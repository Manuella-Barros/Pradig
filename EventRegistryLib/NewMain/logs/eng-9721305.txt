Ratko Mladic, who was later found guilty of war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide, overran the zone.\n\nDutch troops responsible for safeguarding people in the UN zone failed to act when Serb forces occupied it on July 11, killing 2,000 men and boys in a single day.\n\nApproximately 15,000 Bosniaks fled to the surrounding mountains, but Serb troops hunted them down, killing an additional 6,000 people.\n\nSerb forces allowed women and children to reach Bosnian-controlled regions but massacred at least 8,372 Bosnian men in forests, factories, and warehouses. The murdered Bosnians were buried in mass graves, with bodies discovered in 570 different locations across the country, including 77 mass graves.\n\nIn 2007, the International Court of Justice in The Hague ruled that genocide had been committed in Srebrenica.\n\nEfforts to locate the missing victims of the genocide have continued, with identified remains buried at the Potocari Memorial Cemetery.\n\nOn June 8, 2021, UN tribunal judges upheld a life sentence for Mladic for genocide, persecution, crimes against humanity, extermination, and other war crimes committed in Bosnia and

Ratko Mladic - who was later found guilty of war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide - overran the UN zone.\n\nThe fate of approximately 7,000 people who disappeared during the war is still unknown.\n\nRadovan Karadzic, the leader of the Bosnian Serbs during the Bosnian War, was sentenced to 40 years in prison for many crimes, including the Srebrenica Genocide, and then to life imprisonment in an appeal case.\n\nIn the Srebrenica cases heard at the ICTY, former Serbian officials Ljubisa Beara and Vujadin Popovic were also sentenced to life imprisonment.\n\nIn its decision in 2007, the International Court of Justice in The Hague described what happened in Srebrenica and its surroundings as a \"genocide,\" based on evidence from the ICTY.\n\nIn the Srebrenica cases heard at the ICTY, Drago Nikolic was sentenced to 35 years in prison, Radislav Krstic to 35 years, Radivoje Miletic to 19 years, Ljubomir Borovcanin to 17 years, Vidoje Blagojevic to 15 years, Vinko Pandurevic to 13 years and Milan Gvero to five years.\n\nIn a case at the Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Milorad Trbic was found guilty of genocide and was sentenced to 30 years in prison for his part in the killing of nearly 1,000 Bosnian civilians in July 1995.\n\nTo date, 45 Serbs have been sentenced to a total of 699 years in prison in cases heard in different courts.\n\nMost of the Bosnian male civilians who took shelter in a battery factory used as a base by Dutch UN soldiers were killed by Serbs there.\n\nDespite the passing of years, the role of Dutch UN soldiers in the genocide continued to be debated.\n\nIn images taken after the occupation of Srebrenica, Dutch commander Thom Karremans was seen meeting with Mladic on July 11, 1995. It was noted that Mladic bought Karremans a drink at the end of the footage and the two toasted together.\n\nWhile Karremans was never tried for what happened, the Dutch state was found \"partially\" guilty of the genocide in Srebrenica.\n\nFormer Defense Minister Kajsa Ollongren offered the apology at the 27th commemoration of the genocide at the cemetery in the village of Potocari in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\n''Despite everything, Srebrenica was crushed...The Netherlands is also a part of this failure. For this reason, we offer you our deepest apologies,'' said Ollongren.\n\nShe said international institutions had promised to protect innocent people.\n\nIn a lawsuit filed in 2007 by relatives of the victims against the Dutch government, The Hague District Court found The Netherlands guilty of handing over 300 Bosniak civilians to the Serbs who had taken refuge with Dutch soldiers and the United Nations during the occupation of Srebrenica.\n\n- UN resolution commemorating genocide\n\nThe UN in late May this year passed a resolution to designate July 11 as the \"International Day of Reflection and Commemoration of the 1995 Genocide in Srebrenica\" with overwhelming support from the General Assembly.\n\nIt passed with 84 nations voting in favor and 19 against. A total of 68 countries abstained.\n\nCondemning the denial of the Srebrenica genocide, the resolution denounced the glorification of crimes against humanity, genocide and war criminals.\n\nHighlighting the importance of ongoing efforts for the identification of victims and the retrieval of bodies, the resolution emphasizes the need for all perpetrators to be brought to justice.\n\nSerbian President Aleksandar Vucic argued before the vote that the resolution was \"highly politicized.\"\n\nAccusing Germany of threatening countries that did not support the resolution, Vucic said: \"Is that European values, democratic values?\"\n\nWhile not legally binding, General Assembly resolutions carry political weight and send a strong message to the international community.\n\nT\u00fcrkiye has officially declared July 11 as the \"International Day of Reflection and Remembrance of the Srebrenica Genocide,\" according to a presidential decree published in the Official Gazette on Wednesday.\n\n\"July 11, accepted as the 'International Day of Reflection and Remembrance of the Srebrenica Genocide,' will be commemorated in our country to share the pain, condemn genocide and crimes against humanity, and raise global awareness through special remembrance events, educational activities and public awareness initiatives in honor of the victims of the Srebrenica genocide,\" it added.\n\nKosovo is another country that decided Wednesday to declare July 11 Srebrenica genocide remembrance day to honor the memory of the victims.\n\n- Serbia apologizes\n\nIn 2017, then-Serbian President Tomislav Nikolic apologized for all \"crimes\" committed by Serbs during the break-up of Yugoslavia, including Srebrenica.\n\nBut he refused to call the killing of thousands of Bosnian Muslims an act of genocide.\n\nSerbia has never accepted the killings as genocide.\n\nNikolic said he was kneeling and seeking forgiveness for Srebrenica.\n\nIn 2015, then-Prime Minister Aleksandar Vucic attended the commemoration ceremony on July 11 and paid respect to the victims. However, he quickly left the ceremony after being attacked by a stone-throwing mob.\n\nHe was forced to flee with his bodyguards on July 11, 2015 under a hail of stones thrown by mourners at a funeral prayer and burial service for 136 Srebrenica victims whose remains were recently discovered.\n\nPeople from the Bosnian village of Potocari - the scene of the genocide of Bosnian Muslim men and boys in 1995 - shouted \"Justice!\" and \"Vucic leave!\" as the Serbian premier was immediately forced to leave the cemetery.\n\nHe said he was given a warm welcome by the victims' families and the Bosniak mayor of Srebrenica, Camil Durakovic, upon his arrival at the memorial and cemetery complex, adding he refused to hide, despite hearing slogans demanding that he be \"shot.\"\n\n\"I was physically attacked as I was proceeding to the designated seating area, and my glasses fell off my face and broke,\" Vucic said. \"I am sorry that such an incident occurred and some people did not respond to our intention of building a friendship between Bosnians and Serbs.\"\n\n\"I am the one who extends his hand to you and wants to have peace with you. This is our policy,\" he said.\n\nVucic also urged the Serbian people \"to not raise their hands to anyone, thinking they can do anything they want,\" as \"we have to live together with the Bosniaks in the future too.\"\n\n- Council of Europe: Serbia must recognize 1995 genocide\n\nA Council of Europe body in 2017 called on Serbia to officially recognize the 1995 Srebrenica massacre as a genocide and to punish those responsible.\n\nIt said Belgrade should \"actively implement\" a strategy to punish those guilty of war crimes.\n\n- Srebrenica genocide denier awarded Nobel medal\n\nIn 2019, the Swedish Academy picked a 77-year-old Austrian author, Peter Handke, for the Nobel Prize in literature, despite his denial of the Srebrenica genocide.\n\nThe academy's choice was met with backlash worldwide.\n\nHandke claimed that Muslim Bosniaks in Sarajevo had killed themselves.\n\nHe also openly supported Serbian leader Milosevic.\n\nAfter the ceremony, Bosnian Croat President Zeljko Komsic said the Srebrenica genocide was awarded on the occasion.\n\nVucic, however, congratulated Handke and also invited him to visit Serbia.\n\n- 29th anniversary\n\nEuropean Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said Wednesday that they must honor the memory of the over 8,300 boys and men who were systematically murdered in the hills around Srebrenica in Bosnia and Herzegovina, stressing the need to bring all perpetrators of the 1995 genocide to justice.\n\n\"Healing the wounds of the past requires acknowledging and teaching the historical facts, honoring and remembering the victims, identifying those still missing, and bringing all perpetrators to justice. This is key to confronting the roots of hatred that led to the genocide.\"\n\nThere is no place for those who deny genocide, try to rewrite history, and glorify war criminals, Borrell warned, stressing that they need to build together bridges to reconciliation.\n\nThe International Srebrenica Motorcycle Marathon is being held for the 13th time this year under the theme \"Not to be Forgotten, Not to Be Repeated.\"\n\nMotorcyclists passed through Sarajevo's main streets on Wednesday, as they have done in the past, and residents expressed their enthusiasm for their participation in honoring those massacred in 1995.\n\nThe motorcyclists paid their respects and left flowers in front of the Monument to the Murdered Children before continuing to the Potocari Memorial Cemetery.\n\nEvery year on July 11, newly identified victims of the genocide are buried in the memorial cemetery in Potocari.\n\nThe youngest victim to be buried this year is Beriz Mujic, 17, born in 1978 in Zvornik.\n\nIn May 2023, his remains were found 28 years after his killing and exhumed.\n\nHe was killed in July 1995 in the Suceska area near Bratunac.\n\nMujic will be buried next to his brother Hazim, whose remains were laid to rest in 2013.\n\nThe body of their father, Omer Mujic, has yet to be found.\n\nThe oldest victim who will be buried on Thursday is Hamed Salic, born in 1927. He was 68 years old when he went missing in the summer of 1995 in the town of Zepa. His remains were exhumed in May 2014 and recently identified.\n\nThousands of people from various countries will attend the funerals and burials. Following this year's funeral, the cemetery's total number of burials will reach 6,765.", "source": {"uri": "yenisafak.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yeni \u015eafak"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Thousands gather in the eastern Bosnian town of Srebrenica to commemorate the 29th anniversary on Monday of Europe's only acknowledged genocide since World War II. (AP [...]\n\nSREBRENICA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) -- Thousands of people from Bosnia and abroad gathered in Srebrenica on Thursday for the annual ritual of commemorating the 1995 genocide which Serb officials continue to deny, fueling ethnic tensions and deep divisions within the war-ravaged state.\n\nTwenty-nine years after they were murdered in Europe's only acknowledged genocide since the Holocaust, the bodies of 13 men and one teenage boy were laid to rest Thursday at a vast and ever-expanding memorial cemetery just outside Srebrenica, in eastern Bosnia. They join more than 6,600 massacre victims already reburied there.\n\nMore than 8,000 Bosniak Muslims were estimated to have been killed in the shooting spree by the Bosnian Serb army and police over several days in July 1995.\n\nRelatives of the victims can bury only partial remains of their loved ones as they are typically found scattered over several different mass graves, sometimes miles (kilometers) apart.\n\nThe Srebrenica killings were the bloody crescendo of Bosnia's 1992-95 war, which came after the breakup of Yugoslavia unleashed nationalist passions and territorial ambitions that set Bosnian Serbs against the country's two other main ethnic populations -- Croats and Bosniaks, who are mostly Muslim.\n\nThe commemoration Thursday came only weeks after the United Nations General Assembly voted to designate July 11 annually as an international day of reflection and commemoration of the 1995 Srebrenica genocide. Serbia and Bosnian Serbs strongly opposed its adoption, wrongly claiming it portrays all Serbs as \"genocidal people.\"\n\nSerb leaders insist the massacre is not genocide, but a \"terrible crime.\" They have also downplayed the number of those killed.\n\n\"The genocide in Srebrenica did not happen, and if it did, there would be no need to constantly impose this topic,\" Bosnian Serb separatist President Milorad Dodik has repeatedly said.\n\nPresident of the Board of Directors of the Srebrenica Memorial Center, Hamdija Fejzic, said that the genocide denial must stop.\n\n\"For a full 29 years, the policy of covering up and denying the genocide was carried out by those forces who designed and planned the genocide, and who for years provided shelter to those suspected and accused of the most serious war crimes,\" he told the gathering on Thursday.\n\nIn an op-ed piece in Bosnian media, European Union High Representative Josep Borrell said \"Srebrenica remains a deep scar in the history of Europe.\"\n\n\"The failure to prevent this genocide is a burden we continue to bear,\" he wrote. \"Both the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia and the International Court of Justice have indisputably determined that this crime is genocide.\"\n\n\"We promised that we would never forget -- neither the victims, nor the lasting pain of their families and loved ones,\" he added. \"Their memory drives us to work every day to ensure that history does not repeat itself, in a world where peace seems increasingly fragile.\"\n\nOn July 11, 1995, Bosnian Serbs overran a U.N.-protected safe area in Srebrenica. They separated more than 8,000 Bosniak men and boys from their wives, mothers and sisters and slaughtered them. Those who tried to escape were chased through the woods and over the mountains around the ill-fated town.\n\nThe perpetrators then dumped their victims' bodies into hastily made mass graves, which they later dug up with bulldozers, scattering the remains among other burial sites to hide the evidence of their war crimes.\n\nThe Bosnian Serb wartime political leader Radovan Karadzic and his military commander Ratko Mladic were both convicted of genocide in Srebrenica by a special U.N. war crimes tribunal in The Hague. In all, the tribunal and courts in the Balkans have sentenced close to 50 Bosnian Serb wartime officials to more than 700 years in prison for the Srebrenica killings.\n\nHowever, most Serbian and Bosnian Serb officials still celebrate Karadzic and Mladic as national heroes. They continue to downplay or even deny the Srebrenica killings and offend the massacre victims and survivors.\n\n-- --\n\nAssociated Press Writer Dusan Stojanovic contributed to this story from

The remainder of the Bosnian Muslim population present in Srebrenica - approximately 25,000 women, children and elderly - were forcibly transferred out of the enclave.\n\nThis was the largest massacre in Europe since the Holocaust.\n\nTo date, only a few events have been determined by competent judicial bodies to constitute genocide. The International Court of Justice (ICJ) and the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) recognized the massacre of Bosnian Muslims in Srebrenica by the army of Republika Srpska as an act of genocide.\n\nRemembering the victims\n\nThe genocide left deep emotional scars on the survivors, families of victims, and the Bosnian and Herzegovinian society in general, creating enduring obstacles to reconciliation among the country's different ethnic groups.\n\n2025 will mark the thirtieth anniversary of the genocide in Srebrenica, in which at least 8,372 lives were lost, thousands were displaced and families and communities were devastated.\n\nUnited Nations Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide, Alice Wairimu Nderitu has expressed her concern over continuous incidents of revisionism concerning atrocity crimes perpetrated during the 1992-1995 conflict, including unabated denial of the Srebrenica genocide and glorification of convicted war criminals.\n\nA day of reflection and commemoration\n\nIn May 2024, The UN General Assembly, in a resolution sponsored by Germany and Rwanda, designated 11 July as the International Day of Reflection and Commemoration of the 1995 Genocide in Srebrenica.\n\nThe Assembly also asked the Secretary-General to establish an outreach programme on the Srebrenica genocide in preparation for the 30th anniversary.\n\nIt further condemned any denial of the Srebrenica genocide as a historical event and called on Member States to preserve the established facts, including through their educational systems, towards preventing denial and distortion, and any occurrence of genocide in the future.\n\nThe inaugural observance is being marked with a high-level commemorative event, organized by the Permanent Mission of Bosnia and Herzegovina, in the UN General Assembly hall at 11 am EDT on 11 July 2024.", "source": {"uri": "un.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "United Nations"}, "authors": [],

They ended up like this only because they had a (Muslim) name,\" said Mevlida Hasanovic as she prayed at the tomb of her cousin, who was 18 when he was killed.\n\nMs Hasanovic lost a dozen male relatives in the massacre including her father and husband, whose grave is next to her cousin's.\n\nHis remains were buried twice as they were found in two different mass graves.\n\nThe 54-year-old woman is still waiting for \"at least one bone\" of a brother to be found so she can bury him.\n\n\"Their souls know that we are here next to them. When I get here, I feel as if we just parted ways in Srebrenica,\" she said.\n\nThe adoption of the UN General Assembly resolution to declare an International Day of Reflection and Commemoration of the genocide was fiercely opposed by Serbia and Bosnian Serbs, who continue to play down the crime.\n\nBosnian Serb leader Milorad Dodik has repeatedly denied a genocide occurred and says his administration will not recognise the resolution.\n\nBut Mr Dodik expressed sympathy to the families of the victims today.\n\n\"Regardless of our differences, we must show respect for the pain and suffering that has befallen many people of all nations and religions in Bosnia and Herzegovina,\" Mr Dodik said on X.\n\nA UN court sentenced Bosnian Serb wartime political leader Radovan Karadzic and his army chief Mladic to life in prison for war crimes including the Srebrenica genocide.\n\nBosnia's 1992-1995 war between its Croats, Muslims and Serbs claimed approximately 100,000 lives.\n\nNearly three decades after the war ended, the Balkan nation remains deeply divided along ethnic lines.\n\nVictims of the genocide continue to be laid to rest\n\nThe remains of 14 more victims of the bloodshed, including a 17-year-old boy, will be buried at a memorial cemetery in Potocari, just outside Srebrenica.\n\nBeriz Mujic, whose remains were found in the Srebrenica region last year, will be laid to rest next to his brother Hazim.\n\nThe remains of 6,988 Srebrenica victims have been buried, most of them under white tombstones in Potocari.\n\nThe remains were found in 87 mass graves, and a spokeswoman for Bosnia's institute for missing persons said that they are still looking for around 1,000 people.\n\nTo cover up the crime, Bosnian Serb forces moved the bodies of the victims to so-called secondary mass graves.\n\nKada Sikovic, accompanied by her two daughters and son, stood by the coffin of her husband, Musan, with tears rolling down her face.\n\nParts of his chin bone were recovered in 2010 but she had resisted holding a burial ceremony until more remains were found last year.\n\n\"Thank God we found some of his bones,\" she said.\n\nShe remembered the painful moment when the family split in Srebrenica in 1995.\n\n\"He cried, kissed the girl (daughter), took the little one (five-year-old) son in his arms and said: 'See you'.\"\n\nYesterday, the European Union, which Bosnia aspires to join, called the atrocity \"one of the darkest moments in modern European history\".\n\n\"There is no place amongst us for those who deny genocide, attempt to rewrite history, and glorify war criminals,\" EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell and the bloc's enlargement commissioner Oliver Varhelyi said in a joint statement.\n\nAdditional reporting AFP", "source": {"uri":

They join more than 6,600 massacre victims already reburied there.\n\nMore than 8,000 Bosniak Muslims were estimated to have been killed in the shooting spree by the Bosnian Serb army and police over several days in July 1995.\n\nRelatives of the victims can bury only partial remains of their loved ones as they are typically found scattered over several different mass graves, sometimes miles (kilometers) apart.\n\nThe Srebrenica killings were the bloody crescendo of Bosnia's 1992-95 war, which came after the breakup of Yugoslavia unleashed nationalist passions and territorial ambitions that set Bosnian Serbs against the country's two other main ethnic populations -- Croats and Bosniaks, who are mostly Muslim.\n\nThe commemoration Thursday came only weeks after the United Nations General Assembly voted to designate July 11 annually as an international day of reflection and commemoration of the 1995 Srebrenica genocide. Serbia and Bosnian Serbs strongly opposed its adoption, wrongly claiming it portrays all Serbs as \"genocidal people.\"\n\nSerb leaders insist the massacre is not genocide, but a \"terrible crime.\" They have also downplayed the number of those killed.\n\n\"The genocide in Srebrenica did not happen, and if it did, there would be no need to constantly impose this topic,\" Bosnian Serb separatist President Milorad Dodik has repeatedly said.\n\nPresident of the Board of Directors of the Srebrenica Memorial Center, Hamdija Fejzic, said that the genocide denial must stop.\n\n\"For a full 29 years, the policy of covering up and denying the genocide was carried out by those forces who designed and planned the genocide, and who for years provided shelter to those suspected and accused of the most serious war crimes,\" he told the gathering on Thursday.\n\nIn an op-ed piece in Bosnian media, European Union High Representative Josep Borrell said \"Srebrenica remains a deep scar in the history of Europe.\"\n\n\"The failure to prevent this genocide is a burden we continue to bear,\" he wrote. \"Both the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia and the International Court of Justice have indisputably determined that this crime is genocide.\"\n\n\"We promised that we would never forget -- neither the victims, nor the lasting pain of their families and loved ones,\" he added. \"Their memory drives us to work every day to ensure that history does not repeat itself, in a world where peace seems increasingly fragile.\"\n\nOn July 11, 1995, Bosnian Serbs overran a U.N.-protected safe area in Srebrenica. They separated more than 8,000 Bosniak men and boys from their wives, mothers and sisters and slaughtered them. Those who tried to escape were chased through the woods and over the mountains around the ill-fated town.\n\nThe perpetrators then dumped their victims' bodies into hastily made mass graves, which they later dug up with bulldozers, scattering the remains among other burial sites to hide the evidence of their war crimes.\n\nThe Bosnian Serb wartime political leader Radovan Karadzic and his military commander Ratko Mladic were both convicted of genocide in Srebrenica by a special U.N. war crimes tribunal in The Hague. In all, the tribunal and courts in the Balkans have sentenced close to 50 Bosnian Serb wartime officials to more than 700 years in prison for the Srebrenica killings.\n\nHowever, most Serbian and Bosnian Serb officials still celebrate Karadzic and Mladic as national heroes. They continue to downplay or even deny the Srebrenica killings and offend the massacre victims and survivors.\n\n-- --\n\nAssociated Press Writer Dusan Stojanovic contributed to this story from

Ratko Mladic - who was later found guilty of war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide - overran the UN zone.\n\nThe fate of approximately 7,000 people who disappeared during the war is still unknown.\n\nIn a case heard at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in The Hague, the Netherlands, Serbian commander Mladic was sentenced to life imprisonment for many crimes, including genocide. The sentence was approved at an appeal hearing on June 8, 2021.\n\nRadovan Karadzic, the leader of the Bosnian Serbs during the Bosnian War, was sentenced to 40 years in prison for many crimes, including the Srebrenica Genocide, and then to life imprisonment in an appeal case.\n\nIn the Srebrenica cases heard at the ICTY, former Serbian officials Ljubisa Beara and Vujadin Popovic were also sentenced to life imprisonment.\n\nIn its decision in 2007, the International Court of Justice in The Hague described what happened in Srebrenica and its surroundings as a \"genocide,\" based on evidence from the ICTY.\n\nFormer Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic died in prison while his trial was ongoing.\n\nIn the Srebrenica cases heard at the ICTY, Drago Nikolic was sentenced to 35 years in prison, Radislav Krstic to 35 years, Radivoje Miletic to 19 years, Ljubomir Borovcanin to 17 years, Vidoje Blagojevic to 15 years, Vinko Pandurevic to 13 years and Milan Gvero to five years.\n\nIn a case at the Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Milorad Trbic was found guilty of genocide and was sentenced to 30 years in prison for his part in the killing of nearly 1,000 Bosnian civilians in July 1995.\n\nTo date, 45 Serbs have been sentenced to a total of 699 years in prison in cases heard in different courts.\n\nMost of the Bosnian male civilians who took shelter in a battery factory used as a base by Dutch UN soldiers were killed by Serbs there.\n\nDespite the passing of years, the role of Dutch UN soldiers in the genocide continued to be debated.\n\nIn images taken after the occupation of Srebrenica, Dutch commander Thom Karremans was seen meeting with Mladic on July 11, 1995. It was noted that Mladic bought Karremans a drink at the end of the footage and the two toasted together.\n\nWhile Karremans was never tried for what happened, the Dutch state was found \"partially\" guilty of the genocide in Srebrenica.\n\nThe Dutch government in 2022 apologized to Bosniak families who lost their relatives in the genocide.\n\nFormer Defense Minister Kajsa Ollongren offered the apology at the 27th commemoration of the genocide at the cemetery in the village of Potocari in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\n''Despite everything, Srebrenica was crushed...The Netherlands is also a part of this failure. For this reason, we offer you our deepest apologies,'' said Ollongren.\n\nShe said international institutions had promised to protect innocent people.\n\n\"The international community failed to protect the people of Srebrenica. As part of this community, the Dutch government shares political responsibility for the situation in which this failure could happen...We cannot take away the suffering. But what we can do is look history straight in the eye,\" she added.\n\nIn a lawsuit filed in 2007 by relatives of the victims against the Dutch government, The Hague District Court found The Netherlands guilty of handing over 300 Bosniak civilians to the Serbs who had taken refuge with Dutch soldiers and the United Nations during the occupation of Srebrenica.\n\nThe UN in late May this year passed a resolution to designate July 11 as the \"International Day of Reflection and Commemoration of the 1995 Genocide in Srebrenica\" with overwhelming support from the General Assembly.\n\nThe resolution was spearheaded by Germany, with co-sponsorship from more than 40 countries.\n\nIt passed with 84 nations voting in favor and 19 against. A total of 68 countries abstained.\n\nCondemning the denial of the Srebrenica genocide, the resolution denounced the glorification of crimes against humanity, genocide and war criminals.\n\nHighlighting the importance of ongoing efforts for the identification of victims and the retrieval of bodies, the resolution emphasizes the need for all perpetrators to be brought to justice.\n\nSerbian President Aleksandar Vucic argued before the vote that the resolution was \"highly politicized.\"\n\nHe said individuals responsible for the genocide had been punished and that the resolution would neither contribute to the stability and unity of Bosnia and Herzegovina nor the region, but would increase divisions.\n\nAccusing Germany of threatening countries that did not support the resolution, Vucic said: \"Is that European values, democratic values?\"\n\nWhile not legally binding, General Assembly resolutions carry political weight and send a strong message to the international community.\n\nT\u00fcrkiye has officially declared July 11 as the \"International Day of Reflection and Remembrance of the Srebrenica Genocide,\" according to a presidential decree published in the Official Gazette on Wednesday.\n\nMentioning the UN's adoption of the resolution, the decree noted that the resolution unequivocally condemns actions that glorify those convicted by international courts of war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide, including those responsible for the Srebrenica genocide in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\n\"July 11, accepted as the 'International Day of Reflection and Remembrance of the Srebrenica Genocide,' will be commemorated in our country to share the pain, condemn genocide and crimes against humanity, and raise global awareness through special remembrance events, educational activities and public awareness initiatives in honor of the victims of the Srebrenica genocide,\" it added.\n\nKosovo is another country that decided Wednesday to declare July 11 Srebrenica genocide remembrance day to honor the memory of the victims.\n\n''As one of the first countries to implement the UN resolution on the Srebrenica genocide, the Republic of Kosovo has just decided, as the first topic of our government meeting today, that July 11 will be designated as the official Commemoration Day for Srebrenica,'' said Foreign Minister Donika Gervalla-Schwarz.\n\nIn 2017, then-Serbian President Tomislav Nikolic apologized for all \"crimes\" committed by Serbs during the break-up of Yugoslavia, including Srebrenica.\n\nBut he refused to call the killing of thousands of Bosnian Muslims an act of genocide.\n\nSerbia has never accepted the killings as genocide.\n\nNikolic said he was kneeling and seeking forgiveness for Srebrenica.\n\nIn 2015, then-Prime Minister Aleksandar Vucic attended the commemoration ceremony on July 11 and paid respect to the victims. However, he quickly left the ceremony after being attacked by a stone-throwing mob.\n\nVucic has termed the incident involving him getting chased out from the mass burial ceremony during the 20th anniversary of the Srebrenica genocide in Bosnia-Herzegovina as politically motivated.\n\nHe was forced to flee with his bodyguards on July 11, 2015 under a hail of stones thrown by mourners at a funeral prayer and burial service for 136 Srebrenica victims whose remains were recently discovered.\n\nPeople from the Bosnian village of Potocari - the scene of the genocide of Bosnian Muslim men and boys in 1995 - shouted \"Justice!\" and \"Vucic leave!\" as the Serbian premier was immediately forced to leave the cemetery.\n\n\"This was an organized attack laced with political messages. I am happy (to know) that it was not organized by the victims' families. I heard some Muslims from among the crowd say 'he is not guilty,'\" Vucic said after an emergency government meeting upon his return to the Serbian capital Belgrade.\n\nHe said he was given a warm welcome by the victims' families and the Bosniak mayor of Srebrenica, Camil Durakovic, upon his arrival at the memorial and cemetery complex, adding he refused to hide, despite hearing slogans demanding that he be \"shot.\"\n\n\"I was physically attacked as I was proceeding to the designated seating area, and my glasses fell off my face and broke,\" Vucic said. \"I am sorry that such an incident occurred and some people did not respond to our intention of building a friendship between Bosnians and Serbs.\"\n\nHe added that he would continue to extend his hand to the Bosnian people, the majority of whom, he said, condemned the attack on him.\n\n\"I am the one who extends his hand to you and wants to have peace with you. This is our policy,\" he said.\n\nVucic also urged the Serbian people \"to not raise their hands to anyone, thinking they can do anything they want,\" as \"we have to live together with the Bosniaks in the future too.\"\n\nCouncil of Europe: Serbia must recognize 1995 genocide\n\nA Council of Europe body in 2017 called on Serbia to officially recognize the 1995 Srebrenica massacre as a genocide and to punish those responsible.\n\nThe European Commission Against Racism and Intolerance (ECRI) published its annual report on Serbia and also said that hate speech and hate crimes were on the increase in the Balkan state.\n\nIt said Belgrade should \"actively implement\" a strategy to punish those guilty of war crimes.\n\nSrebrenica genocide denier awarded Nobel medal\n\nIn 2019, the Swedish Academy picked a 77-year-old Austrian author, Peter Handke, for the Nobel Prize in literature, despite his denial of the Srebrenica genocide.\n\nThe academy's choice was met with backlash worldwide.\n\nHandke claimed that Muslim Bosniaks in Sarajevo had killed themselves.\n\nHe also openly supported Serbian leader Milosevic.\n\nSeveral countries, including T\u00fcrkiye, boycotted the award ceremony and the Turkish, Albanian, Kosovar and Croatian envoys to Sweden also did not attend.\n\nAfter the ceremony, Bosnian Croat President Zeljko Komsic said the Srebrenica genocide was awarded on the occasion.\n\nVucic, however, congratulated Handke and also invited him to visit Serbia.\n\n29th anniversary\n\nEuropean Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said Wednesday that they must honor the memory of the over 8,300 boys and men who were systematically murdered in the hills around Srebrenica in Bosnia and Herzegovina, stressing the need to bring all perpetrators of the 1995 genocide to justice.\n\nBorrell issued a statement the day before the 29th anniversary of the Srebrenica genocide, urging leaders to reject divisive rhetoric and act with truth, justice and dialogue.\n\n\"Healing the wounds of the past requires acknowledging and teaching the historical facts, honoring and remembering the victims, identifying those still missing, and bringing all perpetrators to justice. This is key to confronting the roots of hatred that led to the genocide.\"\n\nThere is no place for those who deny genocide, try to rewrite history, and glorify war criminals, Borrell warned, stressing that they need to build together bridges to reconciliation.\n\nMeanwhile, hundreds of motorcyclists from various countries gathered in the Bosnian capital Sarajevo to ride in a convoy to the Potocari Memorial Cemetery in Srebrenica in memory of the genocide victims.\n\nThe International Srebrenica Motorcycle Marathon is being held for the 13th time this year under the theme \"Not to be Forgotten, Not to Be Repeated.\"\n\nMotorcyclists passed through Sarajevo's main streets on Wednesday, as they have done in the past, and residents expressed their enthusiasm for their participation in honoring those massacred in 1995.\n\nThe motorcyclists paid their respects and left flowers in front of the Monument to the Murdered Children before continuing to the Potocari Memorial Cemetery.\n\nOn Tuesday, Bosnia and Herzegovina sent the remains of 14 more Srebrenica genocide victims to Potocari village, three days before their burial on the 29th anniversary of the 1995 genocide.\n\nEvery year on July 11, newly identified victims of the genocide are buried in the memorial cemetery in Potocari.\n\nThe youngest victim to be buried this year is Beriz Mujic, 17, born in 1978 in Zvornik.\n\nIn May 2023, his remains were found 28 years after his killing and exhumed.\n\nHe was killed in July 1995 in the Suceska area near Bratunac.\n\nMujic will be buried next to his brother Hazim, whose remains were laid to rest in 2013.\n\nThe body of their father, Omer Mujic, has yet to be found.\n\nThe oldest victim who will be buried on Thursday is Hamed Salic, born in 1927. He was 68 years old when he went missing in the summer of 1995 in the town of Zepa. His remains were exhumed in May 2014 and recently identified.\n\nThousands of people from various countries will attend the funerals and burials. Following this year's funeral, the cemetery's total number of burials will reach 6,765.", "source": {"uri": "aa.com.tr", "dataType": "news", "title": "Anadolu Ajans\u0131"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

They join more than 6,600 massacre victims already reburied there.\n\nMore than 8,000 Bosniak Muslims were estimated to have been killed in the shooting spree by the Bosnian Serb army and police over several days in July 1995.\n\nRelatives of the victims can bury only partial remains of their loved ones as they are typically found scattered over several different mass graves, sometimes miles (kilometers) apart.\n\nThe Srebrenica killings were the bloody crescendo of Bosnia's 1992-95 war, which came after the breakup of Yugoslavia unleashed nationalist passions and territorial ambitions that set Bosnian Serbs against the country's two other main ethnic populations -- Croats and Bosniaks, who are mostly Muslim.\n\nThe commemoration Thursday came only weeks after the United Nations General Assembly voted to designate July 11 annually as an international day of reflection and commemoration of the 1995 Srebrenica genocide. Serbia and Bosnian Serbs strongly opposed its adoption, wrongly claiming it portrays all Serbs as \"genocidal people.\"\n\nSerb leaders insist the massacre is not genocide, but a \"terrible crime.\" They have also downplayed the number of those killed.\n\n\"The genocide in Srebrenica did not happen, and if it did, there would be no need to constantly impose this topic,\" Bosnian Serb separatist President Milorad Dodik has repeatedly said.\n\nPresident of the Board of Directors of the Srebrenica Memorial Center, Hamdija Fejzic, said that the genocide denial must stop.\n\n\"For a full 29 years, the policy of covering up and denying the genocide was carried out by those forces who designed and planned the genocide, and who for years provided shelter to those suspected and accused of the most serious war crimes,\" he told the gathering on Thursday.\n\nIn an op-ed piece in Bosnian media, European Union High Representative Josep Borrell said \"Srebrenica remains a deep scar in the history of Europe.\"\n\n\"The failure to prevent this genocide is a burden we continue to bear,\" he wrote. \"Both the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia and the International Court of Justice have indisputably determined that this crime is genocide.\"\n\n\"We promised that we would never forget -- neither the victims, nor the lasting pain of their families and loved ones,\" he added. \"Their memory drives us to work every day to ensure that history does not repeat itself, in a world where peace seems increasingly fragile.\"\n\nOn July 11, 1995, Bosnian Serbs overran a U.N.-protected safe area in Srebrenica. They separated more than 8,000 Bosniak men and boys from their wives, mothers and sisters and slaughtered them. Those who tried to escape were chased through the woods and over the mountains around the ill-fated town.\n\nThe perpetrators then dumped their victims' bodies into hastily made mass graves, which they later dug up with bulldozers, scattering the remains among other burial sites to hide the evidence of their war crimes.\n\nThe Bosnian Serb wartime political leader Radovan Karadzic and his military commander Ratko Mladic were both convicted of genocide in Srebrenica by a special U.N. war crimes tribunal in The Hague. In all, the tribunal and courts in the Balkans have sentenced close to 50 Bosnian Serb wartime officials to more than 700 years in prison for the Srebrenica killings.\n\nHowever, most Serbian and Bosnian Serb officials still celebrate Karadzic and Mladic as national heroes. They continue to downplay or even deny the Srebrenica killings and offend the massacre victims and survivors.\n\n-- --\n\nAssociated Press Writer Dusan Stojanovic contributed to this story from Belgrade, Serbia.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

They ended up like this only because they had a different (Muslim) name,\" said Mevlida Hasanovic as she prayed at the tomb of her cousin, who was 18 when he was killed.\n\nHasanovic lost a dozen male relatives in the massacre including her father and husband, whose grave is next to her cousin's.\n\nHis remains were buried on two occasions since they were found in two different mass graves.\n\nThe 54-year-old woman is still looking for the remains of a brother to be found, \"at least one bone\", to bury him, she told AFP.\n\n\"Their souls know that we are here next to them. When I get here, I feel as if we just parted ways in Srebrenica.\"\n\nIn May, the United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution declaring July 11 the \"International Day of Reflection and Commemoration of the 1995 Genocide in Srebrenica\".\n\nThe resolution was fiercly opposed by Serbia and Bosnian Serbs, who continue to play down the crime.\n\nBosnian Serb leader Milorad Dodik has repeatedly denied a genocide occurred, and says his administration would not recognise the resolution.\n\nA UN court sentenced Bosnian Serb wartime political leader Radovan Karadzic and his army chief Ratko Mladic to life in prison for war crimes including the Srebrenica genocide.\n\nBosnia's 1992-1995 war between its Croats, Muslims and Serbs claimed approximately 100,000 lives.\n\nNearly three decades after the war ended, the Balkan nation remains deeply divided along ethnic lines.\n\nNew burial\n\nOn Thursday, the remains of 14 more victims of the bloodshed, including a 17-year-old boy, will be buried at a memorial cemetery in Potocari, just outside Srebrenica.\n\nBeriz Mujic, whose remains were found in the Srebrenica region last year, will be laid to rest next to his brother Hazim.\n\nSo far, the remains, often incomplete, of 6,988 Srebrenica victims have been buried, the overwhelming majority of them under white tombstones in Potocari.\n\nThe remains were found in 87 mass graves, and a spokeswoman for Bosnia's institute for missing persons told AFP that they are still looking for around 1,000 people.\n\nTo cover up the crime, Bosnian Serb forces moved the bodies of the victims to so-called secondary mass graves.\n\nOn Wednesday, the European Union, which Bosnia aspires to join, called the atrocity \"one of the darkest moments in modern European

They join more than 6,600 massacre victims already reburied there.\n\nMore than 8,000 Bosniak Muslims were estimated to have been killed in the shooting spree by the Bosnian Serb army and police over several days in July 1995.\n\nRelatives of the victims can bury only partial remains of their loved ones as they are typically found scattered over several different mass graves, sometimes miles (kilometres) apart.\n\nThe Srebrenica killings were the bloody crescendo of Bosnia's 1992-95 war, which came after the breakup of Yugoslavia unleashed nationalist passions and territorial ambitions that set Bosnian Serbs against the country's two other main ethnic populations -- Croats and Bosniaks, who are mostly Muslim.\n\nThe commemoration Thursday came only weeks after the United Nations General Assembly voted to designate July 11 annually as an international day of reflection and commemoration of the 1995 Srebrenica genocide. Serbia and Bosnian Serbs strongly opposed its adoption, wrongly claiming it portrays all Serbs as \"genocidal people.\"\n\nSerb leaders insist the massacre is not genocide, but a \"terrible crime.\" They have also downplayed the number of those killed.\n\n\"The genocide in Srebrenica did not happen, and if it did, there would be no need to constantly impose this topic,\" Bosnian Serb separatist President Milorad Dodik has repeatedly said.\n\nPresident of the Board of Directors of the Srebrenica Memorial Center, Hamdija Fejzic, said that the genocide denial must stop.\n\n\"For a full 29 years, the policy of covering up and denying the genocide was carried out by those forces who designed and planned the genocide, and who for years provided shelter to those suspected and accused of the most serious war crimes,\" he told the gathering on Thursday.\n\nIn an op-ed piece in Bosnian media, European Union High Representative Josep Borrell said \"Srebrenica remains a deep scar in the history of Europe.\"\n\n\"The failure to prevent this genocide is a burden we continue to bear,\" he wrote. \"Both the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia and the International Court of Justice have indisputably determined that this crime is genocide.\"\n\n\"We promised that we would never forget -- neither the victims nor the lasting pain of their families and loved ones,\" he added. \"Their memory drives us to work every day to ensure that history does not repeat itself, in a world where peace seems increasingly fragile.\"\n\nOn July 11, 1995, Bosnian Serbs overran a U.N.-protected safe area in Srebrenica. They separated more than 8,000 Bosniak men and boys from their wives, mothers and sisters and slaughtered them. Those who tried to escape were chased through the woods and over the mountains around the ill-fated town.\n\nThe perpetrators then dumped their victims' bodies into hastily made mass graves, which they later dug up with bulldozers, scattering the remains among other burial sites to hide the evidence of their war crimes.\n\nThe Bosnian Serb wartime political leader Radovan Karadzic and his military commander Ratko Mladic were both convicted of genocide in Srebrenica by a special U.N. war crimes tribunal in The Hague. In all, the tribunal and courts in the Balkans have sentenced close to 50 Bosnian Serb wartime officials to more than 700 years in prison for the Srebrenica killings.\n\nHowever, most Serbian and Bosnian Serb officials still celebrate Karadzic and Mladic as national heroes. They continue to downplay or even deny the Srebrenica killings and offend the massacre victims and survivors.", "source": {"uri": "english.ahram.org.eg", "dataType": "news", "title":

The murdered Bosnians were buried in mass graves, with bodies discovered in 570 different locations across the country, including 77 mass graves.\n\nIn 2007, the International Court of Justice in The Hague ruled that genocide had been committed in Srebrenica.\n\nEfforts to locate the missing victims of the genocide have continued, with identified remains buried at the Potocari Memorial

One participant passed away during the march, organisers said, adding that they did not want to publicise his identity until after the event.\n\nDozens of human rights activists held banners that said \"We will never forget the genocide in Srebrenica\" and the number \"8372\" referring to the number of victims.\n\nIn May, the United Nations approved a resolution establishing an international day of reflection and commemoration of the Srebrenica genocide, when Bosnian Serb forces killed more than 8,000 Bosniak men and boys over the course of three days in July 1995.\n\nThe vote in the 193-member General Assembly was 84-19, with 68 nations abstaining. Neighbouring Serbia was vehemently against the resolution, claiming the events in Srebrenica were not genocide but a \"terrible crime\".\n\nThe Srebrenica genocide remains among the worst atrocities committed during the Yugoslav dissolution wars of the 1990s.\n\nAfter 45 years of peace under President Josip Broz Tito's rule, Yugoslavia, comprised of six republics at the time, disintegrated in a series of wars that engulfed Slovenia, Croatia and Bosnia.\n\nIn Bosnia, the war saw the three main ethnic groups -- Bosnian Serbs, who are Eastern Orthodox, Catholic Bosnian Croats, and Bosniaks, who are Muslim -- pitted against each other along ethnic lines.\n\nOn July 11, 1995, Bosnian Serbs overran a UN-protected safe area in Srebrenica. They separated more than 8,000 Bosniak men and boys from their wives, mothers and sisters and slaughtered them. Those who tried to escape were chased through the woods and over the mountains around the ill-fated town.\n\nThe perpetrators then dumped their victims' bodies into hastily made mass graves, which they later dug up with bulldozers, scattering the remains among other burial sites to hide the evidence of their war crimes.\n\nThe Bosnian Serb wartime political leader Radovan Karad\u017ei\u0107 and his military commander Ratko Mladi\u0107 were both convicted of genocide in Srebrenica by a special UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague.\n\nIn all, the tribunal and courts in the Balkans have sentenced close to 50 Bosnian Serb wartime officials to more than 700 years in prison for the Srebrenica killings.\n\nHowever, a significant number of Serbian and Bosnian Serb officials still celebrate Karad\u017ei\u0107 and Mladi\u0107 as national heroes, downplaying or even denying the Srebrenica killings.", "source": {"uri": "euronews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Euronews

the war.\n\nIt is a \"sincere wish\" for an internal consensus covering all sectors to prevail in Bosnia-Herzegovina, he said, adding that everyone should keep in mind that no one gains from conflict and tension.\n\nMeanwhile, Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan, stressing that the genocide remains a black stain of human history, said on X: \"We will commemorate July 11th every year in our country as the International Day of Reflection and Commemoration of the Srebrenica Genocide.\"\n\n\"I commemorate our martyred brothers and sisters with mercy and wish their families condolences and patience,\" he added.\n\nIn July 1995, more than 8,000 Bosniak Muslims were killed when Bosnian Serb forces attacked the eastern city of Srebrenica, despite the presence of Dutch peacekeeping troops there.\n\nSerb forces were trying to wrest territory from Bosnian Muslims and Croats to form a state.\n\nIn 2007, the International Court of Justice at The Hague ruled that a genocide had been committed in

Ratko Mladic, who was later found guilty of war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide, overran the zone.\n\nDutch troops responsible for safeguarding people in the UN zone failed to act when Serb forces occupied it on July 11, killing 2,000 men and boys in a single day.\n\nApproximately 15,000 Bosniaks fled to the surrounding mountains, but Serb troops hunted them down, killing an additional 6,000 people.\n\nSerb forces allowed women and children to reach Bosnian-controlled regions but massacred at least 8,372 Bosnian men in forests, factories, and warehouses. The murdered Bosnians were buried in mass graves, with bodies discovered in 570 different locations across the country, including 77 mass graves.\n\nIn 2007, the International Court of Justice in The Hague ruled that genocide had been committed in Srebrenica.\n\nEfforts to locate the missing victims of the genocide have continued, with identified remains buried at the Potocari Memorial

My mother and father's cousins and many of our neighbors lost their lives in the genocide,\" said Hodzic, adding that two of her uncle's six sons managed to pass to the safe zone in Srebrenica.\n\nDutch troops responsible for protecting people in the UN zone failed to act when Serb forces occupied it on July 11, killing 2,000 men and boys in a single day.\n\nAbout 15,000 Bosniaks fled to the surrounding mountains, but Serb troops hunted them down and killed 6,000 more people.\n\nSerbs who allowed women and children to reach the region controlled by Bosnian soldiers massacred at least 8,372 Bosnian men in forest areas, factories, and warehouses. The murdered Bosnians were buried in mass graves.\n\nHodzic then fled to Germany, where she lived as a refugee with her children.\n\n\"When I was in Germany, I watched what happened in Srebrenica on television. It was a very difficult time. I was in contact with my sister, who lived in the city of Tuzla. My sister went to the area where the survivors of Srebrenica were brought and found my mother, sister-in-law, and her children,\" she said.\n\nHowever, Hodzic's father and brother were killed. Their body remains were found in a mass grave in Zvornik in 1996 and they were both buried in the Potocari Memorial Cemetery in Srebrenica.\n\nWhile 6,751 victims have been buried in the Potocari Memorial Cemetery to date, 250 have been buried in local cemeteries at the request of their families. More than 1,000 victims of the Srebrenica genocide have not been found.\n\nIn 2007, the International Court of Justice in The Hague ruled that a genocide was committed in Srebrenica.\n\nAmid efforts to find the missing after the war, victims whose bodies were found in mass graves are buried in a ceremony held at the Potocari Memorial Cemetery every year on July 11 after identification.\n\n\"Before the war, our father was working. There was always a happy atmosphere in our house. I always remember those beautiful moments. I always dream of running away from the Chetniks. Every year, when the funeral prayers are held, I come back to what we experienced that day. It is very difficult,\" she said.\n\nMekanic said she was captured by the Serbs twice during that period and her husband was killed while going to Srebrenica with a military unit to defend the city.\n\nMekanic said that victims' relatives can never forget the pain they felt.\n\n\"I cried a lot when they burned our house. But when I saw people being killed, I saw that the house had no meaning,\" she said.\n\nShe added that she remembers her father when she sees elderly people walking on the street.\n\n\"My father could have been like that too, but he is no longer there,\" she said.\n\nOn June 8, 2021, UN tribunal judges upheld a verdict sentencing Mladic to life in prison for genocide, persecution, crimes against humanity, extermination, and other war crimes committed in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\nOn this year's anniversary of the Srebrenica genocide, 14 more genocide victims who have been identified will be

They ended up like this only because they had a different (Muslim) name,\" said Mevlida Hasanovic as she prayed at the tomb of her cousin, who was 18 when he was killed.\n\nHasanovic lost a dozen male relatives in the massacre including her father and husband, whose grave is next to her cousin's.\n\nHis remains were buried on two occasions since they were found in two different mass graves.\n\nThe 54-year-old woman is still looking for the remains of a brother to be found, \"at least one bone,\" to bury him, she told Agence France-Presse (AFP).\n\n\"Their souls know that we are here next to them.

repeatedly denied a genocide occurred and says his administration would not recognize the resolution.\n\nA U.N. court sentenced Bosnian Serb wartime political leader Radovan Karadzic and his army chief Ratko Mladic to life in prison for war crimes including the Srebrenica genocide.\n\nBosnia's 1992-1995 war between its Croats, Muslims and Serbs claimed approximately 100,000 lives.\n\nNearly three decades after the war ended, the Balkan nation remains deeply divided along ethnic lines.\n\nOn Thursday, the remains of 14 more victims of the bloodshed, including a 17-year-old boy, will be buried at a memorial cemetery in Potocari, just outside Srebrenica.\n\nBeriz Mujic, whose remains were found in the Srebrenica region last year, will be laid to rest next to his brother Hazim.\n\nSo far, the remains, often incomplete, of 6,988 Srebrenica victims have been buried, the overwhelming majority of them under white tombstones in Potocari.\n\nThe remains were found in 87 mass graves and a spokeswoman for Bosnia's Institute for Missing Persons told AFP that they are still looking for around 1,000 people.\n\nTo cover up the crime, Bosnian Serb forces moved the bodies of the victims to so-called secondary mass graves.\n\nOn Wednesday, the European Union, which Bosnia aspires to join, called the atrocity \"one of the darkest moments in modern European history.\"\n\n\"There is no place amongst us for those who deny genocide, attempt to rewrite history, and glorify war criminals,\" EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell and EU enlargement commissioner Oliver Varhelyi said in a joint statement.\n\nThe annual commemoration ceremonies started Monday with a 100-kilometer (62-mile) march toward Srebrenica.\n\nSeveral thousand people joined the march from the village of Nezuk,

Srebrenica genocide - Times of India", "body": "SREBRENICA: Thousands of people were expected to gather Thursday in Srebrenica to commemorate the 1995 massacre of Bosnian Muslims during the country's civil war, two months after the UN created an annual day of remembrance of the genocide.\n\nOn July 11, 1995, Bosnian Serb forces captured the eastern Bosnian town, which was then a UN protected enclave, and killed 8,000 Muslim men and boys in the following days.\n\nThe worst massacre in Europe since World War II has been ruled a genocide by two international courts.\n\nIn May, the United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution declaring July 11 the \"International Day of Reflection and Commemoration of the 1995 Genocide in Srebrenica\".\n\nThe resolution was fiercely opposed by Serbia and Bosnian Serbs, who continue to play down the crime.\n\nMilorad Dodik, President of Bosnia's Serbian entity, has repeatedly denied a genocide occurred, and says his administration would not recognise the resolution.\n\nA UN court sentenced Bosnian Serb wartime political leader Radovan Karadzic and his army chief Ratko Mladic to life in prison for war crimes including the Srebrenica genocide.\n\nIncomplete remains\n\nOn Thursday, the remains of 14 more victims of the bloodshed, including a 17 year old boy, will be buried at a memorial cemetery in Potocari, just outside Srebrenica.\n\nBeriz Mujic, whose remains were found in the Srebrenica region last year, will be laid to rest next to his brother Hazim.\n\nSo far, the remains, often incomplete, of 6,988 Srebrenica victims have been buried, the overwhelming majority of them under white tombstones in Potocari.\n\nThe remains were found in 87 mass graves, and a spokeswoman for Bosnia's institute for missing persons told AFP that they are still looking for around 1,000 people.\n\nTo cover up the crime, Bosnian Serb forces moved the bodies of the victims to so called secondary mass graves.\n\nOn Wednesday, the European Union, which Bosnia aspires to join, called the atrocity \"one of the darkest moments in modern European history\".\n\n\"There is no place amongst us for those who deny genocide, attempt to rewrite history, and glorify war criminals,\" EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell and EU enlargement commissioner Oliver Varhelyi said in a joint statement.\n\nThe annual commemoration ceremonies started on Monday with a 100 kilometre (62-mile) march towards Srebrenica.\n\nSeveral thousand people joined the march from the village of Nezuk, where the first survivors arrived days after the massacre.\n\nBosnia's 1992-1995 war between its Croats, Muslims and Serbs claimed approximately 100,000 lives.\n\nNearly three decades after the war ended, the Balkan nation remains deeply divided along ethnic lines.", "source": {"uri": "timesofindia.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Times of India"}, "authors": [{"uri": "agence_france_presse@timesofindia.indiatimes.com",

My mother and father's cousins and many of our neighbors lost their lives in the genocide,\" said Hodzic, adding that two of her uncle's six sons managed to pass to the safe zone in Srebrenica.\n\nThe UN Security Council declared Srebrenica a \"safe area\" in the spring of 1993. But Serb troops led by Gen. Ratko Mladic -- who was later found guilty of war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide -- overran the UN zone.\n\nDutch troops responsible for protecting people in the UN zone failed to act when Serb forces occupied it on July 11, killing 2,000 men and boys in a single day.\n\nAbout 15,000 Bosniaks fled to the surrounding mountains, but Serb troops hunted them down and killed 6,000 more people.\n\nSerbs who allowed women and children to reach the region controlled by Bosnian soldiers massacred at least 8,372 Bosnian men in forest areas, factories, and warehouses. The murdered Bosnians were buried in mass graves.\n\nThe bodies of genocide victims were discovered in 570 locations across the country, 77 of which were mass graves.\n\nHodzic then fled to Germany, where she lived as a refugee with her children.\n\n\"When I was in Germany, I watched what happened in Srebrenica on television. It was a very difficult time. I was in contact with my sister, who lived in the city of Tuzla. My sister went to the area where the survivors of Srebrenica were brought and found my mother, sister-in-law, and her children,\" she said.\n\nHowever, Hodzic's father and brother were killed. Their body remains were found in a mass grave in Zvornik in 1996 and they were both buried in the Potocari Memorial Cemetery in Srebrenica.\n\n\"The last time I went to Potocari, I read the (Muslim holy book of) Quran for my father and brother. I felt that something was pulling me to stay there. It is very difficult to explain that feeling in words for those who have not lost their loved ones,\" said Hodzic.\n\nWhile 6,751 victims have been buried in the Potocari Memorial Cemetery to date, 250 have been buried in local cemeteries at the request of their families. More than 1,000 victims of the Srebrenica genocide have not been found.\n\nIn 2007, the International Court of Justice in The Hague ruled that a genocide was committed in Srebrenica.\n\nAmid efforts to find the missing after the war, victims whose bodies were found in mass graves are buried in a ceremony held at the Potocari Memorial Cemetery every year on July 11 after identification.\n\nThe elder sister Mekanic, whose husband was killed in 1992, said they were very happy before the war.\n\n\"Before the war, our father was working. There was always a happy atmosphere in our house. I always remember those beautiful moments. I always dream of running away from the Chetniks. Every year, when the funeral prayers are held, I come back to what we experienced that day. It is very difficult,\" she said.\n\nMekanic said she was captured by the Serbs twice during that period and her husband was killed while going to Srebrenica with a military unit to defend the city.\n\n\"When I found my mother and sister, my mother was not well. She seemed lost. She did not hug me. I thought she did not miss me, but they said that my father and brother were taken away by the Serbs. My mother could not sleep for a long time, and when she told me what happened in Srebrenica, I understood why she could not sleep,\" she said.\n\nMekanic said that victims' relatives can never forget the pain they felt.\n\n\"I cried a lot when they burned our house. But when I saw people being killed, I saw that the house had no meaning,\" she said.\n\nShe added that she remembers her father when she sees elderly people walking on the street.\n\n\"My father could have been like that too, but he is no longer there,\" she said.\n\nOn June 8, 2021, UN tribunal judges upheld a verdict sentencing Mladic to life in prison for genocide, persecution, crimes against humanity, extermination, and other war crimes committed in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\nOn this year's anniversary of the Srebrenica genocide, 14 more genocide victims who have been identified will be buried in the Potocari Memorial Cemetery.", "source": {"uri": "aa.com.tr", "dataType": "news", "title": "Anadolu Ajans\u0131"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Ratko Mladic, who was later found guilty of war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide, overran the zone.\n\nDutch troops responsible for safeguarding people in the UN zone failed to act when Serb forces occupied it on July 11, killing 2,000 men and boys in a single day.\n\nSerb forces allowed women and children to reach Bosnian-controlled regions but massacred at least 8,372 Bosnian men in forests, factories, and warehouses. The murdered Bosnians were buried in mass graves, with bodies discovered in 570 different locations across the country, including 77 mass graves.\n\nIn 2007, the International Court of Justice in The Hague ruled that genocide had been committed in Srebrenica.\n\nEfforts to locate the missing victims of the genocide have continued, with identified remains buried at the Potocari Memorial Cemetery.\n\nOn June 8, 2021, UN tribunal judges upheld a life sentence for Mladic for genocide, persecution, crimes against humanity, extermination, and other war crimes committed in Bosnia and Herzegovina.", "source": {"uri": "yenisafak.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yeni \u015eafak"}, "authors": [{"uri": "piri_medya_a_s@yenisafak.com", "name": "Piri Medya A.\u015e.", "type": "author",

We pay tribute to their bravery and resilience.\"\n\n\"Although this crime cannot be undone, we can learn from what happened and apply those lessons, so that such horrendous atrocities and human suffering are never repeated,\" she urged.\n\n\"This means acknowledging the facts. There can be no place for denial, historical revisionism, or the glorification of convicted war criminals,\" she said. \"Looking to the future, we must actively embrace equality, diversity and mutual respect.\"\n\nShe stressed: \"We must also be clear that intolerance, hate speech and other forms of discrimination are a gateway to pain and suffering.\"\n\n\"The Council of Europe will continue to stand firmly against these and to promote human rights, democracy and the rule of law as the right way forward for our societies,\" she added.\n\nEvery year on July 11, newly identified victims of the 1995 genocide are buried in a memorial cemetery in Potocari in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\nThis May, with overwhelming support, the UN General Assembly passed a resolution designating July 11 Srebrenica Genocide Remembrance Day.\n\nThe resolution, spearheaded by Germany and co-sponsored by more than 40 countries, calls for July 11 to be declared \"International Day of Reflection and Commemoration of the 1995 Genocide in Srebrenica.\"\n\nThe youngest victim to be buried this year is Beriz Mujic, 17, born in 1978 in Zvornik.\n\nHis remains were found 28 years after he was killed and were exhumed in May 2023.\n\nHe was killed in July 1995 in the Suceska area near Bratunac, and his remains were discovered and exhumed in the Srebrenica municipality area.\n\nMujic will be buried next to his brother Hazim, whose remains were laid to rest in 2013.\n\nThe body of their father, Omer Mujic, has yet to be found.\n\nThe oldest victim to be buried Thursday is Hamed Salic, born in 1927. He was 68 when he went missing in the summer of 1995 in the town of Zepa. His remains were exhumed in May 2014 and recently identified.\n\nThousands of people from various countries will attend the funerals and burials. Following this year's funeral, the number of victims buried at the cemetery will reach 6,765.\n\nIn the spring of 1993, the UN Security Council declared the city of Srebrenica a \"safe area.\" However, Serb troops led by Gen. Ratko Mladic, who was later found guilty of war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide, overran the zone.\n\nDutch troops responsible for safeguarding people in the UN zone failed to act when Serb forces occupied it on July 11, killing 2,000 men and boys in a single day.\n\nApproximately 15,000 Bosniaks fled to the surrounding mountains, but Serb troops hunted them down, killing an additional 6,000 people.\n\nSerb forces allowed women and children to reach Bosnian-controlled regions but massacred at least 8,372 Bosnian men in forests, factories, and warehouses. The murdered Bosnians were buried in mass graves, with bodies discovered in 570 different locations across the country, including 77 mass graves.\n\nIn 2007, the International Court of Justice in The Hague ruled that genocide had been committed in Srebrenica.\n\nEfforts to locate the missing victims of the genocide have continued, with identified remains buried at the Potocari Memorial Cemetery in a ceremony held every year on July 11.\n\nOn June 8, 2021, UN tribunal judges upheld a life sentence for Mladic for genocide, persecution, crimes against humanity, extermination, and other war crimes committed in Bosnia and Herzegovina.", "source": {"uri": "aa.com.tr", "dataType": "news", "title": "Anadolu Ajans\u0131"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

They followed the route that the people of Srebrenica tried to reach in the summer of 29 years ago to reach the free territory - Tuzla or Kladanj. In the \"March of Peace\" there was a large number of young people and people from different parts of the world who in this way pay tribute to the victims of the genocide in Srebrenica, but also send a message that this should never happen again to anyone.\n\nThe participants of the \"Peace March\" will later attend the presentation of the coffin from the hall of the former Battery Factory, which arrived in Poto\u010dari yesterday. Tomorrow he will attend the collective funeral for 14 victims of the genocide. They were killed in the summer of 29 years ago.\n\nThe \"March of Peace\", which is organized this year for the 20th time as part of the commemoration of the 29th anniversary of the genocide against Bosniaks in the \"United Nations Safe Zone\" Srebrenica, represents for the survivors of Srebrenica a kind of trauma treatment, but also an obligation to tell their experiences and stories and pass them on to younger generations .\n\nThe \"March of Peace\" is a memorial event that takes place every year, in July, on the occasion of the anniversary of the genocide against Bosniaks in the \"United Nations Safe Zone\" in Srebrenica in July 1995.\n\nThe \"Peace March\" aims to build, promote and nurture the culture of remembrance of the genocide against the Bosniaks in Srebrenica, and to prevent the denial, denial and relativization of the crime of genocide.\n\n\"Peace March\" lasts three days and the participants walk on a path about a hundred kilometers long from Nezuk to Poto\u010dari. On this path in the opposite direction, from Poto\u010dari to Nezuk, in July 1995, Bosniaks escaped and broke through during the occupation and seizure of the \"United Nations Safe Zone\" of Srebrenica by Serbian military and police formations.\n\nThe participants of the \"Peace March\" walk about 30 kilometers a day, and in certain places the path is extremely strenuous, inaccessible and requires good physical fitness of the participants.\n\nSo far, 6,751 victims of genocide have been buried in the Srebrenica - Poto\u010dari Memorial Center, while 250 victims were buried in local cemeteries by the decision of the surviving family members.\n\nThe victims came from different municipalities, most of them from the areas of Srebrenica, Bratunac, Vlasenica, Zvornik and Mili\u0107i. Genocide victims were found in 150 different locations, of which 77 were mass graves. The youngest victim so far buried in Poto\u010dari was a newborn girl, Fatima Muhi\u0107, and the oldest was a nun, \u0160aha Izmirli\u0107, born in 1901.\n\nMore than a thousand victims of the genocide are still being searched for.\n\nDuring the genocide in and around Srebrenica in July 1995, members of the Army of the Republika Srpska (VRS), under the command of the then president of the RS, Radovan Karad\u017ei\u0107, and the commander-in-chief of the VRS, Ratko Mladi\u0107, killed more than 8,000 Bosniak men and boys.\n\nThe crime in Srebrenica, the largest on European soil after the Second World War, was characterized as genocide before domestic and international courts.\n\nRadovan Karad\u017ei\u0107 was sentenced before the Mechanism for International Criminal Courts (IMCC), the successor of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in The Hague, to life imprisonment for genocide, crimes against humanity and violation of the laws and customs of war during the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\nRatko Mladi\u0107 was also found guilty of genocide and sentenced to life imprisonment before the same court in The Hague.\n\nAt least 47 people were sentenced to more than 700 years in prison for crimes committed in the Srebrenica area, Anadolu Agency writes.", "source": {"uri": "sarajevotimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sarajevo Times"},

Serbs against the country's two other main ethnic populations, Croats and Muslim Bosniaks.\n\nOver a period of three years, more than 100,000 people died and some two million were forced to migrate.\n\nIn 2007, the International Court of Justice, the UN's highest tribunal, determined that the acts committed in Srebrenica constituted genocide.\n\nMladic and the wartime leader, Radovan Karadzic, in 2016 were both convicted of genocide in Srebrenica by a special UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague.\n\nBoth Serbia and Bosnian Serbs have denied that the events that took place

Many were forced to flee a Bosnian Serb campaign of ethnic cleansing during the 1992-95 war.\n\nThe town was declared a UN safe zone in 1993 and international peacekeepers were charged with protecting it from any attacks.\n\nBut in July 1995, Bosnian Serb forces - led by military commander Ratko Mladic - stormed the town, overwhelming the peacekeepers.\n\nThe Serb forces rounded up the town's men and boys, most of whom were never seen alive again.\n\nThey were either killed in droves or murdered when they tried to escape through the wooded hills around Srebrenica.\n\nThe brutal killing of around 8,000 men and boys became known as Europe's worst mass atrocity since World War Two. The remains of about 1,000 people are still missing.\n\nRatko Mladic was later jailed for life for war crimes, including genocide, and nearly 50 Bosnian Serbs were also convicted.\n\nThe recent UN resolution, designating 11 July an International Day of Reflection and Commemoration of the Srebrenica Genocide, also condemned any denial of the massacre and glorification of war criminals.\n\nBut most Bosnian Serbs, as well as many people in Serbia, have repeatedly denied that what had occurred in Srebrenica in 1995 constituted genocide.\n\nSabrija pushes back at claims that the Srebrenica killings were not targeted.\n\n\"What happened should be known, instead of having all these lies flying around,\" she says. \"My soul hurts.\"\n\nSome Bosniak families have been waiting for decades to lay their loved ones to rest, as the identification process is lengthy and difficult.\n\nSabrija was able to bury her husband's skull - the only body part which was unearthed.\n\nHer father's remains are yet to be found, although she knows he was killed close to their house in Srebrenica as her mother witnessed the killing.\n\nSix months after her father's murder, her mother died, too - \"of sorrow,\" says Sabrija, fighting back tears.\n\nMany victims of the Srebrenica massacre are buried at nearby Potocari cemetery. Thousands of simple white tombstones sit in a field on a slope of a hill, surrounded by woods.\n\nBerija Delic also lost her husband in the massacre. His remains were only found a decade later, and were buried in 2010.\n\nLast year, Berija decided to return to Srebrenica from Malta, where she sought refuge after the war.\n\nHer son, a Muslim, married a Serb Orthodox woman who \"loves my baclava,\" she says, referring to a sweet delicacy she cooks.\n\nBefore the 1990s war, Srebrenica was largely a Bosniak Muslim town.\n\nNow, the majority of the population is Serb; some of the residents had been soldiers during the conflict.\n\n\"Even now you see someone walking around town, and you know that he has killed [Bosniaks] - but you remain silent, you cannot deal with that,\" says Berija.\n\nFollowing the war, Bosnia was divided into two entities - Republika Srpska and Bosnia-Herzegovina. Srebrenica is in Republika Srpska.\n\nIn the years since the war, the Bosniak population dwindled and the Serb population grew, but now they have one problem in common - unemployment.\n\n\"Serbs and Bosniaks have no problems between them here, tensions are brought by people from the outside,\" says Slavisa Petrovic, a 37-year old Serb who runs the local tourist office.\n\nBut he says the town needs jobs for people to entice them to stay.\n\nThe recent UN resolution on the massacre has not changed anything, Slavisa adds.\n\n\"People are leaving Srebrenica now just like they as they did before it [the adoption of the resolution]. There are no jobs, just like there weren't before.\"\n\nThere are signs of decline in the town. A once popular local spa and a formerly luxurious hotel are closed, having been abandoned for decades. Their walls are covered in graffiti.\n\nThe roads leading to neighbouring villages, where farmers with healthy livestock once lived, are overgrown with weeds.\n\nMany local homes are still in ruins. A mosque and a Christian Orthodox are sitting on a hillside overlooking the town, its wartime wounds unhealed.\n\nSerb and Bosniak children go to local kindergardens and schools together, and photographs of the new generation are proudly displayed in a public place in the centre of the town.\n\nBut it is most likely that the youngsters will soon leave for good.\n\nSlavisa is sad that locals keep abandoning the town. \"It feels like they are leaving my house,\" he says.\n\nOnly three of his classmates are still living in Srebrenica. The rest have moveld elsewhere.\n\nHe, however, is determined to stay.\n\nBut even he admits that his four-year-old daughter is unlikely to feel the same when she grows up.", "source": {"uri":

Their remains, originally exhumed from mass graves, were laid to rest after a ceremony in a memorial cemetery outside Srebrenica in eastern Bosnia.\n\nAbout 6,750 of the massacre victims are interred in the memorial cemetery, and some others at local grave sites.\n\n\"Unfortunately, while I stand here other mothers lose their children in Ukraine and Palestine,\" said Munira Subasic, president of the Mothers of Srebrenica association.\n\n\"The world and Europe have learned nothing,\" she told several hundred people who attended the ceremony.\n\nThe massacre unfolded after Srebrenica, a designated U.N. \"safe area\" for civilians in Bosnia's 1992-95 ethnic war that followed the disintegration of federal Yugoslavia, was overrun by nationalist Bosnian Serb forces.\n\nBosnian Serb army commander Ratko Mladic and political leader Radovan Karadzic were arrested after the war and convicted of genocide by a U.N. war crimes tribunal in The Hague for their role in the killings.\n\nBosnia was split into autonomous Bosniak-Croat and Serb entities under the 1995 Dayton peace treaty and deep differences over what happened in Srebrenica linger, with both Serbs and Serbia saying the killings could not be called genocide.\n\nHowever Bosnian Serb President Milorad Dodik, known for his strident nationalism, posted an unexpectedly emollient anniversary message on social media site X on Thursday.\n\n\"Today, Bosniaks (Bosnian Muslims) remember their victims and they are paying their respect,\" Dodik said, calling on everyone to \"mark this day in peace and dignity.\"\n\nSrebrenica is located in Bosnia's Serb-governed region.\n\nTurkish President Tayyip Erdogan sent a video message which was played at the ceremony, Bosnian N1 news web portal reported.\n\n\"We will not forget Srebrenica and we will not allow it to be forgotten so that a similar crime is not repeated anywhere in the world,\" Erdogan said. \"I pray that the souls of our martyrs may rest in peace and be in

Today, three decades later, we are witnessing the terrible crimes and genocide being carried out against the people of Palestine,\" she said.\n\nAlthough Israel and Bosnia and Herzegovina have enjoyed good relations since the country's formation in the 1990s, the Gaza war has put a strain on relations, with numerous pro-Palestinian demonstrations taking place in the eastern European country.\n\nIn May, tensions flared after Yahel Vilan, Israel's ambassador to Serbia, told a Russian media outlet that he didn't believe Srebrenica constituted a genocide and that referring to it as such \"diminishes the importance of that term\".\n\nBosnian Foreign Minister Elmedin Konakovic called Vilan's comments \"shameful\", saying they were \"not only deeply wrong, but also insulting to the victims and survivors of the genocide in Srebrenica, as well as to all those who hold to truth and justice in the international community\".", "source": {"uri": "middleeasteye.net", "dataType":

The official international recognition provides important new support for survivors who are still burying the remains of their loved ones in the face of a surge of denial and hate speech.\n\nThe UN Resolution encourages and draws attention to the proliferation of commemorations around the world that are honoring the memory of the victims and affirming the truth about the Srebrenica genocide. The victims of the genocide will be remembered this year at an official high-level event at the United Nations in New York on July 11, organized by Ambassador Lagumd\u017eija. Commemorations will also take place throughout the United Kingdom, in Ireland, Belgium, Switzerland, and elsewhere. And the Srebrenica Genocide will also be commemorated throughout the United States: including in St. Louis, Missouri, in Chicago, Illinois, and in Connecticut where the flag of Bosnia and Herzegovina will be raised.\n\nWith the UN Resolution there is crucial momentum for affirming the truth and for establishing a lasting culture of remembrance in order to prevent a repetition of the genocide. The UN Resolution condemned \"any denial of the Srebrenica genocide\". Genocide scholars warn that denial causes re-victimization and incites a repetition of the violence. But the international community does not seem sufficiently aware or concerned about the dramatic increase of denial and threats to the peace in Republika Srpska and Serbia that have followed the passage of the UN Resolution.\n\nIn brazen opposition to the spirit of the UN Resolution, nationalist leaders in Republika Srpska and Serbia held the highly touted \"All-Serb Assembly,\" and published a \"Declaration\" calling for the unity of all Serb people in an updated version of \"Greater Serbia,\" the same \"Greater Serbia\" that motivated the international aggression and genocide against Bosnia in the 1990's. The Declaration also explicitly condemned the UN Resolution and essentially denied the Srebrenica genocide.\n\nIt is a matter of great concern that the Declaration of the \"All-Serb Assembly\" presents Republika Srpska as an autonomous legal entity, lending support to Milorad Dodik's dangerous plan for \"peaceful disassociation\" from Bosnia. In the same context, there is great concern among survivors about the proposal emanating from Bosnian Serb political representatives, to change the name of Srebrenica. More recently, the July 11 commemoration at Poto\u010dari was even characterized as a threat to security in Republika Srpska. All these are troubling provocations that threaten a repetition of the atrocities. Such threats require more severe condemnations and sanctions from the United States, United Kingdom, and the European Union.\n\nLong before the UN Resolution, the Mothers of Srebrenica inspired us with their struggle for the truth of the Srebrenica Genocide to be recognized and for the victims to be remembered. They have testified at the Hague, brought legal action against the Netherlands for its liability for the genocide and advocated for the exhumation and identification of the victims. The Mothers advocated tirelessly for the establishment of a Memorial Center and Cemetery, a vision that the dedicated and capable leadership and staff of the Srebrenica Memorial Center have made a reality today.\n\nOn July 1, I was honored to attend the opening ceremony for a \"Srebrenica Genocide Exhibition\" at the UN Headquarters in New York, which was organized by the office of Ambassador Lagumd\u017eija and the Srebrenica Memorial Center. The tireless Mothers of Srebrenica, Munira Suba\u0161i\u0107 and Kada Hoti\u0107, attended and Munira addressed those who gathered. In his remarks Ambassador Lagumd\u017eija referred to Memorial Center Director Emir Suljagi\u0107's haunting observation that none of those at the Memorial Center who worked on this exhibition were supposed to be alive today. In other words, as Amra Begi\u0107 Fazli\u0107, Deputy Director of the Memorial Center took to the podium to officially open the exhibition, it was a poignant moment for her and for the Mothers of Srebrenica, since, according to the genocidal plan in 1995, they were not supposed to be here today. And yet here they were at the United Nations in New York opening a memorial exhibition to educate the world. It was inspirational for all of us.\n\nAs we commemorate the Srebrenica Genocide on July 11 this year in the face of unprecedented threats from the \"Declaration\" of the \"All Serb Assembly\" and other provocations it will indeed be a solemn hour of remembrance. With this commemoration let us renew our commitment to a culture of remembrance to educate future generations and prevent a repetition of the atrocities. As Srebrenica commemorations spread around the world, may that culture of remembrance extend to the establishment of memorial museums at Barutni magacin in Kalinovik and at the White House at Omarska. Now, more than ever, the United States, United Kingdom, European Union, and international community must protect survivors, stand for the truth, stand with the Mothers of Srebrenica, and stand with Bosnia.\"", "source": {"uri": "n1info.ba", "dataType": "news", "title": "N1"}, "authors": [{"uri": "n1_sarajevo@n1info.ba", "name": "N1 Sarajevo", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts":

I am asking the dear God to honour all our martyrs with his paradise and his beauty. We are aware that the pain of our mothers and sisters who lost their loved ones in Srebrenica is as fresh as the day the genocide happened.

I would like to thank everyone who contributed to all stages of this decision, from its preparation to its adoption. We believe that this decision should serve as an example so that the darkness similar to the genocide in Srebrenica is not repeated anywhere in the world,\" Erdogan said.\n\nHe also recalled the suffering of the Palestinian people in Gaza and the occupied Palestinian territory.\n\n\"However, today the Palestinian people in Gaza and the occupied Palestinian territories are exposed to crimes similar to those experienced in Srebrenica 29 years ago. International institutions and organizations are only observing the murder of around 40 thousand innocent people, including 16 thousand children, as they did 29 years ago,\" Erdogan said with the message that the whole world is going through a test of humanity and sincerity.\n\n\"Those who are responsible for the barbarism in Gaza will sooner or later answer to international law, just like in Srebrenica. Turkey will continue to do its best to ensure that justice is served and that the perpetrators of the genocide are held accountable,\" the Turkish president said.\n\n- \"We expect local authorities to protect returnees\" -\n\nErdogan expressed regret for the denial of the Srebrenica genocide and the glorifficatrion of war criminals.\n\n\"Here, once again, I want to express my regret for the existence of those who continue to deny the genocide in Bosnia and Herzegovina and glorify war criminals, despite the verdicts of international courts. We also observe with concern the attacks and mistreatment of people who returned to their homes after the war. We expect the local authorities to do their part so that every citizen of Bosnia and Herzegovina, regardless of ethnicity, feels safe where they live,\" Erdogan said.\n\nIn order to maintain lasting peace and stability in BiH Erdogan said all kinds of hate speech must be completely abandoned and \"we must look for ways to spread the culture of peace, tolerance and reconciliation.\"\n\n\"It is our sincere wish that an internal consensus prevails in Bosnia and Herzegovina that will include all segments.

Among them, convicted war criminal Ratko Mladi\u0107.\n\nThe Bosnian Serb military chief known as the \"Butcher of Bosnia\" orchestrated a genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes in the Balkan nation's 1992-1995 war.\n\nThese included the massacre of 8,000 Bosniak Muslim men and boys in Srebrenica in July 1995.\n\nThe bloodbath was the worst episode of mass murder within Europe since the Second World War, and the only one to be declared a genocide.\n\nThe scars still run deep, with thousands of Serbs across the country, including politicians, continuing to deny that the killing of Bosniaks in Srebrenica constituted genocide.\n\nThe billboard in Vlasenica encapsulates how deeply fractured Bosnia and Herzegovina remains as the country marks Srebrenica Memorial Day on Thursday. The sign is less than a mile from Su\u0161ica concentration camp - where about 1,600 people were reportedly killed and countless others raped and tortured -and 20 miles east of Srebrenica.\n\nIt also features an image of the mayor of Vlasenica, Miroslav Kraljevi\u0107, who is on trial over war crimes allegedly committed during the 90s conflict. Mr Kraljevi\u0107 is reported to have led a Bosnian Serb special police unit in Vlasenica and is accused of imprisoning several dozen people who suffered torture and persecution in 1992 and 1993. The municipality of Vlasenica did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe much-maligned 1995 Dayton Accords ended the war but effectively split the country in two, with one half ruled by the Serb-populated Republika Srpska and the other a Bosniak-Croat federation. Vlasenica is situated in Republika Srpska, and so is Srebrenica.\n\n\"For years, we have been facing active denial of genocide, relativisation and support for the perpetrators of genocide,\" Edin Ikanovic, of the Srebrenica Memorial Centre, told .\n\n\"Very often in the territory of the entity Republika Srpska and the neighbouring state of Serbia, we can see murals of war criminals and certain messages that deny the genocide.\"\n\nThe entrenched division besetting Bosnian politics and delays to constitutional and electoral reforms have threatened to derail the country's long bid to join the EU.\n\nIt had seemed a remote prospect, but Russia's war in Ukraine injected a sense of urgency for Bosnia to move forward on its European path. Bosnia was granted candidate status in December 2022, and in March this year, EU leaders agreed to open membership negotiations but stressed the country needed to undertake more reforms before the talks could begin.\n\nObservers say EU accession offers no remedy to persistent ethnic tensions, and that the bloc has done little to tackle the issue.\n\nThe billboard glorifying Mladi\u0107 is a stone's throw from the village's revamped fire department, which was partly funded by the EU and implemented by the UN Development Programme (UNDP). A sign bearing the EU flag and proudly proclaiming the bloc's involvement in the project sits beside the billboard.\n\nFerdinand Koenig, a spokesman for the EU Delegation/Office of the EU Special Representative in Bosnia and Herzegovina, said: \"The EU has on multiple occasions and at the highest level condemned all rhetoric and actions which deny or relativise the genocide in Srebrenica and glorify the war criminals who carried it out.\n\n\"Healing the wounds of the past requires acknowledging and teaching the historical facts, honouring and remembering the victims, identifying those still missing, and bringing all perpetrators to justice. This is key to confront the roots of hatred that led to the genocide.\n\n\"Those in positions of power have a particular responsibility to promote an environment conducive to reconciliation, and the EU calls on them to reject divisive rhetoric and act with truth, justice, trust, and dialogue.\"\n\nThe UNDP did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nAt the Srebrenica Memorial Centre cemetery, 6,751 victims of the genocide are buried, their graves marked by white headstones stretching along the hillside as far as the eyes can see.\n\nAnother 250 victims are buried at other cemeteries, while relatives of more than 1,000 missing people are still searching for their loved ones' remains that are scattered in multiple mass graves across the region.\n\nNewly identified victims are buried at the centre every year on Srebrenica Memorial Day, which was established as an annual day of remembrance by the UN in May. This year will see 14 people laid to rest there on Thursday, the youngest being Beriz Mujic, who was killed aged 17.\n\n\"He will be buried next to his brother, Hazim, who was buried in 2013,\" Emza Fazlic, a spokesperson at the Bosnian Missing Persons Institute, told the Balkan Investigative Reporting Network. She added that their father's body has yet to be found.\n\nThe Srebrenica Memorial Centre has been monitoring and documenting incidents of genocide denial in Bosnia for the past four years, with findings published in an annual report.\n\n\"Our mission is to fight against denial, to demand from judicial institutions their prosecution, because the denial of genocide is not only an anti-civilisational act but also a threat to the future,\" Mr Ikanovic said.\n\nAccording to its 2023 report, the memorial centre recorded 90 cases of denial of genocide between May 2022 and May last year, including statements made by Milorad Dodik, president of Republika Srpska.\n\nThe 2023 report marked a significant decrease from the 693 recorded incidents in the previous year, due in part to a ban imposed in 2021 that prohibits and punishes genocide denial and the glorification of war criminals. But the report notes that \"not a single indictment has been filed against those who deny the genocide, despite the dozens of criminal charges filed\".\n\nThis year's report is still in progress, but Mr Ikanovic said the findings are \"devastating\".\n\n\"There has been another wave of mass denial,\" he added. \"The reason is certainly that there are no sanctions for those who deny, even though there is a law prohibiting genocide denial.\"", "source": {"uri": "inews.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "inews.co.uk"}, "authors": [{"uri": "taz_ali@inews.co.uk", "name": "Taz Ali", "type":

Many were forced to flee a Bosnian Serb campaign of ethnic cleansing during the 1992-95 war.\n\nThe town was declared a UN safe zone in 1993 and international peacekeepers were charged with protecting it from any attacks.\n\nBut in July 1995, Bosnian Serb forces - led by military commander Ratko Mladic - stormed the town, overwhelming the peacekeepers.\n\nThe Serb forces rounded up the town's men and boys, most of whom were never seen alive again.\n\nAround 8,000 Muslim men and boys were killed by the Serb forces\n\nThe brutal killing of around 8,000 men and boys became known as Europe's worst mass atrocity since World War Two. The remains of about 1,000 people are still missing.\n\nRatko Mladic was later jailed for life for war crimes, including genocide, and nearly 50 Bosnian Serbs were also convicted.\n\nThe recent UN resolution, designating 11 July an International Day of Reflection and Commemoration of the Srebrenica Genocide, also condemned any denial of the massacre and glorification of war criminals.\n\nBut most Bosnian Serbs, as well as many people in Serbia, have repeatedly denied that what had occurred in Srebrenica in 1995 constituted genocide.\n\nSabrija pushes back at claims that the Srebrenica killings were not targeted.\n\n\"What happened should be known, instead of having all these lies flying around,\" she says. \"My soul hurts.\"\n\nSome Bosniak families have been waiting for decades to lay their loved ones to rest, as the identification process is lengthy and difficult.\n\nSabrija was able to bury her husband's skull - the only body part which was unearthed.\n\nHer father's remains are yet to be found, although she knows he was killed close to their house in Srebrenica as her mother witnessed the killing.\n\nSix months after her father's murder, her mother died, too - \"of sorrow,\" says Sabrija, fighting back tears.\n\nMany victims of the Srebrenica massacre are buried at nearby Potocari cemetery. Thousands of simple white tombstones sit in a field on a slope of a hill, surrounded by woods.\n\nBerija Delic lost her husband and recovered his remains only in 2005\n\nBerija Delic also lost her husband in the massacre. His remains were only found a decade later, and were buried in 2010.\n\nLast year, Berija decided to return to Srebrenica from Malta, where she sought refuge after the war.\n\nHer son, a Muslim, married a Serb Orthodox woman who \"loves my baclava,\" she says, referring to a sweet delicacy she cooks.\n\nBefore the 1990s war, Srebrenica was largely a Bosniak Muslim town.\n\nNow, the majority of the population is Serb; some of the residents had been soldiers during the conflict.\n\n\"Even now you see someone walking around town, and you know that he has killed [Bosniaks] - but you remain silent, you cannot deal with that,\" says Berija.\n\nFollowing the war, Bosnia was divided into two entities - Republika Srpska and Bosnia-Herzegovina. Srebrenica is in Republika Srpska.\n\nIn the years since the war, the Bosniak population dwindled and the Serb population grew, but now they have one problem in common - unemployment.\n\n\"Serbs and Bosniaks have no problems between them here, tensions are brought by people from the outside,\" says Slavisa Petrovic, a 37-year old Serb who runs the local tourist office.\n\nBut he says the town needs jobs for people to entice them to stay.\n\nThe recent UN resolution on the massacre has not changed anything, Slavisa adds.\n\n\"People are leaving Srebrenica now just like they as they did before it [the adoption of the resolution]. There are no jobs, just like there weren't before.\"\n\nThere are signs of decline in the town. A once popular local spa and a formerly luxurious hotel are closed, having been abandoned for decades. Their walls are covered in graffiti.\n\nThe roads leading to neighbouring villages, where farmers with healthy livestock once lived, are overgrown with weeds.\n\nMany local homes are still in ruins. A mosque and a Christian Orthodox are sitting on a hillside overlooking the town, its wartime wounds unhealed.\n\nSerb and Bosniak children go to local kindergardens and schools together, and photographs of the new generation are proudly displayed in a public place in the centre of the town.\n\nBut it is most likely that the youngsters will soon leave for good.\n\nSlavisa is sad that locals keep abandoning the town. \"It feels like they are leaving my house,\" he says.\n\nOnly three of his classmates are still living in Srebrenica. The rest have moved elsewhere.\n\nHe, however, is determined to stay.\n\nPero incluso el admite que su hija de cuatro a\u00f1os es improbable que sienta lo mismo cuando crece.", "source": {"uri":

On July 11, 1995, Bosnian Serb forces captured the eastern Bosnian town -- which was then a UN-protected enclave -- and killed 8,000 Muslim men and boys in the following days. The worst massacre in Europe since World War II has been ruled a genocide by two international courts. In May, the United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution declaring July 11 the \"International Day of Reflection and Commemoration of the 1995 Genocide in Srebrenica\". The resolution was fiercly opposed by Serbia and Bosnian Serbs, who continue to play down the crime.\n\nMilorad Dodik, President of Bosnia's Serbian entity, has repeatedly denied a genocide occurred, and says his administration would not recognise the resolution.

We vowed \"never again\" in the wake of history's gravest atrocities, yet today, the specter of genocide looms over Gaza. Srebrenica's haunting legacy still reverberates -- a stark reminder of our boundless capacity for inhumanity. In July 1995, within a supposed sanctuary, thousands fell victim to unfathomable brutality, their resting places mass graves. Their only crime was their Muslim identity, marking this as the gravest atrocity on European soil since World War II.\n\nThe ongoing genocide in the Gaza Strip, with lives lost or trapped beneath the debris, surpasses the horrors witnessed in Srebrenica. Survivors of the systematic slaughter of more than 8,000 Bosniak Muslim men and boys by Serbian forces understand the agony felt by the people of Gaza. We were both killed because of our Muslim identity.\n\nThe accumulative effects of Israel's war on Gaza could mean the true death toll could reach more than 186,000 people, according to a study published in the journal Lancet. According to the Health Ministry in the battered enclave, 38,000 Palestinians have been killed in\n\nIsraeli attacks on the Gaza Strip since October 7. A ministry statement added that at least 87,060 others have also been injured in the ongoing onslaught.\n\nIn 2009, the European Parliament declared July 11 as the official day of remembrance for the victims of Srebrenica. On this day each year, the world is called to honour the victims and survivors of this atrocity. Fourteen identified victims of the Srebrenica genocide will be buried.\n\nHave we learned nothing from Srebrenica's searing lesson, from our vow of \"never again\"? How much longer will the international community bear witness to the slaughter of innocents in Gaza? We, Bosnian Bosniaks, stand in solidarity with our brothers and sisters in Palestine. We know firsthand the agony of losing children and family members -- thousands met their untimely end at the hands of Bosnian Serb forces in Srebrenica.\n\nIn this hour of peril, we stand on the precipice, fearing the repetition of history's darkest chapter. The international community bears the weighty responsibility to intervene, to halt these brazen violations of international law before they escalate further. Time, that most precious of commodities, slips through our fingers like sand in the wind.\n\nIn Gaza, a once-thriving tapestry of life now lies in ruins. Communities, once vibrant, now stand as monuments to devastation. Their inhabitants, parched and desperate, bear the weight of a total blockade. Water, a cornerstone of human existence, is now a rare treasure. Families, resilient yet weary, dig makeshift wells along the coastline -- a cruel metaphor for their fight for survival. Hospitals, the bastions of healing, teeter on the precipice of collapse. Their generators sputter, their fuel dwindles. Food stores, once bustling with life, now stand barren, their shelves stripped of sustenance. This grim reality strikes a chord with survivors of Srebrenica, who bear witness to the depths of human suffering.\n\nThe Israeli onslaught, marked by relentless barrages on densely populated residential areas, speaks volumes. It is a campaign of annihilation, indiscriminately targeting civilians. It eclipses any prior assault on Gaza in its toll on innocent lives. The blackout of fuel, electricity, water, and humanitarian aid paints a chilling tableau of a population teetering on the precipice of catastrophe.\n\nAs power wanes and resources dwindle, health facilities stare into the abyss of collapse. The UNRWA's dire warning is a clarion call to action: without fuel, operations will grind to a halt. Contaminated water threatens a major epidemic, while overcrowded shelters breed disease. Women, children, and the most vulnerable among us face the specter of malnutrition and its associated afflictions.\n\nThe time for action is now. The international community must not waver in the face of this impending humanitarian catastrophe. Gaza stands at the precipice, its fate hanging in the balance.\n\nThe truth is on our side. International law is on our side. It is imperative to act now. The atrocities in Srebrenica should have taught us that silence and inaction in the face of genocide are tantamount to complicity. We cannot let history repeat itself. We must act with urgency and compassion to prevent another genocide from unfolding before our eyes.\n\nMy story is not just a plea for Gaza; it is a plea for humanity. When genocide denial persists, as it does in the Balkans, it plants the seeds for future atrocities. We, the survivors of Srebrenica, are living testaments to the horrors of unchecked hatred and violence. We have seen what happens when the world turns a blind eye.\n\nIn Bosnia, the scars of genocide are still fresh. Every year, new graves are unearthed, and families like mine bury their loved ones once more. My uncles' remains, found in multiple mass graves, are a stark reminder of the cruelty that can arise from ethnic hatred and indifference. The international community must not allow Gaza to become another Srebrenica.\n\nGaza's plight is not just a Palestinian issue; it is a human issue. The blockade, the bombings, the deprivation -- all these crimes against humanity demand a response. The world must uphold the principles of justice and human rights that we so often espouse.\n\nMy message to the international community is clear: Do not let Gaza become another Srebrenica. Do not let the cries of the innocent go unheard. Act now, with resolve and compassion, to end the suffering and prevent further atrocities. History is watching, and we must ensure that the promise of \"never again\" is not just an empty slogan but a commitment to action and justice.", "source": {"uri": "dohanews.co", "dataType": "news",

International institutions and organizations are just watching the murder of approximately 16 thousand innocent people, including 40 thousand children, just like 29 years ago. As the whole world, we are going through the test of humanity and sincerity. I would like it to be known that those responsible for the barbarism in Gaza will sooner or later be held accountable before international law, just like in Srebrenica. \"As T\u00fcrkiye, we will continue to do our best to ensure that justice is served and the perpetrators of the massacre are held accountable.\"\n\n\"ALL KINDS OF HATE SPEECH MUST BE LEAVED BEHIND\"\n\nUnderlining that they

Herzegovina, regardless of ethnic origin, feels safe where they live, President Erdo\u011fan said: \"In order to maintain permanent peace and stability in Bosnia and Herzegovina, we must leave all kinds of hate speech behind and achieve peace.\" \"We must look for ways to spread the culture of tolerance and compromise.\" he said.\n\nStating that it is their sincere wish that an internal consensus covering all sections of Bosnia and Herzegovina prevails, President Erdo\u011fan emphasized that everyone should keep in mind that no one will benefit from conflict and tension.", "source":

In Potocari, he recalled the events of 1994 and compared them to the genocide in Srebrenica.\n\nMutanguha explained that the preparation for the Rwandan genocide lasted about thirty years, during which discrimination was developed to divide the local population.\n\n\"I am a victim, a genocide survivor. In 1994, I lost my parents and four sisters. They were among our neighbors. That was the horrific moment when you find yourself as a victim. You lost your parents, grandfather, extended family -- you lost everything. You lost your home, and your neighbors killed your family,\" Mutanguha emphasized.\n\nHe noted that it was particularly characteristic of Rwanda that neighbors killed neighbors.\n\n\"They turned against us. If you do not pay attention, this can lead to division and discrimination, turning your neighbors against you, making them killers. That happened in '94, and about a year later, genocide occurred in Srebrenica. The rest of the world simply didn't care about what was happening in Rwanda enough to protect civilians and prevent genocide from happening here in Srebrenica,\" Mutanguha reflected.\n\nThe UN recognized the Rwandan genocide as such and passed a resolution on the genocide in January 2018. Mutanguha expressed satisfaction that a resolution on the Srebrenica genocide was adopted in May this year.\n\n\"This is a significant step forward where the international community has recognized these crimes. As survivors of the genocides in Rwanda and Srebrenica, we want the international community to take another step to protect civilians worldwide and ensure this world is a just and good place to live. We hope the international community learns from these two crimes in our countries, despite the time gap. We have realized that the world does not learn enough about what is happening -- about the hatred, discrimination, and divisions occurring worldwide. I am very pleased that the resolution has finally been adopted, and we hope that deniers, those who deny genocide, will be silenced because it will now be the responsibility of all states to remember genocide, prevent it, and provide the dignity that the victims deserve,\" he added.\n\nThirty years later, people in Rwanda are rebuilding the nation, the state itself, and working to improve relationships. Part of Rwanda's reconstruction and renewal included steps to ensure justice for survivors. Freddy Mutanguha had the opportunity to meet face-to-face with the person convicted of murdering his family.\n\n\"It was a very sad moment for me because it took me back to 1994. His name is Samson, and he was the leader of the militia that killed my family. When I came to see him, about five minutes before, it took me back 30 years, where I could even hear the killers' hate songs as they came to kill my family. However, my sister and I found the courage to move forward and shake hands with him. I wanted him to look me in the eye, to see that we are still alive and understand why he did it and what he feels when he looks at me. When we shook hands, when he approached me, he began to apologize, saying he was sorry. When I asked him why he did it, he had no answer,\" Mutanguha recalled.", "source": {"uri": "n1info.ba", "dataType": "news", "title": "N1"}, "authors": [{"uri": "n1_sarajevo@n1info.ba", "name": "N1 Sarajevo", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rwandan_genocide", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rwandan genocide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Discrimination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocide", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Genocide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rwanda", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rwanda"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Rwanda"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Srebrenica_massacre", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Srebrenica massacre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Srebrenica", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Srebrenica"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Srebrenica"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bosnia and Herzegovina"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aegis_Trust", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aegis Trust"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_community", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International community"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kigali", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kigali"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kigali"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Rwanda"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Militia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Militia"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 51}], "image": "https://n1info.ba/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/11/1720693838-ruanda-e1720693864933-1200x800.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9721305", "eventUri": "eng-9721305", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2018-01-", "textStart": 1382, "textEnd": 1394}], "sentiment": -0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 141, "relevance": 1}

Their eventual goal was to annex this territory to the adjacent republic of Serbia (which, along with Montenegro, constituted the rump of the Yugoslav federation). To do so, they believed, required the expulsion of the territory's Bosniak inhabitants, who opposed annexation. In March 1995 Radovan Karad\u017ei\u0107, president of the self-declared autonomous Republika Srpska (Bosnian Serb Republic), directed his military forces to \"create an unbearable situation of total insecurity with no hope of further survival or life for the inhabitants of Srebrenica.\" By May a cordon of Bosnian Serb soldiers had imposed an embargo on food and other supplies that provoked most of the town's Bosniak fighters to flee the area. In late June, after some skirmishes with the few remaining Bosniak fighters, the Bosnian Serb military command formally ordered the operation, code-named Krivaja 95, that culminated in the massacre.\n\nThe offensive commenced on July 6, 1995, with Bosnian Serb forces advancing from the south and burning Bosniak homes along the way. Amid chaos and terror, thousands of civilians fled Srebrenica for the nearby village of Poto\u010dari, where a contingent of about 200 Dutch peacekeepers was stationed. Some of the Dutch surrendered, while others withdrew; none fired on the advancing Bosnian Serb forces. On July 11, Bosnian Serb military leader Ratko Mladi\u0107 strolled through Srebrenica and, in a statement recorded on film by a Serb journalist, said, \"We give this town to the Serb nation...The time has come to take revenge on the Muslims.\"\n\nOn the night of July 11, a column of more than 10,000 Bosniak men set off from Srebrenica through dense forest in an attempt to reach safety. Beginning the following morning, Bosnian Serb officers used UN equipment and made false promises of security to encourage the men to surrender; thousands gave themselves up or were captured, and many were subsequently executed. Other Bosniaks were forced out of Poto\u010dari that day through the use of terror, including individual murders and rapes committed by Bosnian Serb forces. The women, children, and elderly were placed aboard buses (some of which had been brought from Serbia) and driven to Bosniak-held territory. The men and boys were taken on July 12 and 13 to various holding sites, mostly in Bratunac.\n\nSome killings occurred on the evening of July 12, but mass evacuations of mostly blindfolded Bosniak males to execution sites began in earnest on the evening of July 13. The destinations were primarily north of Srebrenica, in a 35-mile- (55-km-) long band alongside the Drina River, which marks much of Bosnia's border with Serbia. They included a football field in Bratunac, several meadows and fields near Vlasenica and Nova Kasaba, a warehouse in Kravica, a factory in Karakaj, a school in Orahovac, a dirt road in the Cerska Valley, and a cultural centre in Pilica. The executions continued at least through July 16, when hundreds of people were reportedly shot at a state farm in the village of Branjevo. Although Bosnian Serb forces were primarily responsible for the killings, a police unit from Serbia was recorded on video participating in the execution of six Bosniaks. It was discovered later that many of the victims of the massacre had had their arms and feet bound. Many of the bodies also showed signs of mutilation.", "source": {"uri": "sarajevotimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sarajevo Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Last November, she became the first high-ranking Arab official to enter Gaza when she visited Rafah.\n\nAl Khater has been personally welcoming all Palestinians evacuated from the Gaza Strip, including holders of Qatari residency and those receiving treatment under the initiative by Qatar's Amir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani.\n\nThe Qatari official is also due to speak in Sarajevo on Wednesday at a session titled \"From the Balkans to Gaza: A Critical Examination of Genocide\" which is taking place ahead of the anniversary of the 1995 Srebrenica genocide.\n\nThe session is organised by The Islam and Muslims Initiative (IMI) in collaboration with the Sarajevo Center for Advanced Studies. Speakers on the panel include Palestinian photojournalist Motaz Azaiza, Sarajevo Mayor Benjamina Karic, and Slovenia's President Natasa Pirc Musar among others.\n\n\"The session will explore the profound impacts of Islamophobia, tracing its historical roots and contemporary manifestations. We will delve into the parallels between the Srebrenica genocide, the Sarajevo siege, the unfolding genocide in Gaza, and colonial expansion in Palestine,\" the IMI said.\n\nOn July 11, 1995, Bosnian Serb forces captured Srebrenica, a UN-protected area, which killed around 8,000 Muslim men and teenagers.\n\nDuring the genocide -- known as the worst in Europe since World War II-Serb forces besieged Srebrenica in an attempt to seize the area from Bosnian Muslims and Croats.\n\nIn late May, the UN passed a resolution to designate July 11 as the \"International Day of Reflection and Commemoration of the 1995 Genocide in Srebrenica.\"\n\nThe Gaza Strip is currently witnessing one of the worst wars in modern history, widely described as a genocide. Since October 7, Israel has killed at least 38,243 Palestinians, mainly women and children, while injuring 88,243 others.\n\nAccording to the UN, the war has destroyed more than 80 percent of the Strip's commercial facilities and more than 60 percent of residential buildings while displacing 1.9 million out of the 2.1 million population.\n\nA report by The Lancet on Friday found that the total death toll in the Gaza Strip, including indirect deaths, could reach 186,000, representing 8 percent of the besieged enclave's population.\n\n\"Even if the conflict ends immediately, there will continue to be many indirect deaths in the coming months and years from causes such as reproductive, communicable, and non-communicable diseases,\" the report said.\n\nThe war has been widely described as a continuation of the Nakba, or Catastrophe, in which Israel forcibly displaced and killed Palestinians to establish a Jewish state in 1948.", "source": {"uri": "dohanews.co", "dataType":

On this day, we remember the over 8,000 men and boys who were murdered in July 1995 and reaffirm our commitment to ensuring that the truth about these atrocities is revealed and justice is served.\n\nThis year also marks a significant step forward in the international community's recognition of the Srebrenica Genocide. The United Nations has adopted a resolution reaffirming the importance of remembering the victims and committing to preventing such atrocities in the future. This resolution is a testament to the enduring impact of the Srebrenica Genocide and the global commitment to upholding human rights and dignity.\n\nFourteen victims of the Srebrenica Genocide will be laid to rest this year at the Srebrenica-Poto\u010dari Memorial Center. Their identification and burial bring a measure of closure to their families, who have endured years of anguish and uncertainty. The ICMP, through its dedication and advanced forensic techniques, continues to support these families by assisting the institutions in Bosnia and Herzegovina to identify the remains of their loved ones.\n\n\"Each year, as we commemorate the Srebrenica Genocide, we are reminded of the critical importance of the work of locating the victims whose mortal remains were buried in hundreds of clandestine mass graves in and around Srebrenica, or who died in an attempt to flee execution ,\" said Kathryne Bomberger, ICMP Director General. \"Our commitment to the families of Srebrenica remains unwavering. We will continue to use the latest scientific methods to provide answers, ensure the truth is known, and seek justice for those who have suffered immeasurable loss.\"\n\nMore than 7,000 of the 8,000 victims of the Genocide have been identified, the vast majority through DNA testing. The DNA-led process has been indispensable because the perpetrators of the Srebrenica Genocide tried to hide the evidence of their crime by systematically digging up mass graves in the weeks and months after the murders and distributing the bodies of victims in secondary and tertiary clandestine graves across eastern Bosnia.\n\nOn average, seven or eight separate DNA match reports are issued for each identified victim. This is because the bones of individual victims have been found in multiple mass graves.\n\nFollowing the burials on 11 July, teams from the Missing Persons Institute of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Bosnia and Herzegovina Prosecutor's Office, and the International Commission on Missing persons (ICMP) will carry out 78 \"re-associations\". In this process, human remains that have already been identified and buried will be exhumed, and bones that have since been recovered will be restored to the skeleton; the bodies will then be reburied. In each case, the families have been contacted and asked to give their consent to the re-association. Even these bodies, in many cases, will still be incomplete.\n\nOn this day of remembrance, we once again honor the victims and stand in solidarity with their families.\n\nICMP is a treaty-based intergovernmental organization with Headquarters in The Hague, the Netherlands. Its mandate is to secure the co-operation of governments and other authorities in locating persons missing as a result of conflicts, human rights abuses, disasters, organized violence and other causes and to assist them in doing so.", "source": {"uri": "n1info.ba", "dataType": "news", "title": "N1"}, "authors": [{"uri": "n1_sarajevo@n1info.ba", "name": "N1 Sarajevo", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Commission_on_Missing_Persons", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Commission on Missing Persons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Srebrenica_massacre", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Srebrenica massacre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_grave", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mass grave"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_community", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International community"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Srebrenica", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Srebrenica"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Srebrenica"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bosnia and Herzegovina"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosnia_and_Herzegovina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bosnia and Herzegovina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bosnia and Herzegovina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Srebrenica_Genocide_Memorial", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Srebrenica Genocide Memorial"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_testing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Genetic testing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Atomic_Energy_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International Atomic Energy Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forensic_science", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Forensic science"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocide", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Genocide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Human rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missing_person", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Missing person"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_profiling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "DNA profiling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hague", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Hague"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Refugees", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Refugees", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 60}], "image": "https://n1info.ba/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/10/1720596677-image00008-1200x800.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9721305", "eventUri": "eng-9721305", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-11", "textStart": 2475, "textEnd": 2482}, {"amb": false, "date": "1995-07-", "textStart": 261, "textEnd": 270}], "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 134, "relevance": 1}

Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights, Michael O'Flaherty, emphasized the importance of remembering the victims, countering genocide denial, and preventing future atrocities in his statement ahead of the day.\n\n\"I was a United Nations human rights field officer during the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina. One of the most important tasks of my colleagues and myself was to chronicle the atrocities that were perpetrated right across the period of the conflict,\" O'Flaherty recalled.\n\nHe highlighted the horrors of the Srebrenica genocide in July 1995, where over 8,000 men were viciously murdered, and women and children faced brutal human rights violations and subsequent expulsion from the area.\n\n\"By far the most horrific of those was, of course, the genocide at Srebrenica,\" he said.\n\nO'Flaherty welcomed the UN's decision to declare an annual day of remembrance. He outlined four essential actions to be taken on this day:\n\n\"The first is that we must remember. It is essential that we recall what happened in all its detail, we never forget because it is when we forget that there is a danger that such awful things can happen again.\n\nSecond, we must honour. We must honour those who died. We must honour the victims of the abuses. We must honour their relatives and their descendants.\n\nThird, we must be outraged. We must be outraged against those who deny the fact of the genocide, or who glorify those who perpetrated it.\n\nAnd fourth, and finally, we must act. We must recommit to building societies with the thread of human rights holding them together, where acts of genocide would be inconceivable.\"", "source": {"uri": "n1info.ba", "dataType": "news", "title": "N1"}, "authors": [{"uri": "n1_sarajevo@n1info.ba", "name": "N1 Sarajevo", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Srebrenica_massacre", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Srebrenica massacre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocide_denial", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Genocide denial"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_Europe", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Council of Europe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Human rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosnian_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bosnian War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocide", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Genocide"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Human_Rights_and_Liberties", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Human Rights and Liberties", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Peace", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Peace", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://n1info.ba/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/10/1720624662-profimedia-0865565747-1200x800.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9721305", "eventUri": "eng-9721305", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-11", "textStart": 20, "textEnd": 27}, {"amb": false, "date": "1995-07-", "textStart": 713, "textEnd": 722}], "sentiment": -0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 130, "relevance": 1}

However, three days before the match, the umbrella house of European football changed its decision and ordered that the Flower of Srebrenica be covered.\n\nThe text of the statement from FK Sarajevo is transmitted in its entirety:\n\n\"Acknowledging the fact that the Conference League match against Aktobe is scheduled for July 11, FK Sarajevo planned to display the \"Flower of Srebrenica\" symbol on the jerseys in memory of the victims of the genocide in Srebrenica.\n\nIn accordance with UEFA rules, the appearance of the jersey was accepted by the Football Association of BiH, which officially reported such jersey to UEFA. In addition, on June 25, FK Sarajevo sent a special request to UEFA to allow us to use this jersey. Three days before the match, UEFA received an official response to our request, stating that we do not have permission to add this symbol to the jersey, and that the players can use black armbands. Since the jerseys were already prepared at that moment, the club informed UEFA about this, who ordered that the printed symbol be \"covered\".\n\nFK Sarajevo believes that the decision to play the match with this emblem on the jersey is in line with the broader goals of promoting human rights and respect for victims of crime. The flower of Srebrenica embodies the principles of humanity, respect and collective memory for the victims of genocide. Allowing our team to wear this emblem would be a gesture of solidarity with the victims of genocide and a message that such tragedies should never be forgotten, but also not repeated.\n\nFK Sarajevo remains faithful to the memory of the victims of the genocide in Srebrenica.

They will be buried on July 11 at a collective funeral in the cemetery of the Memorial Center.\n\nThe vehicles left this morning from Visoko, where the identification of remains found in mass graves from the last war in Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1992 - 1995 is being carried out. On the way to Poto\u010dari, a stop was organized in Sarajevo in front of the building of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Memorial of the killed children of Sarajevo, in Markale, and in front of the Town Hall.\n\nAmong the 14 victims who will be buried at the collective funeral this year, there are also two brothers and a minor.\n\nThe youngest victim to be buried this year is seventeen-year-old Beriz (Omera) Muji\u0107, born in 1978 in Zvornik.\n\nThe oldest victim to be buried is Hamed (Ibrahima) Sali\u0107, born in 1927. He was 68 years old when he disappeared in the summer of 1995 in the area of \u017depa. This year, the Efendi\u0107 brothers - Hasib and \u0106amil - will be buried together.\n\nVictims of genocide\n\nThis year, on July 11, in the cemetery of the Memorial Center Srebrenica - Poto\u010dari, the following will be buried: Hasib (Uzejir) Efendi\u0107, born in 1931, \u0106amil (Uzejir) Efendi\u0107, born in 1928, Mehmed (Daut) Krd\u017ei\u0107, born in 1961, Sabrija (Asim) Omi\u0107, born in 1966, Mu\u0161an (Ramo) \u0160iljkovi\u0107, born in 1956, Sakib (Ragib) Harba\u0161, born in 1975, Beriz (Omer) Muji\u0107, born in 1978, Ahmet (Ismet) Ja\u0161arevi\u0107, born in 1971, Nevres (Mehmed) Salihovi\u0107, born in 1970, Ibrahim (Muharem) Salki\u0107, in 1935, Midhat (Adem) Ba\u0161i\u0107, born in 1973, Hajdin (Kadrija) Mustafi\u0107, born in 1959, Latif (Arif ) Mand\u017ei\u0107, born in 1964 and Hamed (Ibrahim) Sali\u0107, born in 1927.\n\nIn the Commemorative Center in Tuzla, there are the remains of 11 more genocide victims who have been identified using the DNA method so far, but the families have not yet given their consent for burial, mainly due to the incompleteness of the bodies.\n\nThis year, after the collective funeral in Poto\u010dari, on July 15 to be exact, the re-exhumation process will begin and the remains of 78 victims will be re-exhumed this year. Their remains that were later found and identified will be added to them. Reexhumations will last until July 22.\n\nThe Poto\u010dari Memorial Center was officially opened on September 20, 2003, by the former President of the United States of America, Bill Clinton. So far, 6,751 victims of genocide have been buried in the Srebrenica - Poto\u010dari Memorial Center, while 250 victims were buried in local cemeteries by the decision of the surviving family members.\n\nGenocide victims came from different municipalities, most of them from the areas of Srebrenica, Bratunac, Vlasenica, Zvornik and Mili\u0107.\n\nGenocide victims were found in 150 different locations, of which 77 were mass graves. The youngest victim so far buried in Poto\u010dari was a newborn girl, Fatima Muhi\u0107, and the oldest was a nun, \u0160aha Izmirli\u0107, born in 1901.\n\nMore than a thousand victims of the genocide are still being searched for, Anadolu Agency writes.\n\nPhoto: AA", "source": {"uri": "sarajevotimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sarajevo Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

From June 15, 2021, to June 15, 2023, relatives of genocide victims could file for compensation. The Commission received over 8,000 applications, relating to 2,690 victims. Ultimately, 2,337 compensations were awarded for 611 victims.\n\nKada Hotic, Vice President of the Mothers of the Enclaves of Srebrenica and Zepa Association, expressed satisfaction with the outcome.\n\n\"We sued them, the Ministry of Defense and the Government of the Netherlands. We managed to prove that the Netherlands had a role in this genocide because they admitted responsibility. This is important for the state of BiH, although the money is minimal. There are still some appeals, but no more applications will be accepted,\" she said.\n\nOn July 11, 1995, when the Army of Republika Srpska (VRS) took over Srebrenica, Dutch soldiers tasked with protecting the UN-designated safe area failed to prevent the genocide. Over 7,000 men and boys were killed.\n\nIn 2019, the Dutch Supreme Court ruled that the Netherlands was responsible, to a very limited extent, for the deaths of approximately 350 victims. This applied to a group of men who were expelled from the Dutch Battalion base on the afternoon of July 13, 1995.\n\nAccording to the Supreme Court, the Dutch Battalion acted unlawfully, knowing that the male refugees from Srebrenica were in serious danger of being attacked or killed. It was estimated that if the men had been allowed to remain in the base, their chance of survival would have been small but not negligible, at about ten percent. Thus, the closest relatives of those 350 victims could hold the Netherlands responsible for ten percent of the damages they suffered.\n\nThe compensation includes payments of 15,000 euros for the spouses of the deceased and 10,000 euros for other surviving relatives -- children, siblings, and others. The total amount of payments made so far has not been disclosed. As of June 2023, approximately 12 million euros had been paid out for 1,145 approved claims.\n\nHotic received compensation for her husband but not for her son.\n\n\"But they took some ten percent estimate, which I can never understand -- is that the value of a person? A person's value is immeasurable. That's how their court ruled... Their court decided to award ten percent compensation based on some estimate of their responsibility, and among the thousand people claiming compensation, there are several family members, like the mother and children,\" she told Detektor.\n\nThe Supreme Court's ruling differentiated between refugees inside the military base and those outside.\n\n\"Their statements clearly indicate that their fate and suffering are no different from the relatives of victims who were inside the base. Statements from those who couldn't prove their relative was in the UN base all testify to horrific personal tragedies. The painful statements of women who had to watch as Bosnian Serb soldiers took away their husbands and sons. Based on the criteria of the Decree, we had to reject applications with such statements, despite our efforts to apply leniency,\" the report states.\n\n\"For my son, they said he wasn't there, that he was seen elsewhere, based on what they heard from others. But it doesn't matter; I didn't make a fuss because no one can pay for my son,\" said Hotic.\n\nAccording to the Commission, the right to compensation was extended to victims not on the original list of 350.\n\n\"Relatives had to prove that their deceased family member was in the UN base on July 13, 1995. This was generally done by submitting eyewitness statements,\" the report states.\n\nThe report acknowledges that requesting detailed eyewitness statements can be an emotional burden for both the applicant and the witness.\n\n\"The horrific events in Srebrenica have left deep scars on all survivors,\" it says, noting that the Commission was aware that rejecting a well-explained application could cause even greater pain to the relatives.\n\nWhile searching for witnesses to their relatives, many survivors have since passed away.\n\n\"It was also clear that finding witnesses more than 25 years after the Srebrenica genocide was not easy for many applicants,\" the report states.\n\nThe Commission notes that relatives who could not credibly prove their deceased family member was in the UN base felt the rejection of their applications was unjust, leading to misunderstandings and disappointment.\n\n\"Some perceived the rejection of their application as a denial of the harm done to their loved ones and a negation of their personal suffering,\" the report states.\n\nSurviving relatives could submit claims until the summer of last year.\n\nTo mitigate the possible harmful effects of granting compensation or rejecting some claims, the Commission recommended that the Dutch government provide resources for appropriate psychosocial support for surviving relatives of the victims,

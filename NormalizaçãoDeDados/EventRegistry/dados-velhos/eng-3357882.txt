in the Chicago White Sox's from-the-bottom-up rebuilding effort are starting to show why they're so highly regarded.\n\nTim Anderson hit a two-run homer to cap a four-run, seventh-inning rally, Reynaldo Lopez pitched six strong innings in his White Sox debut and Chicago won its fourth straight, 6-3 over the sliding Kansas City Royals on Friday night.\n\nAdam Engel's second triple of the game drove in the tiebreaking run in the seventh. Yolmer Sanchez had two RBIs and Kevan Smith doubled in a run as the AL-worst White Sox kept rolling following a three-game sweep of league-leading Houston.\n\n\"I feel the team chemistry,\" said Anderson, who hit his 12th homer. \"We're definitely having fun, you know, coming together as brothers and having fun with it.\"\n\nMike Moustakas belted a pair of deep solo shots -- the only runs allowed by Lopez -- to give him 34 homers, but the Royals lost their fifth straight and 10th in 12. Lopez, a 23-year-old right-hander, permitted four hits and struck out six after being recalled from Triple-A Charlotte earlier in the day.\n\n\"I was focused all the game and I was able to command all my pitches,\" Lopez said through a translator. \"I felt very, very comfortable with all my pitches.\"\n\nLopez was acquired by Chicago from Washington in December 2016 with right-handers Lucas Giolito and Dane Dunning for outfielder Adam Eaton.\n\nAaron Bummer (1-2) pitched a scoreless seventh and eighth to earn his first major league win. Kansas City starter Danny Duffy (7-8) allowed five runs and seven hits in his second straight loss.\n\nTyler Clippard got the final two outs for third save in eight chances as Kansas City scored its third run on wild pitch.\n\nThe Royals slipped back below .500 at 57-58 and are fading in the race for second AL wild-card.\n\n\"Nobody likes to go through these streaks,\" manager Ned Yost said. \"This team, over the years, has always, after a streak like this, put together a nice winning streak. That can start any day.\"\n\nMoustakas' first homer, with one out in the fourth, was the first hit Lopez allowed.\n\n\"That guy's got some good stuff and was throwing hard,\" Moustakas said. \"I was trying to make good contact and stay on something.\"\n\nThe White Sox jumped out 1-0 in the first when Smith lined a double to the left-center gap and drove in Anderson. Engel tripled off the right-center wall, then scored on Sanchez's grounder in the second to make it 2-0.\n\nAfter Moustakas cut it to 2-1 with one out in the fourth, Cheslor Cuthbert and Alcides Escobar followed with sharp singles. But following a mound conference with pitching coach Don Cooper, Lopez settled down and got the next two outs.\n\nMoustakas' second homer tied it at 2-all in the sixth.\n\nDOUBLE-TRIPLE\n\nEngel became the first White Sox player to triple twice in a game since Alejandro De Aza did it in August 2011.\n\nMINOR MOVES\n\nTo make room for Lopez, the White Sox assigned LHP David Holmberg to Charlotte. ... Chicago acquired minor league RHP Ryan Burr from the Arizona Diamondbacks on Friday for international signing bonus pool money.\n\nSTREAKING\n\nChicago INF/OF Nicky Delmonico beat out an infield hit in the fifth and has reached base safely in his first 10 games since being called up from Charlotte on Aug. 1. Delmonico, who has an eight-game hitting streak, is the first White Sox player to reach base in his first 10 games since Larry Rosenthal in 1936.\n\nTRAINER'S ROOM\n\nRoyals: RHP Trevor Cahill, placed on the 10-day on Thursday with right shoulder soreness, said he was relieved to learn there was no structural damage, but did not know how long he would be sidelined. Cahill was unable to throw for 10 days after the same injury last season. . Royals CF Lorenzo Cain hit the wall awkwardly tracking Engel's triple in the second. Cain sprawled on the warning track for a few moments, but stayed in the game.\n\nWhite Sox: OF Avisail Garcia got the day off to \"give his legs a break\" according to manager Rick Renteria. Garcia, the White Sox's lone 2017 All-Star, had played three straight games after missing 12 with a strained ligament in his right thumb.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nA pair of struggling right-handers meet when the Royals' Ian Kennedy (4-8, 4.83) faces Chicago's James Shields (2-4, 6.03) on Saturday night. Shields is 0-3 with a 8.13 ERA in six starts since his last win, on June 29. Kennedy has lost his last two starts, allowing 10 runs in 10 innings.", "time": "04:46:00"}

innings in his White Sox debut and Chicago won its fourth straight, 6-3 over the sliding Kansas City Royals on Friday night.\n\nAdam Engel's second triple of the game drove in the tiebreaking run in the seventh. Yolmer Sanchez had two RBIs and Kevan Smith doubled in a run as the AL-worst White Sox kept rolling following a three-game sweep of league-leading Houston.\n\n\"I feel the team chemistry,\" said Anderson, who hit his 12th homer. \"We're definitely having fun, you know, coming together as brothers and having fun with it.\"\n\nMike Moustakas belted a pair of deep solo shots -- the only runs allowed by Lopez -- to give him 34 homers, but the Royals lost their fifth straight and 10th in 12. Lopez, a 23-year-old right-hander, permitted four hits and struck out six after being recalled from Triple-A Charlotte earlier in the day.\n\n\"I was focused all the game and I was able to command all my pitches,\" Lopez said through a translator. \"I felt very, very comfortable with all my pitches.\"\n\nLopez was acquired by Chicago from Washington in December 2016 with right-handers Lucas Giolito and Dane Dunning for outfielder Adam Eaton.\n\nAaron Bummer (1-2) pitched a scoreless seventh and eighth to earn his first major league win. Kansas City starter Danny Duffy (7-8) allowed five runs and seven hits in his second straight loss.\n\nTyler Clippard got the final two outs for his third save in eight chances as Kansas City scored its third run on a wild pitch.\n\nThe Royals slipped back below .500 at 57-58 and are fading in the race for the second AL wild card.\n\n\"Nobody likes to go through these streaks,\" manager Ned Yost said. \"This team, over the years, has always, after a streak like this, put together a nice winning streak. That can start any day.\"\n\nMoustakas' first homer, with one out in the fourth, was the first hit Lopez allowed.\n\n\"That guy's got some good stuff and was throwing hard,\" Moustakas said. \"I was trying to make good contact and stay on something.\"\n\nThe White Sox jumped out 1-0 in the first when Smith lined a double to the left-center gap and drove in Anderson. Engel tripled off the right-center wall, then scored on Sanchez's grounder in the second to make it 2-0.\n\nAfter Moustakas cut it to 2-1 with one out in the fourth, Cheslor Cuthbert and Alcides Escobar followed with sharp singles. But following a mound conference with pitching coach Don Cooper, Lopez settled down and got the next two outs.\n\nMoustakas' second homer tied it at 2-all in the sixth.\n\nDanny Duffy: \"There's no lack of fire in this clubhouse.

Cahill was unable to throw for 10 days after the same injury last season. ... Royals CF Lorenzo Cain hit the wall awkwardly tracking Engel's triple in the second. Cain sprawled on the warning track for a few moments, but stayed in the game.\n\nWhite Sox: OF Avisail Garcia got the day off to \"give his legs a break,\" according to manager Rick Renteria.

"body": "CHICAGO (AP) -- Tim Anderson hit a two-run homer to cap a four-run, seventh-inning rally, Reynaldo Lopez pitched six strong innings in his White Sox debut and Chicago won its fourth straight, 6-3 over the sliding Kansas City Royals on Friday night.\n\nMike Moustakas belted a pair of deep solo shots to give him 34 homers, but the Royals lost their fifth straight and 10th in 12.\n\nAdam Engel's second triple of the game drove in the tiebreaking run in the seventh. Yolmer Sanchez had two RBIs and Kevan Smith doubled in a run as the AL-worst White Sox kept rolling following a three-game sweep of league-leading Houston.\n\nAaron Bummer (1-2) pitched a scoreless seventh and eighth to earn his first major league win. Kansas City starter Danny Duffy (7-8) allowed five runs and seven hits in his second straight loss.\n\nTyler Clippard got the final two outs for third save in eight chances as Kansas City scored its third run on wild pitch.\n\nLopez allowed two runs -- both on Moustakas' homers. The 23-year-old right-hander, one of rebuilding Chicago's prized prospects, permitted four hits and struck out six after being recalled from Triple-A Charlotte earlier in the day.\n\nThe 23-year-old Lopez was acquired by Chicago from Washington in December 2016 with right-handers Lucas Giolito and Dane Dunning for outfielder Adam Eaton.\n\nMoustakas' first homer, with one out in the fourth, was the first hit off Lopez.\n\nThe White Sox jumped out 1-0 in the first when Smith lined a double to the left-center gap and drove in Anderson. Engel tripled off the right-center wall, then scored on Sanchez's grounder in the second to make it 2-0.\n\nAfter Moustakas cut it to 2-1 with one out in the fourth, Cheslor Cuthbert and Alcides Escobar followed with sharp singles. But following a mound conference with pitching coach Don Cooper, Lopez settled down and got the next two outs.\n\nMoustakas' second homer tied it at 2-all in the sixth.\n\nDOUBLE-TRIPLE\n\nEngel became the first White Sox player to triple twice in a game since Alejandro De Aza did it in August 2011.\n\nMINOR MOVES\n\nGet the latest sports news and scores sent to your email inbox Sign Up! I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site consitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.\n\nTo make room for Lopez, the White Sox assigned LHP David Holmberg to Charlotte. . Chicago acquired minor league RHP Ryan Burr from the Arizona Diamondbacks on Friday for international signing bonus pool money.\n\nSTREAKING\n\nChicago INF/OF Nicky Delmonico beat out an infield hit in the fifth and has reached base safely in his first 10 games since being called up from Charlotte on Aug. 1. Delmonico, who has an eight-game hitting streak, is the first White Sox player to reach base in his first 10 games since Larry Rosenthal in 1936.\n\nTRAINER'S ROOM\n\nRoyals: RHP Trevor Cahill, placed on the 10-day on Thursday with right shoulder soreness, said he was relieved to learn there was no structural damage, but did not know how long he would be sidelined. Cahill was unable to throw for 10 days after the same injury last season. . Royals CF Lorenzo Cain hit the wall awkwardly tracking Engel's triple in the second. Cain sprawled on the warning track for a few moments, but stayed in the game.\n\nWhite Sox: OF Avisail Garcia got the day off to \"give his legs a break\" according to manager Rick Renteria. Garcia, the White Sox's lone 2017 All-Star, had played three straight games after missing 12 with a strained ligament in his right thumb.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nA pair of struggling right-handers meet when the Royals' Ian Kennedy (4-8, 4.83) faces Chicago's James Shields (2-4, 6.03) on Saturday night. Shields is 0-3 with a 8.13 ERA in six starts since his last win, on June 29. Kennedy has lost his last two starts, allowing 10 runs in 10 innings.", "time": "03:55:00"}

When the series began the Cards were 55-56, a losing team, so getting swept in a series of poorly-played games hurts more than it might otherwise.\n\nHere's why:\n\nGenerally speaking, you don't build your record by beating teams with a winning record; you build your record by beating teams with a losing record.\n\nThe Royals have 10 games left with the Cleveland Indians and since they're games within the division they matter a lot and will get a lot of attention. But if the Royals go 5-5 in those games, they might not be all that unhappy.\n\nIf they split the Cleveland series the Royals wouldn't gain ground, but they wouldn't lose ground either.\n\nThe Royals need to build their record by beating up on teams that have scuffled.\n\nSo in the players' minds, this White Sox series is big; the Sox are 44-68 and the Royals need to sweep or take at least two out of three. Same goes for the Tigers (52-62), Blue Jays (54-60) and Athletics (50-65).\n\nTalk to players and coaches about a big series and they'll say you have to win them all, but you sure don't want a scuffling team to beat you because you were so focused on the previous series or a series that's coming up.\n\nGetting swept in the I-70 Series hurt more than usual because the Cardinals presented an opportunity for the Royals to build their record and the Royals lost all four games. Now the Cardinals are no longer a team with a losing record.\n\nWhen the Royals are behind after the first inning, their record is 7-14. When their opponent scores first, the Royals are 27-34.\n\nWhy are those early innings so important?\n\nTake a look at the four-game series against the Cardinals: in Game 1 the Royals were down 7-1 after the top of the fourth, in Game 2 the Royals were down 7-3 after the top of the fifth and in Game 3 the Royals were down 8-5 after six innings.\n\nWhen the Royals are playing well they're an aggressive team; they steal bases, drop down bunts and go first-to-third or second-to-home. But if the Royals get down by multiple runs, it shuts down their aggressiveness.\n\nYou don't risk getting a base runner thrown out when you're down by six runs and other teams know that.\n\nSo when the Royals are down by multiple runs, opposing pitchers don't have to worry about throwing out of the slide step, middle infielders don't have to hug second base to make sure they can cover second on a stolen base, catchers don't have to call fastballs to throw out runners and outfielders don't have to rush their throws trying to prevent runners from taking an extra base.\n\nA big part of the Royals offense is getting the ball in play and running the bases aggressively; that puts pressure on the other team and Royals fans know how often their team capitalizes on an opponent's mistakes.\n\nBut if the Royals get down by multiple runs early in the game, they're much less aggressive on the base paths; they have to get back in the game by swinging the bats and for a team ninth in team batting average, ninth in slugging percentage and dead last in on-base-percentage that can be difficult.\n\nWhen the Royals get blown out, as they were two times in the Cardinals series, they look especially dead on offense because, even though they're hitting more home runs this season, they're still not designed to score runs in bunches. They're at their best when playing low-scoring games.\n\nWhen the Royals allow four runs or fewer, their record is 48-12; when the Royals allow five runs or more, their record is 9-45.\n\nAfter Thursday night's loss to the Cardinals some of the Royals players and coaches were left shaking their heads; how in the world did we let that happen?\n\nBut hope springs eternal.\n\nAs he headed to the showers, coach Mike Jirschele said: \"OK, we'll get it started in Chicago.\" But if the Royals are going to take advantage of the White Sox, it would help if they get some decent starts out of their rotation, keep the scores low, grab some early leads and play their kind of game.\n\nThe Sox haven't been very good this season, so it's a big series.", "time": "16:16:00"}

"CHICAGO (AP) -- Tim Anderson hit a two-run homer to cap a four-run, seventh-inning rally, Reynaldo Lopez pitched six strong innings in his White Sox debut and Chicago won its fourth straight, 6-3 over the sliding Kansas City Royals on Friday night.\n\nMike Moustakas belted a pair of deep solo shots to give him 34 homers, but the Royals lost their fifth straight and 10th in 12.\n\nAdam Engel's second triple of the game drove in the tiebreaking run in the seventh. Yolmer Sanchez had two RBIs and Kevan Smith doubled in a run as the AL-worst White Sox kept rolling following a three-game sweep of league-leading Houston.\n\nAaron Bummer (1-2) pitched a scoreless seventh and eighth to earn his first major league win. Kansas City starter Danny Duffy (7-8) allowed five runs and seven hits in his second straight loss.\n\nTyler Clippard got the final two outs for third save in eight chances as Kansas City scored its third run on wild pitch.\n\nLopez allowed two runs -- both on Moustakas' homers. The 23-year-old right-hander, one of rebuilding Chicago's prized prospects, permitted four hits and struck out six after being recalled from Triple-A Charlotte earlier in the day.\n\nThe 23-year-old Lopez was acquired by Chicago from Washington in December 2016 with right-handers Lucas Giolito and Dane Dunning for outfielder Adam Eaton.\n\nMoustakas' first homer, with one out in the fourth, was the first hit off Lopez.\n\nThe White Sox jumped out 1-0 in the first when Smith lined a double to the left-center gap and drove in Anderson. Engel tripled off the right-center wall, then scored on Sanchez's grounder in the second to make it 2-0.\n\nAfter Moustakas cut it to 2-1 with one out in the fourth, Cheslor Cuthbert and Alcides Escobar followed with sharp singles. But following a mound conference with pitching coach Don Cooper, Lopez settled down and got the next two outs.\n\nMoustakas' second homer tied it at 2-all in the sixth.\n\nDOUBLE-TRIPLE\n\nEngel became the first White Sox player to triple twice in a game since Alejandro De Aza did it in August 2011.\n\nMINOR MOVES\n\nTo make room for Lopez, the White Sox assigned LHP David Holmberg to Charlotte. . Chicago acquired minor league RHP Ryan Burr from the Arizona Diamondbacks on Friday for international signing bonus pool money.\n\nSTREAKING\n\nChicago INF/OF Nicky Delmonico beat out an infield hit in the fifth and has reached base safely in his first 10 games since being called up from Charlotte on Aug. 1. Delmonico, who has an eight-game hitting streak, is the first White Sox player to reach base in his first 10 games since Larry Rosenthal in 1936.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nA pair of struggling right-handers meet when the Royals' Ian Kennedy (4-8, 4.83) faces Chicago's James Shields (2-4, 6.03) on Saturday night. Shields is 0-3 with a 8.13 ERA in six starts since his last win, on June 29. Kennedy has lost his last two starts, allowing 10 runs in 10 innings.", "time": "05:17:00"}

games remain this season between the slumping but contending Kansas City Royals and the rebuilding Chicago White Sox, beginning with Saturday's meeting at Guaranteed Rate Field.\n\nThe Royals realize as much. They also know Chicago's organizational status guarantees no advantage in Kansas City's bid for an American League playoff berth.\n\n\"No, no, no. We are the furthest thing away from taking an opponent lightly,\" Royals catcher Drew Butera said. \"They're playing really well right now. They swept Houston, right? Just because they're rebuilding doesn't mean they're a bad team. They've got a lot of talent over there, and we're not going to go in thinking we're going to come in and be easy wins.\"\n\nWhite Sox right-hander Chris Beck called Chicago's three-game sweep of American League West-leading Houston this week a \"nice little uplift, for sure.\" The vibes continued during Friday's series opener between the White Sox and Royals, with Chicago winning 6-3 behind a four-run, seventh-inning rally and a solid team debut from right-hander Reynaldo Lopez.\n\nChicago delivered sound starting pitching, slick defense and timely hitting against the Royals and during the Houstonseries, which culminated with a walk-off, extra-inning hit from prized prospect Yoan Moncada to win Thursday's series finale.\n\nWas it a potential preview of coming attractions for the White Sox in future seasons? Perhaps. For his part, though, Beck has seen the team transition to a more consistent brand of baseball well before Houston came calling. Even suffering a four-game road sweep against American League East leader Boston last weekend offered bright spots to Beck entering the Astros series.\n\n\"We're not that far off from where we want to be,\" Beck said. \"Each team is capable of winning. We stood toe-to-toe and swept one of the best lineups in baseball. We'll get to go there again in September, so, I mean, it'll be fun.\"\n\nChicago's visit to Houston from Sept. 19-21 precedes a three-game home series against the Royals from Sept. 22-24. The White Sox and Royals also are set to play in Kansas City from Sept. 11-13.\n\nBut first things first. On Saturday, White Sox right-hander James Shields (2-4, 6.03 ERA) will face Royals right-hander Ian Kennedy (4-8, 4.83 ERA).\n\nShields is 7-2 with a 4.02 ERA in 12 career starts against the Royals, with 65 strikeouts in 80 2/3 innings. Shields spent the 2013 and 2014 seasons with Kansas City, winning 27 regular-season games while helping the club to the American League pennant in 2014.\n\nKennedy is 2-2 with a 4.70 ERA in seven career starts against the White Sox, with 31 strikeouts and seven home runs allowed in 38 1/3 innings.\n\nDespite losing five in a row and 10 of their past 12 games overall, the Royals remain in the hunt in the jumbled AL Central and wild-card races. Success against the White Sox figures to be pivotal during the stretch run.\n\nIt starts with ignoring the same standings Kansas City is trying to climb -- at least to a degree.\n\n\"Oh, yeah. You don't take any team for granted, you know, because once you start taking teams for granted, that's when they sneak up on you and you lose games,\" Royals center fielder Lorenzo Cain said. \"We're all big-league ballplayers. We all respect each other.\"", "time": "15:24:00"}

Scott Alexander gave up a two-run single and the lead; if anyone thought, \"Here we go again,\" it was understandable.\n\nBut in the top of the eighth inning Melky Cabrera hit a two-run homer and gave the lead back to the Royals.\n\nJoakim Soria pitched a scoreless bottom of the eighth, Kelvin Herrera did the same in the ninth and the Royals broke their five-game losing streak.\n\nSaturday night's comeback win should serve as a reminder: It's a mistake to give up on this team too soon.\n\nHaven't the Royals earned some loyalty?\n\nOn Saturday morning I wrote that the Royals had played some sloppy baseball and their recent losing streak was not entirely due to bad luck. At least a couple readers took what I said and went even further; they said it was time to give up on this team.\n\nI've never understood the pride some fans seem to take in being the first to give up.\n\nI assume it's because those fans expect the worst and, when their team performs poorly, it's their chance to say they were right.\n\nBut all teams, even champions, go through bad times.\n\nThe 2014 American League Champion Royals had one five-game losing streak, four four-game losing streaks, were down 7-3 going into the eighth inning of that year's Wild Card Game and still made it to Game 7 of the World Series.\n\nIn 2015 the Royals were facing elimination in the American League Division Series, down 6-2 to the Astros headed into the eighth inning of Game 4, and still came back and won that that game and that series.\n\nIn the American League Champion Series against the Blue Jays, the Royals were down 3-0 going into the seventh inning of Game 2 and still came back and won that game and that series.\n\nIn Game 1 of the World Series against the Mets the Royals were down 4-3 going into the bottom of the ninth and still came back and won that game.\n\nIn Game 4, the Royals were down 3-2 going into the eighth inning and still came back and won that game.\n\nIn Game 5, the Royals were down 2-0 going into the ninth inning and still came back and won that game and that series.\n\nNone of that means the 2017 Royals will do the same thing, but it does mean the Royals have shown us time and time again that we shouldn't give up on this team too soon.\n\nThe 2017 Royals still have their core players\n\nIf you're thinking this team isn't the same team that won the World Series, in many ways you're right.\n\nLook at the list of Royals pitchers that appeared in the 2015 postseason, and the only two pitchers still on the staff are Danny Duffy and Kelvin Herrera. (Jason Vargas and Scott Alexander pitched during the regular season but did not pitch in the postseason.)\n\nBut look at the position players who appeared in the 2015 postseason, and the 2017 Royals have the same core: Lorenzo Cain, Eric Hosmer, Mike Moustakas, Alex Gordon, Salvador Perez, Alcides Escobar and Drew Butera. The Royals' manager and coaching staff are still around, and the same goes for much of the Royals' front office.\n\nThat's an awful lot of guys who own a World Series ring.\n\nDuring this recent Royals losing a streak, a scout from another team said if the Royals make the postseason they'd be worrisome because it's a team that's \"battle-tested.\"\n\nThe Royals have been on the big stage and know what it takes to win once they get there.\n\nBeing a fan doesn't mean you can't be critical\n\nIf you have kids, you understand: Just because you refuse to turn a blind eye to their faults, it doesn't mean you don't love them.\n\nYou can be critical, but when push comes to shove, you're still in their corner.\n\nIn the Royals' five-game losing streak, they played sloppy baseball: walks, errors and mental mistakes and their fans don't have to ignore that.\n\nIt's OK to be critical, but good fans - and good parents - don't give up and walk away.\n\nOn Saturday the Royals won, in part, because they only walked two batters, made no errors and had at least five outstanding plays on defense. The Royals got back to playing good baseball and looked like the team their fans have come to love.\n\nAnd once again the Royals reminded all of us, that even though they have their problems, giving up on this team too soon is a mistake.", "time": "17:28:00"}

missing.\n\nCabrera hit a go-ahead, two-run homer against his former team in the eighth inning, and the Kansas City Royals beat the White Sox 5-4 Saturday night to stop a five-game losing streak.\n\nCabrera, acquired from the White Sox on July 30, homered with one out off Aaron Bummer (1-3) and drove in Lorenzo Cain, who led off the inning with a walk against Chris Beck. Cabrera has an eight-game hitting streak.\n\n\"These kind of wins are wins that help you stop the bleeding,\" Royals manager Ned Yost said. \"I was sitting there thinking about this group. What do you tell them? They're not pressing. They're competing their tails off. All you can tell them is, 'Hang in there, keep battling, it is going to get better.' And a win like this does a lot for their spirits.\"\n\nCabrera fell behind 1-2 in the count and homered on the ninth pitch, his third home run since the trade and 16th this season. He extended his hitting streak to eight games.\n\n\"I am grateful to Ned for playing me every day,\" Cabrera said through a translator.\n\nScott Alexander (3-3) won after allowing a two-run, two-out single in the seventh to Leury Garcia that put Chicago ahead 4-3.\n\nJoakim Soria pitched a perfect eighth, and Kelvin Herrera worked around a walk in a hitless-but-eventful ninth for his 25th save in 28 chances.\n\nAfter pinch-runner Tyler Saladino stole second, third baseman Mike Moustakas made a diving stop on Adam Engel's grounder and threw to first for the final out, ending Chicago's four-game winning streak.\n\n\"I was trying to keep in the infield to make sure a run doesn't score but I got a pretty good read on the hop so I was able to make a play on it,\" Moustakas said. \"We know how good we can be and we know we weren't playing good baseball.\"\n\nWhite Sox starter James Shields struck out a season-high eight in six innings, allowing three runs and seven hits.\n\nJose Abreu hit a pair of solo home runs against Ian Kennedy, who gave up three runs and seven hits in 6 1/3 innings. Abreu became the first White Sox player to reach 20 homers in each of his first four seasons.\n\n\"Good pitches, bad pitches, he hits them,\" Kennedy said.\n\nSTREAKING\n\nNicky Delmonico singled in the second, becoming the first player to reach base in his first 11 games with the White Sox. He is batting .366 (15 for 41) and has a nine-game hitting streak.\n\nTRAINER'S ROOM\n\nRoyals: C Salvador Perez (strained right intercostal muscle) threw from 120 feet for about 10 minutes before the game and could hit off a tee next week. The Royals have lost six of seven since he got hurt and are 4-12 when he doesn't start.\n\nWhite Sox: 3B Matt Davidson (bruised wrist) may not be ready to be activated from the 10-day DL when he becomes eligible Tuesday, according to manager Rick Renteria said.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nJason Vargas (13-6) starts for the Royals on Sunday against fellow left-hander Derek Holland (6-11) in the finale of the three-game series. Vargas is 1-3 with a 6.94 ERA since the All-Star break. Holland survived seven walks against Houston on Tuesday for his first win since June 13.\n\n___\n\nMore AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball", "time": "09:35:00"}

former team in the eighth inning, and the Kansas City Royals beat the White Sox 5-4 Saturday night to stop a five-game losing streak.\n\nCabrera, acquired from the White Sox on July 30, homered with one out off Aaron Bummer (1-3) and drove in Lorenzo Cain, who led off the inning with a walk against Chris Beck. Cabrera has an eight-game hitting streak.\n\n\"These kind of wins are wins that help you stop the bleeding,\" Royals manager Ned Yost said. \"I was sitting there thinking about this group. What do you tell them? They're not pressing. They're competing their tails off. All you can tell them is, 'Hang in there, keep battling, it is going to get better.' And a win like this does a lot for their spirits.\"\n\nCabrera fell behind 1-2 in the count and homered on the ninth pitch, his third home run since the trade and 16th this season. He extended his hitting streak to eight games.\n\n\"I am grateful to Ned for playing me every day,\" Cabrera said through a translator.\n\nScott Alexander (3-3) won after allowing a two-run, two-out single in the seventh to Leury Garcia that put Chicago ahead 4-3.\n\nJoakim Soria pitched a perfect eighth, and Kelvin Herrera worked around a walk in a hitless-but-eventful ninth for his 25th save in 28 chances.\n\nAfter pinch-runner Tyler Saladino stole second, third baseman Mike Moustakas made a diving stop on Adam Engel's grounder and threw to first for the final out, ending Chicago's four-game winning streak.\n\n\"I was trying to keep in the infield to make sure a run doesn't score but I got a pretty good read on the hop so I was able to make a play on it,\" Moustakas said. \"We know how good we can be and we know we weren't playing good baseball.\"\n\nWhite Sox starter James Shields struck out a season-high eight in six innings, allowing three runs and seven hits.\n\nJose Abreu hit a pair of solo home runs against Ian Kennedy, who gave up three runs and seven hits in 6 1/3 innings. Abreu became the first White Sox player to reach 20 homers in each of his first four seasons.\n\n\"Good pitches, bad pitches, he hits them,\" Kennedy said.\n\nSTREAKING\n\nNicky Delmonico singled in the second, becoming the first player to reach base in his first 11 games with the White Sox. He is batting .366 (15 for 41) and has a nine-game hitting streak.\n\nTRAINER'S ROOM\n\nRoyals: C Salvador Perez (strained right intercostal muscle) threw from 120 feet for about 10 minutes before the game and could hit off a tee next week. The Royals have lost six of seven since he got hurt and are 4-12 when he doesn't start.\n\nWhite Sox: 3B Matt Davidson (bruised wrist) may not be ready to be activated from the 10-day DL when he becomes eligible Tuesday, according to manager Rick Renteria said.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nJason Vargas (13-6) starts for the Royals on Sunday against fellow left-hander Derek Holland (6-11) in the finale of the three-game series. Vargas is 1-3 with a 6.94 ERA since the All-Star break. Holland survived seven walks against Houston on Tuesday for his first win since June 13.", "time": "08:20:00"}

slumping but contending Kansas City Royals and the rebuilding Chicago White Sox, beginning with Saturday's meeting at Guaranteed Rate Field.\n\nThe Royals realize as much. They also know Chicago's organizational status guarantees no advantage in Kansas City's bid for an American League playoff berth.\n\n\"No, no, no. We are the furthest thing away from taking an opponent lightly,\" Royals catcher Drew Butera said. \"They're playing really well right now. They swept Houston, right? Just because they're rebuilding doesn't mean they're a bad team. They've got a lot of talent over there, and we're not going to go in thinking we're going to come in and be easy wins.\"\n\nWhite Sox right-hander Chris Beck called Chicago's three-game sweep of American League West-leading Houston this week a \"nice little uplift, for sure.\" The vibes continued during Friday's series opener between the White Sox and Royals, with Chicago winning 6-3 behind a four-run, seventh-inning rally and a solid team debut from right-hander Reynaldo Lopez.\n\nChicago delivered sound starting pitching, slick defense and timely hitting against the Royals and during the Houston series, which culminated with a walk-off, extra-inning hit from prized prospect Yoan Moncada to win Thursday's series finale.\n\nWas it a potential preview of coming attractions for the White Sox in future seasons? Perhaps. For his part, though, Beck has seen the team transition to a more consistent brand of baseball well before Houston came calling. Even suffering a four-game road sweep against American League East leader Boston last weekend offered bright spots to Beck entering the Astros series.\n\n\"We're not that far off from where we want to be,\" Beck said. \"Each team is capable of winning. We stood toe-to-toe and swept one of the best lineups in baseball. We'll get to go there again in September, so, I mean, it'll be fun.\"\n\nChicago's visit to Houston from Sept. 19-21 precedes a three-game home series against the Royals from Sept. 22-24. The White Sox and Royals also are set to play in Kansas City from Sept. 11-13.\n\nBut first things first. On Saturday, White Sox right-hander James Shields (2-4, 6.03 ERA) will face Royals right-hander Ian Kennedy (4-8, 4.83 ERA).\n\nShields is 7-2 with a 4.02 ERA in 12 career starts against the Royals, with 65 strikeouts in 80 2/3 innings. Shields spent the 2013 and 2014 seasons with Kansas City, winning 27 regular-season games while helping the club to the American League pennant in 2014.\n\nKennedy is 2-2 with a 4.70 ERA in seven career starts against the White Sox, with 31 strikeouts and seven home runs allowed in 38 1/3 innings.\n\nDespite losing five in a row and 10 of their past 12 games overall, the Royals remain in the hunt in the jumbled AL Central and wild-card races. Success against the White Sox figures to be pivotal during the stretch run.\n\nIt starts with ignoring the same standings Kansas City is trying to climb -- at least to a degree.\n\n\"Oh, yeah. You don't take any team for granted, you know, because once you start taking teams for granted, that's when they sneak up on you and you lose games,\" Royals center fielder Lorenzo Cain said. \"We're all big-league ballplayers. We all respect each other.\"", "time": "13:34:00"}

dazzling team debut from right-hander Reynaldo Lopez boosted the Chicago White Sox to a 6-3 victory against the Kansas City Royals on Friday night.\n\nWhite Sox center fielder Adam Engel broke a tie with an RBI triple in the seventh inning and scored with a headfirst slide on Yolmer Sanchez's sacrifice bunt one batter later. Tim Anderson added a two-run home run later in the inning to provide the final margin for the White Sox (45-68), who won their fourth straight game.\n\nStill contending but sliding in a jumbled American League Central and wild-card race, Kansas City (57-58) lost its fifth straight and 10th time 12 games to fall under .500 for the first time since July 19.\n\nRecalled from Triple-A Charlotte before the game, Lopez spaced two runs and four hits in six innings in his White Sox debut. He struck out six, walked three, and threw 68 of his 102 pitches for strikes in a no-decision. Lopez and fellow right-handers Dane Dunning and Lucas Giolito joined Chicago from the Washington Nationals in a December 2016 trade for Adam Eaton.\n\nRoyals left-hander Danny Duffy lost to the White Sox for the third time this season. Duffy fell to 7-8 after allowing five runs and seven hits in 6 1/3 innings, striking out eight and walking zero.\n\nWhite Sox left-hander Aaron Bummer (1-2) earned his first major league win, striking out two in two innings of one-hit relief.\n\nThe White Sox took a 1-0 lead in the bottom of the first inning, as catcher Kevan Smith doubled to the gap in left-center field to score Anderson from first base. Chicago built on its lead one inning later behind a run-scoring groundout from Sanchez.\n\nDesignated hitter Mike Moustakas opened the scoring for the Royals with a solo home run against Lopez with one out in the fourth inning. He added a solo shot in the sixth inning, his 34th of the season.\n\nThe Royals scored on a wild pitch in the ninth inning, but Tyler Clippard recorded the final two outs to earn his third save of the season.\n\nAnderson and Engel both had two hits for the White Sox. Alcides Escobar and Moustakas had two hits for the Royals.\n\nNOTES: Moutakas delivered his third multi-home run game of the season and seventh of his career. His most recent came on July 22 against the White Sox. ... Royals starters have allowed 24 runs in 22 1/3 innings in the past five games. ... The White Sox recognized Royals RF Melky Cabrera with a video tribute before the second inning. Chicago traded Cabrera, with the White Sox since 2015, to Kansas City on July 30. Fans offered Cabrera a warm ovation when lineups were announced.", "time": "04:10:00"}

They were easily the worst playing conditions the team has faced all season.\n\nThe Royals started off very slowly. Their opponent, the Quest Kermodes, whom the Royals beat 3-1 in the season opener, took an early lead and finished the half ahead 1-0. Despite the downpour, captain Mohammed Ali hyped the team up for the second half to play through the adversity. Twenty-five minutes into the second half, the Royals found their equalizer to knot things up at 1-1; this was a momentum changer. From that point on, the Royals wouldn't even allow their opponent an opportunity on goal.\n\nShortly after, the Royals had several attempts but couldn't finish. Some of the rookies were having difficulty executing the plays Coach Paul Bahia had implemented. Bahia told the Royals that before a score he wanted three players to assist in the play: two passes and a goal. With 15 minutes left in the game, the Royals put all their hard work at practice into action. Quest was getting rattled; they were called for numerous fouls back-to-back and the Royals were getting into their heads. Rookie Dorian Colopisis broke the deadlock with nine minutes left to put the Royals up 2-1 when he found a gap between two defenders. Seemingly immediately after, the Royals scored again, only to see it be called by the referee.\n\nWith only a few minutes remaining, it was obvious the team was starting to click. Fifth-year Javid Khan made a glorious between-the-legs, no-look pass to his rookie teammate Illias (Louie) Bocolas to score the final goal of the game. When the final whistle blew, the scoreline was once again 3-1 for the Royals -- good enough for their third consecutive victory. The win pushed the team's record to 4-1-2.\n\nCoach Bahia briefly discussed the game: \"I think the guys showed a lot of heart. We haven't played in weather like this at all this year. You have to be mentally tough, and they demonstrated that. We were off to a very slow start being down at the end of half but we fought back and won.\"", "time": "14:51:00"}

register with most Royals fans, because it doesn't with players and team officials.\n\nBut refer to the Royals' 4-2 victory over the Cardinals on May 30, 2013 as the \"rain delay game in St. Louis,\" and there is instant recognition, if for no other reason than it didn't end until after 3 a.m.\n\nThere was much more to the game, which proved to be a turning point in a season that had gone sour.\n\nIn 2013, the Royals' young core was expected to turn the page on nearly two decades of history of bad baseball and become a contender. The Royals made a huge trade during the offseason, acquiring pitcher James Shields in the hopes he would give the team the veteran leadership it needed to win.\n\nInstead, the Royals entered that game in St. Louis having lost 12 of 13 games, including six straight at home, and their record had crashed to 21-29. In 10 of those games, the Royals scored three or fewer runs. After starting the month of May in first place in the American League Central, the Royals plummeted to last as they headed into the finale of a four-game home-and-home series with the Cardinals in St. Louis.\n\nThe pitching matchup that night featured Royals right-hander Jeremy Guthrie and the Cardinals' Michael Wacha, who was making his big-league debut less than a year after being drafted out of Texas A&M.\n\nRain was in the forecast and there was some question about whether the game would be played. But before first pitch, there was a thunderbolt of news.\n\nSixty-year-old Hall of Famer George Brett was returning to active duty as one of two Royals hitting coaches. Pedro Grifol joined Brett as interim replacements for Jack Maloof and Andre David, who were reassigned to roles in the minor-league organization.\n\nThat was just part of what would be a memorable evening. Here is how it is remembered by those who were there.\n\nRoyals first baseman Eric Hosmer: \"Any time you're part of the offense and the hitting coach gets fired, you're not feeling too good about yourself. We were disappointed about that. But at the same time, I think there was a lot of excitement that was brewing up, because George was taking over. I think we realized that had his interest in helping us and we were pumped by that.\"\n\nFormer Kansas City Star reporter Bob Dutton: \"It was all sorts of a mess. You knew they were going to do something. It was a team that had expectations, but they certainly weren't hitting and they were under-performing. I can remember being in the lunch room where they held a news conference to say George was taking over. George was very careful in saying it was an open-ended thing. He would see how far it would go. He sort of had to be talked into it. There was a panicked feel around the team at that time. This was a team that wasn't working. And, heck, how much longer were those guys in the front office going to get? If this group didn't click, they weren't going to get the chance to rebuild again.\"\n\nFormer Royals pitcher Jeremy Guthrie: \"It was a surprise to me, I don't know about the hitters. I had seen George around and just never considered or thought about him being in the dugout and being a coach. As well as he got along with everybody, it made perfect sense when it was announced. All of a sudden to have the likes of George on the team and in the clubhouse and working with the players daily instead of in the more general, advisory role was exciting.\"\n\nRoyals announcer Ryan Lefebvre: \"I'd only been around George as a Royals ambassador and helping out in spring training, but I just remember thinking, boy he looks great at podium in that press conference and just answered the questions perfectly and with charisma. I remember thinking to myself, 'Wow, this is a great idea. This is a great fit.' ... I thought for a group of young guys who are kind of struggling to find their way at the big-league level, this might be a perfect guy for them.\"\n\nThere was a one-hour rain delay before the game started at 8:15 p.m. The Cardinals got a leadoff double in the first inning, and three straight two-out singles staked them to 2-0 lead. Wacha retired the first 13 Royals batters he faced before Lorenzo Cain doubled and scored on a single by Elliot Johnson.\n\nLefebvre: \"I think Michael Wacha was making his major-league debut and I want to say that he pitched better against the Royals that night than he did against KU the year before.\"\n\nIt remained a 2-1 advantage for the Cardinals, and the big question was whether the rain, which radar showed was descending on Busch Stadium, would arrive before the final out.\n\nDutton: \"You could see it was coming. Up until the ninth inning, well, you thought they are going to lose. It was 2-1, and you could see it was coming.\"\n\nBut in the ninth inning, Jeff Francoeur pinch hit for Tim Collins and lined an 0-1 pitch from Mitchell Boggs into the left-field stands. Alex Gordon drew a walk and Victor Marte entered the game. Alcides Escobar was hit by a pitch, and David Lough's bunt was mishandled for an error, loading the bases.\n\nHosmer then hit a two-run double that gave the Royals a 4-2 lead.\n\nHosmer: \"We had a couple of big hits late and then a long delay.\"\n\nYost: \"You kept looking at the radar. We had taken the lead but because St. Louis hadn't hit, if the game was going to be rained out, we were going to lose, and we were really struggling at that point.\"\n\nAfter an intentional walk to Chris Getz, the rain hit, and the game was delayed for 4 hours and 32 minutes.\n\nHosmer: \"About an hour and a half into the rain delay we found out that if we didn't continue with the game, we were going to lose because it was going to revert back to the previous inning. At that point, there was a lot of talk in the locker room: 'We've got to find a way to finish this game' (and) 'There's no way they can do that.' \"\n\nThe crew chief that night was Joe West, whose nickname is \"Country Joe\" because he has has dabbled in music. That includes his album \"Blue Cowboy.\"\n\nYost: \"What was funny was Joe would come in the locker room and guys were scrambling, trying to find the Joe West CD to put on, trying to buy it on iTunes so that they could be blaring it in the locker room every time Joe came in. But nobody could find it.\"\n\nGuthrie: \"I remember going through the scenarios with the coaches and Ned and Dave Eiland as to what was going to happen if the game it was called. I felt like there either was some sort of pushing or prodding from the Cardinals side toward Joe West telling him to call it and then it was almost like Joe became an ally of ours.\"\n\nYost: \"The grounds-crew guy was really dragging his feet trying to do everything he could to make sure that we couldn't get back on the field. He told Joe West, 'Look it's not going to stop raining.' Joe came in my office and said, 'Look, I'm going to have to call this, it's not going to stop raining.' Joe didn't know that I'm a phenomenal meteorologist and I got on the computer and said, 'Look, that guy is lying. It's fixing to stop in five minutes.' Joe looked at that radar and went back out and said, 'We're staying here, I don't care how long.' \"\n\nRoyals vice president of communications and broadcasting Mike Swanson: \"I was in Ned's office and Joe saw what Ned saw and said, 'We're playing baseball. Let's go.' \"\n\nThe rain finally relented, but with that much weather, meant the grounds grew had its work cut out. Not that they were in a hurry to get the field ready. Guthrie, Francoeur and Alex Gordon grabbed bags of Turface and brought them to the diamond to dry the infield dirt.\n\nDutton: \"It's so hard to describe how slow the Cardinals were moving to get the field ready. Enough so that Joe West recognized it. ... He said if you don't get this field ready, we're going to forfeit this game to the Royals. That's what goosed those guys to get them going.\"\n\nLefebvre: \"The grounds crew worked so slow as if they expected this game to eventually just be called, and the longer that they would wait, the better chance the game would be called. So you've got our guys hauling the drying compound out there, they become members of the grounds crew.\"\n\nSwanson: \"Our guys were carrying Turface out to the field, Gordo (Alex Gordon) and Guthrie, they were carrying bags of Turface to make sure the field had dirt on.\"\n\nHosmer: \"Francoeur, because he had a home run, he wanted to make sure it counted, that's for sure.\"\n\nGuthrie: \"I know Frenchy and I were in a very selfish way were rooting for the game to continue and certainly we were wanting to finish the game.\"\n\nHosmer: \"I remember we went out there at 2:30 or 2:45 and there were fans right there, so we just started throwing them baseballs and gum, because it was a pretty cool move for them to stick around. It felt like one of those high school tournaments and you're playing in a stadium and you can hear all the echos.\"\n\nSwanson: \"The other thing that was funny was Moose and Hos were throwing all the sunflower seed packages in the dugout up to our fans who stayed because they thought they had to be starved.\"\n\nThe game started up at 3:04 a.m., and Miguel Tejada hit into a double play that ended the top of the ninth. Royals closer Greg Holland retired the Cardinals in order, and the Royals got the 4-2 win at 3:14 a.m.\n\nDutton: \"I was staying at the Union Station Marriott, or whatever it is called, and I had been riding the light rail back and forth to the stadium. It had shut down for the night, but by the time I got out of there, it had started up again.\"\n\nHosmer: \"Joe West and his crew had a day game in Chicago the next day, so it was a pretty pro move to let us finish the game.\"\n\nSwanson: \"Joe and those guys, they were supposed to fly to Chicago after the game. They ended up having a limo take them up and they were there for the day game the next day.\"\n\nGuthrie: \"There was a lot of push for that from the players and the coaches and we needed the win. We felt like it was a chance to get a be a big comeback win and George's first game, so a lot of factors. It was just one of 162, but I think in a lot of ways, you had a lot of guys pulling for this victory as much as any we'd had up to that point in the season.\"\n\nThe Royals traveled to Arlington, Texas, after the game and players got to their hotel around 8 a.m. They lost that night's game, but split the next two in the series. After that, the Royals won their next four series and didn't have a losing month the rest of the year.\n\nThere was a seven-game skid later in the season, but the Royals ended up winning 86 games in 2013, their most in 24 years, and were in the playoff hunt until the final week of the season. The following year saw the Royals win the American League pennant, and they were World Series champions in 2015.\n\nLefebvre: \"At that point, if you compared that season to other Royals season, you could have said, this season is over, they're not going anywhere. But maybe we got a glimpse of how badly they want to win.\"", "time": "18:35:00"}

missing.\n\nCabrera hit a go-ahead, two-run homer against his former team in the eighth inning, and the Kansas City Royals beat the White Sox 5-4 Saturday night to stop a five-game losing streak.\n\nCabrera, acquired from the White Sox on July 30, homered with one out off Aaron Bummer (1-3) and drove in Lorenzo Cain, who led off the inning with a walk against Chris Beck. Cabrera has an eight-game hitting streak.\n\n\"These kind of wins are wins that help you stop the bleeding,\" Royals manager Ned Yost said. \"I was sitting there thinking about this group. What do you tell them? They're not pressing. They're competing their tails off. All you can tell them is, 'Hang in there, keep battling, it is going to get better.' And a win like this does a lot for their spirits.\"\n\nCabrera fell behind 1-2 in the count and homered on the ninth pitch, his third home run since the trade and 16th this season. He extended his hitting streak to eight games.\n\n\"I am grateful to Ned for playing me every day,\" Cabrera said through a translator.\n\nScott Alexander (3-3) won after allowing a two-run, two-out single in the seventh to Leury Garcia that put Chicago ahead 4-3.\n\nJoakim Soria pitched a perfect eighth, and Kelvin Herrera worked around a walk in a hitless-but-eventful ninth for his 25th save in 28 chances.\n\nAfter pinch-runner Tyler Saladino stole second, third baseman Mike Moustakas made a diving stop on Adam Engel's grounder and threw to first for the final out, ending Chicago's four-game winning streak.\n\n\"I was trying to keep it in the infield to make sure a run doesn't score, but I got a pretty good read on the hop so I was able to make a play on it,\" Moustakas said. \"We know how good we can be and we know we weren't playing good baseball.\"\n\nWhite Sox starter James Shields struck out a season-high eight in six innings, allowing three runs and seven hits.\n\nJose Abreu hit a pair of solo home runs against Ian Kennedy, who gave up three runs and seven hits in 6 1/3 innings. Abreu became the first White Sox player to reach 20 homers in each of his first four seasons.\n\n\"Good pitches, bad pitches, he hits them,\" Kennedy said.\n\nMelky Cabrera on the #Royals snapping their losing streak: \"We're trying to look for the first win and then just keep winning from there.\" pic.twitter.com/m6hXvSOdxS\n\n-- FOX Sports KC (@FSKansasCity) August 13, 2017\n\nSTREAKING\n\nNicky Delmonico singled in the second, becoming the first player to reach base in his first 11 games with the White Sox. He is batting .366 (15 for 41) and has a nine-game hitting streak.\n\nTRAINER'S ROOM\n\nRoyals: C Salvador Perez (strained right intercostal muscle) threw from 120 feet for about 10 minutes before the game and could hit off a tee next week. The Royals have lost six of seven since he got hurt and are 4-12 when he doesn't start.\n\nWhite Sox: 3B Matt Davidson (bruised wrist) may not be ready to be activated from the 10-day DL when he becomes eligible Tuesday, according to manager Rick Renteria.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nJason Vargas (13-6) starts for the Royals on Sunday against fellow left-hander Derek Holland (6-11) in the finale of the three-game series. Vargas is 1-3 with a 6.94 ERA since the All-Star break. Holland survived seven walks against Houston on Tuesday for his first win since June 13.", "time": "04:24:00"}

missing.\n\nCabrera hit a go-ahead, two-run homer against his former team in the eighth inning, and the Kansas City Royals beat the White Sox 5-4 Saturday night to stop a five-game losing streak.\n\nCabrera, acquired from the White Sox on July 30, homered with one out off Aaron Bummer (1-3) and drove in Lorenzo Cain, who led off the inning with a walk against Chris Beck. Cabrera has an eight-game hitting streak.\n\n\"These kind of wins are wins that help you stop the bleeding,\" Royals manager Ned Yost said. \"I was sitting there thinking about this group. What do you tell them? They're not pressing. They're competing their tails off. All you can tell them is, 'Hang in there, keep battling, it is going to get better.' And a win like this does a lot for their spirits.\"\n\nSponsored Content: How is your agency managing and maximizing its data? Share your opinions in a Federal News Radio survey.\n\nCabrera fell behind 1-2 in the count and homered on the ninth pitch, his third home run since the trade and 16th this season. He extended his hitting streak to eight games.\n\n\"I am grateful to Ned for playing me every day,\" Cabrera said through a translator.\n\nScott Alexander (3-3) won after allowing a two-run, two-out single in the seventh to Leury Garcia that put Chicago ahead 4-3.\n\nJoakim Soria pitched a perfect eighth, and Kelvin Herrera worked around a walk in a hitless-but-eventful ninth for his 25th save in 28 chances.\n\nAfter pinch-runner Tyler Saladino stole second, third baseman Mike Moustakas made a diving stop on Adam Engel's grounder and threw to first for the final out, ending Chicago's four-game winning streak.\n\n\"I was trying to keep in the infield to make sure a run doesn't score but I got a pretty good read on the hop so I was able to make a play on it,\" Moustakas said. \"We know how good we can be and we know we weren't playing good baseball.\"\n\nHouse minibus sets stage for fight over sequestration, civilian-defense parity\n\nWhite Sox starter James Shields struck out a season-high eight in six innings, allowing three runs and seven hits.\n\nJose Abreu hit a pair of solo home runs against Ian Kennedy, who gave up three runs and seven hits in 6 1/3 innings. Abreu became the first White Sox player to reach 20 homers in each of his first four seasons.\n\n\"Good pitches, bad pitches, he hits them,\" Kennedy said.\n\nSTREAKING\n\nNicky Delmonico singled in the second, becoming the first player to reach base in his first 11 games with the White Sox. He is batting .366 (15 for 41) and has a nine-game hitting streak.\n\nTRAINER'S ROOM\n\nRoyals: C Salvador Perez (strained right intercostal muscle) threw from 120 feet for about 10 minutes before the game and could hit off a tee next week. The Royals have lost six of seven since he got hurt and are 4-12 when he doesn't start.\n\nWhite Sox: 3B Matt Davidson (bruised wrist) may not be ready to be activated from the 10-day DL when he becomes eligible Tuesday, according to manager Rick Renteria said.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nJason Vargas (13-6) starts for the Royals on Sunday against fellow left-hander Derek Holland (6-11) in the finale of the three-game series. Vargas is 1-3 with a 6.94 ERA since the All-Star break. Holland survived seven walks against Houston on Tuesday for his first win since June 13.\n\n___\n\nMore AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball", "time": "04:13:00"}

back above .500 when they play the Chicago White Sox in the rubber match of a three-game set Sunday afternoon.\n\nKansas City (58-58) is feeling better after a comeback win Saturday night that snapped a five-game losing streak. Now, the Royals hope to start a run as they remain fixated on a possible playoff berth.\n\n\"We know how good we can be, and we know we weren't playing good baseball (up until Saturday),\" Royals veteran third baseman Mike Moustakas said. \"We've just got to carry this momentum into (Sunday) and take it for the rest of this road trip -- and get back home in front of the fans and keep this thing rolling.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Chicago (45-69) will try to claim a series victory one day after its four-game win streak came to an end. White Sox pitchers have posted four straight quality starts, which is the longest streak of the season.\n\nRoyals left-hander Jason Vargas (13-6 3.40 ERA) made his first All-Star appearance this year but has struggled since. He is 1-3 with a 6.94 ERA in five starts since the break. He needs one more victory to match his career high of 14, which he set in 2012 with the Seattle Mariners.\n\nIn 12 career appearances (11 starts) against the White Sox, Vargas is 2-3 with a 5.92 ERA. He has faced Chicago three times this season, going 1-1 with a 3.38 ERA. He allowed two runs in five innings in his last matchup July 22.\n\nFor the White Sox, left-hander Derek Holland (6-11, 5.25 ERA) is eyeing back-to-back victories after limiting the Houston Astros to three runs over 5 2/3 innings in his last outing.\n\nIn 10 career appearances (eight starts) against the Royals, Holland is 3-1 with a 3.91 ERA. He already has faced Kansas City twice this season, posting a 1-1 record with a 3.18 ERA.\n\nRoyals first baseman Eric Hosmer will try to maintain the success that he has enjoyed against Holland in his career. He is 6-for-15 with a home run, double and two RBIs. Others have not fared as well against Holland, including Mike Moustakas (1-for-7) and Lorenzo Cain (2-for-9).\n\nRoyals outfielder Melky Cabrera carries an eight-game hitting streak into Sunday's game. Cabrera, who clubbed a go-ahead home run Saturday to sting his former teammates, has three home runs in 13 games with the Royals.\n\nWhite Sox shortstop Tim Anderson is 4 for 8 against Vargas. Jose Abreu is 3 for 10 with an RBI and Avisail Garcia is 1 for 6.\n\nWhite Sox rookie outfielder Nicky Delmonico has a nine-game hitting streak and has reached base safely in each of his first 11 games in the big leagues -- a franchise record.\n\nWhite Sox manager Rick Renteria has liked what he has seen from his club during the past week.\n\n\"I'm more impressed with the way they're playing the game,\" Renteria said. \"The way they're approaching at-bats, some of the defensive plays they're making, the things they're doing on the bases. If they can maintain that consistency, that's what gives you a chance for winning ballgames.\"", "time": "05:54:00"}

contending Kansas City Royals and the rebuilding Chicago White Sox, beginning with Saturday's meeting at Guaranteed Rate Field.\n\nThe Royals realize as much. They also know Chicago's organizational status guarantees no advantage in Kansas City's bid for an American League playoff berth.\n\n\"No, no, no. We are the furthest thing away from taking opponent lightly,\" Royals catcher Drew Butera said. \"They're playing really well right now. They swept Houston, right? Just because they're rebuilding doesn't mean they're a bad team. They've got a lot of talent over there, and we're not going to go in thinking we're going to come in and be easy wins.\"\n\nWhite Sox right-hander Chris Beck called Chicago's three-game sweep of American League West-leading Houston this week a \"nice little uplift, for sure.\" The vibes continued during Friday's series opener between the White Sox and Royals, with Chicago winning 6-3 behind a four-run, seventh-inning rally and a solid team debut from right-hander Reynaldo Lopez.\n\nChicago delivered sound starting pitching, slick defense and timely hitting against the Royals and during the Astros series, which culminated with a walk-off, extra-inning hit from prized prospect Yoan Moncada to win Thursday's series finale.\n\nWas it a potential preview of coming attractions for the White Sox in future seasons? Perhaps. For his part, though, Beck has seen the team transition to a more consistent brand of baseball well before Houston came calling. Even suffering a four-game road sweep against American League East leader Boston last weekend offered bright spots to Beck entering the Astros series.\n\n\"We're not that far off from where we want to be,\" Beck said. \"Each team is capable of winning. We stood toe-to-toe and swept one of the best lineups in baseball. We'll get to go there again in September, so, I mean, it'll be fun.\"\n\nChicago's visit to Houston from Sept. 19-21 precedes a three-game home series against the Royals from Sept. 22-24. The White Sox and Royals also are set to play in Kansas City from Sept. 11-13.\n\nBut first things first. On Saturday, White Sox right-hander James Shields (2-4, 6.03 ERA) will face Royals righty Ian Kennedy (4-8, 4.83 ERA).\n\nShields is 7-2 with a 4.02 ERA in 12 career starts against the Royals, with 65 strikeouts in 80 2/3 innings. Shields spent the 2013 and 2014 seasons with Kansas City, winning 27 regular-season games while helping the club to the American League pennant in 2014.\n\nKennedy is 2-2 with a 4.70 ERA in seven career starts against the White Sox, with 31 strikeouts and seven home runs allowed in 38 1/3 innings.\n\nDespite losing five in a row and 10 of their past 12 games overall, the Royals remain in the hunt in the jumbled American League Central and wild-card races. Success against the White Sox figures to be pivotal during the stretch run.\n\nIt starts with ignoring the same standings Kansas City is trying to climb -- at least to a degree.\n\n\"Oh, yeah. You don't take any team for granted, you know, because once you start taking teams for granted, that's when they sneak up on you, and you lose games,\" Royals center fielder Lorenzo Cain said. \"We're all big league ballplayers. We all respect each other.\"", "time": "06:44:00"}

closer to the brink. This was Friday night at Guaranteed Rate Field, a 6-3 Royals loss to the Chicago White Sox transforming an August swoon into something closer to a nightmare.\n\nOn a cool night on the South Side of Chicago, the Royals (57-58) lost for a 10th time in 12 games, running their latest streak to an ugly: \"LLLLL.\" On the first night of a three-game series, Kansas City tumbled further out of the division race, dropping five games behind first-place Cleveland.\n\nThe Chicago White Sox long ago waved the white flag on their 2017 season. They traded away assets last winter, and they continued the selling in the month of July. The Royals, meanwhile, pushed their chips into the middle of the table after a nine-game winning streak in late July.\n\nThey were two teams, moving in opposite directions, and on July 30 they consummated a deal to send outfielder Melky Cabrera to the Royals for two minor-league pitchers. In the 12 games since, Cabrera has been a productive force in the middle of the lineup. Everything else has fallen apart.\n\nOn Friday night, Duffy was raked for five runs in 6 1/3 innings, including three in a four-run seventh inning. The offense was limited to two solo shots from Mike Moustakas, who became the first Royals hitter to reach 34 homers since Dean Palmer in 1998. The fatal blow came in the seventh, when Chicago shortstop Tim Anderson clubbed a three-run bomb off reliever Peter Moylan.\n\nThe pitching staff had posted a 6.38 ERA across 10 games in August. The frustration and lack of execution persisted for another night in Chicago. A bullpen so dominant in July has turned flammable in August. A once dependable starting rotation has ranged from decent to poor.\n\nThe White Sox were coming off a three-game sweep of the Houston Astros, the best team in the American League. On Friday, they would score single runs off Duffy in the first and second innings. Duffy settled down in the middle innings as Moustakas homered twice against White Sox rookie Reynaldo Lopez. But Duffy ran into trouble in the seventh, surrendering a second triple to Chicago center Adam Engel and a safety squeeze to Yolmer Sanchez before Anderson pounced on Moylan.\n\nThe Royals dipped under .500 for the first time since July 19. The streakiest team in baseball has skidded into a danger zone.\n\nThey remain just a solid weekend from playoff position, by the grace of the American League and its extreme parity. They cannot afford another run like this.\n\nOn July 18, they suffered their seventh loss in eight games, falling 9-3 to Detroit. They sat three games behind first-place Cleveland. For the next 10 days, they did nothing but win, pushing their record to 54-47 following a nine-game streak. They gained just one game on Cleveland.\n\nFor weeks, the odd trend continued. The Royals will win, and Cleveland will win. The Royals will lose, and Cleveland will lose. There have been exceptions, of course. Nothing in baseball is perfect. Yet on July 30, Royals manager Ned Yost could peer at the standings and see his team seven games over .500 and just two games back. On Friday, they were back to .500. They had lost just two games in the standings.\n\n\"I've just been amazed,\" Yost said. \"We lost nine out of 11. We've lost two games in the standings.\"\n\nThe American League Wild Card standings offer another puzzle, so many moving parts that one could spent an entire day dissecting the race. For one day, the basics read like this: Seven teams separated by four games, two playoff spots at stake, the Royals a game behind the Seattle Mariners for the second slot heading into Friday's action.\n\n\"Everybody is doing the same thing,\" Yost said. \"Nobody can run away.\"\n\nAnd with that, another series began. The Royals faced off against Lopez, one of the jewels of Chicago's vaunted minor-league system. A 23-year-old right-hander and one of the top 75 prospects in baseball, Lopez was making his first start for the White Sox after spending the season at Class AAA Charlotte.\n\nIn six innings, he yielded just two runs on four hits and three walks. He struck out six and departed after 102 pitches. The only damage came from the bat of Moustakas.", "time": "03:26:00"}

"url": "http://m.mlb.com/news/article/247824658/white-sox-4-run-7th-beats-slumping-royals/", "body": "The Royals, who have lost five straight and 10 of 12, dropped to five games behind the American League Central-leading Indians. Mike Moustakas hit his 33rd and 34th home runs for the Royals, pulling within two of Steve Balboni's club record of 36 in 1985.\n\nRight-hander Reynaldo Lopez, acquired from the Nationals in December and making his White Sox debut, was dominant early, striking out six through three no-hit innings. But Lopez, ranked as the club's No. 6 prospect by MLBPipeline.com, surrendered Moustakas' first home run in the fourth. Lopez went six innings, giving up four hits and two runs while walking three.\n\nRoyals left-hander Danny Duffy was strong through six innings before running into trouble in the seventh. He went 6 1/3 innings, allowing seven hits and five earned runs.\n\nMOMENTS THAT MATTERED\n\nStop right there: The Royals had a chance to do some serious damage after Moustakas' one-out homer in the fourth. Cheslor Cuthbert and Alcides Escobar followed with sharp singles, but Lopez got Alex Gordon to fly out to center and Drew Butera to foul out to third, ending the threat.\n\nSqueeze play: The White Sox, already with a 3-2 lead after Engel's second triple, which scored Leury Garcia, tacked on another run when Yolmer Sanchez executed a safety-squeeze bunt. Engel scored on a close play at the plate as Duffy's throw to Butera was just late.\n\nSOUND SMART WITH YOUR FRIENDS\n\nOutfielder Nicky Delmonico's infield single in the fifth inning off Duffy made him the first White Sox player since Larry Rosenthal in 1936 to reach base safely in each of his first 10 career games. Delmonico's hit had some luck to it -- it only had a hit probability of 11 percent, according to Statcast\u2122.\n\nEngel became the first White Sox player since Alejandro De Aza on Aug. 16, 2011, to triple twice in a game with his go-ahead RBI triple into the gap in left-center in the seventh inning. He became the first White Sox rookie to achieve the feat since Pete Ward on April 11, 1963, against the Angels. At 25 years and 245 days old, Engel is the youngest White Sox player to triple twice in a game since Sammy Sosa (21 years, 241 days old) on July 11, 1990.\n\nWHAT'S NEXT\n\nRoyals: Right-hander Ian Kennedy (4-8, 4.83 ERA) will face the White Sox for a third time this season on Saturday at 6:10 p.m. CT. Kennedy gave up six hits and six earned runs in six innings in an 11-3 loss to the Cardinals on Monday.\n\nWhite Sox: Right-hander James Shields (2-4, 6.03) will take the mound at 6:10 p.m. CT on Saturday in the middle game against the Royals, his former team, at Guaranteed Rate Field. Shields has just one quality start since coming off his first-ever stint on the disabled list for a right lat strain on June 18.", "time": "04:04:00"}

eighth inning, and the Kansas City Royals held on for a 5-4 win over the Chicago White Sox on Saturday night.\n\nEric Hosmer also homered as Kansas City (58-58) snapped a five-game losing streak.\n\nJose Abreu hit a pair of solo home runs to lead the White Sox at the plate. Leury Garcia drove in two more runs for Chicago (45-69), which had its four-game winning streak come to an end.\n\nCabrera stung his former team with a two-run shot to erase a 4-3 deficit in the eighth. He lifted a low pitch to the opposite field for his 16th home run of the season and his third since Kansas City acquired him from Chicago.\n\nRoyals left-hander Scott Alexander (3-3) earned the win in relief. He replaced right-hander Ian Kennedy, who allowed three runs on seven hits in 6 1/3 innings.\n\nWhite Sox left-hander Aaron Bummer (1-3) took the loss out of the bullpen after giving up Cabrera's home run.\n\nRight-hander Kelvin Herrera pitched a scoreless ninth inning to earn his 25th save for the Royals.\n\nAbreu pulled the White Sox within 3-2 in the sixth inning when he belted his second home run of the game and his 21st of the year. The 410-foot shot over the left-field wall gave him nine career multi-homer games.\n\nGarcia gave Chicago a 4-3 lead with a two-out, two-run single in the seventh. His line drive up the middle scored Tim Anderson and Omar Narvaez, who slid just in front of an attempted tag by catcher Drew Butera.\n\nThe Royals grabbed an early lead on Hosmer's solo home run into the left-field bleachers in the first inning. The blast marked Hosmer's 19th home run and his third in the past seven games.\n\nKansas City added two more runs in the second to increase its advantage to 3-0. Alcides Escobar ripped a triple to the wall in right-center field, which scored Mike Moustakas. Three batters later, Whit Merrifield singled to center field to push Escobar across the plate.\n\nChicago trimmed the deficit to 3-1 in the fourth on Abreu's 20th home run. Abreu became the first player in White Sox history to hit 20-plus homers in each of his first four seasons.\n\nNOTES: White Sox OF Avisail Garcia returned to the starting lineup Saturday after receiving a day off because his legs were tired. He went 2-for-3. ... Royals C Salvador Perez (strained intercostal muscle) played catch Saturday and might try to take some swings next week as he nears a return. Perez has been out since Aug. 5 ... White Sox DH Matt Davidson (bruised right wrist) will remain on the 10-day disabled list for an indefinite period after experiencing a setback this week. Davidson was injured Aug. 1 when he was hit by a pitch from Toronto Blue Jays RHP Marcus Stroman. ... Royals OF Melky Cabrera extended his hit streak to eight games.", "time": "04:09:00"}

It's tough to gain ground when there are four or five teams ahead of you.\n\nDespite the loss, Mike Moustakas gave Royals fans two reasons to get excited Friday night. He clubbed his 33rd and 34th home runs of the season:\n\nWith those two home runs, Moustakas has tied John Mayberry's record for the most home runs by a left-handed batter in Royals history. Also, Moustakas is now only two homers behind Steve Balboni's single-season franchise record.

"url": "http://www.espn.com/blog/sweetspot/post/_/id/81883", "body": "CHICAGO -- Sometimes how you won is almost as important as whether you won. Or at least that's what the Kansas City Royals are hoping.\n\nDon't misunderstand. The Royals needed a win in the worst way, and no matter how a victory might have unfolded, K.C. would have still basked in the booming postgame music that fills clubhouses after a W.\n\n\"It's great hearing music,\" said Royals starter Ian Kennedy, who put up a quality start in Saturday's 5-4 win over the Chicago White Sox. \"We haven't heard it in awhile. We're pretty streaky lately, so hopefully we get a streak going the other way.\"\n\nHere's some context: After beating the Boston Red Sox on July 28, the Royals had run off nine straight wins and reached a high-water mark of seven games over .500. They were just two games back of Cleveland in the AL Central and 2.5 games ahead of the scrum for the American League's second wild-card spot. After a loss the next day, the Royals won in Boston again to raise their run differential to break-even for the first time all season.\n\nAfter that point and before Saturday, the Royals' feel-good, turnaround season had transmogrified into an Edgar Allan Poe-kind of slow, unfolding nightmare. The top of the stat sheet told the story -- 10 losses in 12 games -- but when you dig in, it was even worse than that. At the very point at which Kansas City might have put a stranglehold on their third postseason appearances in four years, this happened:\n\nSince the Royals' wave crested in Boston, the bullpen had put up a collective 6.92 ERA, blown three of five save chances. Every middle reliever between set-up man Joakim Soria and closer Kelvin Herrera had an ERA over 5. In other words, no matter what number manager Ned Yost dialed up, it was the wrong answer.\n\n\"Just seems like the last four or five days, they've all struggled a little bit,\" Yost said at the start of the series. \"Those things get turned around quick, so I don't worry about it too much.\"\n\nThat trend continued on Saturday despite the win. Kennedy departed with Kansas City up 3-2 after he walked Anderson with one out in the seventh. Omar Narvaez, the first batter lefty Scott Alexander faced, doubled to drive Anderson to third. With the infield drawn in, Alexander got Adam Engel on a grounder to keep the runners in place. But Leury Garcia plated them both with a two-out single.\n\nVoila. The bullpen strikes again.\n\n\"The pitch to Garcia was a pretty good pitch,\" Yost said. \"He just poked it into center. Ian had been grinding all day. Threw the ball extremely well.\"\n\nFlashback to late July, with the Royals so clearly a big part of the AL playoff chase, general manager Dayton Moore went about adding complementary pieces to his roster. Three pitchers were added from the San Diego Padres, all of whom had performed well in San Diego but, so far, not so much in Kansas City. And he added old pal Melky Cabrera from Saturday's opponent, the White Sox.\n\nCabrera was the Royals' center fielder in 2011, a formative campaign for the core of what eventually became a championship club. Cabrera had a good season for Kansas City, hitting .305/.339/.470 and, more importantly, having a positive impact on then-green teammates like Eric Hosmer, Mike Moustakas, Lorenzo Cain, Alcides Escobar and Salvador Perez. That was the vagabond phase of Cabrera's career, as he toiled for five different teams from 2009 to 2013.\n\nCabrera had joined the White Sox by 2015 and quickly became a fan favorite. He seemed poised to help mentor Chicago's gradual influx of young talent and seemed happy to do it. In fact, when phenom Yoan Moncada was called up in late July, he was given the locker between Cabrera and Jose Abreu, who hit two homers in Saturday's game. Instead, Cabrera was shipped out to the contending Royals, not an unhappy development for either party.\n\n\"I had Melky here back when these kids were coming up,\" Yost said on Friday. \"He was a great presence in the clubhouse when Hos and Moose and Salvy all came to the big leagues. They loved him for it. They were tremendously excited when they heard that he was coming back. He's the same guy, just a pleasure to be around.\"\n\nThen the Royals arrived in Chicago on Friday. And the first time Cabrera strode to the plate, the modest gathering at Guaranteed Rate Field gave him a surprisingly robust standing ovation. Cabrera returned the love by tipping his batting helmet to his old fans. But then it was time to get back to the task at hand: Helping his new team, which is his old team, get back to the playoffs one more time while the old gang is still together. Cabrera knows that with this bunch now, his mentoring days are behind him. Now, it's about providing a boost for one of the AL's most maddeningly inconsistent offenses.\n\n\"I know most of the guys here,\" Cabrera said before Friday's game, through an interpreter. \"They are very talented players and you can notice a difference [from his first stint]. This is a good team that is competing for the playoffs.\"\n\nThat boost came in the eighth inning on Saturday, in the very next half-frame after the Royals coughed up yet another lead. With Cain on first, Cabrera lofted a high-trajectory fly ball to the fence in left-center field. His old outfield mate, Engel, made an acrobatic attempt at climbing the wall, but the blast settled into the bleachers to give the Royals a 5-4 lead. You could almost see a puff cloud of relief emanating from the Kansas City dugout.\n\n\"Anything he does for us is always big,\" Moustakas said. \"Melky is a huge [part] of what we've got going on. He's a huge leader and definitely makes our team a lot better. We were very familiar with him. He's been here for awhile. It's great to have him back.\"\n\nThere were still six outs to get, but at least the outcome was then placed in the steady hands of the close-out crew. Soria zipped through a perfect eighth. Herrera walked Narvaez with two outs in the ninth and then pinch-runner Tyler Saladino stole second. But Moustakas made a nice stab of an Engle grounder and fired across the diamond to Hosmer, who pumped his fist with perhaps a little more than the usual vigor.\n\n\"Great play,\" Yost said about the game-ender. \"A game saver, really.\"\n\nIt's just one win, but the Royals hope it spurs more for a team that has been as streaky as any in baseball this season. The record is back to .500, and because the 2017 AL playoff race rewards that kind of mediocrity with contention, it feels something like a clean slate as the season turns toward the home stretch.\n\n\"These kinds of wins are the ones that help you stop the bleeding,\" Yost said. \"We've just been struggling. It was huge to answer back right there.\"", "time": "05:35:00"}

Kansas City Royals during the first inning of a baseball game Friday, Aug. 11, 2017, in Chicago.\n\nThere was plenty to like about Reynaldo Lopez's first start for the Chicago White Sox.\n\nTaking the mound against the Kansas City Royals on Friday night at Guaranteed Rate Field after being called up from Class AAA Charlotte, Lopez ran his touted fastball up to 100 mph, and the 23-year-old right-hander had all 6 of his strikeouts before the third inning was over.\n\n\"Like we talked about last night, he has wipeout type stuff,\" Sox manager Rick Renteria said Saturday. \"He can strike out a lot of guys.\"\n\nThat's a fact.\n\nBefore joining the White Sox from Class AAA Charlotte, Lopez was third in the International League in strikeouts, and the 6-foot-1, 210-pounder struck out 42 in 44 innings with the Washington Nationals last season.\n\nOne thing to keep an eye on?\n\nLopez was overpowering in his start against the Royals, but he lasted just 6 innings after throwing 102 pitches.\n\nLike Chris Sale from 2011-15 and like Carlos Rodon from earlier this season, Lopez's heavy reliance on the strikeout is going to lead to early exits.\n\n\"Can you induce more contact? I'm sure you can,\" Renteria said. \"But you don't want to take away the ability for the guy to do what he does naturally.\"\n\nLopez threw 20 pitches 97 mph or faster Friday night, and one hit 100.\n\nHe is naturally able to blow fastballs past hitters -- no matter the level -- but look for the prospect to focus on hitting more bats once his secondary pitches gain polish.\n\nLopez gave up 2 runs against Kansas City. The first was a Mike Moustakas home run on a hanging curveball. The second was a Moustakas homer on a changeup that stayed up in the zone.\n\n\"I told him that was a terrific outing, we can build off that,\" said Kevan Smith, who caught Lopez. \"Now let's get in the film room and learn from it and see what our mistakes were and just get better and keep building off it.\"\n\nLopez has the talent and work ethic to do just that, and he already looks like a foundation piece for the rebuilding White Sox.\n\n\"I feel proud to be here,\" he said through a translator. \"This is the reward for all the work that I put in during my career.\"", "time": "00:26:00"}

Which I'm not. And you're grateful for that.\n\nThe trade deadline was just 11 days ago. It feels like 40 months ago. The rumors were everywhere, hanging over the heads of losing teams, giving life to winning teams. Anything was possible. Justin Verlander on the Twins? Sonny Gray on the Rockies? The Mariners acquiring every single Tyler in baseball after Jerry Dipoto had a waking vision of a flaming trade eagle? Which he has every other week? It was all possible.\n\nNow we're in the middle of August, and the teams are mostly set. Sure, Verlander still might get sent to the Astros. Other players will be traded. But for the most part, the teams that made moves have to live with those moves, for better or for worse.\n\nThese are the teams that would do things differently if the deadline were just 11 days later. Maybe. I don't know. Probably not. Teams are stubborn.\n\nThere's are the teams for which I would do things differently, at least. These organizations made their decisions, and I'm here to retroactively change them.\n\nThe state of the Cardinals is something like this: They have a rotation that's so full, they can't work in their best young prospect, who's probably ready. Their current no. 3 hitter is a rookie shortstop who was injected with Temporary Serum of Stan Musial's Pancreas, which they've fully synthesized at this point, but there's no way to tell how long it will last. It was a season for Randal Grichuk and two for Allen Craig, but the serum is still pumping through the veins of Jedd Gyorko and Matt Carpenter. Total crapshoot.\n\nAnd the Cardinals are winning. Like, a bunch. I was so very excited to crow about my preseason pick of the Brewers finishing ahead of them, but, as always, the baseball seasons are too long. The Cardinals are battling for first place in the NL Central, which is one step closer to meeting the Dodgers in the NLCS, which is their destiny, even if it looked unlikely a month ago.\n\nAt the deadline, there were talks that the Cardinals were interested in trading Lance Lynn, possibly to replenish the farm, possibly in a three-way deal to bring back an outfielder. Now that I'm in charge, I dial it back all the way before the deadline and get them J.D. Martinez, who was kind of the perfect fit and didn't take a bevy of prospects to acquire for the Diamondbacks. I understand why the Cardinals weren't interested in a rental back when they were spinning their wheels in the mud.\n\nThey're probably cool now, though. And they would love to have Martinez.\n\nThis is an obvious one, and I've written about it before, so I won't belabor the point. But ...\n\nYeah, that. Add in the surly Dallas Keuchel comments, and you have a team that's lost a little puff of steam. Their main addition -- Francisco Liriano as some sort of super reliever -- has been a small-sample flop because he has trouble throwing strikes and hasn't been used in short relief for years.\n\nI'm torn, though. Do they give up prospects for Yu Darvish? Or do they beat the Yankees' offer for Sonny Gray? Both seem daunting, but I'll go with the Gray option because he would bring the Astros' guaranteed payroll commitments up to, oh, $60 million next year and $30 million in 2019. That would give them the freedom to buy whatever complementary players their hearts desire to supplement their absurdly young core.\n\nAnd they would have Gray for next year. It made far too much sense to work. But when Derek Fisher is in the middle of baseball's first 60/60 season, maybe they'll look back at this moment and laugh.\n\nOh, I know better than to doubt the Royals. They shouldn't be here in the first place. For the first 45 days of the season, when I was writing article after article about how the Giants were on fire and running straight for the oxygen tent, I was mad at the Royals because they were so bad offensively that it forced me to write things like, \"The Giants are the worst offensive team in the National League\" or \"the Giants are the 29th worst offense in baseball.\" Ruined the impact.\n\nThen the Royals started winning and winning, and while they didn't exactly go on the same streak as the Dodgers, they were 44-27 after a 10-20 start. They were in position for a wild card slot, and that's if they weren't pushing the Indians for the Central.\n\nSince then, they've gone 3-10, including getting swept in a four-game home-away stretch against the Cardinals, which put both teams here. They have six more games on the road trip (against the two worst teams in the AL), and then they'll start a 15-game stretch against contending teams. If they can't make up ground against the White Sox and A's, they'll be in a dilly of a pickle.\n\nIf I have control of the Delorean and I'm redoing their trade deadline, I'm selling. There would be no way to sell it back then. It would have been worse than the White Flag trade of the 1997 White Sox, a punch in the throat of fans who deserve better. That's why I'm taking all of you with me. To explain.\n\nThe Royals have been outscored on the season, and their expected record is more like 54-60. The players they traded for -- Brandon Mauer, Trevor Cahill, and Ryan Buchter -- have all been terrible. The most important part of this endeavor, though, is that the Royals are going to be decimated by free agency. Eric Hosmer, Mike Moustakas, Lorenzo Cain, and Jason Vargas are either going to be so expensive that they'll prevent the Royals from signing some of the other guys, or they're going away.\n\nIn this new reality, the Royals can swoop in with Mike Minor to appease the teams disappointed that Brad Hand and Zach Britton didn't go anywhere. They could have dealt Vargas when his value was as high as it has ever been. Heck, they could have kept Hosmer, Cain, and/or Moustakas to keep the exclusive negotiating window and the potential that one of them might accept a qualifying offer in a weird market.\n\nThey would have had prospects, they would have been facing the same confusing offseason, and they still would have lost just as many games. There was no way to justify it back then, but we're here, and even with the Royals just a game behind the Mariners for the second wild card, I would be ready to pull the emergency chute.\n\nNow let's all kick back and wait for the Royals to win 10 straight, just to make the pundit look stupid. They're good at that.\n\nWait, that's not nice. Dial it back a bit.\n\nThere we go. And this seems unfair because I loved their creative approach to filling out a rotation on a budget. Marco Gonzalez and Erasmo Ramirez were both fine additions for a team that didn't have a ton of prospect capital to spend, and I applaud them for this.\n\nThat written, James Paxton might miss time with a left pectoral strain. That's not an elbow or a shoulder, so maybe I'm making too much about this, but I've got the heebie-jeebies about this. Felix Hernandez has shoulder bursitis. Hisashi Iwakuma has issues with his shoulder, too. One of the pitchers they got at the deadline, David Phelps, has an elbow impingement, which always sounds like the most painful injury in baseball. Nothing is going right for the Mariners, who are resigned to the fact that baseball is their personal kite-eating tree.\n\nYovani Gallardo is back in the rotation, for example. After all those deals, all that planning, they're back to where they started.\n\nMy suggestion is this: One more pitcher. It doesn't have to be as creative as Gonzales or Ramirez. Something obvious, like Yu Darvish or Sonny Gray. Maybe if we go back and tell the Cardinals that they lose 14 in a row, they trade Lance Lynn after all. The Mariners looked like a team that would do well making some creative additions. It turns out that the dumbest, most heavy-handed prospect-for-known-quantity deals were what they needed the whole time.\n\nIf Paxton just needs a little rest, forget that I wrote this. But if he has to miss even two starts, I'm a little fidgety thinking about how the Mariners are going to maintain their contending status for the rest of the year. Paxton getting hurt right after Hernandez is absolutely brutal.\n\nAlthough, I must say, isn't it their time to have a streak of dumb luck? Shouldn't this be when Gallardo throws six straight quality starts? We've seen the White Sox, Red Sox, Giants, and Cubs get it this century after not getting a lot of it in the previous century. The Royals climbed out of the depths. Why not the Mariners? Isn't this their time? Is that too much to ask*?", "time": "16:58:00"}

Cardinals, the Kansas City Royals enter a weekend series at the Chicago White Sox trying to figure out how to solve their bullpen problem.\n\nThe Royals have lost four straight games and nine of their past 11. Their troubles stem largely from the bullpen, which has been taxed during the recent slide. In the four losses to the Cardinals this week, only one starter managed to pitch at least six innings. That took its toll on manager Ned Yost's relief pitchers, who allowed 19 runs in 16 innings.\n\nAfter an 8-6 loss Thursday at Busch Stadium, Yost admitted something has to change -- and soon.\n\n\"It's kind of a bullpen slump, a little bit, but it's a good bullpen,\" Yost told the Kansas City Star. \"They'll fight their way through it.\"\n\nDanny Duffy (7-7, 3.48 ERA) gets the start for the Royals in the opener Friday night. The left-hander won two consecutive starts before a no-decision and then a loss in his most recent outing, when he allowed three runs in 5 2/3 innings against Seattle.\n\nDuffy is 6-4 with a 4.08 ERA in 18 games (16 starts) against the White Sox. However, in two outings against Chicago this year, he is 0-2 with an 11.17 ERA, having allowed 12 runs on 19 hits in 12 2/3 innings.\n\nDuffy will face right-hander Reynaldo Lopez, the latest White Sox minor leaguer to make the transition to the big-league stage.\n\nLopez will be officially called up from Triple-A Charlotte on Friday. He replaces Mike Pelfrey, who was moved to the bullpen, in the rotation.\n\n\"Everybody has kind of been anticipating his arrival as we wait for a lot of the other guys that are going to be developing over the course of the next couple of years to get here,\" White Sox manager Rick Renteria said Thursday before the White Sox finished off a sweep of the Houston Astros with a 3-2, 11th-inning walk-off victory. \"Certainly, we're all looking forward to getting him out there on the hill to see how he's doing.\"\n\nLopez, 23, went 6-7 with a 3.79 ERA and 131 strikeouts in 22 starts this season for Charlotte. He was 5-3 in 11 starts with the Washington Nationals last season, when he struck out 42 in 44 innings and had a 4.91 ERA.\n\nHe was acquired last offseason in a deal that sent center fielder Adam Eaton to Washington. Last week, Lopez said he was prepared to make the move to the major leagues and become a full-time part of the White Sox rotation.\n\n\"I feel like I'm ready physically and mentally to pitch in the majors,\" Lopez said through a team interpreter. \"Yes, it has been a little difficult because you dream about pitching in the majors.\n\n\"When you're doing your job and things are going well, then you want to be there right away. But you also know you have to be patient. That's one of the things I've been trying to show to the organization -- that I can be patient, too.\"\n\nLopez will oppose Kansas City for the first time.", "time": "14:11:00"}

Teams that are winning tend to do the little stuff right and teams that are losing tend to play sloppy baseball.\n\nAnd in this current bad streak, the Royals have played sloppy baseball.\n\nThe Royals need to control what they can\n\nYou don't worry about things like cats running on the field and the poorly-located sinker that followed; that is baseball and you don't control it.\n\nSo what can you expect to control?\n\nAt the top of that list you'd find walks and errors; big league pitchers should be able to throw strikes and big league fielders need to make the routine plays.\n\nAssuming I counted right, in this five-game losing streak the Royals have walked 23 batters and made eight errors. They've also had one wild pitch, two passed balls and hit three batters.\n\nDuring this streak of sloppy baseball, we've seen a pitcher fail to cover first base and home, a pitcher out of position on play at the plate, a blown rundown and a base runner picked off because he lost track of the count.\n\nThose are things the Royals should have been able to control, but didn't.\n\nWhy you have to admit fault\n\nIf a player makes a mistake and won't admit it, he's unlikely to change; why should he?\n\nHe just got unlucky and the result was not his fault.\n\nThe same goes for teams; if they say a losing streak is the result of bad luck, they have no motivation to fix mistakes, clean things up and be accountable. After all, losing was just bad luck and that's not something they control.\n\nNow here are a couple pertinent quotes about luck:\n\nThe first quote is attributed to numerous golfers; the second quote comes from either John Milton or Branch Rickey, and since Milton was born in 1608 and died in 1674, I'd put my money on John.\n\nDespite the uncertainty of the quotes' origin, there's not much doubt of their veracity.\n\nGood teams take care of the little stuff and when they do something wrong, they correct it so they don't make the same mistake again; when bad teams do something wrong they blame it on bad luck and just keeping making the same mistakes.\n\nThe Royals need to be the exploiters, not the exploited\n\nIn recent years Royals fans have seen their team pressure the opposition into making mistakes and then exploiting those mistakes. For the past few years, this has been part of the Royals' winning formula.\n\nBut recently, the Royals are the ones making mistakes and the ones being exploited; if they want to get back on a winning streak, that needs to change.\n\nAfter a loss, players and managers know how to talk to the media; they won't throw a teammate or player under the bus, they won't say we could have won if our pitcher remembered to cover first base.\n\nBut after the media leaves the clubhouse, those things not only might get said; they better get said.\n\nStaying in your lane, refusing to speak critically about how your team is playing, is how you keep making the same mistakes. Nobody wants to be the bad guy, so nothing gets said and nothing gets fixed and the team keeps playing sloppy baseball.\n\nWe'll never hear what gets said behind closed doors, but we can see how the Royals play on the field; we can watch them play and see if some of their recent mistakes get fixed.\n\nAnd those mistakes need to get fixed quickly; the season is winding down, the Royals don't have much room for error and this losing streak is not all bad luck.", "time": "14:35:00"}

A solid performance from a starter. A clean night from the bullpen. Enough offense to snap a five-game losing streak.\n\nThere was some of that here at Guaranteed Rate Field. It was not perfection. The Royals will settle for it, nonetheless.\n\nMelky Cabrera, the former White Sox outfielder and fan favorite, clubbed a two-run homer in the top of the eighth, rescuing the Royals from another bullpen stumble and delivering a 5-4 victory on the South side of Chicago. One swing of the bat ended a five-game losing streak and pushed the Royals (58-58) back to .500 entering a series finale on Sunday afternoon.\n\nThird baseman Mike Moustakas saved a run with a sprawling stop in the bottom of the ninth, throwing across the diamond for the final out with a man in scoring position.\n\nCabrera had spent nearly three full seasons here, manning a corner spot in the outfield, winning over the locals with his consistent hustle and goofy charisma. On Saturday, he played the role of heel, pouncing on a 3-2 slider from the arm of reliever Aaron Bummer and depositing the baseball into the seats in left-center field.\n\nCabrera had battled for eight pitches before hammering a mistake. He erased a 4-3 lead and helped the Royals to their first victory since last Sunday evening against the Seattle Mariners.\n\nThe inning had opened with a walk from Lorenzo Cain. He moved to second when White Sox second baseman Yoan Moncada bobbled a ground ball. The late surge nullified another frustrating night for the Royals bullpen.\n\nStarter Ian Kennedy had surrendered two runs in 6 1/3 innings before issuing a walk with one out in the sixth. He exited for reliever Scott Alexander, who continued his recent struggles.\n\nAlexander allowed a one-out double to Omar Narvaez and a two-out, two-run single to Leury Garcia. In moments, the Royals' 3-2 lead had turned into a one-run deficit.\n\nFor a moment, it appeared that another loss was looming. In the first 11 days of August, the Royals had been outscored 74-46 while losing nine of 11. The bullpen had allowed 29 earned runs in 36 innings. The defense was a nightly question mark.\n\nBut then Cabrera offered the kind of relief that the bullpen could not provide. And Kansas City evened the series. And they will seek another victory on Sunday.\n\nStill in the thick of the American League wild-card race despite 10 losses in 12 games, the Royals must now streak in the other direction to offset the cold start to August.\n\nOn Saturday, Kennedy was coming off consecutive starts in which he yielded 10 earned runs in 10 innings. His last outing was marked by inconsistent command and a rash of walks. In the moments after an 11-3 loss to the Cardinals at Kauffman Stadium, Kennedy appeared confounded by the mini slump.\n\n\"It's like you get into a funk,\" he said.\n\nIn his previous six starts, Kennedy had logged five 'quality' starts. In the days before taking the mound here in Chicago, pitching coach Dave Eiland discovered a slight mechanical flaw. Kennedy was pulling his head to the left during his delivery, causing his body to drift and his arm to lag. The issue was minor. Yet Kennedy sought to clean it up during a bullpen session earlier this week.\n\nThe results were apparent on Saturday night. Kennedy allowed just two runs on solo homers from White Sox first baseman Jose Abreu in the fourth and sixth. The first blast came on a 1-1 fastball that moved in on Abreu. The second came on a 2-2 change-up that stayed in the heart of the strike zone.\n\nKennedy was also the beneficiary of some suspect base running on the other side. Moncada reached base on a passed ball in the first inning before being caught stealing on what might have been a missed hit-and-run from Abreu. Moments later, Abreu singled and Avisail Garcia followed with a double into the left-field corner. Alex Gordon retrieved the ball and threw a strike to the cut-off man. Abreu blew through a stop sign at third. And shortstop Alcides Escobar threw him out easily at the plate.\n\nFor Gordon, it was the 82nd outfield assist of his career, the most in the American League since 2010.\n\nGarcia would later run into another out in the sixth when Royals catcher Drew Butera backed up an errant throw from second baseman Whit Merrifield and relayed the throw back to second.\n\nIn moments, the White Sox were running as if they wished to end the Royals' five-game losing streak themselves. By the end of the night, Cabrera and Moustakas would handle that.", "time": "02:52:00"}

will be accurate again the next day, and this see-saw of emotions and outlook will continue for seven more weeks because this is how Bud Selig wanted it to be:\n\nEleven of the American League's 15 teams are holding or within three games of a playoff spot as of Saturday morning.\n\nSelig, the former commissioner, cared primarily about maintaining interest and producing revenue and this year his creation looks to be working better than he ever could've imagined. Fans in a super-majority of American League markets have reason to believe their team can be in the playoffs as the season hits the stretch run.\n\nEven here, in Kansas City, with the Royals working on three wins in two weeks, they're only two games out of a playoff spot. One hot stretch -- and how many hot stretches has this group had the last five years -- and the standings can flip.\n\nOne awesome byproduct: with so many teams bunched together, it seems highly possible if not probable that we'll have a 163rd game to get into the wild card. In other words: an effective one-game playoff to get into a one-game playoff.\n\nActually, that may be selling this madness short, because there are many scenarios for a three- or even more team tiebreaker for a wild card spot.\n\nIn that terrific version of reality, we could have the first 164th game in more than a half century: a virtual one-game playoff to get into another virtual one-game playoff to get into an actual one-game playoff to get into a playoff series.\n\nIf funhouse mirrors were a playoff format, this would be it.\n\nIn Kansas City, we tend to put hyper focus on the Royals, which is simultaneously natural, more fun, simpler -- and distorting.\n\nBallplayers often say they don't look at the standings or out-of-town scores much until September, and even if that's more about what they want to do rather than what they do, right now it's the only path that makes any sense.\n\nBecause, look, this weekend the Mariners are playing the Angels, and the Rays are playing the Indians.\n\nIf you're the Royals, who do you want to win those games? Those teams are tied in the standings, each a game ahead of the Royals, so that's a wash. The Rays are also a game ahead of the Royals, so maybe you want them to lose, but that means the Indians win and become increasingly difficult to catch in the division (maybe you're giving up on that already).\n\nThere are no ties in baseball, and at least at the moment, rules prohibit both teams from receiving a loss in the same game.\n\nThe Royals need to worry about their own house before they look at others, anyway. What's felt like a six year roller coaster ride -- literally, each of the last six years have included wild extremes -- is going strong with a 2-10 stretch immediately following a 10-1 run.\n\nBut, what's the fun in that?\n\nWe all know the Royals need to stop stinking. Fewer bad starts, fewer bat at-bats, fewer grand slams given up in the late innings (or early or middle innings).\n\nThey are in a critical stretch right now, with Sal Perez in the dugout as the world's loudest assistant coach (other than Rusty Kuntz) and the pitchers scuffling and Alex Gordon working back in the lineup after a benching so short you could've gone out to dinner and missed it.\n\nBut, as much as we can say such things with so much time left and so many teams involved, the Royals are effectively one of seven teams competing for two playoff spots. If you want to hold on to the dream about the division, then they are also one of three competing for that spot.\n\nTen remaining games against the Indians -- that's more than one fifth of the remaining schedule for both teams -- will go a long way. At this point, anything less than six or seven wins will make it difficult.\n\nThe Yankees are three games clear of the wild card as of Saturday morning and the best team in the bunch. Several advanced metrics have the Yankees as baseball's third-best team behind the Dodgers and Astros. They are the wild card contenders' best mix of hitting, rotation and bullpen. Even in a tough division, it would be a significant surprise to see them fall.\n\nThe Rays are a half-game out of the second wild card, and probably the most balanced team we'll talk about the rest of the way. Logan Morrison is among three Rays with at least 22 homers, and the pitching is strong despite Chris Archer still not quite developing into an ace.\n\nThe Mariners and Royals fans have their own standard for postseason droughts, but the last time Seattle saw a playoff game they'd probably rather forget it -- the 2001 team won 116 games and lost in the ALCS. Yonder Alonso makes a good offense better, and James Paxton is a stud, but Felix Hernandez is both injured and carrying around his worst ERA since his first full year as a starter.\n\nThe Twins (bullpen, lineup depth), Angels (pretty much everyone but Mike Trout), and Orioles (rotation, even after the Jeremy Hellickson trade) all have potentially fatal flaws, but every year a team or three works around a potentially fatal flaw to make the playoffs.\n\nSo that part won't be different.\n\nWhat would be different is if this claustrophobic playoff race ends up with a 163rd, and even a 164th, baseball game before the playoffs technically start.", "time": "20:19:00"}

"It's always nice to have some success, especially if you're where the White Sox are.\n\nThe four-game winning streak, that ended Saturday with a 5-4 loss to the Royals thanks to Melky Cabrera's two-run homer in the eighth off Aaron Bummer, was a nice oasis in the middle of a long season. It was some positive feedback that the Sox are doing some things right in Chicago, even as the focus stays on what's happening in the minors.\n\n\"We still have another month and a half left in the regular season. These guys are trying to take advantage of every moment of it and they're still trying to continue to take information in, learn from every experience they have,\" Sox manager Rick Renteria said. \"They're still trying to learn how to play together as a team and I think they're coming together as a team. I know we've had a lot of changes but they've been dealing with those things, I think pretty well.\"\n\nLeury Garcia had a go-ahead two-run single in the seventh and Jose Abreu homered twice for the Sox, who swept AL West-leading Houston and are trying to play spoiler against Kansas City. Because of the changes, both during the offseason and regular season, that's all the Sox can do now.\n\nJames Shields looks at the scoreboard during Saturday's game. | AP\n\nBut everybody knew that would happen, and the remaining players have responded by staying engaged and, as the series with the Astros showed, still capable of the occasional highlight.\n\n\"I think that the way they go about playing the game and preparing... does it help them build on the belief that there's a reason and there's a process to things moving forward in a particular direction? Yes. I think they're buying into it,\" Renteria said. \"I think they've been buying in since Day 1.\"\n\nRenteria deflected credit for that.\n\n\"I don't know if it's so much what I'm doing, as much as it's probably the way they want to play the game. They have an energy about them,\" Renteria said. \"They have a desire to want to be the best. It's very exciting for them to do what they're doing and have some positive results, absolutely.\"\n\nThough he didn't get the win, James Shields still had some positive results.\n\nEntering Saturday, Shields had gone 1-4 with a 7.63 ERA over since returning from the disabled list in June, and things were better against Kansas City. He went six innings and gave up three runs and seven hits and struck out eight but remained winless since beating the Yankees on June 29.\n\nHe fell behind early, as Kansas City took a 1-0 lead in the first on Eric Hosmer's two-out homer to left. Garcia appeared to lose the ball in the sun or the lights and didn't move, even as it landed over his head and the fence.\n\nThe Royals, who are one of a bunch of teams chasing an AL wildcard spot, scored two more in the second against Shields. Alcides Escobar tripled in Mike Moustakas, and Escobar scored on a two-out single by Whit Merrifield.\n\nIn the fourth, Abreu hit his 20th of the season, taking an Ian Kennedy pitch just over the wall in left to become the first player in team history to start his MLB career with four straight 20-homer seasons. Then in the sixth, Abreu hit his second of the night to cut Kansas City's lead to 3-2.\n\nWith his second-inning single, Nicky Delmonico became the first player in Sox history to reach base safely in the first 11 games of his career.\n\nFollow me on Twitter @BrianSandalow", "time": "02:24:00"}

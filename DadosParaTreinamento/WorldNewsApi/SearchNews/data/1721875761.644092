How to have a 'Structure and Flow' in a good essay? Everyone knows that an essay should be broken down into an introduction, body and conclusion. But what is written inside these 3 components and HOW it is written makes the difference between an essay fetching average or excellent scores. Structuring and flow refer to the organisation of the essay and your ideas therein. A good structure is a way of organising information that fits well with the essay topic and the ideas you wish to present in your arguments such that the reader can make sense of the entire write-up without much effort. Good flow refers to how your arguments and counterarguments connect from one to another such that the reader finds it logically connected and easy to comprehend. An essay without these elements will appear to be disorganized, jargoned, hard to comprehend and overall, complicated. Contrary to popular belief, flow and structure are not subjective writing skills that are inborn in good writers but can be learned and improved upon. What follows is a series of structuring techniques that will help you choose the best one for any essay topic you may encounter. What are different types of structures? 1. 2 Side Face-off: This is the oldest trick in the book. While writing the body of the essay, you divide it into arguments and counterarguments. In other words, you compare one side of the debate with the other. For example: \u201cThinking is like a game; it does not begin unless there is an opposite team\u201d The body of the essay can be divided into 2 parts- one agreeing with the statement and one disagreeing with it as follows: Thinking is reciprocal as thought builds on other thoughts. The Socratic method, championed by Socrates, is a testament to this idea. Socrates would go around Athens spreading knowledge by asking questions and inciting dialogue which would lead the conversationist to the point of realization about something new and profound. Similarly, when Einstein said he was standing on the shoulders of giants, he meant that his theory of relativity was built using many ideas developed by mathematicians and physicists who came before him. The reciprocal nature of thought helps to improve it by allowing dissent and counterarguments much like a game of chess. An example is the Case study pioneered by Harvard Business School wherein one case is debated upon in detail considering various strategies before arriving at the optimal one. While dissent and opposition can lead to many a good idea, there are more ways for thought to develop into ideas within human consciousness. Human cognition is too complex to be restricted to one mode of thinking. A Case in point is intuitive or creative thinking that can arise spontaneously without the interlocking of two human intelligences. For instance, creative geniuses often hit upon their best ideas out of the blue in \u2018Eureka\u2019 moments that seem to arise from within the subconscious mind without the presence of an opponent. Another example is \u2018thought-experiments\u2019 used by philosophers that are designed to be introspective exercises that one engages with, with oneself. Thought experiments are indispensable tools for philosophers and physicists to offer insight into a profound problem of logic and metaphysics. 2.Dimensional analysis: It has become fashionable to break the essay topic into various dimensions such as Social, Cultural, Historical, Economic etc. But this is not a one-size-fits-all method and may or may not work with every essay topic. For example: \u201cEducation is what remains after one has forgotten what one has learned in the school.\u201d While this topic can be written about based on various dimensions such as economic, historical, social etc, it is not necessarily the best structure for it. Instead, a better way to present the information in this essay topic would have a mix of chronology and analysis in the following way- We are blank slates when we are born onto which society and culture leave their imprint. Through childhood and adolescence, the education system seeks to put us through a treadmill of learning, hoping for a fully functional human to emerge at the end. Sadly, the world that awaits a young adult after school is often very different from what the education system has imparted. Memorization, exams, grades and NCERT books amount to nothing in a world driven by start-ups, ChatGPT and Social Media influencers\u2026. Please note that the dimensions such as social, cultural and historical factors can also be mentioned in the body of the essay as supporting content ideas. In most essay topics, these dimensions are best used to describe the reasons and impact of an issue or debate instead of as just a structure. 3. Timeline and Chronology Some essay topics are uniquely suited for a chronological structure wherein you take the reader through a historical journey or evolution such as : \u201cHistory is a series of victories won by the scientific man over the romantic man\u201d This topic is about the ancient debate between rationality and idealism. To write well about it, you would have to trace the through major historical intellectual movements such as the Scientific Revolution, the Dark Ages, the Renaissance, etc. While doing so, you could mention how each stage was relevant for rational thinking versus idealism with relevant examples. While you do so chronologically, remember to also present a balanced approach in your arguments- On every stage, you can mention how rational thinking and idealism have been in a tight relationship, but both have been an integral part of human consciousness representing creativity and logic. You may also mention how this to and fro has enriched human civilisation and led to the development of science and art. 4. Anecdotes and stories Many students like to start their essays with an anecdote- a personal story or an imaginary one about characters highlighting the debate presented in the essay topic. While this is not a bad strategy, it requires a fair amount of creative writing ability to pull off properly. It is also important to mention that anecdotes are not the most suitable vehicle to comprehensively deal with the essay topic as not all arguments can easily fit into a personal story. An example of a good use of anecdotal structure is: \u201cNot all who wander are lost\u201d About 2000 years ago, a wandering prince changed the world by questioning the most profound and radical assumptions about human existence. Prince Siddhartha was bathed in luxury and wanted for nothing. But when we saw the naked reality of the world and all its suffering, he could not silence his mind to the questions that we take for granted- why is there suffering and death? If suffering is inevitable then what is the point of life? Is there peace to be found or are we doomed to suffer in this life? He wandered for years in search of answers, as lost as a soul can be. But in the end, it was his wandering that changed the world forever. When he became the Buddha, he not only found himself but saved millions of others from being lost themselves\u2026. Anecdotes can make for good hooks or introductions to an essay but may not serve well to cover the entire body of the essay. The Essay Exercise Example: Essay topic The time to repair the roof is when the sun is shining Practice: Essay topic A ship in harbour is safe, but that is not what ship is for Types of structures to be used 1. Use Anecdotes or historical examples in intro 2. 2 side face-offs in body of the essay 3. Balanced conclusion Introduction Start with comparing USSR and USA in the cold war. Preparation for nuclear war and hint at how being pre-emptive is strategic but not always a good thing. Structure in the body of the Essay Argument- Mention the need and merit for vigilance, caution and pre-emptive action during good times Use various examples to support arguments Counter-argument- While vigilance is good, we must also enjoy the moment in the now. Life is short and we should count our blessings and appreciate the blessings of the current moment Use examples to support counter argument Conclusion Conclude by saying that we must strike a balance between preparedness and being spontaneous: Life is short but it\u2019s not to be lived recklessly. Life is hard but it is not lived in fear of the future. Important points to note: You can choose which type of structure to use- there is no single best choice. You may use more than 1 type of structure. You may use structures for introduction, body and conclusion. Subscribe to our UPSC newsletter and stay updated with the news cues from the past week.

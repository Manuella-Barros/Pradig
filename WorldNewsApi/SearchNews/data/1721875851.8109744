It seems to me that our whole sexual process is intrinsically tied up with perpetuating the human race. When people are in their teens and early twenties, the hormones are flying, the woman\u2019s eggs \u2014 she is born with a certain amount of eggs in her body and these are subject to the ageing process the same as she herself is \u2014 are new and fertile, and pregnancy is fairly easy to achieve. Also, sex happens more often in the early stages of a relationship because the relationship is new, the couple are delighted to be in each other\u2019s company and they can\u2019t keep their hands off one another.

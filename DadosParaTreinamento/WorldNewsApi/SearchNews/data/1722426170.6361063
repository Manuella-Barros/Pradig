Doug Burgum\u2019s two terms in office, he approached the job like a CEO running a business. The wealthy former software executive, now on a shortlist to be Donald Trump\u2019s running mate, was laser-focused on priorities like strengthening the state\u2019s economy and cutting taxes. He mostly steered clear of social issues that animated many fellow Republicans, and he sometimes pushed back on them. In 2020, Burgum criticized an anti-LGBTQ resolution of the state GOP as \u201churtful and divisive rhetoric.\u201d He vetoed a 2021 measure to ban transgender girls from playing on girls\u2019 teams in public schools, saying it \u201cwould unnecessarily inject the state into a local issue by creating a ban with myriad unforeseen consequences.\u201d In 2023, Burgum vetoed a bill he said would make teachers into \u201cpronoun police.\u201d But as Burgum prepared a bid for the presidency that spring, he also signed a sheaf of bills that imposed restrictions on transgender people \u2014 including two that were nearly identical to the sports ban he vetoed in 2021. Another bill banned gender-affirming medical treatments for kids, and he signed a measure that had provisions nearly identical to parts of the pronoun bill he had vetoed earlier in 2023. Burgum also signed a book ban bill, though he did veto a second, further-reaching one. Opponents decried both bills for targeting LGBTQ themes. While conservatives cheered, others close to Burgum \u2014 who applaud what they call his independent streak and inclusivity as a leader \u2014 said the 2023 bill signings were disappointing and marked a shift as the governor entered the national stage. Some saw Burgum\u2019s willingness to support the measures as an attempt to gain traction among Republicans as he eyed a presidential campaign, or as a response to action in other GOP-led states. State Rep. Emily O\u2019Brien, a moderate Republican who opposed the bills but supported Burgum\u2019s presidential bid, said it was shocking Burgum signed them because of his business mentality of \u201ctrying to move the needle\u201d and improve government, not drive social issues. \u201cSocial issues aren\u2019t helping move the needle \u2014 economic development, quality of life \u2026 in his words, \u2018treating the taxpayers like customers,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cI think it\u2019s, you know, that business-model mentality of \u2018No matter who comes through the door, you treat them with respect.\u2019\u201d Burgum, through a spokesman, declined an interview request for this story. He told The Bismarck Tribune after the 2023 session \u2014 Burgum\u2019s last regular legislative session as governor \u2014 that with Republicans holding enough seats in the state Legislature to override his vetoes, he had to \u201cpick his spots.\u201d He also bemoaned the time and energy spent on social issues as \u201ca missed opportunity.\u201d \u201cI talk to real people, creating real jobs, building real companies and hiring people, and some of the things the Legislature is focused on is not what the citizens are focused on,\u201d Burgum said. Caedmon Marx, of Bismarck, repeatedly testified against the anti-trans bills when they were before the Legislature. Marx previously viewed Burgum as someone in the political middle, who had North Dakota\u2019s best interests in mind. \u201cAfter last session, it was kind of someone with his own interests in mind and his own political gain,\u201d said Marx, whose boyfriend, a transgender man, moved to Minnesota earlier this year due to the new laws. Who is Doug Burgum? Burgum, 67, grew up in tiny Arthur, North Dakota. After earning a master\u2019s of business administration from the Stanford University Graduate School of Business, Burgum went on to lead Great Plains Software. In 2001, Microsoft acquired the company for $1.1 billion, and Burgum stayed on as a vice president until 2007. He\u2019s led other companies in real estate development and venture capital. When he launched his 2016 bid for governor, Burgum\u2019s announcement \u2014 like other speeches he gives \u2014 felt like a TED Talk, complete with a slideshow and lacking a lectern. Burgum ran on a vision of \u201creinventing\u201d government as the state faced a $1 billion revenue shortfall that drained reserves. He defeated North Dakota\u2019s longtime attorney general in the GOP primary, a major upset. Burgum is a policy wonk who can speak at length about subjects important to him \u2014 his recent State of the State address was two hours long \u2014 such as advancing carbon capture or reducing regulations. Sometimes he visibly chokes up when discussing serious topics, such as his wife Kathryn\u2019s recovery from addiction. He\u2019s a huge fan of North Dakota State University football and might sprinkle a so-called dad joke into a speech. But people who have worked with him as governor say he\u2019s also extremely inquisitive and works long hours. When former policy adviser Sean Cleary was dating his now-wife in 2019, he sometimes returned to the Capitol after their dates to work for a few hours until as late as 11 p.m. or midnight, he said. Former Lt. Gov. Brent Sanford recalled a late-night meeting where Burgum looked at him and others in the room at 1 a.m. and said enthusiastically, \u201cIsn\u2019t this fun, doing the work for North Dakota?\u201d Business focus shifts Most often, Burgum was advocating business-oriented priorities: income tax cuts, updates to state government websites, cybersecurity enhancements, attracting capital to the state and rejiggering the early budgeting process with state agencies. He\u2019s touted a data-driven approach to problems and frequently talks about \u201cinnovation over regulation.\u201d Burgum entered office during the often-chaotic protests of the Dakota Access oil pipeline, the controversial project long opposed by the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe. Sanford said Burgum displayed courage and listening amid the controversy, inviting the tribal chairman to his office, and hosting a listening session on the tribe\u2019s reservation. In 2019, he announced the display of tribal flags near the entrance to the governor\u2019s state Capitol office, a legislative push for years. Today, North Dakota\u2019s finances are in healthy shape. The 2020 census found the state as one of the fastest-growing. North Dakota was tied with South Dakota for the lowest unemployment rate in the U.S., at 2% in May. Burgum has had to work with a Legislature that in recent years has focused more on social-issue legislation, and has approved more of those types of bills than in previous sessions. The North Dakota Legislature meets for regular session only in odd-numbered years. Two book ban bills passed the Legislature last year. He signed one that targeted \u201cexplicit sexual material\u201d in public libraries\u2019 children\u2019s collections and required those libraries to have policies for reviewing their collections, with a \u201ccompliance report\u201d for lawmakers. But he vetoed the other bill, which he said went too far in \u201ccriminalizing potential disagreements\u201d over certain content, and had no money for libraries to review their materials. In 2023, Burgum also signed one of the strictest abortion bans in the U.S. The bill largely revised or reorganized North Dakota\u2019s myriad abortion laws after the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s 2022 decision that overturned Roe v. Wade. North Dakota\u2019s ban outlaws abortion with few exceptions: in cases of rape or incest up to six weeks gestation, or to prevent the death of or \u201ca serious health risk\u201d to the mother. That law and the ban on gender-affirming care for kids are both the subject of ongoing lawsuits. Burgum has not been outspoken on abortion or transgender issues. \u2018Why did you do it?\u2019 After the state GOP\u2019s anti-LGBTQ resolution gained attention in 2020, Burgum telephoned the state\u2019s first openly gay lawmaker, then the House minority leader, to say he disagreed with it. Democratic state Rep. Josh Boschee said Burgum told him he would work to keep the resolution out of policy and to ensure North Dakota remained \u201can open and inclusive state, because that\u2019s one of the values that he has,\u201d Boschee said. Burgum also shared personal stories about LGBTQ people he knows who have had a positive impact on him, said Boschee, who called it a good conversation. But during the 2023 session, as Burgum planned his presidential campaign, Boschee said he sensed \u201cthe independence I think many of us admired about him\u201d was going away. \u201cHe had to shore up that base,\u201d Boschee said. \u201cWhen you are going to the national stage, you know, other people wouldn\u2019t know that nuance. They would see that he signed and he\u2019d be able to say he did these things if he wanted to say it out loud.\u201d Burgum doesn\u2019t appear to have run for president on those bills or touted them in rallies, \u201cso then it\u2019s why did you do it?\u201d Boschee said. \u201cWas it to get inside the orbit so you didn\u2019t have to worry about it, and now you can stand behind it if you need to?\u201d The authentic Doug Burgum begins a speech with gratitude before diving into energy and tax policy, he said. \u201cI have a lot of positive things to say about Gov. Burgum because of the man I know him to be, which makes it extremely disappointing to see the man he has become in the last several months,\u201d in \u201cthe way that he has attached himself to Donald Trump now,\u201d Boschee said.

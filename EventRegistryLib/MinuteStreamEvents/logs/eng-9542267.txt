Mozambique's ruling Frelimo party has chosen a relatively unknown regional governor, Daniel Chapo, as its new leader making him the successor to President Filipe Nyusi if the party wins this year's elections.\n\nFrelimo's central committee elected Chapo over three other internal candidates, in a surprise move late on Sunday that followed three days of intense wrangling, a high number of spoiled ballot papers and the withdrawal of his closest rival.\n\nChapo, a former academic and journalist, has been governor of the central province of Inhambane since 2016.\n\nAt 47, he is presented by Frelimo as a youthful candidate who could attract young voters to the party, which has been in power for nearly five decades.\n\nHis election as Frelimo leader follows an internal struggle between factions of the party, notably between supporters of Nyusi and those of his predecessor as president and party leader, Armando Guebuza.\n\n\"With the election of its candidate for president, Frelimo took an important step to prepare for victory in the October elections,\" Nyusi said on Sunday night at the end of an extraordinary party congress near the capital Maputo.\n\nFrelimo has won every national election since the end of the war for independence from Portugal in 1975 and also controls a large majority of local authorities.\n\nThe main opposition party, Renamo, accuses it of rigging recent national and local elections.\n\nNyusi, 65, is prevented by the constitution from seeking a third term when Mozambicans vote on October 9 to choose their president, parliament and provincial authorities.\n\nOn Sunday, the president urged the divided Frelimo to \"give Daniel Chapo all our support\", after an internal election that saw Chapo's closest rival, Roque Silva, withdraw from the race at the last minute and resign from his post as Frelimo secretary general.\n\nChapo won with 225 votes out of 240 in the second round of voting after initially garnering 103 votes in the first round.\n\nThe former political science lecturer and radio presenter, who has a law degree, is the first Frelimo presidential candidate to be born after the southern Africa gained independence from Portugal in 1975.\n\nAll four presidents since 1975 have been Frelimo veterans of the independence struggle.\n\nThe party congress was marked by reports of party infighting and disagreements.\n\nSilva, rumoured to be Nyusi's preferred candidate, resigned from his position during the debates after failing to garner sufficient votes.\n\nSpeaking to reporters after his election on Sunday, Chapo pledged to be a unity candidate.\n\n\"We will work... with all layers of society -- young people, women, men and war veterans,\" he said.\n\nFrelimo's landslide victory in the last general election in 2019 was contested by the largest opposition party, Renamo, a former rebel group.\n\nAfter independence, Renamo and Frelimo fought a civil war from 1977 to 1992 that devastated the Mozambican economy and left almost one million people dead.\n\nIn October, at least two people were killed in protests over the results of local elections, which saw police open fire on demonstrators in several cities.\n\nRenamo called the protests after Frelimo was declared the winner in 64 of 65 local authorities.\n\nMozambique ranks seventh from bottom on the 191-country human development index compiled by the United Nations Development Programme.\n\nIt had high hopes for vast natural gas deposits -- the largest found south of the Sahara -- that were discovered in northern Cabo Delgado province in 2010.\n\nBut an insurgency waged by militants linked to the Islamic State group in the region has stalled progress.", "source": {"uri": "thecitizen.co.tz", "dataType": "news", "title":

wrangling, a high number of spoiled ballot papers and the withdrawal of his closest rival.\n\nChapo, a former academic and journalist, has been governor of the central province of Inhambane since 2016.\n\nAt 47, he is presented by Frelimo as a youthful candidate who could attract young voters to the party, which has been in power for nearly five decades.\n\nHis election as Frelimo leader follows an internal struggle between factions of the party, notably between supporters of Nyusi and those of his predecessor as president and party leader, Armando Guebuza.\n\n\"With the election of its candidate for president, Frelimo took an important step to prepare for victory in the October elections,\" Nyusi said on Sunday night at the end of an extraordinary party congress near the capital Maputo.\n\nFrelimo has won every national election since the end of the war for independence from Portugal in 1975 and also controls a large majority of local authorities.\n\nThe main opposition party, Renamo, accuses it of rigging recent national and local elections.\n\n- Youth vote -\n\nNyusi, 65, is prevented by the constitution from seeking a third term when Mozambicans vote on October 9 to choose their president, parliament and provincial authorities.\n\nOn Sunday, the president urged the divided Frelimo to \"give Daniel Chapo all our support\", after an internal election that saw Chapo's closest rival, Roque Silva, withdraw from the race at the last minute and resign from his post as Frelimo secretary general.\n\nChapo won with 225 votes out of 240 in the second round of voting after initially garnering 103 votes in the first round.\n\nThe former political science lecturer and radio presenter, who has a law degree, is the first Frelimo presidential candidate to be born after the southern Africa gained independence from Portugal in 1975.\n\nAll four presidents since 1975 have been Frelimo veterans of the independence struggle.\n\nMore from this section Jewish

Its pick comes as a surprise as Chapo has never served in the national cabinet and his name didn't feature on most lists of potential winning candidates.\n\n\"Chapo demonstrated that he is committed to the party and the country,\" Nyusi said in a speech, in which he committed to stepping down after the election. \"The soap opera of speculation ends, including speculation about a third term.\"\n\nA law graduate and former radio announcer, Chapo, 47, was appointed governor of the central Inhambane province in 2016. Before that, he taught constitutional law and political sciences.\n\nGas Bonanza\n\nChapo, who garnered 221 votes, or 94% of those cast in a second round of balloting, takes over Frelimo's leadership at a critical juncture in Mozambique's history. The nation is anticipating TotalEnergies SE's imminent return to a $20-billion-plus natural gas project it paused three years ago after militants staged attacks nearby. The revival of TotalEnergies' plan is crucial for a nation that's among the poorest in the world.\n\nNyusi has led Frelimo for the past decade and spent much of his two terms as president dealing with the fallout of scandal that erupted when the government admitted that it had failed to disclose debts of about $1.2 billion. He also sought to cut a peace deal with the main opposition party, known as Renamo, but while he was focused on demilitarizing Frelimo's old political foe, a new threat took hold in Mozambique's northern Cabo Delgado province.\n\nAttacks by a group that affiliated itself with Islamic State began in 2017 and rapidly escalated, ultimately derailing the gas project -- Africa's biggest private investment at the time. Mozambique's military struggled to assert control and maintain the trust of communities.\n\nAfter a major strike in March 2021 prompted Total's consortium to evacuate its staff and declare force majeure on the project, Nyusi reached a deal with Rwandan President Paul Kagame to send hundreds of soldiers to help restore order. He later agreed to accept other troops from the Southern African Development Community, a regional bloc. While the interventions were initially successful, the militants have escalated attacks this year.\n\nContaining the violence and convincing the gas developers that it's safe to resume work will be a key priority for Chapo.\n\nRenamo is scheduled to hold its own internal elections this month. Ossufo Momade, its current president, has faced internal criticism of his leadership. He got 21.5% of the national vote in 2019, compared with Nyusi's 73%.\n\n(Updates with official announcement of new party leader starting in first paragraph.)", "source": {"uri": "bnnbloomberg.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "BNN"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FRELIMO", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "FRELIMO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozambique", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mozambique"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mozambique"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TotalEnergies", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TotalEnergies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filipe_Nyusi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Filipe Nyusi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Province", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Province"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_L.P.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg L.P."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_(government)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet (government)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maputo", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Maputo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Maputo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mozambique"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugal", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Portugal"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Portugal"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Constitutional law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_science", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Political science"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_gas", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Natural gas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inhambane", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inhambane"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Inhambane"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mozambique"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Islamic State"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ossufo_Momade", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ossufo Momade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RENAMO", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "RENAMO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force_majeure", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Force majeure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_African_Development_Community", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Southern African Development Community"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Kagame", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paul Kagame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consortium", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Consortium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabo_Delgado_Province", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cabo Delgado Province"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cabo Delgado Province"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mozambique"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rwanda", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rwanda"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Rwanda"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial_Disputes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial Disputes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 71}], "image": "http://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/polopoly_fs/1.2069102!/fileimage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_620/the-flag-of-mozambique-photographer-mike-egerton-pa-images-getty-images.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542267", "eventUri": "eng-9542267", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-09", "textStart": 172, "textEnd": 178}], "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 224, "relevance": 1}

ruling party chooses new leader", "body": "Mozambique's ruling Frelimo party has chosen a relatively unknown regional governor, Daniel Chapo, as its new leader making him the successor to President Filipe Nyusi if the party wins this year's elections.\n\nFrelimo's central committee elected Chapo over three other internal candidates, in a surprise move late on Sunday that followed three days of intense wrangling, a high number of spoiled ballot papers and the withdrawal of his closest rival.\n\nChapo, a former academic and journalist, has been governor of the central province of Inhambane since 2016.\n\nAt 47, he is presented by Frelimo as a youthful candidate who could attract young voters to the party, which has been in power for nearly five decades.\n\nHis election as Frelimo leader follows an internal struggle between factions of the party, notably between supporters of Nyusi and those of his predecessor as president and party leader, Armando Guebuza.\n\n\"With the election of its candidate for president, Frelimo took an important step to prepare for victory in the October elections,\" Nyusi said on Sunday night at the end of an extraordinary party congress near the capital Maputo.\n\nFrelimo has won every national election since the end of the war for independence from Portugal in 1975 and also controls a large majority of local authorities.\n\nThe main opposition party, Renamo, accuses it of rigging recent national and local elections.\n\n- Youth vote -\n\nNyusi, 65, is prevented by the constitution from seeking a third term when Mozambicans vote on October 9 to choose their president, parliament and provincial authorities.\n\nOn Sunday, the president urged the divided Frelimo to \"give Daniel Chapo all our support\", after an internal election that saw Chapo's closest rival, Roque Silva, withdraw from the race at the last minute and resign from his post as Frelimo secretary general.\n\nChapo won with 225 votes out of 240 in the second round of voting after initially garnering 103 votes in the first round.\n\nThe former political science lecturer and radio presenter, who has a law degree, is the first Frelimo presidential candidate to be born after the southern Africa gained independence from Portugal in 1975.\n\nAll four presidents since 1975 have been Frelimo veterans of the independence struggle.\n\nThe party congress was marked by reports of party infighting and disagreements.\n\nSilva, rumoured to be Nyusi's preferred candidate, resigned from his position during the debates after failing to garner sufficient votes.\n\nSpeaking to reporters after his election on Sunday, Chapo pledged to be a unity candidate.\n\n\"We will work... with all layers of society -- young people, women, men and war veterans,\" he said.\n\n- Disputed election results -\n\nFrelimo's landslide victory in the last general election in 2019 was contested by the largest opposition party, Renamo, a former rebel group.\n\nAfter independence, Renamo and Frelimo fought a civil war from 1977 to 1992 that devastated the Mozambican economy and left almost one million people dead.\n\nIn October, at least two people were killed in protests over the results of local elections, which saw police open fire on demonstrators in several cities.\n\nRenamo called the protests after Frelimo was declared the winner in 64 of 65 local authorities.\n\nMozambique ranks seventh from bottom on the 191-country human development index compiled by the United Nations Development Programme.\n\nIt had high hopes for vast natural gas deposits -- the largest found south of the Sahara -- that were discovered in northern Cabo Delgado province in 2010.\n\nBut an insurgency waged by militants linked to the Islamic State group in the region has stalled

Its pick comes as a surprise as Chapo has never served in the national cabinet and his name didn't feature on most lists of potential winning candidates.\n\n\"Chapo demonstrated that he is committed to the party and the country,\" Nyusi said in a speech, in which he committed to stepping down after the election. \"The soap opera of speculation ends, including speculation about a third term.\"\n\nA law graduate and former radio announcer, Chapo, 47, was appointed governor of the central Inhambane province in 2016.

The nation is anticipating TotalEnergies SE's imminent return to a $20-billion-plus natural gas project it paused three years ago after militants staged attacks nearby. The revival of TotalEnergies' plan is crucial for a nation that's among the poorest in the world.\n\nNyusi has led Frelimo for the past decade and spent much of his two terms as president dealing with the fallout of scandal that erupted when the government admitted that it had failed to disclose debts of about $1.2 billion. He also sought to cut a peace deal with the main opposition party, known as Renamo, but while he was focused on demilitarizing Frelimo's old political foe, a new threat took hold in Mozambique's northern Cabo Delgado province.\n\nAttacks by a group that affiliated itself with Islamic State began in 2017 and rapidly escalated, ultimately derailing the gas project -- Africa's biggest private investment at the time. Mozambique's military struggled to assert control and maintain the trust of communities.\n\nAfter a major strike in March 2021 prompted Total's consortium to evacuate its staff and declare force majeure on the project, Nyusi reached a deal with Rwandan President Paul Kagame to send hundreds of soldiers to help restore order. He later agreed to accept other troops from the Southern African Development Community, a regional bloc. While the interventions were initially successful, the militants have escalated attacks this year.\n\nContaining the violence and convincing the gas developers that it's safe to resume work will be a key priority for Chapo.\n\nRenamo is scheduled to hold its own internal elections this month. Ossufo Momade, its current president, has faced internal criticism of his leadership.

According to a report on the independent television station STV, 103 members of the Central Committee voted for Chapo, and only 77 for his nearest rival, the party's General Secretary, Roque Silva.\n\nFrelimo parliamentarian Francico Mucanheia received 46 votes, while just three Central Committee members voted for the only woman in the race, Esperanca Bias, who is the speaker of the Mozambican parliament, the Assembly of the Republic.\n\nA fifth candidate, Damiao Jose, a member of the Frelimo Political Commission and a former spokesperson for the party, dropped out before the vote was taken.\n\n249 members of the Central Committee were present (out of a total of 254 full and 11 supplementary members).\n\nSince nobody received over 50 per cent of the votes, a second round was necessary, between the two candidates with the most votes, Daniel Chapo and Roque Silva.\n\nBut Roque Silva suddenly resigned - as general secretary, and as a potential presidential candidate. Chapo was now unopposed, and a debate took place as to whether, under these circumstances, a second round of voting was even necessary.\n\nBut the Central Committee decided to follow standard practice and held a second round, in which the Committee members gave overwhelming support to Chapo.\n\nHe received 225 votes, which was 94.1 per cent of the Central Committee members present. The final statement from the Committee did not reveal whether the other six per cent were blank votes or spoiled ballots.\n\nAfter his election, Chapo thanked the Central Committee members for the trust they had placed in him, and promised to honour his mission of winning the October presidential election.\n\nBeing the party's candidate for the Presidency was just another mission entrusted to him, said Chapo. \"In Frelimo, we work on the basis of missions\", he declared. \"The party trusts its cadres, and this is one more mission like the others I have previously performed\".\n\nThe current President of Frelimo, and of the Republic, Filipe Nyusi, declared that the election of Chapo as the party's presidential candidate should end the persistent speculation that he wanted to run for a third, and thus unconstitutional, term of office.\n\nFor years now there have been suggestions that Nyusi wanted a third term - although Nyusi himself never publicly declared this intention. The Mozambican Constitution states that nobody can be head of state for more than two consecutive five year terms of office. Thus, if Nyusi really did want another term, his supporters in parliament would have needed to amend the Constitution, and the Frelimo parliamentary group never showed any interest in doing so.\n\n\"The soap opera of speculations is over, including the soap opera about a third term of office\", said Nyusi. \"There was never any reason for such speculation - Frelimo respects the law\".\n\nNyusi said that, in Daniel Chapo, Frelimo has chosen a candidate with experience of leadership and who is able to respond to the challenges posed by the country's current dynamics. Judging by the results of the voting. Chapo is \"a candidate of consensus\", he added.\n\nChapo was chosen, Nyusi said, not because of his origin or ethnicity (he was born in the central province of Sofala), but because of his capacity to lead the destiny of the nation in the coming years.\n\nNyusi urged all Frelimo members to unite around Chapo in order to ensure victory in the forthcoming presidential, parliamentary and provincial elections.\n\nThe 47 year old Chapo is the first Frelimo presidential candidate who was born after independence (in February 1977), and thus took no part in the war to free the country from Portuguese colonial rule.\n\nHis experience of governance is at local level. In 2009, he was appointed administrator of Nacala-a-Velha district, in the northern province of Nampula. In 2015, he was transferred to the neighbouring province of Cabo Delgado, where he became administrator of Palma district.\n\nThe following year he was appointed governor of Inhambane province. In the 2019 provincial elections, he was elected governor, because he was head of the Frelimo list for members of the provincial assembly.\n\nProfessionally, Chapo is a jurist, who obtained a law degree from Maputo's Eduardo Mondlane University in 2000. He has taught constitutional law and political science, and was briefly a news reader on the Miramar radio station.", "source": {"uri": "clubofmozambique.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Frelimo respects the laws, he added, so there was no reason to speculate about new term limits.\n\nNyusi also encouraged party members to support Chapo in the upcoming elections.\n\nSince Mozambique's independence in 1975, all heads of state have been nominated by Frelimo.\n\nThe party has won all elections since multi-party democracy was introduced 30 years ago at the end of a crippling 16-year civil war which left over one million people dead and five million others internally displaced.\n\nChapo has been governor of Inhambane province since 2016. He holds a master's degree in development management from a university in Mozambique. Prior to entering politics, he taught constitutional law and political science at the Universidade Catolica in the port city of Beira, and worked as an announcer at a private radio station in the same city.\n\nAfter being confirmed as Frelimo's candidate, Chapo promised to work to promote the country's economic development.\n\nIf elected, Chapo will become Mozambique's fourth democratically elected head of state.\n\nChapo is viewed by analysts as a leader who may be able to restore security in the troubled oil- and gas-rich province of Cabo Delgado, where Islamic State-linked insurgents have been terrorizing civilians and destroying public infrastructure since 2017, forcing the interruption of multibillion-dollar projects.\n\nThe violence has continued despite support by troops from other countries of the Southern African Development Community, and soldiers from Rwanda.\n\nEconomic analyst and university lecturer Alcidio Bachita has high hopes for Chapo.\n\n\"He is an individual who has not been accused of any corruption schemes,\" Bachita said. \"And I believe that this change of leadership will open a new page in the history of Mozambique, given that he is a young man and was born after [the] independence period of the country. So I believe that the economy of Mozambique will witness a great performance in the coming years.\"\n\nMozambique will hold its seventh presidential and legislative elections on October 9.\n\nThe

Now he will be the presidential candidate for Frelimo, that country's ruling party since independence.\n\nHe will also be its first non-combatant in charge. From founding president Samora Machel to incumbent President Filipe Nyusi, all of Mozambique's leaders have been former guerrillas under Frelimo.\n\nFormer fighters were in the running for candidacy, some heavily favoured for it, but the nearly born-free Chapo beat them to the nomination.\n\nIf he wins, he will face high expectations as one of Africa's poorest countries seeks to combat jihadism while exploiting gas riches.\n\nNews24 spoke to Marisa Louren\u00e7o, a political and economic risk analyst with a deep understanding of Lusophone Africa, about Mozambique's likely next president.\n\nREAD MORE | Test for democracy: Africa 'jam packed' with elections in 2024\n\nQ: What was the fuss about Frelimo's internal election process?\n\nA: It's almost certain Frelimo will emerge victorious at the upcoming polls. This will be done through a combination of its liberation credentials (it fought against Portuguese colonialism until independence in 1975); its enormous organisational and mobilisation capacity; the demise of the key opposition parties, the Mozambican National Resistance and Mozambique Democratic Movement; and rigging through voter intimidation and ballot stuffing.\n\nThis means that whoever was chosen as the incoming Frelimo president is more than likely to be the next head of state, making an internal party matter a wider national issue.\n\nQ: Frelimo's presidential candidate selection is always a tightly guarded secret until voting time. Can you explain how the process works?\n\nA: There is a central committee, made up of 250 elected party members, with representation from all 11 provinces, and a political commission, which has 19 members, including the incumbent president and the party secretary-general.\n\nThe remaining 17 are senior politicians, often handpicked by the former president (depending on his hold over the party once he leaves office) and the incumbent (depending on the extent to which he has managed to get his allies into the inner circle).\n\nWhile the central committee meets twice or three times a year, the political commission meets every week, underlining its position as the most powerful decision-making body in Frelimo.\n\nIn an election year, the political commission presents a shortlist to the central committee, usually by mid-March, with up to three names, from which the central committee will vote.\n\nIf the central committee indicates displeasure with the selection, it can reject the list or request that the political commission add new names.\n\nThe winning candidate must receive more than 50% of the total vote.\n\nFailing that, a run-off between the two candidates with the highest vote shares is held.\n\nALSO READ | Mozambique's Constitutional Council to rule on disputed election results; Renamo readies for protest\n\nQ: There was a lot of drama this time around. Can you tell us about it?\n\nA: Well, March came and went without a shortlist or explanation, and so did April.\n\nEventually, an extraordinary meeting on the question of the presidential succession was called for 4 and 5 May.\n\nThe most likely reason for the delay was Nyusi's manoeuvring behind the scenes. He is the outgoing president but wants to stay in control behind the scenes, through his allies.\n\nIndicative of Nyusi's and the political commission's struggle to achieve this, at the end of April, local news outlets reported that the central committee had outright rejected the political commission's first shortlist.\n\nThe political commission on 4 May finally presented three candidates for consideration to the central committee: Roques Silva; Frelimo secretary-general Chapo, who is also governor of Inhambane province; and Dami\u00e3o Jos\u00e9, a member of the political commission.\n\nThe central committee, still dissatisfied with the list, requested additional candidates for consideration, though to its surprise - and consternation - on 5 May there appeared two of Nyusi's allies, without regard for the central committee's own recommendations.\n\nThe additional names were Esperan\u00e7a Bias, the president of parliament; and Francisco Mucanheia, one of Nyusi's advisors.\n\nQ: How did Nyusi influence the system?\n\nA: Nyusi brushed aside the central committee's protests, saying the body's only responsibility was to vote.\n\nHowever, this could pose a danger for Nyusi. Frelimo's constitution states that if 75% of the central committee's members refuse to vote, this makes way for the immediate removal of the incumbent.\n\nNyusi, though, appeared unconcerned - which showed he knew he could play his hand. Throughout his two terms in office, particularly from 2017 until March 2023, Nyusi has steadily placed his allies in key government positions and built up important bilateral relations within and outside the continent.\n\nQ: How does Chapo win?\n\nA: The central committee agreed to proceed to vote, though Jos\u00e9 dropped out, reducing the number of candidates to four.\n\nAfter the first round of voting, Chapo and Silva emerged as the top two contenders, with 41.2% and 30% of the vote, respectively.\n\nGiven that neither received the required 50%+1 to be declared the winner, a second round of voting was held.\n\nSilva dropped out, but the vote went ahead anyway, and garnered over 90% of the vote (Silva, immediately after the result was announced, stepped down as party secretary-general).\n\nA: He currently serves as the governor of Inhambane province, and his professional background is in law, journalism, and local and provincial politics.\n\nHe is, in many ways, a surprising choice. Frelimo's presidents often have military experience, like Samora Machel (1975-1986), Joaquim Chissano (1986-2005), and Armando Geubuza (2005-2015); or served as minister of defence, like Nyusi.\n\nHe is also young, born after Mozambique's 1975 liberation from Portugal.\n\nHe also maintained a relatively low profile throughout Nyusi's time in power, and most of his political positions have been significant but not transformative.\n\nQ: How does he protect Nyusi's interests?\n\nA: To have been handpicked by Nyusi, he must fit the bill somehow. It helps that Chapo upheld Frelimo's unwritten rule that its presidential candidates must rotate provinces for wider popular representation every five years.\n\nNyusi hails from the northern-most province of Cabo Delgado; his predecessor, Armando Guebuza, is from Nampula province, in the north-east; Chapo was born in Sofala province, which is located in the centre.\n\nBut this was not the main reason for his selection. Much more important is Chapo's likely closeness to Nyusi's favourite, senior Frelimo politician Celso Correia.\n\nNot only does Correia serve as minister of agriculture and rural development, but he has been responsible for the party's political campaigns, including Nyusi's 2019 re-election effort, and the most recent local elections in 2023, making him one of Nyusi's closest and most important allies.\n\nAdditionally, Correia, since February 2024, has been part of Frelimo's central brigade in Inhambane, part of a party initiative to assist newly deployed governors - including Chapo.\n\nChapo, through Correia, could therefore be Nyusi's way of keeping his hands on the wheels of power after the general elections on 9 October.", "source": {"uri": "news24.com", "dataType":

However, Nyusi's endorsement of Chapo signals a transition within FRELIMO's leadership.\n\nChapo, relatively unknown on the national political stage, currently serves as the governor of the southern province of Inhambane. His selection as the presidential candidate garnered overwhelming support from FRELIMO's central committee, with Chapo securing 94% of the votes.\n\nIn response to his nomination, Chapo expressed his commitment to working with all social strata, emphasizing inclusivity in his approach to governance. Born in 1977, Chapo holds a law degree and a Master's degree in development management.\n\nHe brings a diverse political background to the table, having served in various administrative roles, including as an administrator of the districts of Nacala and Palma.\n\nChapo's candidacy marks a generational shift within FRELIMO, as he becomes the first presidential candidate born after Mozambique's independence.\n\nWith his blend of academic qualifications and administrative experience, Chapo aims to lead FRELIMO to victory in the upcoming election, navigating the country through its political landscape.", "source": {"uri": "thezimbabwemail.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Zimbabwe Mail"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FRELIMO", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "FRELIMO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozambique", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mozambique"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mozambique"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filipe_Nyusi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Filipe Nyusi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruling_party", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ruling party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maputo", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Maputo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Maputo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mozambique"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Independence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Province", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Province"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inhambane", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inhambane"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Inhambane"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mozambique"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nacala", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nacala"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor_of_Laws", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bachelor of Laws"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "District"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master's_degree", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Master's degree"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Public_Administration", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Public Administration", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Civic_Participation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Civic Participation", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 65}], "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.thezimbabwemail.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Daniel-Chapo.jpg?fit=1140%2C474&ssl=1&w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542267", "eventUri": "eng-9542267", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mozambique"}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-09", "textStart": 152, "textEnd": 163}], "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

Now he will be the presidential candidate for Frelimo in the impending polls.\n\nOur Senior Reporter, Joseph Madzimure (JM), sat down for a conversation with Zimbabwe's Ambassador to Maputo, Cde Victor Matemadanda (VM), to discuss issues around the impending polls.\n\nJM: Can you give us an insight of what is happening in Mozambique ahead of the elections set for October this year?\n\nThe traditional way of Frelimo is that a candidate is elected a year before elections, but this time around the elections are going to be held on October 9 which means that there is not much time left.\n\nWhat I understand (is that) there were a number of candidates who contested for the highest office, but through their systems they reduced the candidates to a sizable number.\n\nTo start with, I am happy that the Central Committee of the Front for the Liberation of Mozambique (Frelimo) has elected Cde Daniel Francisco Chapo, the Governor of Inhambane Province as the party's candidate for the upcoming presidential elections on October 9.\n\nHe will replace the incumbent President Filipe Jacinto Nyusi who served since 2015 as the fourth President of Mozambique.\n\nHe is the current leader of Frelimo, the party that has governed Mozambique since its independence from Portugal in 1975.\n\nHe is development oriented and a regional communicator.\n\nThis is also important in modern day regional politics.\n\nHe is a lawyer by profession, a very level-headed person and he did some educational training here in Zimbabwe, he is also fluent in Shona.\n\nHe is a Pan-Africanist because we talked a lot about the region.\n\nWhen we were talking, I could sense that he is a regional leader in-terms of operation and his appreciation of issues affecting the SADC region.\n\nJM: As an observer, can you give us the selection criteria used to elect the successor?\n\nVM: The selection of Cde Daniel Chapo, who has been a member of Frelimo since 2000, was made after an internal vote during the third day of the committee's extraordinary meeting.\n\nThe meeting, initially scheduled for Friday last week, saw the participation of all 254 members of the Central Committee.\n\nCde Chapo emerged as the winner of the internal election, securing an impressive 94.1 percent of the vote from the committee members.\n\nHe is the frontrunner to succeed President Nyusi who has been in power since 2014.\n\nPresident Nyusi, also the President of Frelimo, is ineligible to run for a third term due to constitutional term limits.\n\nBorn in Inhaminga, Sofala Province, Cde Daniel Chapo holds a Degree in Law from the Faculty of Law at Eduardo Mondlane University in Maputo.\n\nJM: How did they come up with the succession plan and who qualifies to contest for the top office?\n\nVM: The approach in Mozambique is that past presidents still have the influence in the selection process, they also nominate the presidential candidates.\n\nHowever, all is now water under the bridge as they have to support the nominated candidate who will represent the party in the coming elections.\n\nDuring their extraordinary meeting, the political commission of Frelimo presented a list of pre-candidates that included Cdes Roque Silva, the party's general secretary, Daniel Chapo and Dami\u00e3o Jos\u00e9- a member of the Central Committee.\n\nHowever, after intense internal debates, the committee added two additional names to the list- Cdes Esperan\u00e7a Bias, the president of Parliament and Francisco Mucanheia, an advisor to President Nyusi.\n\nCde Dami\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 later withdrew from the race. As per Frelimo's statutes, the political commission is responsible for presenting a shortlist of three pre-candidates for the presidency to the Central Committee.\n\nWith Cde Daniel Chapo now officially endorsed as Frelimo's presidential candidate, the political landscape in Mozambique is set to witness an exciting contest as the country prepares for the upcoming general elections on October 9.\n\nJM: Do you think he is the best candidate for Frelimo to retain the party's supremacy in Mozambique?\n\nVM: From my own assessment, he is the best candidate.\n\nIn Mozambique politics, Frelimo is still dominant, but there is need to be cautious of the current emerging post-independence political parties.\n\nJM: For decades, revolutionary political parties (former liberation movements) have been dominant in Southern Africa but there is a new trend of opposition political parties being sponsored by former colonisers.\n\nWhat do you think needs to be done to counter foreign interference or influence in regional politics?\n\nVM: I think revolutionary or former liberation movements need to go back to the drawing board and see how best they can counter neo-colonial interests.\n\nThe enemy is still fighting hard and pushing for regime change by influencing our youth to revolt against revolutionary parties.\n\nOur former colonisers are regrouping and moulding the neo-colonial agenda.\n\nThey are bringing back to Africa all sorts of euphemistic and ephemeral ideologies.\n\nNow we do not have opposition parties who respect the outcome of the elections.\n\nTheir motivation is power for power's sake without any plausible or alternative policies.\n\nThe former colonisers are intent on recolonising Africa by using proxies.\n\nThis, they are doing through various ways that include sponsoring so-called civil society organisations and directly funding some political parties.", "source": {"uri": "manicapost.co.zw", "dataType": "news", "title": "The ManicaPost"},

We will try in the next weeks to catch up. Joseph Hanlon\n\nFrelimo names safe unknown as presidential candidate\n\nAfter a long and convoluted battle, Frelimo has followed the model of Nyusi a decade ago and chosen a seemingly safe and controllable unknown as their presidential candidate. Daniel Chapo is a 47-year-old lawyer, appointed governor of Inhambane in 2016 and then elected to the post in 2019. He will be the first presidential candidate born after independence.\n\nIn the face of bitter infighting President Filipe Nyusi kept tight control of the process, delaying the nomination until last weekend. For the Frelimo elite the battle was not about governing the country, but about protecting the Frelimo oligarchs' business interests, particularly contracts with government and mining and gas companies. For Nyusi it was ensuring that his successor would not be able to do to him what he did to his predecessor, Armando Guebuza - jailing his son and restricting Guebuza's business interests.\n\nThe presidential candidate is selected by the Frelimo Central Committee (CC), based on a short list drawn up by the ruling Political Commission (CP). A majority of the CC was named by, and is loyal to, Nyusi, who ensured it constantly delayed in drawing up a short list.\n\nUnusually, the several months of delay led to up to 40 names being put into circulation. Some senior party figures even covertly opened offices to promote their candidacy. Five political heavyweights were being promoted to the CC and in the press - former prime ministers Aires Ali and Luisa Diogo, former interior ministers Basilio Monteiro and Jose Pacheco, and former parliament speaker Eduardo Mulembw\u00e8. Samora Machel Junior was being promoted by some senior figures. And Agriculture Minister and 2023 campaign leader Celso Correia had initially seen himself as a possible presidential candidate.\n\nThe PC met on Thursday 2 May to finally name a short list to give to a CC meeting the next day. The PC debate continued into Friday, delaying the CC meeting. Nyusi won, and the short list was three loyal apparatchiks:\n\n+ Roque Silva Samuel, party general secretary and thus CP member (Supported by Nyusi);\n\n+ Damiao Jose, former party spokesperson and current CP member;\n\n+ Daniel Chapo, a member for the CC but not of the CP.\n\nThe CC was not pleased and after some debate Nyusi agreed that list could be sent back demanding more names. Former presidents Joaquim Chissano and Armando Guebuza also pressed for a wider shortlist. The CP added two names from parliament:\n\n+ Esperan\u00e7a Bias, Speaker of Parliament and\n\n+ Francisco Mucanheia, Chair of the Committee on Public Administration and Local Authority, and an energy expert, previously close to Guebuza but now a trusted advisor of Nyusi.\n\nSo the longer list remained one of trusted apparatchiks and included none of the experienced party heavyweights. At this point CP member Damiao Jose withdrew, leaving four candidates.\n\nIn the first ballot of four people, Chapo won 103 votes, Roque Silva 77, Francisco Mucanheia 46, and speaker Esperanca Bias only 3.\n\nThis was seen as a strong vote against Roque Silva, so he dropped out of the race, and resigned as party secretary general and thus from the CP. On the second round on Sunday night, had the backing of Nyusi and won with 225 votes.\n\nChapo has won some praise as governor of Inhambane, with good leadership and a focus on solving the problems of the population. Zitamar (6 May) quotes Eugenio Arao, a political analyst and university lecturer in Inhambane, to say that in all the years that Chapo has worked in Inhambane, he is not known to have behaved inappropriately. Savana (5 May) comments that Chapo \"is apparently not a figure with a strong commitment to any wing within the party\" but the bitter meetings over the weekend show he will inherit a deeply divided party. And he will be seen as a younger generation candidate.\n\nOpposition choosing candidates\n\nOn Sunday 5 May the second opposition party, MDM (Mozambique Democratic Movement), announced that it has selected as presidential candidate Lutero Simango, head of the parliamentary delegation and brother of party founder Daviz Simango (who died of Covid in 2021). The other candidate was Beira mayor Albano Carige, who withdrew.\n\nRenamo has not yet chosen its candidate but will do so at a congress 15-16 May. Afonso Dhlakama led Renamo from 1979 through the war which ended in 1992, until he died of diabetes related conditions on 3 May 2018. Former guerrilla Ossufo Momade was elected president at a congress at Renamo's Gorongosa base on 17 January 2019 for a five year term, which some say has now been expired. Renamo has two dynamic younger people, Manuel de Ara\u00fajo, who is mayor of Quelimane, and Venancio Mondlane, who was elected mayor of Maputo last year, but denied the victory by the Constitutional Council. In order to be named presidential candidate next week, he is marginalising Mondlane and Ara\u00fajo and may block them from attending the Congress.\n\nLutero Simango and Ossufo Momade are much weaker campaigners that their late predecessors, and they are being challenges by younger and more dynamic local leaders. But it appears that both leaders are happy to remain as official opposition parties. MDM is effectively a family party which wins in and successfully run Beira, and seem happy to stay that way. The younger generation in Renamo want the party to be to be a political opposition to Frelimo today, naot a guerrilla opposition from three decades ago. But Momade seems happy to be leader of the opposition, receiving significant money from the government, with the main goal of organising the retirement of guerrillas.\n\nNeither MDM nor Renamo leaders see their parties as an opposition which can win, whereas younger members say \"we were born after the war and want to be an opposition for today that can beat Frelimo\".\n\nIs Frelimo victory inevitable?\n\nA victory for Chapo and Frelimo seems inevitable. In part this is due to the growing level of fraud and misconduct in the electoral system. The National Election Commission is on course to register a million more voters than there are voting age adults for the 9 October election. Renamo provided proof that it won local elections last year in Maputo and Matola, but the Constitutional Council simply gave the victory to Frelimo.\n\nSecond, the leadership of the Renamo and MDM opposition are too comfortable being the opposition. They are not motivated to do the serious political organising required the challenge Frelimo nor to allow space for younger and more dynamic leaders. So both Frelimo and opposition are happy to ignore younger voters.\n\nThird the international community strongly backs Frelimo, and will not challenge another fraudulent election. Their capitals want resources and investment opportunities, and do not argue if benefits from the projects go to Frelimo oligarchs instead of local people.", "source": {"uri": "clubofmozambique.com",

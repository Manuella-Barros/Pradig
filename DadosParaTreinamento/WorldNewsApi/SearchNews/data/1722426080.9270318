{"id": 243283214, "title": "County buys, demolishes store next to flood-damaged Rapidan Dam before it fell into river", "text": "RAPIDAN, Minn. \u2014 County officials bought and demolished a southern Minnesota family store that was precariously perched beside a cliff near a flood-damaged dam, officials said Friday. Blue Earth County bought the Rapidan Dam Store and then removed the structure to lessen the downstream impact if it tumbled into the Blue Earth River, the county said in a statement. For decades, the Hruska family had operated the store and lived in a nearby house, but recent heavy rain caused the river to rise dramatically upstream and cut a channel between the Rapidan Dam and the riverbank. The house collapsed into the river Tuesday and the river continued to erode the land near the store, which was famous for its homemade pie. \u201cThe Dam Store was an integral part of the community and remains embedded in the memories of many residents,\u201d the statement said. \u201cOur thoughts are with the Hruska family and everyone close to them.\u201d No one was reported injured by the dam\u2019s partial failure. Officials said the aging concrete dam, located a few miles southwest of Mankato, remains stable as does a county highway bridge just upriver. However, officials are warily watching both structures, noting that the still-surging river has drastically changed the area. The county didn\u2019t disclose what it paid for the store. On Thursday, county employees and the Hruska family worked to remove a bar, booths, kitchen appliances and other items from the shelves. Flooding in the last week has caused millions of dollars in damage to bridges, homes and roads across Minnesota, Iowa, Nebraska and South Dakota. High water was blamed for at least three deaths in the Upper Midwest.", "summary": "No one was reported injured by the dam's partial failure.", "url": "https://www.twincities.com/2024/06/28/county-buys-demolishes-store-next-to-flood-damaged-rapidan-dam-before-it-fell-into-river/", "image": "https://www.twincities.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/STP-L-MNFLOOD-0628-001.jpg?w=1024", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 03:19:33", "author": "The Associated Press", "authors": ["The Associated Press"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.393}

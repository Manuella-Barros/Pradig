{"id": 223730018, "title": "Vital work to upgrade East Kilbride station takes a step forward", "text": "Network Rail has hit three important milestones as part of its ongoing improvement works at East Kilbride station. Engineers demolished the kiosk building, removed part of the platform at one side and extended it at the other to allow the construction of a new station building and installation of overhead line equipment. The platform work is vital in allowing the station to accommodate longer trains on the East Kilbride to Glasgow route as part of the East Kilbride enhancement project. In addition, the railway buffer, which is used to mark the end of the line, was moved in preparation for the platform to be extended by 25m next year \u2013 a move which will create space for more passengers. Ailish Allan, scheme project manager, Network Rail said: \u201cThe completion of these three pieces of work means that we can begin construction of the new East Kilbride station building. \u201cThe community will benefit from a new modern station building facilitating an electrified railway line. \u201cI\u2019d like to thank the public for their continued patience while we carry out this essential work.\u201d Work at East Kilbride station began in March this year. The East Kilbride enhancement project is due for completion in December 2025. The 16-month programme is a key milestone in the East Kilbride enhancement project. This is part of a wider \u00a3139.8m investment at the centre of the Scottish Government\u2019s ongoing strategy to decarbonise Scotland\u2019s Railway. Network Rail said that \u201cworks have progressed significantly\u201d since activity got underway on the wider enhancement project. Three successful bridge demolitions were delivered over Christmas and New Year to generate the required height clearance below two of the bridges for the new overhead electrification equipment. When complete, the new building, located within the existing station footprint between Torrance Road and West Mains Road, will be more modern and accessible, with improved passenger facilities, a new booking office, a waiting area and a small retail unit. Part of the station works include extending the existing platform by 51m to accommodate longer trains. Electric services will be introduced on the East Kilbride line following completion of the project in December 2025 and will offer enhanced train performance and service flexibility on the route. *Don't miss the latest headlines from around Lanarkshire.

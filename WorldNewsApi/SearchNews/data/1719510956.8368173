Superstorm Sandy and Hurricane Ida, among other storms, increased the sediment and nutrients in the water, preventing light from reaching seagrass. Jackman said that after recent major storms, the Hudson River recorded significant decreases in submerged plants. \u201cWhen conditions are turbid, if there's a lot of suspended sediment or if there's a lot of floating phytoplankton [algae], that will cut down the light and stress the seagrass,\u201d said Lathrop. \u201cSeagrass do best when the waters are clear.\u201d In a healthy waterway, the submerged aquatic vegetation helps keep the water clear by filtering sediment through its roots and leaves. Pollution is another reason seagrass is shrinking. In New York City, the combined sewer system discharges raw sewage into waterways during heavy rains. On Long Island, septic tanks leach sewage into the groundwater, which eventually ends up in the bay. Agricultural and lawn care runoff from fertilizers also add nitrogen to the water, encouraging the growth of algal blooms. Carl LoBue, director of New York ocean programs for the nonprofit Nature Conservancy, said 70% of residents and businesses in Suffolk County aren\u2019t connected to a sewer system. \u201cThey basically flush their toilets into the ground, and then that flows through the groundwater right into the bay untreated,\u201d he said. Boats are another problem, as their propellers can chop up the ribbonlike sea grasses, which can take several years to regrow. \u201cWe've documented propeller scarring, boats basically driving over seagrass beds and ripping up seagrass,\u201d Lathrop said. \u201cThat's more of a spot disturbance, but we've mapped miles of propeller scars through the Barnegat Bay.\u201d Conservation efforts are in the early stages. One experimental method includes transplanting grass harvested from healthy waterways, though the strategy has had mixed results. The state Department of Environmental Conservation plans to begin rearing seagrass in greenhouses that will then be planted in the the Hudson River. By the end of this year, the agency will release an updated map for the river\u2019s submerged aquatic vegetation. It's expected to reveal the extent of the underwater forest\u2019s decline. \u201cSeagrass are really cool, just kind of swaying in the currents and just kind of floating over and seeing sponges and crabs, and some of the other critters that live there,\u201d Lathrop said. \u201cThey really are an important part of our coastal system that may be somewhat underappreciated by the public. But they are a key component of our ecosystem, especially if you like to fish, you like to crab and [like] having healthy water quality.\u201d", "summary": "<img src=\"https://images-prod.gothamist.com/original_images/G0041208_Adam_Starke.JPG\" alt=\"Underwater grass.\" />\n  \n    <p>Seagrass in the Hudson River by New York City.

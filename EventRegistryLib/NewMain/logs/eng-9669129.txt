However, balancing the duties of parenting four daughters presents an altogether different challenge for Stafford off the turf. Juggling between the demands of fatherhood and an intense football career becomes difficult when handling an all-female household. Which made him share something \"scary\" that comes with raising daughters.\n\nOn the Father's Day edition of 'The Morning After' podcast titled \"Girl Dads Day,\" Kelly Stafford and her husband Matthew shared the ups and downs of being parents.\n\nAhead of Father's Day, Kelly Stafford took a moment to appreciate her husband's skills as a father. She commends Matthew's ability to balance a masculine sport while nurturing their daughters, before discussing the concerns about raising girls in today's society.\n\nAs the conversation progressed, Kelly questioned Matthew about the most \"scary\" aspect of raising their four daughters. To which, Matthew shared his concerns about protecting their daughters from social media influences and lack of expertise in dealing with the unpredictable internet world. Before wrapping up his answer, the Rams QB stressed about striking a balance between protecting their children and allowing them the freedom to grow.\n\n\"Social media, I'm not good at,\" he said. \"I don't understand how all of it works, and I would not be able to guide them in the right direction with that. I think that part of the world is hard for me, and just the access that other people have to them. And the number of people that can positively or, most likely, negatively influence their day, their attitude, their lifestyle -- that number is huge now.\"\n\nAgreeing with Matthew's opinion, Kelly stressed the effect of social media on young girls and boys. Her main concern was the high amount of public scrutiny that comes with high-profile lifestyles in the spotlight. Having said that, she also recognized that their daughters will inevitably come across this virtual world.\n\n\"Trying to be able to protect them from that influence, but at the same time understand that that's the way the world's moving, and you've got to be able to find a happy medium. That's going to be a hard thing for me. That's a scary thing,\" Stafford added.\n\nThree of Matthew Stafford's daughters have already hit the school-age. Given the children's fast-approaching adolescence, it clearly explains why Matthew and Kelly are super concerned about their experience with social media.\n\nMatthew Stafford and Kelly are parents to four daughters, Tyler (3), Hunter (5), and twins Sawyer and Chandler (6). The couplet was born through IVF in 2017 when the pair were going through fertility issues.\n\nPreviously, Kelly has openly shared how their daughters are supportive of their father and recalled a moment when the girl squad accompanied the Super Bowl LVI winner to the stadium for the first time.\n\nComing to the power couple, Matthew and Kelly, met as college sweethearts at the University of Georgia and tied the knot in 2015.

Mandatory Credit: Gary A. Vasquez-USA TODAY Sports\n\nBack in 2015, Matthew Stafford and his wife Kelly embarked on an adventurous honeymoon journey in New Zealand, an experience that still gives Kelly chills nine years later. Recently, she took to Instagram to share a glimpse of that adventure, including a moment of bungee jumping where the Rams quarterback, in proper gear, hugged Kelly and smiled for the camera.\n\nOne might be captivated by the scenic mountain view, but it's the hundreds of feet drop that looks bone-chilling. In her Instagram post, Kelly also wrote a caption that wasn't for the faint-hearted.\n\n\"If you're not attempting death, you're not really living Had a little storytime with this most recent episode,\" Kelly wrote, accompanied by a 'CoupleGoals' hashtag.\n\nIn her Instagram story too, Kelly elaborated on the experience. \"Glad we survived our honeymoon,\" she wrote. Undoubtedly, while it was terrifying, it was also thrilling for the couple.\n\nThat said, what better way to start their new phase in life together than with new experiences and a rush of emotions? Married in 2015, the Staffords have since shared a life filled with adventure and joy, raising their four daughters together.\n\nKelly and Matthew Stafford's adventurous honeymoon in 2015 in New Zealand was marked by several exciting activities. Kelly posted glimpses of their time on Instagram, showing that the couple clearly had the time of their life. They enjoyed bungee jumping, skydiving, speed boating, and sightseeing in the mountains, all against the backdrop of New Zealand's scenic beauty.\n\nKelly Stafford also provided some insider views of their stay that had Matthew embracing his footballer side. Despite being on honeymoon, Matthew's dedication to his fitness regimen didn't budge. Kelly previously posted a video showing Matthew climbing up and down flights of stairs, surrounded by beautiful red-tinted trees and fresh scenery.\n\n\"Meanwhile in queenstown, New Zealand... My hubby is getting his workout on,\" she wrote in the caption.\n\nDespite Kelly Stafford joking that the couple survived their honeymoon, it was truly a dream trip for two adventurous lovers. Since then, the duo has moved from Detroit to Hollywood, with Matthew clinching a Super Bowl, and Kelly becoming quite the internet personality with a successful podcast.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsrush.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsRush"}, "authors": [{"uri": "anushree_gupta@thesportsrush.com", "name": "Anushree Gupta", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Rams", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Rams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Stafford", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Matthew Stafford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SoFi_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SoFi Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bungee_jumping", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bungee jumping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFC_Championship_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NFC Championship Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_49ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco 49ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inglewood,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inglewood, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Inglewood, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashtag", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hashtag"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood,_Los_Angeles", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hollywood, Los Angeles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_celebrity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internet celebrity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_fitness", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Physical fitness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Survivalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Survivalism", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Extreme_Sports/Bungee_Jumping", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Extreme Sports/Bungee Jumping", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Weddings/Gift_Registry", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Weddings/Gift Registry", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure_Racing/Schools", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure Racing/Schools", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Criminals", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Criminals", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 56}], "image": "https://cdn-wp.thesportsrush.com/2024/03/125f50b0-yagya-fis-78.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9669129", "eventUri": "eng-9669129", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

When she makes her way onto your Twitter timeline because she inevitably said or did something to piss people off, you KNOW kickoff is right around the corner.\n\nKelly Stafford and drama are the most perfect combo in the history of time. Like PB & J. Fries and ketchup. Angel Reese and pettiness. Biden and incoherent sentences.\n\nThey all work together beautifully, and Kelly Stafford deserves to be on that list.\n\nAnyway, right on cue - on an otherwise slow day in the NFL - Kelly is currently going viral because she went on some podcast and said she dated Matt Stafford's backup at Georgia just to make him jealous.\n\nSuch a ruthless move, and the internet is currently having NONE of it. I don't think I've seen one human on that insufferable app that's on Kelly's side here.\n\nSo, I guess I'll be the first? I don't know - I don't see the big deal. It's a tale as old as time.\n\nIs it sort of a scumbag move? Sure. But kids are, by nature, scumbags. You were a scumbag in college. I was a scumbag in college.\n\nWe did things between the ages of 15-24 that we'll all take to our graves. You're thinking of one right now. Personally, I could write a book. The difference here is, Kelly Stafford usually shoots from the hip and says whatever the hell is on her mind.\n\nSometimes, it angers the mob. Earlier this year, she found herself under fire because she claimed that Lions fans booed her kids during the playoff game. Then, she kinda-sorta backtracked. That may have been a swing and a miss.\n\nBUT, she also defended Charissa Thompson when the sports media mob was after her because she admitted to making up sideline quotes once in a while. I was #TeamKelly on that one, because I thought it was silly, too.\n\nSee? Sometimes she pisses people off. Other times, she makes sense. The very definition of a wild card.\n\nAnyway, everyone is A) pissed at Kelly over this, and B) trying to figure out the backup QB in question. The popular answer seems to be Joe Cox, which is especially funny because of his last name.\n\nNow, Joe Cox could certainly be the cocksman (see what I did?!),but there's also the theory that it was actually Logan Gray. Not nearly as much fun, but if Joe's wife is adamant that her future husband didn't fool around with Kelly Stafford during their years in Athens, we have to consider it:\n\nEither way, it sounds like the Sunday morning meetings in the UGA QB room were filled with plenty of sexual tension, and that sounds like a blast.", "source": {"uri": "outkick.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "OutKick"}, "authors": [{"uri": "zach_dean@outkick.com", "name": "Zach Dean", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stafford", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stafford"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Stafford"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Stafford", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Matthew Stafford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel_Reese", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Angel Reese"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketchup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ketchup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kickoff_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kickoff (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_video", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Viral video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logan_Gray", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Logan Gray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Cox_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Cox (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charissa_Thompson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charissa Thompson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_journalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sports journalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_card_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wild card (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Athens"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Athens"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Greece"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Backup", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Backup", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Moving_and_Relocating", "label": "dmoz/Home/Moving and Relocating", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Moving_and_Relocating/Moving", "label": "dmoz/Home/Moving and Relocating/Moving", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Criminals", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Criminals", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 51}], "image": "https://static.outkick.com/www.outkick.com/content/uploads/2024/06/Kelly-Stafford-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9669129", "eventUri": "eng-9669129", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 168, "relevance": 1}

While a lot has happened since then, Kelly recently revealed on a podcast what all went into the start of their relationship, and how it was difficult to get the star Bulldogs QB to date her at first.\n\nOne of her primary tactics was actually dating the backup QB at Georgia to make Matthew jealous and win over his affection.\n\nThe name of the backup was never said, but by going through the Georgia roster from the years that Stafford was there, it seems that the most likely candidate would be Joe Cox, who was behind Stafford on the depth chart for his entire career in Athens.\n\nHowever, some people on social media are saying that rather, it was backup QB/WR Logan Gray who was the culprit.\n\nRegardless of who it was, it appears that Kelly made the right decision in the end, as her husband Matthew has gone on to win Super Bowl LVI and make multiple Pro Bowls in his NFL career.\n\nRelated: Controversial Jayson Tatum Billboard Ignites Tensions in Rival Team's Territory", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "zachary_neel@postandcourier.com", "name": "Zachary Neel", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_Bulldogs_and_Lady_Bulldogs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Georgia Bulldogs and Lady Bulldogs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Georgia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of Georgia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_LVI", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl LVI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Cox_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Cox (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pro Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billboard_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Billboard (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logan,_Utah", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Logan, Utah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Logan, Utah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens,_Georgia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Athens, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Athens, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Backup", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Backup", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Advice", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/E-zines", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/E-zines", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/8/03/8031e880-ac15-5b99-bac1-71e6021a9515/66749eb1680a2.image.jpg?crop=1199%2C629%2C0%2C85&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9669129", "eventUri": "eng-9669129", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

Today's News in 90 seconds - 29th May 2024 \"I want to pass on my condolences to the family of the man who tragically passed away in the fire, who I understand was aged in his 40s. \"I believe there's about 20 apartments in that block itself. The local guards acted very quickly once they were alerted to the fire. They heroically went around the apartment block, door-to-door, telling people to get out right now and they managed to get everyone out safely except for the poor man. \u201cI really want to commend their brave work,\" said Cllr Clear.", "summary": "<p>A man has died and three garda\u00ed have been injured following a fire at a residential property in Kildare in the early hours of this morning.</p>", "url": "https://www.independent.ie/regionals/kildare/news/man-dies-and-three-gardai-injured-in-residential-fire-in-kildare/a1698918112.html", "image": "https://focus.independent.ie/thumbor/OzidrENPwBSTvzbj6kQloKa1FCs=/11x0:608x398/550x550/prod-mh-ireland/a135951c-912d-4180-ab8d-f2679544140b/397f0751-b5a2-42e1-8e43-1cca1d06a2f8/a135951c-912d-4180-ab8d-f2679544140b.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 12:19:40", "author": "Aisling Bolton-dowling", "authors": ["Aisling Bolton-dowling"], "language": "en", "source_country": "ie", "sentiment": -0.577}

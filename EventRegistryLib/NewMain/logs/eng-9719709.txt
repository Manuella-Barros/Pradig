When light reflects off shiny jewelry, it resembles the sheen of fish scales.Avoid waters with known discharges or sewage and waters used for any type of fishing especially if there are signs of baitfish or feeding activityUse extra caution when waters are murkyRemember that sharks see contrast particularly well. Uneven tans and bright colored clothing may draw a shark's attention.Refrain from excess splashing, as this may draw a shark's attention.Do not allow pets in the water, their erratic movements may draw a shark's attention.Swim only in areas tended by lifeguards.Do not enter the water if sharks are known to be present and get out of the water if sharks are sighted.\n\nGet today's headlines in minutes with Your Florida Daily:", "source": {"uri": "clickorlando.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WKMG"}, "authors": [{"uri": "treasure_roberts@clickorlando.com", "name": "Treasure Roberts", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shark", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Smyrna_Beach,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New Smyrna Beach, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Smyrna Beach, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volusia_County,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Volusia County, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Volusia County, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarasota,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sarasota, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sarasota, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wound", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wound"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tendon", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tendon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tendon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bait_fish", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bait fish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bleeding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstruation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Menstruation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sewage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sewage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fishing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fish"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Fishing", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Fishing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Fish_and_Aquaria", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Fish and Aquaria", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Water_Sports/Surfing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Water Sports/Surfing", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://res.cloudinary.com/graham-media-group/image/upload/f_auto/q_auto/c_thumb,w_700/v1/media/gmg/JWWLQGR4C5FKPIIC7IYIE6OFBM.png?_a=ATAPphC0", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719709", "eventUri": "eng-9719709", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Smyrna Beach, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-04", "textStart": 227, "textEnd": 233}], "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 206, "relevance": 1}

(WSVN) -- A young swimmer, who survived a shark attack off the coast of Florida, is sharing his story of the moment he came face-to-face with the shark.\n\nTwenty-one-year-old Connor Baker said he was tossing a ball around in the water like he had been doing all week long, when he felt something in his foot.\n\n\"It felt like my foot was getting like stabbed and sliced at the same time, at the top and bottom,\" said Baker. \"Even though it hurt bad, and I saw the initial gash, I didn't think it was that bad.\"\n\nBaker said he was spending his Fourth of July holiday in New Smyrna Beach, Florida. He was throwing the ball to his girlfriend's brother when the attack occurred.\n\n\"Maybe made two or three passes, that was it, not even been in the water for five minutes, and I kinda jumped to catch one,\" said Baker. \"All of a sudden, I felt like something like stabbed the top and bottom of my foot.\"\n\nHe rushed out of the water where he was met by his friend and his girlfriend, who is a nurse.\n\n\"Yeah, I'm a nurse but I've never seen anything like that before,\" said Haley Moore, Baker's girlfriend.\n\nBaker explained how his girlfriend jumped into action to help his bleeding leg.\n\n\"She started putting pressure on it with a towel, like on my leg to stop the bleeding,\" said Baker.\n\nA nearby swimmer, an Emergency Medical Technician who was on vacation, came to Baker's aid as Moore flagged down a local sheriff who put a tourniquet around Baker's leg.\n\n\"The lady came screaming in, 'We need help, I need help,' and the man was kinda limping in fell in kinda the shallow part of the water, and next thing you know paramedics were coming up to him. You could tell he was in pain. You could see the blood coming off of the sand,\" said witness John Grindle.\n\nAt the hospital, doctors initially thought Baker only had one tendon ruptured by the shark bite.\n\n\"He said it would be an hour surgery. Turned out to be a four-hour surgery because I had three more tendons ruptured,\" said Baker.\n\nOfficials said Baker is lucky that the shark missed a nerve in his foot.\n\nWhile it will take about six to seven weeks until Baker can apply pressure on his foot and move it, he is expected to walk again after he's healed.\n\n\"The nerve, not getting hit, was such a blessing for us because that could have affected me walking probably permanently,\" said Baker.\n\nNew Smyrna Beach is known as the shark bite capital of the world.\n\nCopyright 2024 Sunbeam Television Corp.

He's so fast to the football.\"\n\nBaker's overall ranking from last season did drop a bit, as Baker ranked as the third-best player in ESPN's accumulation of NFL opinions last offseason.\n\nBaker spent some time on injured reserve and forced no turnovers with the second-lowest amount of tackles (87) in his career despite still receiving a Pro Bowl nod.\n\nBaker - now entering a contract year - has all eyes on him in the desert.\n\n\"For me, I love this game. I play it at a high level each and every week because of the work I put in each and every week. And, for me, I'm an honest believer in just controlling what I can control and do my job. At the end of the day, everything else will take care of itself,\" said Baker earlier this offseason.\n\nBaker finished above names such as Derwin James, Kyle Dugger, Talanoa Hufanga and Xavier McKinney to round out the top ten of ESPN's voting.\n\nMoving into 2024, there's hope that more help is on the way for Baker.

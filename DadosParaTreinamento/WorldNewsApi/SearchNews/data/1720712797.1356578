{"id": 232107494, "title": "Starfield: Shattered Space DLC gets debut trailer, release date", "text": "Bethesda has finally revealed the launch date for Starfield\u2019s Shattered Space DLC at Summer Game Fest. The inaugural piece of DLC for Bethesda\u2019s latest open-world RPG, to be released in 2024, will introduce a new quest line centered around a mysterious Great Serpant in addition to a robust helping of new ship parts, weapons, and quality-of-life improvements. Shattered Space was announced prior to Starfield\u2019s launch, and was sold as part of the $99.99 Premium Edition of the game players purchased around nine months ago. The team announced new changes heading to the game on Sunday that will introduce new locations, gear, and bounties to the game. Starfield has enjoyed a myriad of changes and improvements from its dedicated modding community, but this DLC represents the most substantial official changes to Starfield since its launch back in September. Bethesda\u2019s post-launch support for the game has been limited to a handful of updates, which have largely focused on addressing bugs and performance issues. While a new storyline is always a welcome addition, personally, I\u2019m more excited about the new customization options Shattered Space is promising, so I can build even crazier ships and settlements.", "url": "https://www.polygon.com/24172975/starfield-dlc-shattered-space-launch-date-announcement-summer-game-fest", "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iI6ybFnlqz-2DmlvCWxy2GYrSqA=/0x75:1920x1080/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25484066/vlcsnap_2024_06_09_13h15m10s098.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 17:23:27", "author": "Alice Jovan\u00e9e", "authors": ["Alice Jovan\u00e9e"], "language": "en", "catgory": "entertainment", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.288}

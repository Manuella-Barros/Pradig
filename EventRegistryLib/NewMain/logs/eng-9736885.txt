As the fourth season of The Boys is drawing to a close - with one episode left to release on Prime Video - Starr, who plays Homelander in the show, is preparing himself for the emotional roller coaster of shooting the fifth and final season. It was only in the last two months that showrunner Eric Kripke confirmed that The Boys will end with its fifth season, having said for years that he wasn't sure how long the show would run for. The Boys has been a mainstay of the modern streaming era, producing some of the most memorable and vile superhero moments in TV history. But one of the show's stars isn't quite ready to hang up his star-spangled cape.\n\nSpeaking to IGN, Antony Starr discussed the show's ongoing fourth season, and was asked to look ahead to shooting the fifth and final season of The Boys. The actor said he can't look that far ahead yet because it will make him too emotional. Starr is currently focused on enjoying and embracing the ongoing fourth season, with the final episode streaming on July 18. Starr said:\n\n\"Oh, I can't think of that yet. I can't go there yet because, first of all, we've got a long way to go, and I want to make the most of it and enjoy it. I'm enjoying what's happening with the show at the moment. We worked so hard on Season 4 across the board, everyone from the caterers to everyone that works in the production office to the actors, to cast, the producers, directors... Everyone's put so much into it, so it's great to have this very warped creature of a season come out and be released on the world.\"\n\nAntony Starr Isn't Ready to Hang Up Homelander's Cape The Boys - Season 4 TV-MASuperheroActionComedy 2.5/5\n\nIn season four of The Boys, Victoria Neuman is closer than ever to the Oval Office and under the control of Homelander.

As the main antagonist of The Boys, Starr's narcissistic, violent, milk-loving version of Superman, has become an internet icon, terrifying audiences and being turned into endless memes. For Starr, working on The Boys has been an amazing experience, as the show's cast have traversed some beautiful and strange moments together, including the COVID pandemic. Starr explained:\n\n\"If I stop to think about it, it'll be really sad. It's been such a long road with the show. We started before COVID, and we released Season 2 in COVID. We did all the press for that in seclusion and isolation in our homes, and then all of a sudden we came back. We shot in COVID. It's been such a ride together with this group of people that it'll be very sad. It'll be a sad day to hang up the spandex.\"\n\nRelated The Boys Showrunner Reveals the Only Way the Series Can End\n\nEric Kripke reveals the big conflict that will bring The Boys' fifth and final season to a close.\n\n2\n\nWhile The Boys has become one of Prime Video's highest rated shows, season 4 has divided the fan base, with some questioning its on-the-nose approach to the show's signature satire. Add to that the confused section of the fan base that actually root for Homelander, and The Boys season 4 holds the show's lowest audience score on Rotten Tomatoes. The disgruntled fans are hoping that season 5 will put the show back on top form and end the acclaimed, Emmy-winning show with a bang.\n\nThe Boys season 4 is currently streaming on Prime Video.

The final episode of the Prime Video series dropped on the streamer Thursday, and there's a lot to digest in the season finale. For example, Billy Butcher is knocking on death's door, and Neuman is close to being sworn into being President. However, the details behind that development caused the creators behind The Boys to assure the fanbase that the events in the Season 4 finale are fictitious, and are not inspired by the recent attack at a Donald Trump Presidential rally.\n\n\"The season finale of The Boys contains scenes of fictional political violence, which some viewers may find disturbing, especially in light of the injuries and tragic loss of life sustained during the assassination attempt on former President Trump,\" a statement from The Boys and Prime Video on social media reads.\n\n\"The Boys is a fictitious series that was filmed in 2023, and any scene or plotline similarities to these real-world events are coincidental and unintentional,\" the statement continues. \"Amazon, Sony Pictures Television, and the producers of The Boys reject, in the strongest terms, real-world violence of any kind.\"\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nA post shared by THE BOYS (@theboystv)\n\nWhat is The Boys Season 4 finale about?\n\nTitled \"Assassination Run,\" the description of The Boys Season 4 finale reads, \"Calling all patriots!

The season's first three episodes, \"Department of Dirty Tricks,\" Life Among the Septics,\" and \"We'll Keep the Red Flag Flying Here\" were all released on June 13th.\n\nThe Boys Season 4 debut exceeded Season 3's viewership by 21% in its first four days online with the new season reaching number one on Prime Video in 160 countries. The show was also the third-most watched streaming show that week, falling only behind Netflix's Bridgerton and Your Honor. Bridgerton released four episodes on June 13th with viewing numbers of 3.47 billion viewing minutes during that week.\n\nWhat is The Boys Season 4 about?\n\nIn The Boys season 4, Karl Urban stars once again as Billy Butcher, leader of The Boys, which also includes Jack Quaid as Hughie Campbell, Laz Alonso as M.M., Tomer Capone as Frenchie, and Karen Fukuhara as Kimiko Miyashiro. Some of the \"supes\" featured in the series include Antony Starr as Homelander, Jessie T. Usher as A-Train, and Chace Crawford as The Deep.

Amazon, Sony Pictures Television and the producers of The Boys reject, in the strongest terms, real-world violence of any kind.\n\nIn June, The Boys showrunner Eric Kripke responded to fans saying supervillain Homelander is a hero and the series had gone \"woke.\"\n\n\"Anyone who wants to call the show 'woke' or whatever, that's okay. Go watch something else. But I'm certainly not going to pull any punches or apologize for what we're doing,\" Kripke told THR.\n\n\"Some people who watch it think Homelander is the hero. What do you say to that?\" he added. \"The show's many things. Subtle isn't one of them. So if that's the message you're getting from it, I just throw up my hands.\"\n\nWhen asked whether the showrunners always intended to parallel Trump's presidential race via Homelander's authoritarian rise to power, Kripe responded that Homelander was always intended to be a proxy for Trump.\n\nKripke has confirmed The Boys TV series ends with Season 5. Laz Alonso, who plays The Boys team leader Mother's Milk, wants a The Boys film to wrap up the series.\n\nWesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

And he loves it. Here's what he said to DiscussingFilm about resemblance...\n\n\"I think there's a very obvious human being that I know that Eric has steered the character towards. I understand why and I agree with that choice. I love that choice. For me it's really important to make sure that as well as getting the nods to people in real-life and you know the super brand elements and all that for me to have a three dimensional...because he's a human being ultimately that's just been injected with a drug to make him what he is. But you can't escape that humanity. And so, I don't mind the references to the real world I don't...I think they're really complimentary to the nature of the show and the themes in the show.\"\n\nRelated 8 Ways Hughie Is Completely Different in the Comics\n\nFrom Hughie's origin story to his revenge on A-Train, his story is very different in The Boys' comics.\n\nBased on the comic book of the same name by Garth Ennis and Darick Robertson, The Boys takes place in a universe where super-powered individuals are recognized as heroes by the public and owned by the powerful corporation Vought International.

This season gave us a lot of cool and unexpected moments that have given the overall story a lot of new depth. However, since it has already been confirmed that there is going to be a The Boys Season 5, which will be the final season, the fun is not over yet. So, in this article, find out about the speculative release date and everything else we know about The Boys Season 5.\n\nThe Boys Season 5 is expected to release in 2026, going by the trend.\n\nIf we look at the pattern for how The Boys has been released over time, it generally takes 1.5 to 2 years for a new season to be released. With that being said, we can speculate that The Boys Season 5 can come out by the summer of 2026. However, if you are thinking that the fun of The Boys universe has come to an end, you are massively wrong since Season 2 of Gen V started filming in May itself and might see a release by the end of 2025.\n\nGen V season 2 will set up the stage for The Boys Season 5 but if you want to know how, we do not have an answer just yet but maybe in a couple of months some info might start coming in. Along with this, a spinoff of The Boys set in Mexico is also being made so it's safe to say that we will not be kept devoid of the craziness of The Boys universe unless Season 5 is released.\n\nThe Boys Season 4's end is probably the best ending for a series I have seen in a while. This series ended with Butcher getting some diabolical powers and The Boys being captured by Homelander's super army. So, what could be the cast for Season 5? Some cast members are bound to return but as of now, there is no official confirmation for some cast members. It is confirmed that Karl Urban will return as Butcher, Jack Quaid as Hughie, Erin Moriarty as Starlight, Karen Fukahara as Kimiko, Tomer Capone as Frenchie, and Laz Alonzo as Mother's Milk.\n\nWe will also see Anthony Starr return as Homelander, Susan Heyward as Sister Sage, Valorie Curry as Firecracker, Chace Crawford as The Deep, and Nathan Mitchell as Black Noir. Along with these cast members, we might also see Maddie Phillips return as Cate Dunlap and Asa Germann as Sam in The Boys Season 5.\n\nMore importantly, we've seen Soldier Boy in The Boys Season 4 Finale, and therefore, Jensen Ackles will also appear in The Boys Season 5.\n\nThe Boys Season 5 might just give us one of the best plots we have seen in a while. Now that Butcher has powers, he is out to kill all the supes he can and is most probably going to create that contagious strain of the supe-killing virus.\n\nThe Boys seems to be moving towards a comic-accurate ending where Butcher is killed at the hands of someone you would never expect. There are not a lot of details regarding the plot of The Boys Season 5, but as soon as we have something on our hands, you guys will be the first ones to know. Till then, stay tuned with us for further updates while we wait for The Boys Season 5 release.", "source": {"uri": "beebom.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Beebom"}, "authors": [{"uri": "shashank_shakya@beebom.com", "name": "Shashank Shakya", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boys_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Boys (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gen_V", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gen V"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fictional_universe", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fictional universe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin-off_(media)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spin-off (media)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomer_Capone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tomer Capone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_Mitchell", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nathan Mitchell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maddie_Phillips", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Maddie Phillips"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother's_Milk_(novel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mother's Milk (novel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susan_Heyward", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Susan Heyward"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chace_Crawford", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chace Crawford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valorie_Curry", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Valorie Curry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erin_Moriarty_(actress)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Erin Moriarty (actress)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Quaid", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jack Quaid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Urban", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Karl Urban"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jensen_Ackles", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jensen Ackles"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/The-Boys-Season-5-Release-Date-Speculation-And-Everything-We-Know.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9736885", "eventUri": "eng-9736885", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

The episode was originally titled \"Assassination Run.\" It has now been retitled to just \"Season Four Finale\" and includes a \"viewer discretion advised\" warning the attempted murder of Trump during a Pennsylvania rally ahead of the 2024 Republican National Convention.\n\nPrime Video further issued a statement about \"The Boys\" episode, despite the finale being filmed more than a year prior.\n\n\"The season finale of 'The Boys' contains scenes of fictional political violence, which some viewers may find disturbing, especially in light of the injuries and tragic loss of life sustained during the assassination attempt on former President Trump,\" the statement reads. \"'The Boys' is a fictitious series that was filmed in 2023, and any scene or plotline similarities to these real-world events are coincidental and unintentional. Amazon, Sony Pictures Television, and the producers of 'The Boys' reject, in the strongest terms, real-world violence of any kind.\"\n\nLast month, \"The Boys\" showrunner Eric Kripke told The Hollywood Reporter that the series has been prescient for years. His point, while made well ahead of the attempt on Trump's life, had plenty to do with our former POTUS.\n\n\"When Seth [Rogen] and Evan [Goldberg] and I took it out to pitch, it was 2016,\" Kripke said. \"We just wanted to do a very realistic version of a superhero show, one where superheroes are celebrities behaving badly. Trump was the, 'He's not really getting the nomination, is he?' guy. When he got elected, we had a metaphor that said more about the current world. Suddenly, we were telling a story about the intersection of celebrity and authoritarianism and how social media and entertainment are used to sell fascism. We're right in the eye of the storm. And once we realized that, I just felt an obligation to run in that direction as far as we could.\"\n\nHe added, \"It's happened now almost every season, and we write them sometimes close to two years before they air and again we'll find that the news is accurately reflecting whatever we're talking about. It's not a spoiler to say that first episode [of Season 4], Homelander (Antony Starr) is on trial. A big concern is 'Can you convict someone that powerful of a crime?' And what does that mean for the various supporters or the people protesting him? Did I know it was going to come out during Trump's trial? Of course not.

Season 4 has been set in the aftermath of the election of presidential candidate Robert Singer (played by Jim Beaver) and his villainous running mate, the undercover super-powered Victoria Neuman (Claudia Doumit).\n\nNeuman has been working for superhero mega-corporation Vought, and with its supe supremacist leader, Homelander (Antony Starr). Her agenda has made her a target for assassination by the anti-supe squad, The Boys, led by Butcher (Karl Urban) and Hughie (Jack Quaid), who have been attempting to kill her since the season premiere on June 13.\n\nThe sixth episode of Season 4 of \"The Boys\" featured Homelander, Victoria Neuman and supe Sister Sage (Susan Heyward) rally some Federalist Society one-percenters to fall in line with their plan for total supe domination, which includes assassinating Singer following inauguration and upping Neuman to president and then creating internment camps for any of their detractors.\n\n\"When we first pitched the show, it was before Trump was elected,\" Kripke said in a June 18 interview with Variety, explaining the increasing political nature of \"The Boys.\" \"And the idea that a celebrity would actively want to turn themselves into a fascist autocrat was kind of a crazy idea. I mean, it still is. But it turned out to have happened? We sort of lucked into a show whose metaphor is really about the moment we're living in, which is the cross-section of celebrity and authoritarianism. And so once we realize that, we're like, 'Well, we have to go all the way.' And so every season we've just pushed it a little bit further, but it's all over. I mean, it's all over Season 1.

That is a tough thing to consider.\n\nNow as we do prepare for the final chapter, you better believe that the cast and crew are all doing the same ... though they may all have different ways of handling it.\n\nIn speaking on this subject further to IGN, Antony Starr made it clear that he is trying hard not to think about the end of the show right now, though he realizes it is coming:\n\n\"If I stop to think about it, it'll be really sad ... It's been such a long road with the show. We started before COVID, and we released Season 2 in COVID. We did all the press for that in seclusion and isolation in our homes, and then all of a sudden we came back. We shot in COVID. It's been such a ride together with this group of people that it'll be very sad. It'll be a sad day to hang up the spandex.\"\n\nWe are assuming that Homelander makes it to season 5, but that is largely for one simple reason: Why wouldn't he? This is a show that needs villains just as much as it does heroes, and when you think about it, Homelander is the absolute villain. He may be a product of warped psychology and his terrible childhood, but at the same time that does not excuse any of the awful things that he's done ... and of course, there have been many over the years.\n\nRelated - Be sure to get some more news on The Boys now, including what is ahead with the finale later this week!\n\nShare right now in the attached comments, and also come back for some other updates on the show.", "source": {"uri": "cartermatt.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CarterMatt"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jess_carter@cartermatt.com", "name": "Jess Carter", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boys_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Boys (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Better_Call_Saul_(season_5)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Better Call Saul (season 5)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antony_Starr", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Antony Starr"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IGN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "IGN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_(professional_wrestling)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Face (professional wrestling)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villain", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Villain"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 63}], "image": "https://cartermatt.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/The-Boys.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9736885", "eventUri": "eng-9736885", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

series landed on the streaming site today (18 July) and featured the culmination of a plot which saw Homelander (Antony Starr) try to kill the President and Vice-President elect of the United States

'coincidental' and had no relation to real world events.\n\n\"The season finale of The Boys contains scenes of fictional political violence, which some viewers may find disturbing, especially in light

But when Homelander reveals the truth about Neuman on live TV, it sends Congress -- and the entire nation -- into an uproar. Meanwhile, The Boys try to protect Singer from assassination, not realizing that the assassin is closer than they think. Annie struggles to figure out who Annie January really is -- and to break free from captivity. And when Butcher makes his final attempt to convince Ryan to leave Homelander, things go horribly wrong, causing Butcher to embrace the monster within -- and nothing will ever be the same again.\"\n\n(Check back in later Thursday for THR's spoiler-y take on the season four finale.)\n\nCreator and showrunner Eric Kripke spoke to THR ahead of season four about how his darkly comic satire (which will end with a forthcoming fifth season and is also turning into a franchise) has always been about Trumpism. The latest season spoofed a certain trial and presidential election, and he commented on the show's social agenda.\n\n\"When Seth [Rogen] and Evan [Goldberg] and I took it out to pitch, it was 2016,\" he explained of the origin story of the series. \"We just wanted to do a very realistic version of a superhero show, one where superheroes are celebrities behaving badly. Trump was the, 'He's not really getting the nomination, is he?' guy. When he got elected, we had a metaphor that said more about the current world. Suddenly, we were telling a story about the intersection of celebrity and authoritarianism and how social media and entertainment are used to sell fascism. We're right in the eye of the storm. And once we realized that, I just felt an obligation to run in that direction as far as we could.\"\n\nWhen commenting on how each season contains parallels to real life, Kripke explained that they write the seasons close to two years before they release -- well ahead of the real-life news cycle they seem to constantly predict.\n\n\"Again we'll find that the news is accurately reflecting whatever we're talking about,\" he said, citing the season four premiere plot of putting the show's Trump-like character, Homelander (played by Antony Starr) on trial. \"Did I know it was going to come out during Trump's trial? Of course not. But we write what we're either scared of or pissed off about. Someone asked me last year, about season three, 'How are you so prescient with cops and over-policing in Black neighborhoods?' Well, it's been a problem for over 100 years. It was a problem five years ago, and, unfortunately, it's going to be a problem five years from now. It's always the same shit.\"\n\nThe Boys has been one of Prime Video's more successful original series: It regularly makes Nielsen's streaming top 10 and has spawned a spinoff, Gen V, and an animated anthology set in the same world called Diabolical.\n\nSony Pictures Television produces The Boys with Amazon MGM Studios, Kripke Enterprises, Original Film and Point Grey Pictures.", "source": {"uri":

The former U.S. president was reportedly injured by a bullet that pierced his ear during the incident.\n\nAmazon has also included a \"viewer discretion advised\" warning at the beginning of the episode to alert viewers to the sensitive content. \"The Boys,\" one of Amazon's most successful series, continues to mirror political events that resonate with current real-life issues.\n\nThis precautionary measure by Amazon aims to address viewer concerns and clarify the unintentional timing and content parallels between the show and actual events.", "source": {"uri": "tribune.com.pk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Express Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "pop_culture@tribune.com.pk", "name": "Pop Culture", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boys_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Boys (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Prime_Video", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amazon Prime Video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_assassination_of_Ronald_Reagan", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Pictures_Television", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sony Pictures Television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Kripke", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eric Kripke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphic_novel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Graphic novel"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/DVD", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/DVD", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Cartoons", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Cartoons", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/the-boys1715694484-0/the-boys1715694484-0.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9736885", "eventUri": "eng-9736885", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-18", "textStart": 280, "textEnd": 287}], "sentiment": -0.192156862745098, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

Thrilled to bring the story to a gory, epic, moist climax,\" he wrote on X (formerly Twitter) with a nod to the evil corporation at the center of his series.\n\nWhile seasons 1 and 2 of The Boys were released a year apart, the following two seasons were released two years apart, which could mean a summer or fall 2026 release date for season 5.\n\nThe main cast from season 4 of The Boys is expected to return for season 5. This includes Jack Quaid reprising his starring role as tech salesman turned vigilante Hughie along with the actor's real-life girlfriend Claudia Doumit, who plays head-exploding supervillain and congresswoman Victoria Neuman.\n\n\"He's been busy the last few years, so schedules haven't worked out ... But now, unfortunately, [Walker] got canceled -- but the good thing is he's free,\" Kripke said. \"And I feel like I have to complete my game of Supernatural Pok\u00e9mon and I have my one big one -- very big one -- left to catch.\"\n\nThe Boys season 5 will continue the vigilantes' quest to expose supposed heroes like Homelander for abusing their power. Considering that the plot of The Boys always parodies real-world sociopolitical and pop culture events, it is likely that the 2024 Presidential election will play a large part in influencing the plot of season 5.\n\n\"The cast and crew are deeply grateful to Sony Pictures Television and Amazon MGM Studios for the opportunity to tell this story for another season,\" Kripke said when announcing the renewal news. \"My only problem is that since this year promises to be free of any conflict or misinformation, we're not sure what to write about.\"\n\nThe Boys season 5 will be streaming on Amazon Prime Video. The dark comedy is one of the streamer's most well-known and successful original series.\n\nWho is directing The Boys season 5?\n\nThere are no confirmed directors yet, but The Boys generally employs multiple directors throughout each season.

One particular line, tucked in the opening \"newsreel\" montage, delivered a direct response to the recent trend of studios shelving movies and TV shows that have been completed in favor of taking a tax write-off.\n\nThe Boys finale played out with plenty of crushed skulls, torn torsos, and the usual wholesome fun that has become the series' trademark. But before all that, the show decided to call out studios such as Warner Bros. Discovery and Netflix, who have produced movies and then scrapped them once they have been completed, much to the outrage of both fans and those involved in the productions themselves.\n\nThe Boys - Season 4 TV-MASuperheroActionComedy 2.5/5\n\nIn season four of The Boys, Victoria Neuman is closer than ever to the Oval Office and under the control of Homelander. With only months to live, Billy Butcher must find a way to work with The Boys if they want to save the world.\n\nRelease Date June 13, 2024 Cast Antony Starr , Karl Urban , Jack Quaid , Erin Moriarty , Jessie T.

During the finale's opening, a news report is heard announcing, \"Stunning news out of Vought Studios, who are canceling the eagerly anticipated film, Training A-Train, though it's completely finished.\" The clip cuts to Vought's CEO, Ashley Barrett (Colby Minifie), who delivered a killer jab at similar real-world cancelations.\n\nWe just knew we would make more from the write-off\n\nThis is certainly not the first time that showrunner Eric Kripke has used the series to slap the face of the film industry, and it has become apparent more than ever in Season 4, that there is a lot more of the real world in The Boys' universe than many people are truly comfortable to admit.\n\nThe Boys Has Taken Criticism for Its Political Storylines Close\n\nThe latest season of The Boys has been the usual juggernaut for Prime Video in terms of viewership, with the series easily outpacing other shows on the platform, and indeed across many other streaming platforms too. But the less than subtle political leanings of Season 4 have been more than some fans could take, leading to some online discourse throughout the season.\n\nHowever, Kripke has been resolute in standing by the show, and has simply offered everyone a very simple choice when it comes to watching The Boys; do, or don't. Shortly after the series returned to screens, Kripke went on record to directly respond to those who have slammed the show for its stance, and those who have decided that Homelander is the type of person they want to look up to.\n\nRelated The Boys Huge Post Credits Scene Reveal Sets Up Its Most Awaited Season 5 Tease\n\nThe Boys has concluded its fourth season with a stinger that will have more than just The Boys fans hypes for Season 5.\n\nSpeaking to The Hollywood Reporter in June, Kripe shared his very clear lack of interest in people who spend a lot of time complaining about The Boys on social media for \"going woke.\" He said at the time:\n\n\"I clearly have a perspective, and I'm not shy about putting that perspective in the show. Anyone who wants to call the show 'woke' or whatever, that's OK. Go watch something else. But I'm certainly not going to pull any punches or apologize for what we're doing. Some people who watch it think Homelander is the hero. What do you say to that? The show's many things. Subtle isn't one of them. So if that's the message you're getting from it, I just throw up my hands.\"\n\nThe Boys Season 4 is now available to stream in full on Prime Video, along with all three previous seasons.", "source": {"uri": "movieweb.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Movieweb"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boys_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Boys (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stranger_Things_(season_4)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stranger Things (season 4)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Kripke", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Eric Kripke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros._Discovery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Warner Bros.

While Season 4 may not be those viewers' favorite of the series, the story that executive producer Eric Kripke and his fellow creatives told is one of the series' most important. The season's plot centered on Homelander's attempt to instigate a coup of the American government and build a fascist state in his image. This makes The Boys the keenest political satire on television in 2024.\n\nIn truth, Kripke is \"really troubled\" by The Boys' prescience when it comes to Season 4's parallels to real-world politics. He's probably not thrilled that this season's finale, \"Season 4 Finale\" (originally titled \"Assassination Run,\" but renamed in light of recent events), comes less than a week after a would-be assassin took a shot at the Republican nominee for president, Donald Trump. After all, Kripke also admitted that Homelander's characterization is directly inspired by the only U.S. President to both be a convicted felon and accused of instigating a real-life coup attempt. Yet, this is what makes Season 4 of The Boys such a powerful season of television.\n\nRegardless of what one thinks of the GOP and their so-called \"standard-bearer,\" The Boys is a meticulous, fictional example of how authoritarians can use propaganda to sway public opinion into believing they are actually heroes. However, the titular group of operatives working to bring them down aren't exactly heroes themselves. For a brief moment, Hughie Campbell almost allowed them to claim that title, until Billy Butcher showed up and \"bollocks-ed it all up.\"\n\nThe Boys Season 4 Shows How Violence Only Begets More Violence\n\nFighting back Against Evil Sometimes Can't Actually Be a \"Fight\"\n\nJoe Kessler is unique to The Boys series. He does not have a counterpart in the original comics. Joe Kessler's namesake in the comics, \"Monkey\" (aka Howard Kessler), is a completely different character. Monkey was a CIA analyst and Billy Butcher's informant. He was the comics' laughingstock and a pathetic pervert.\n\nRelated\n\nThe Boys Unleashes Vought's Secret Weapon and It's Not One of the Seven\n\nThe Boys Season 4 reveals that Homelander's secret weapon against President Singer isn't a member of Vought International's Seven.\n\n\"What's insane is that our solution to every problem is murder.... Violence isn't brave...forgiveness, letting go...mercy, that's brave.\" - Hughie Campbell to the Boys.\n\nFrom the moment A-Train accidentally killed Robin, Hughie's girlfriend before Annie January, to the end of \"Season 4 Finale,\" violence drove both sides of the conflict in The Boys. The Supes used their powers to hurt or kill people who get in their way, while the Boys tried to hurt or kill the Supes. The plan that the Boys try to execute here is the same one they tried in the first episode of Season 4: killing Vice President-elect Victoria Neuman. Because President-elect Robert Singer wanted her dead, she felt that she had no choice but to throw in with Homelander's and Sage's super-powered fascist takeover.\n\nYet, upon realizing that Homelander was now at his most unhinged, Vicky had a change of heart. In Season 3 and for a brief moment in the previous episode, Hughie and Vicky were genuinely friends. At their last meeting, Hughie tried to convince Vicky to give up her plans, so that he and the Boys wouldn't have to kill her. Now when Homelander threatened her daughter Zoe, Vicky had no choice but to turn to Hughie and the Boys. What makes Season 4 of The Boys so genius is that if his plan had worked, Sage's plan would've been ruined.\n\nVicky and Zoe would've gone into hiding, the democratic presidency would be safe, and the Boys would have an asset against Vought and Homelander. Instead, Butcher and his dark Joe Kessler half showed up at the worst possible time. Using sickly tentacles, he killed Vicky, subdued Zoe and snatched a victory for Homelander and Sage from the jaws of defeat. With this one act of violence, Butcher turned the Boys into international fugitives. Again.\n\nThese tragic developments allow The Boys' already stellar cast to have some of their most emotionally resonant and dramatic scenes yet. Everyone brings in their a-game, whether they survive the season's brutal closing moments or not. Claudia Doumit seemingly wrapped up her time on the show as an ostensibly antagonistic character by giving her a difficult moral dilemma. The fact that Victoria actually had a change of heart, only for it to be wasted by Butcher, adds to Season 4's feeling of dread and hopelessness.\n\nHughie Campbell Almost Turned the Boys Into Genuine Heroes\n\nHis Final Speech Is Season 4's Central Argument\n\nClose\n\nThe Boys Season 4's Critical Reception\n\nCBR\n\nMetacritic\n\nRotten Tomatoes\n\nThe Boys Season 4\n\n8/10\n\nMetascore: 76/100 User Score: 4.1/10\n\nTomatometer: 93% Audience Score: 52%\n\nRelated\n\nThe Boys Season 4 Has a Link to Supernatural -- And It's Quite Graphic\n\nSeason 4 of The Boys has repeatedly pushed the boundaries, and its recent connection to the hit show Supernatural is no exception.\n\n\"If we're ever going to win against monsters, I think we need to start acting human,\" Hughie Campbell to the Boys.\n\nIt's been a bad, life-changing season for Hughie Campbell. First, his father had a stroke. Then, he learns that his mentor and friend Butcher is dying. He is also traumatized by his mother's return, and then his father's death that he inadvertently caused by securing some Compound V. Finally, after a blissful 10 days which ended with his engagement to Annie, he learns that she was replaced by the shapeshifter meant to kill President-elect Singer. Despite all this heartbreak, when Vicky reaches out and asks for help, he's willing to give it. In convincing the team to consider taking Vicky's offer of surrender, Hughie makes an impassioned plea for forgiveness, compassion and humanity.\n\nAll season long, every mission the Boys undertook ended in failure. From trying to find dirt on Firecracker to getting Samir to create the supe-killing virus, they failed. This is not because of Marvin \"Mother's\" Milk (\"MM\" for short) in a position of leadership, despite what he thought and what Butcher smugly claimed. Rather, it's because their approach was wrongheaded this whole time. The only success that the Boys found this season was when MM flipped one of the Seven to their cause. Working against Homelander and his wicked plans helped to redeem A-Train, not just in the eyes of Hughie, the Boys, and audiences, but himself as well.\n\nThe Boys Season 4 dared to be hopeful, if only for a moment. But thanks to Butcher's myopic commitment to violence and death, they ended up delivering the United States right into Homelander's hands. As real-world parallels between The Boys and the 2024 election continue, the show hammers in its core message of how lashing out against violence with even more violence only strengthens the resolve of the very people the \"good guys\" need to convince. From the mass killings at Vought to Firecracker's pathetic, tear-filled praise of Homelander after Vicky's death, Sage counted on Butcher and his friends to do the absolute worst things they could.\n\nSage's Mystery & What She Really Wants Are Finally Revealed\n\nThe Smartest Person in the World Is a Full-on Hometeamer\n\nSage is unique to The Boys series. She does not have a counterpart in the original comics. Sage's real name, Jessica Bradley, is her only connection to the comics. The comics' Jessica Bradley was an overly ambitious Vought senior officer who was framed and outsmarted by James Stillwell.\n\nRelated\n\nThe Boys' Sister Sage Actor Was In Another TV-MA Superhero Satire\n\nThe Boys Season 4 introduces Susan Heyward as Sister Sage, but it's not the first TV-MA satirical superhero series the actor has starred in.\n\n\"[I did it] to see if I could. Thank you. This was so much fun. Just next time? Listen to me.... Buckle up for Phase Two.\" - Sage to Homelander.\n\nWhen \"Sister\" Sage was brought to the Seven, viewers wondered what her motivations were. She's the smartest person on the planet, so why would she agree to help a monster like Homelander? The answer, it seems, was to see if she could pull off a supe-takeover of the United States. Just as Sage knew A-Train was the leak and manipulated him, she did the same with Homelander. She knew his ego wouldn't allow him to listen to her, so she incorporated his intransigence into her plans. Allowing the Boys to kill Vicky ended with Singer being arrested while their ally, Speaker Calhoun, was installed as president.\n\nWhile Sage likely didn't expect Homelander to fire her, it didn't interrupt her masterplan. Throughout Season 4, Sage made it clear that she didn't think much of ordinary people. She told the Deep that he was a \"superior being\" by virtue of him being a supe, despite her lack of respect for him and how much of a sleazy loser he was. Similarly, Sage told Victoria a story about curing cancer when her grandmother was sick, only for the doctors to laugh at her. This level of deep-seethed anger and hatred for humanity-at-large made even the smartest person on Earth susceptible to Homelander's brand of fascism.\n\nShe also knew that in this \"new world order,\" she'd be safe and protected unlike the poor saps being thrown into internment camps. Episode 6, \"Dirty Business\" proved that Homelander desperately needed her. In trying to convince the world's elite to back his coup, he mistakenly used the same propagandistic nonsense they spewed on Vought media. Despite his great power, Homelander had no understanding of how the world really works. Whether he admits it or not, he was basically useless without Sage. Yet, because these people stood to profit from his coup, they backed it. These warnings about how the elite would side with fascism is one of the most important messages and pertinent of The Boys Season 4, especially when accounting for current events.\n\nAlthough it was fairly obvious that, from the very beginning, Sage had her own motives and was only using everyone around her as pawns, it was nice to finally learn what she really had in mind. The Boys' choice to commit to Sage's villainy and supe supremacy rather than redeem her was a bold move that also tied back to the season's themes about the dead-ended cycle of violence. Susan Heyward is at her most cunning and Machiavellian in this episode, and she shows yet again why she's one of the series' best new additions.\n\nBilly Butcher Chose Supe Genocide as His Final Play\n\nHis Descent Into Darkness Has Dire Consequences for the Boys and the Country\n\nClose\n\nThe Boys Season 4 Episodes, Reviewed by CBR\n\nEpisode Number\n\nEpisode Title\n\nCBR's Score\n\n1\n\nDepartment of Dirty Tricks\n\n9/10\n\n2\n\nLife Among the Septics\n\n8/10\n\n3\n\nWe'll Keep the Red Flag Flying Here\n\n9/10\n\n4\n\nWisdom of the Ages\n\n8/10\n\n5\n\nBeware the Jabberwock, My Son\n\n9/10\n\n6\n\nDirty Business\n\n9//10\n\n7\n\nThe Insider\n\n7/10\n\n8\n\nSeason 4 Finale\n\n9/10\n\nRelated\n\n'It'll Be a Sad Day': The Boys Star Says Filming Finale Will Be Very Emotional\n\nEndings are emotional, and one of the lead actors of The Boys admits that it will be difficult to wrap the show.\n\n\"What is real is that piece of you that wants to burn every...Supe on Earth.... What's a little genocide between friends?\" - Hallucinatory Kessler to Billy Butcher.\n\nButcher's belief in Ryan, manifested through his visions of Becca, is what kept the Kessler and his darkest impulses at bay. He believed that Ryan's time with his mother provided just enough \"nurture\" to keep him from turning into another Homelander. Yet, when he and Grace Mallory tried to capture Ryan to use as a weapon against his father, the boy lashed out. He killed Grace, and in doing so, killed that part of Butcher that believed there was anything about Ryan worth saving.\n\nButcher then embraced Kessler, the part of him that wants to kill every Supe on the planet. In doing, he gained control of his \"power.\" Butcher admitted to taking a dose of Compound V to try to beat his cancer but, instead, it just made things worse. He now plans to unleash a virus that would kill everyone with Compound V in their system -- including Butcher himself. Interestingly, he seems to have recovered slightly, as if it was Kessler making him sick in the first place. However, Butcher did the opposite of what Hughie suggested. Instead of being \"human,\" Butcher embraced his inner monster, no matter what the resulting body count and collateral damage would be. It goes without saying that this is possibly Karl Urban's finest hour as The Boys' central anti-hero.\n\nSeason 4's ending is depressing, for sure, but it's also one that leads nicely into the final season of The Boys, where Butcher and Homelander will face off for the last time. \"Season 4 Finale\" and the series as a whole are a far cry from the comics, which justified and lionized Butcher's bottomless hatred and anger at every turn. After faithfully adapting the comic's most important basics and beats during its earliest episodes, The Boys grew into its own beast. Even better, the series' original story was a much better political commentary and character study of superheroes than its source material ever was. Despite its aggression and edginess, The Boys is arguably one of the strongest appeals to humanity and demolitions of toxic masculinity on air today.\n\nWhile the series is best known for its pitch-black humor and send-up of superhero culture, Season 4 proves that The Boys fits into the mold of superhero storytelling more than it doesn't. Using fantastical characters and classic genre conventions, the storytellers held up a mirror to the real-world with a warning about how embracing ugliness, violence, revenge and hatred will only lead to the proliferation of more sadness and suffering. There hasn't been a superhero story as daring and relevant as The Boys Season 4 in quite some time, and it will be an even longer while before any other superhero story can surpass it.\n\nSeason 1-4 of The Boys are now streaming on Prime Video, with its final season expected to begin filming in November 2024.\n\nThe Boys Season 4, Episode 8: \"Season 4 Finale\"\n\nTV-MA\n\nAction\n\nCrime\n\nDrama\n\nSuperhero\n\n9\n\n10\n\nThe Boys is a superhero/dark comedy satire series created by Eric Kripke based on the comic series of the same name.

That's because the concluding episode of the current season comes with a caution about \"fictional political violence\".\n\nAmazon's superhero satire show introduces a plotline featuring attempts to assassinate the incoming president and vice-president in its thrilling climax. Penned a year back and shot in 2023, the episode is now being screened mere days after former US President and Republican nominee, Trump was targeted in an assassination attempt at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.\n\nIssuing a joint statement, Prime Video and the show's team said: \"The season finale of The Boys contains scenes of fictional political violence, which some viewers may find disturbing, especially in light of the injuries and tragic loss of life sustained during the assassination attempt on former president Trump.\"\n\nREAD MORE: 'Dark' show forces fans to 'take breaks' as 'disturbing' scenes 'too realistic'\n\nREAD MORE: Netflix fans beg streamers to watch steamy series that will 'forever be their favourite' show\n\nReiterating the fictional nature of the show, they added: \"The Boys is a fictitious series that was filmed in 2023, and any scene or plotline similarities to these real-world events are coincidental and unintentional. Amazon, Sony Pictures Television and the producers of The Boys reject, in the strongest terms, real-world violence of any kind.\"\n\nAs the finale of the fourth series of the drama, starring Jack Quaid and Karl Urban came to a close, viewers saw Quaid's character Hughie trying to prevent the assassination of President-elect Robert Singer (Jim Beaver), masterminded by the evil superhero Homelander (Antony Starr). It was previously spilled that the fifth series will be the show's last, reports the Manchester Evening News.\n\nFans who are biting their nails during the show's fourth run, airing weekly since 13 June, have voiced out a niggle with an 'irksome' feature on the streaming platform. Despite its 95% score on Rotten Tomatoes for the fourth season, a number of viewers grumbled about the show's annoying ad feature.\n\nSince 5 February, Prime Video started showing adverts on its streaming service where customers encounter \"limited\" ads unless they fork out an extra \u00a32.99 monthly. If you are a full Amazon Prime customer, the current bill is \u00a38.99 a month, or \u00a395 if paid annually in advance.\n\nWishing to boot out all adverts means an increase in your monthly bill to \u00a311.98, equivalent to a yearly increase of \u00a335.88. Talking about this disputed step, Amazon justified: \"It allows us to continue investing in compelling content and keep increasing that investment over a long period of time. We aim to have meaningfully fewer ads than linear TV and other streaming TV providers.\"\n\nThe Boys fans are absolutely fuming after being bombarded with ad breaks on Amazon Prime, and they've taken to social media to vent. One peeved viewer ranted: \"These adverts on prime are irritating me, I just want to watch The Boys in peace.\"\n\nAnother shared their annoyance: \"Rewatching The Boys on Amazon Prime since the new season is out, and it's a joke that I pay for Prime yet they put adverts during their TV series, including one of their most popular 'originals'.\"\n\nA third disgruntled fan blasted: \"Trying to watch #TheBoys and it's been interrupted twice to play a minute's worth of adverts. Looks like it's time to cancel @amazon Prime. What a joke,\" while another griped: \"Flipping adverts on Amazon prime messing up the pacing on The Boys new episodes. These shows are made for streaming without ad breaks in mind. And I flipping already pay for Amazon prime.\"\n\nAnd as if echoing the sentiment of many, a fourth chimed in: \"I'm trying to watch The Boys, but it seems to be interrupted with inappropriate adverts.

While it was rumored that Jensen Ackles would be returning to The Boys after his Season 3 stint as Soldier Boy - and a brief appearance as the character in spin-off series Gen V - he failed to appear throughout the new season, potentially laying waste to fans' hopes of seeing a Supernatural reunion in Season 5. But reforming the trinity of Ackles, Jeffrey Dean Morgan, and Jared Padalecki is now well and truly on again.\n\nEven since it was announced that Morgan was joining Season 4 of The Boys, fans have been waiting to see him appear again on screen with his Supernatural son Ackles. While this has not happened, mainly due in part to the revelation that Morgan's character, Joe Kessler, is a figment of Billy Butcher's tumor hallucinations, the post-credits scene of Season 4 has at least hinted that they could somehow appear in the same scene in Season 5.\n\nThe Boys - Season 4 TV-MASuperheroActionComedy 2.5/5\n\nIn season four of The Boys, Victoria Neuman is closer than ever to the Oval Office and under the control of Homelander. With only months to live, Billy Butcher must find a way to work with The Boys if they want to save the world.\n\nRelease Date June 13, 2024 Cast Antony Starr , Karl Urban , Jack Quaid , Erin Moriarty , Jessie T. Usher , Laz Alonso , Chace Crawford , Jeffrey Dean Morgan , Colby Minifie , Valorie Curry , Karen Fukuhara , Cameron Crovetti , claudia doumit , Susan Heyward Main Genre Superhero Number of Episodes 8 Streaming Service(s) Prime Video Franchise(s) The Boys Showrunner Eric Kripke Expand\n\nThe final scene finds Antony Starr's slowly-eroding Homelander being led to a secret containment unit by his newest political ally. There he finds an isolation chamber, and when the camera finally pans over it, we see Ackles' Soldier Boy in a state of suspended animation. This means we are certain to see Soldier Boy back in action in Season 5, and the final moment of the main show also made it clear that Morgan's Kessler isn't going anywhere as Butcher prepares for his final showdown with his archenemy.\n\nWill The Boys Season 5 Have a Supernatural Reunion?\n\nFans have been calling on The Boys creator Eric Kripke - who also created Supernatural - to bring both Jeffrey Dean Morgan and Jared Padalecki into the series for a long time now. After many scheduling conflicts, Kripe was finally able to make one half of that request come true, with Morgan joining the series as FBI Agent Joe Kessler - or, a version of him, as it turned out. Now, the question is whether Kripke can manage to get Padalecki to complete the reunion that really needs to happen before The Boys comes to an end.\n\nThe good news is that Padalecki has already dropped several hints that he would love to join The Boys in Season 5. Speaking on the subject back in April with Collider, the actor made it clear that he would love to be part of The Boys' final season, but does have one condition.\n\n\"And my response to him 90% of the time is, 'Dude, I'm 41 now with three kids. I'm not 25 and working out three hours a day. I know you're going to f-cking make me get naked, so give me a heads-up. I'm in, but let me get a nutritionist and a trainer and get in the hyperbaric chamber for eight months before you make me show up.' But yeah, it would obviously be a lot of fun to see Kripke again and to work on that show, which is a great show that I'm a fan of.\"\n\nRelated Homelander Actor Teases the Emotional Final Season of The Boys\n\nAntony Starr says he isn't ready to film the final ever season of The Boys.\n\nAs fans digest the devastating conclusion of The Boys Season 4, there will now be a little wait until we finally get to see how the story of Butcher and Homelander ends. While most people would expect Homelander to get his much-deserved comeuppance, in The Boys nothing like that is going to happen without some kind of horrific and bloody twist.\n\nThe Boys Seasons 1-4 are all available to stream - with spin-offs - on Prime Video.", "source": {"uri": "movieweb.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Movieweb"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boys_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Boys (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stranger_Things_(season_4)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stranger Things (season 4)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernatural_(American_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Supernatural (American TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Dean_Morgan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jeffrey Dean Morgan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jensen_Ackles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jensen Ackles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Prime_Video", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Amazon Prime Video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jared_Padalecki", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jared Padalecki"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gen_V", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gen V"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antony_Starr", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Antony Starr"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Kripke", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eric Kripke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-credits_scene", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Post-credits scene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallucination", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hallucination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessie_T._Usher", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jessie T.

You can check out at any time. More info\n\nThe final episode of the current series of The Boys has added a warning about \"fictional political violence\" following the attempted assassination of Donald Trump.\n\nThe episode of the Amazon Prime Video superhero satire features a storyline during which assassination attempts are made on the president-elect and vice president-elect. The episode was written a year ago and was filmed in 2023 but has been released just days after the assassination attempt against Republican nominee and former US president Mr Trump at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.\n\nA statement released by Prime Video and the show said: \"The season finale of The Boys contains scenes of fictional political violence, which some viewers may find disturbing, especially in light of the injuries and tragic loss of life sustained during the assassination attempt on former president Trump.\n\nREAD MORE: Cobra Kai fans treated to bonus 'episode' as Season 6 part 1 drops on Netflix\n\nREAD MORE: Michelle Keegan-led hit Sky comedy shares first-look photos ahead of highly-anticipated sixth season\n\n\"The Boys is a fictitious series that was filmed in 2023, and any scene or plotline similarities to these real-world events are coincidental and unintentional. Amazon, Sony Pictures Television and the producers of The Boys reject, in the strongest terms, real-world violence of any kind.\"\n\nThe finale of the fourth series of the drama, starring Jack Quaid and Karl Urban, shows Quaid's Hughie attempting to block an assassination attempt on president-elect Robert Singer (Jim Beaver), orchestrated by villainous superhero Homelander (Antony Starr). It was previously announced the show will end with its fifth season.\n\nFans trying to enjoy the show's fourth season, which has been airing weekly since June 13, issued a complaint over an 'irritating' feature on the streaming platform. Based on The New York Times best-selling comic by Garth Ennis and Darick Robertson, the show has also welcomed more twisted supes including Sister Sage and Firecracker. While season four boasts an impressive 95 per cent Rotten Tomatoes score, many viewers have complained about the show's irritating advert feature.\n\nPrime Video introduced adverts to its streaming service on February 5, where customers see \"limited\" ads unless they pay an additional \u00a32.99 per month to remove them. If you're a full Amazon Prime customer, the current bill sits at \u00a38.99 a month, or \u00a395 for the year upfront. If you want to get rid of adverts, your monthly bill would increase to \u00a311.98 a month. The extra fee is equivalent to a \u00a335.88 a year hike.\n\nDiscussing the controversial move, Amazon said: \"It allows us to continue investing in compelling content and keep increasing that investment over a long period of time. We aim to have meaningfully fewer ads than linear TV and other streaming TV providers.\"\n\nIt marks the first time fans of The Boys have experienced advert breaks whilst streaming the popular show, and many have voiced their frustration on X. One user vented: \"These adverts on prime are irritating me, I just want to watch The Boys in peace.\" Another echoed: \"Rewatching The Boys on Amazon Prime since the new season is out, and it's a joke that I pay for Prime yet they put adverts during their TV series, including one of their most popular 'originals'.\"\n\n\"Trying to watch #TheBoys and it's been interrupted twice to play a minute's worth of adverts. Looks like it's time to cancel @amazon Prime. What a joke,\" voiced a third. Another penned: \"Flipping adverts on Amazon prime messing up the pacing on The Boys new episodes. These shows are made for streaming without ad breaks in mind. And I flipping already pay for Amazon prime.\"\n\nAs a fourth wrote: \"I'm trying to watch The Boys, but it seems to be interrupted with inappropriate adverts. I currently have Prime, does that not work anymore?\"\n\nAll episodes of The Boys season four are available to stream now on Amazon Prime Video.", "source": {"uri": "manchestereveningnews.co.uk",

According to the Associated Press, the suspected shooter -- identified as 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks of Bethel Park, Pa. -- \"was engaged by members of the U.S. Secret Service counterassault team and killed.\"", "source": {"uri": "tvline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TVLine"}, "authors": [{"uri": "vlada_gelman@tvline.com", "name": "Vlada Gelman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boys_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Boys (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Prime_Video", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Amazon Prime Video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Pictures_Television", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sony Pictures Television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama_(film_and_television)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drama (film and television)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Singer_(producer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Robert Singer (producer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President-elect_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "President-elect of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Singer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bob Singer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_assassination_of_Ronald_Reagan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_(magazine)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vice (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secret_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Secret Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/DVD", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/DVD", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Cartoons", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Cartoons", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 67}], "image": "https://tvline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/the-boys-finale.jpg?w=650", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9736885", "eventUri": "eng-9736885", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-01-06", "textStart": 1277, "textEnd": 1288}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-13", "textStart": 1568, "textEnd": 1575}], "sentiment": -0.192156862745098, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

Thrilled to bring the story to a gory, epic, moist climax,\" he wrote on X (formerly Twitter) with a nod to the evil corporation at the center of his series.\n\nWhile seasons 1 and 2 of The Boys were released a year apart, the following two seasons were released two years apart, which could mean a summer or fall 2026 release date for season 5.\n\nThe main cast from season 4 of The Boys is expected to return for season 5. This includes Jack Quaid reprising his starring role as tech salesman turned vigilante Hughie along with the actor's real-life girlfriend Claudia Doumit, who plays head-exploding supervillain and congresswoman Victoria Neuman.\n\n\"He's been busy the last few years, so schedules haven't worked out ... But now, unfortunately, [Walker] got canceled -- but the good thing is he's free,\" Kripke said. \"And I feel like I have to complete my game of Supernatural Pok\u00e9mon and I have my one big one -- very big one -- left to catch.\"\n\nSupernatural's other series lead, Jensen Ackles, starred in The Boys as the antiquated American antihero Soldier Boy, along with other Supernatural actors Morgan, Jim Beaver and Rob Benedict.\n\nThe Boys season 5 will continue the vigilantes' quest to expose supposed heroes like Homelander for abusing their power. Considering that the plot of The Boys always parodies real-world sociopolitical and pop culture events, it is likely that the 2024 Presidential election will play a large part in influencing the plot of season 5.\n\n\"The cast and crew are deeply grateful to Sony Pictures Television and Amazon MGM Studios for the opportunity to tell this story for another season,\" Kripke said when announcing the renewal news. \"My only problem is that since this year promises to be free of any conflict or misinformation, we're not sure what to write about.\"\n\nThe Boys season 5 will be streaming on Amazon Prime Video. The dark comedy is one of the streamer's most well-known and successful original series.\n\nThere are no confirmed directors yet, but The Boys generally employs multiple directors throughout each season.

The hyper-violent superhero TV show has borrowed heavily from the comics for both characters and plot points, but hasn't been afraid of doing its own thing either, satirising the ongoing political turmoil of the United States and poking fun at other superhero franchises.\n\nFollowing the exploits of rag-tag group The Boys as they try to curtail the power and corruption of superheroes, season four of The Boys was election year, with the fate of the entire world seemingly hanging in the balance as the two sides wrestled for control using shady deals, blackmail, violence and fake news. Spoiler alert - things did not end well for our heroes.\n\nSeason four saw both The Boys and manic superhero Homelander (Anthony Starr) backing a different political candidate during an election year. Democratic presidential candidate Robert Singer (Jim Beaver) wanted to remove super-powered individuals from all government positions with the backing of the CIA, while his Vice President-elect was secret head-popping supe Victoria Neumann (Claudia Doumit) who wanted the presidency for herself.\n\nThings rarely go according to plan in The Boys and season four ended with Singer in jail after seemingly ordering the assassination of Neumann, with Senator Calhoun (David Andrews) becoming President. His first order of business? Declaring Martial Law and deputising hundreds of supes under the direct command of Homelander. As he threatens in the dying moments of season four, \"a new age of superheroes begins\".\n\nThis means The Boys are now enemies of the state, and Frenchie (Tomer Capone), Kimiko (Karen Fukuhara) Hughie (Jack Quaid), Starlight (Erin Moriarty) and M.M (Laz Alonso) end season four by trying to flee the country - before a majority are captured by Homelander's new army of supes. As for Butcher (Karl Urban), he's last seen speeding down a highway with ghostly devil-on-his-shoulder Joe Kessler (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) and a virus that could potentially cause a pandemic that kills all super-powered individuals.\n\nA fifth season of The Boys was green-lit in the days leading up to season four's premiere. Showrunner Eric Kripke had previously hinted that he was looking to wrap up the series in the near future, but he used the renewal to finally confirm that season five would be the last season of The Boys. \"Always my plan, I just had to be cagey till I got the final OK from Vought,\" he wrote on social media. \"Thrilled to bring the story to a gory, epic, moist climax. Watch Season 4 in 2 DAYS, cause the end has begun,\" he added.\n\nWith filming due to start at the end of the year and continue into 2025, it looks like season five of The Boys will air at some point in 2026.\n\nAs well as dealing with the immediate fallout of what's come before, season five of The Boys will feature a number of confrontations that have been seeded across the show. After betraying the rest of his team by ripping Neumann in half with his new tentacle powers and dooming them to a life on the run, Butcher has seemingly burned the last of his bridges with the gang. Season four ended with both Kimiko and Starlight still at large, and you can imagine revenge will be on the cards - especially with Butcher potentially unleashing a global pandemic that will painfully kill all super-powered individuals, including them.\n\nHowever, Butcher has another target in his sights. With just a few months to live, he's trying to do right by Ryan (Cameron Crovetti), who is the biological child of Homelander and his dead wife Becca (Shantel VanSanten). Ryan is perhaps the only person on earth who can take out the tyrannical Homelander, but he also poses just as much of a risk - especially now he's got a few kills under his belt. The battle for his soul is likely going to be a key part of season five of The Boys.\n\nFans can also expect the return of Soldier Boy (Jensen Ackles) after his brief cameo at the end of season four, while both the newly-orphaned, tentacle-mouthed Zoe (Olivia Morandin) and the scheming, highly connected Stan Edgar (Giancarlo Esposito) will want to see Butcher pay for murdering Neumann.\n\nIt also seems like Homelander essentially becoming President Of The United States was only the beginning of Sister Sage's (Susan Heywood) grand social experiment. As she said at the end of season four \"buckle up for phase two\".\n\nAlongside the mainline series, The Boys has inspired a number of spin-offs. The Boys Presents: Diabolical was an eight-episode animated anthology that premiered in 2022 and explored the wider world of the show, toying with tone, attitude and canon in the process. With three episodes set in the world of The Boys, another taking place in the comic book universe and the rest existing in their own multiverse, Diabolical could easily continue after The Boys has ended. Following the release of the first season, executive producer Seth Rogan confirmed scripts were being written for another season but he wasn't sure if they'd be picked up by Prime Video, and nothing has been confirmed since.\n\nThen there's Gen V. A live-action show set at Godolkin University, it featured a number of teenage supes as they got to grips with their power and the corruption that comes with being a beloved superhero. The show not only introduced the supe-killing virus that's become an ongoing threat in the main show, but both \"The Guardians Of Godolkin\" (Asa Germann's Sam Riordan and Maddie Phillips' Cate Dunlap) have crossed over into The Boys as part of Team Homelander. They were last seen separating Kimiko from a brainwashed Frenchie, and have their own Vought-produced movie coming out.\n\nAs for the real heroes of Gen V, Marie Moreau (Jaz Sinclair), Emma Meyer (Lizze Broadway), Jordan Li (London Thor and Derek Luh) and Andre Anderson (Chance Perdomo) ended the series trapped in a secret hospital, with seemingly no chance of escape. A second season has already been confirmed, and had been due to start production in April but was delayed following the tragic death of Chance Perdomo. Production eventually began in May, with creators saying they weren't going to recast the character of Andre but season two would \"honour\" his legacy.\n\nWith a number of The Boys also captured by Team Homelander at the end of the main series, there are plenty of chances for meaningful crossovers in season two, but Gen V could very well carry on beyond the end of The Boys as well, acting as an epilogue or evolving into its own thing entirely. There have also been reports of a Spanish-language take on The Boys set in Mexico City being developed by Prime Video.\n\nWe've seen with The Walking Dead that the end doesn't always mean the end, with a number of new spin-offs continuing that story. The Boys is one of Prime Video's most successful shows, boasting a rich universe to explore, so there's every chance of more spin-offs coming out after the main series wraps.", "source": {"uri": "nme.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NME Music News, Reviews, Videos, Galleries, Tickets and Blogs | NME.COM"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ali_shutler@nme.com", "name": "Ali Shutler", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boys_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Boys (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superhero", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Superhero"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Prime_Video", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amazon Prime Video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claudia_Doumit", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Claudia Doumit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fake_news", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fake news"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Beaver", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jim Beaver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garth_Ennis", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Garth Ennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walking_Dead_(comic_book)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Walking Dead (comic book)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darick_Robertson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Darick Robertson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assassination of John F.

But even with its progressive politics, no, it was not going to create a parallel version of the Trump assassination attempt from a week ago.\n\nHowever, coincidences happen, and all season long The Boys has been building to an assassination attempt on the President of the United States, which was supposed to culminate in a finale called \"Assassination Run\" which aired today.\n\nWhile it does not seem like anything was cut from the episode, it did change its title to simply \"Season 4 Finale\" at the last minute and issued a warning ahead of the episode which read:\n\n\"Viewer discretion advised - This episode contains scenes of fictional political violence. Any similarities to recent events are completely coincidental and unintentional.\n\nPrime Video, Amazon MGM Studios, Sony Pictures Television and the producers of The Boys oppose, in the strongest terms, real-world violence of any kind.\"\n\nSo how close was it? Spoilers follow.\n\nNot...very close. While it once seemed like there would be a literal shooter trying to kill the President, that's not what happened. Instead, if there were any real-life parallels, it was much closer to a parody of January 6, though with Homelander and the Seven purging Vought of traitors rather than anyone storming the Capital. It was about a coup, certainly, with Homelander eventually at its apex, deputizing a superhero army to round up dissenters around the country.\n\nAs for the potential assassination it...didn't work. A shapeshifter disguised as Starlight tried to kill the president with her bare hands in his bunker, stopped by Kimiko and the real Starlight. The only political death of the evening was Butcher murdering a surrendering VP Elect Neuman (with the show losing arguably its second-best character) and the President getting arrested for being recorded ordering her death a while back.\n\nEssentially the plot of the finale is \"what if Trump actually took over on January 6\" rather than anything that has to do with this past week and the near-miss attempt on his life. There is one more season of The Boys, but I would be surprised if despite the show's politics, it went there. Though of course, yes, the entire premise of The Boys for years has been trying to kill Homelander, and you would imagine that will probably happen by series' end. Though not as a Trump statement, but rather just...that's the point of this show. Homelander needs to die.\n\nIt's certainly an awkward moment for all this, but the episode itself really does not have anything to do with recent events. It's actually a really good finale in what was an otherwise pretty uneven season. Looking forward to seeing how it all wraps up in season 5.", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boys_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Boys (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parody", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Parody"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Donald_Trump", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Progressivism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satire", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Satire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Prime_Video", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amazon Prime Video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Pictures_Television", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sony Pictures Television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_violence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Political violence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superhero", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Superhero"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coup_d'\u00e9tat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coup d'\u00e9tat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapeshifting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shapeshifting"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Cartoons", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Cartoons", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/66990d17ca1131f26e3fa6e5/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=600&width=1200&fit=bounds", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9736885", "eventUri": "eng-9736885", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-01-06", "textStart": 1271, "textEnd": 1280, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1}

Ahead of that though, here's everything we know about The Boys season 5.\n\n[Ed. note: This story contains spoilers for The Boys season 4.]\n\nIt is. The Boys has already been renewed for its fifth and final season.

Always my plan, I just had to be cagey till I got the final OK from Vought. Thrilled to bring the story to a gory, epic, moist climax. Watch Season 4 in 2 DAYS, cause the end has begun!\n\nThere's really no telling when the show's next season might arrive, but it's probably safe to assume it won't be until at least 2026. For one thing, the show doesn't seem to have started production on its next season yet, for another each of the show's seasons so far has had a two-year gap between them. Add in the fact that Gen V is filming another season at the moment, and it seems like 2026 is a pretty solid guess.\n\nConsidering where season 4 ended, it seems like we're setting up for a pretty apocalyptic final season. A showdown with Homelander always seemed like how the series had to end, and now that Homelander is functionally heading up marshal law in America, it seems like we're finally ready for the big battle. Of course, as part of that we'll also have to follow what happens to all the supes that are now in jail, and Butcher now that he's out on his own -- with some new powers to boot.\n\nThis is almost guaranteed, but we don't know Gen V season 2's release date either.

After four seasons, it doesn't feel as though we've made all too much headway in a narrative sense, as the same problems and issues that kickstarted this series are still the main focus. Now that we're at the end of Season 4, a season that is seemingly the penultimate season, I can comfortably add that this is still the case.\n\nNow let me just pivot a moment and mention that The Boys is still effortlessly entertaining television that is well-produced and well-acted. Every time you start an episode of The Boys, you can be damn sure that you're getting an hour's worth of good quality television that engages and even makes you laugh, but that has always been the case, and some of the charm that makes The Boys special is evaporating as the years roll on.\n\nThis season feels like a season where very little is actually accomplished. Sure there's a bit of extra character development and growth, backstory for some of the more unexplained parts of the wider lore, but in terms of meaningful narrative moments, the questions we had at the end of Season 3 are pretty much intact at the end of Season 4. Yes, there was that moment in the final episode. Yes, that will have sweeping repercussions going forward. But otherwise, you could effectively jump from the end of Season 3 into the coming Season 5 and not really have missed a beat with Billy Butcher, Frenchie, Starlight, Hughie, Mother's Milk, Homelander, or the rest of the Seven.\n\nTo me, this is why The Boys: Season 4 has been one of the less impressive outings from The Boys yet. Don't get me wrong, Antony Starr still steals the show as Homelander each and every time he's on-camera, Chace Crawford remains a timeless, hilarious supporting star, Karl Urban, Jack Quaid, Erin Moriarty, Tomer Capone, Karen Fukuhara, Claudia Doumit, Laz Alonso, Jessie T. Usher, and the rest of the cast all thrive and continue to deliver top performances too. The cast and performances in The Boys have always been excellent and Season 4 doesn't miss a beat here.\n\nWhat is a little different this time around is the vulgarity. We're used to so many shocking and highly mature scenes that many of us are likely desensitised to it now, and perhaps that's precisely the case. Either way, it feels like The Boys: Season 4 has scaled back on the crude factor, only offering a few moments that stand out as the season develops, with the Tek Knight basement scene definitely being the cream of the crop here. To me, this actually works in the season's favour, although there is a distinct lack of compelling action throughout, perhaps due to the fact that Jensen Ackles' Soldier Boy is no longer around to go toe-to-toe with Homelander on a frequent basis.\n\nIt's still massively refreshing to see The Boys operate and act as a polar-opposite take on the overused superhero genre, a show that is unafraid to jab and poke fun at societal trends. But at the same time, this season feels lazier and slower than those that came before it, and there's no denying that it doesn't quite pack the same punch and deliver the same astonishing moments as we've become familiar with. Perhaps that's because showrunner Eric Kripke is saving all the best and biggest moments for the final season coming up? Hopefully that's the case, because The Boys is desperate for a major plot moment, and that's what this show has been lacking in Season 4 without a doubt.", "source": {"uri": "gamereactor.eu", "dataType": "news", "title": "GameReactor"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ben_lyons@gamereactor.eu", "name": "Ben Lyons", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boys_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Boys (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomer_Capone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tomer Capone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother's_Milk_(novel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mother's Milk (novel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karen_Fukuhara", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Karen Fukuhara"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antony_Starr", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Antony Starr"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chace_Crawford", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chace Crawford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erin_Moriarty_(actress)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Erin Moriarty (actress)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Quaid", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jack Quaid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Urban", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Karl Urban"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessie_T._Usher", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jessie T.

The Disappointing News About The Series' Future", "body": "The fourth season of The Boys premiered on Prime Video on June 13 and aired its finale on July 18. \"The world is on the brink,\" the synopsis for Season 4 reads. \"Victoria Neuman is closer than ever to the Oval Office -- and Butcher, who has only months to live, has lost Becca's son as well as his job as The Boys' leader. The team is fed up with his lies -- but with the stakes higher than ever, they have to find a way to work together and save the world.\"\n\nJack Quaid, Antony Starr, Erin Moriarty, Jessie T. Usher, Laz Alonso, Chace Crawford, Tomer Capone, Karen Fukuhara, and more returned for latest season. Meanwhile, newcomers included Rosemarie DeWitt, Rob Benedict, Elliot Knight, Susan Heyward, Valorie Curry, Cameron Crovetti, and Jeffrey Dean Morgan.\n\nWhat will happen to the superhero series after Season 4? Here's what you need to know about the status of The Boys Season 5 and beyond.\n\nYes, Amazon Prime renewed The Boys for a fifth season in June, just days before the season four premiere. Unfortunately, the next installment will mark the last season of the fan-favorite series on Prime Video.\n\nPrime Video has not announced a release date for Season 5 of The Boys. The first two seasons were released a year apart, while the most recent two had a two-year gap. Based on the showrunner's recent comments about filming, a release date in the summer or fall of 2026 seems likely for Season 5.\n\nShowrunner Eric Kripke told Variety in June 2024 that Season 5 will be filmed between November 2024 and mid-2025. He also confirmed that the final season will have eight episodes.\n\n\"It's not totally locked in yet but we are going to start shooting around mid-November. And I don't know when it'll premiere yet, but we'll be shooting well into middle of '25,\" he told the site.\n\nShowrunner Eric Kripke said in a recent interview that he knew that Season 5 of The Boys would be the show's final chapter since Season 3.\n\n\"I would say near the beginning of writing Season 3, so years -- years and years,\" he explained to Variety, noting that it \"took a minute for Amazon to agree, it took another minute to get them to clear it in all the channels so that we could finally announce it.\"\n\nKripke added that once Amazon announced Season 5, he wanted to let fans know that it was the final season as soon as possible.\n\n\"It's weird for this show to say, but it's a slightly more introspective season. We always look at it in the three-act movie way as the end of Act 2 low point before the roller coaster ride of the climax,\" he continued. \"And I just wanted people to understand where it fit into the larger piece so that they kind of get what this season is supposed to be.\"\n\nTwo days before the Season 4 premiere of The Boys, Kripke announced that the R-rated Prime Video drama will conclude with its fifth season.\n\n\"#TheBoys Season 4 Premiere Week is a good time to announce: Season 5 will be the Final Season!\" Kripke said in a post on X (formerly Twitter). The post also includes a screenshot of a redacted copy of the script for the Season 4 finale, \"Assassination Run.\"\n\nThe showrunner revealed that ending with Season 5 was always his \"plan.\" Kripke continued, \"I just had to be cagey till I got the final OK from Vought. Thrilled to bring the story to a gory, epic, moist climax. Watch Season 4 in 2 DAYS, cause the end has begun!\"\n\nRumors started swirling that the next season of The Boys would be its last after Amazon renewed the show for Season 5 in May before Kripke and the cast began promoting Season 4. According to Variety, the showrunner had previously stated that he wanted at least five seasons to tell the story. The Season 5 renewal announcement back in May also did not specify that it would be the final season.\n\nThe Boys has become one of Prime Video's most successful original series, inspiring an animated spinoff called Gen V that's set in the same universe. Kripke recently explained to The Hollywood Reporter in June that the show's budget hasn't take a large hit despite media companies' recent spending cuts.\n\n\"We've been lucky in that The Boys has become one of their flagships. We get a level of freedom that it'll be hard to repeat anywhere,\" Kripke said. \"That said, we have budget battles. But, ultimately, we figure out a way. We made Gen V for a lot less money, and there's a target that we have to hit on that show -- whether we like it or not. There's a couple of things in development. You have to pre-negotiate the budgets, and those budgets are a lot tighter than what we've had in the past. So, we're feeling it.\"", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boys_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Boys (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Prime_Video", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Amazon Prime Video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Kripke", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Eric Kripke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Showrunner", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Showrunner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomer_Capone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tomer Capone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessie_T._Usher", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jessie T.

There will be a big showdown. Whatever new Supe character was introduced this season will probably wind up dead (or seriously injured). And Homelander will just barely escape Billy Butcher's best-laid plans to capture or murder the psychotic Superman parody.\n\nBut in the final episode of Season 4, The Boys finally flips that script. Maybe it's because we're heading into the show's fifth and final season (though there is talk of a movie), but for once, it feels like Amazon's superhero show is raising the stakes in a truly interesting way, rather than just simply resetting the series to its edgy status quo.\n\nWarning! Major Spoilers for The Boys Season 4 Episode 8 ahead!\n\nDespite hinting at a January 6 insurrection parody for the entire season, The Boys Season 4 finale doesn't go that route. Instead, the episode (titled \"Assassination Run\" in a somewhat disturbing instance of life imitating art) focuses on a more insidious type of coup.\n\nAfter the Boys manage to save newly elected President Robert Singer from a shapeshifting assassin, the action pivots to Vice President Victoria Neuman. She may be a head-exploding Supe, but due to her differences with Homelander, Neuman is ready to make a deal with the Boys. Unfortunately, that deal goes sideways when Butcher's rage gets the better of him, and the compound V swimming in his bloodstream emerges to rip the Veep limb from limb.\n\nIf you think that's a good thing, you're dead wrong. Turns out, this was Sister Sage's plan all along. The smartest person/Supe in the world emerges from the shadows to reveal that, with Neuman gone and Singer somehow framed for treason, the mantle of president has passed to the Speaker of the House, who just so happens to be a diehard Homelander supporter.\n\nThe newly sworn-in president's first act is to declare martial law, deputizing Supes across the country to defeat the \"deep-state Starlighters.\" Meanwhile, the Boys try to make a run for it, splitting up and going into hiding, but as the episode ends we see two superhero groups led by Sam and Cate from Gen V and Cindy and Love Sausage from Sage Grove capture our heroes, prompting Kimiko to say her first words of the entire series: screaming \"NO!\" while Frenchie is wrestled away from her.\n\nSeason 4 is a dark finale, even for The Boys, but that's exactly what the series needed. This isn't another \"Homelander just barely gets away\" moment. Instead, the Boys are at the lowest they've ever been. They're captured fugitives, and the very person they've wanted to stop for years is essentially running the entire country.\n\nWith only one season left, The Boys Season 4 finale perfectly sets up an epic rise from the worst situation these characters have encountered so far. Even worse, a deputized Homelander isn't the only enemy they'll have to overcome -- a post-credits scene shows the Supe looking over a seemingly comatose Soldier Boy who's been stashed away by American leadership.\n\nSeason 5 has its work cut out for it, but The Boys appears to be doing everything right in setting up one last showdown between the forces of evil and the force of... well, slightly less evil. Hopefully, by the time the series comes to an end, Homelander will finally get what's coming to him.", "source": {"uri": "inverse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Inverse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boys_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Boys (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supe_District", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Supe District"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Supe District"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Peru"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parody", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Parody"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_6_United_States_Capitol_attack", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "January 6 United States Capitol attack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superman_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Superman (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Singer_(producer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Robert Singer (producer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Season_finale", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Season finale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Status_quo", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Status quo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychosis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Psychosis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superhero", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Superhero"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veep", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Veep"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treason", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Treason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Victoria", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Queen Victoria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapeshifting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shapeshifting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coup_d'\u00e9tat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coup d'\u00e9tat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gen_V", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gen V"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAGE_Publishing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "SAGE Publishing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hero"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-credits_scene", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Post-credits scene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Norway"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Norway"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Cartoons", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Cartoons", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2024/7/18/f000d79f/9b7nu5ccyrgh2mubrrtfxj.jpg?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop&crop=faces&fm=jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9736885", "eventUri": "eng-9736885", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-01-06", "textStart": 783, "textEnd": 792}], "sentiment": -0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

He has been working at PEOPLE since 2023. His work has previously appeared in The Winnipeg Free Press, The Sporting Tribune, On3 and Lakers Nation.\n\nBefore season 4 was even released, Amazon Prime announced that its superhero-centric black comedyThe Boys would be renewed for season 5, marking the return of the series' morally complex characters.\n\nDuring the premiere of the fourth season, show creator Eric Kripke announced that season 5 would be the last installment of The Boys. \"Always my plan, I just had to be cagey till I got the final OK from Vought. Thrilled to bring the story to a gory, epic, moist climax,\" he wrote on X (formerly Twitter) with a nod to the evil corporation at the center of his series.\n\nWhile seasons 1 and 2 of The Boys were released a year apart, the following two seasons were released two years apart, which could mean a summer or fall 2026 release date for season 5.\n\nThe main cast from season 4 of The Boys is expected to return for season 5. This includes Jack Quaid reprising his starring role as tech salesman turned vigilante Hughie along with the actor's real-life girlfriend Claudia Doumit, who plays head-exploding supervillain and congresswoman Victoria Neuman.\n\n\"He's been busy the last few years, so schedules haven't worked out ...

Considering that the plot of The Boys always parodies real-world sociopolitical and pop culture events, it is likely that the 2024 Presidential election will play a large part in influencing the plot of season 5.\n\n\"The cast and crew are deeply grateful to Sony Pictures Television and Amazon MGM Studios for the opportunity to tell this story for another season,\" Kripke said when announcing the renewal news. \"My only problem is that since this year promises to be free of any conflict or misinformation, we're not sure what to write about.\"\n\nThe Boys season 5 will be streaming on Amazon Prime Video. The dark comedy is one of the streamer's most well-known and successful original series.\n\nThere are no confirmed directors yet, but The Boys generally employs multiple directors throughout each season. Phil Sgriccia is the only director who has directed an episode of The Boys in each season.\n\nKripke directed the season 1 finale and season 4 finale, so he could return to direct the season 5 finale.", "source": {"uri": "people.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PEOPLE.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boys_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Boys (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stranger_Things_(season_4)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stranger Things (season 4)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Prime_Video", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amazon Prime Video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernatural_(American_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supernatural (American TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winnipeg_Free_Press", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Winnipeg Free Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Kripke", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eric Kripke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Epic film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claudia_Doumit", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Claudia Doumit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Quaid", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jack Quaid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervillain", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supervillain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok\u00e9mon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pok\u00e9mon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria,_British_Columbia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Victoria, British Columbia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Victoria, British Columbia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Sgriccia", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Philip Sgriccia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Beaver", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jim Beaver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Benedict", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rob Benedict"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Pictures_Television", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sony Pictures Television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jensen_Ackles", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jensen Ackles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hero"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Black comedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_culture", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Popular culture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parody", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Parody"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antihero", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Antihero"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Cartoons", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Cartoons", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://people.com/thmb/hrfME0nofHdmbt6pVev3g_asWUk=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x0:1001x2)/the-boys-1-aa1c6e7f7a5446789aa91356d81c398f.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9736885", "eventUri": "eng-9736885", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 152, "relevance": 1}

Despite criticisms, show's real-world connections have been consistent, with a disturbing track record. While politics stay relevant, redemption arcs shine in season 4, promising an impactful conclusion.\n\nWhile the latest season of The Boys might be its most culturally significant to date, showrunner Eric Kripke isn't quite as excited about his work's ballooning reputation for mirroring reality as some fans of the show might expect.\n\nWhile the graphic novel story it is based on came to a conclusion in 2012 with little mainstream appeal, The Boys has exceeded every expectation for a comic book adaptation. Widely regarded as improving on the source material at a time when skepticism and genre fatigue stood at an all-time high, the show managed to deliver a bloody, grimy mess of gratuitous gore that was still able to tell an engaging, thoughtful story in a way that the comics didn't (and admittedly didn't try to at all). After the unfortunate series of events that was 2023 for both Marvel and DC films, The Boys season 4 was heralded by some as the perfect antidote for superhero fatigue come 2024 and has been the talk of the town since it started in June.\n\nRelated\n\nThe Boys: 6 Supes Who Haven't Appeared In The Show\n\nPlenty of superheroes from the comic have yet to appear in the live-action version of The Boys, begging the question of if they ever will.\n\nWhile the show has always been a bit less than subtle about making fun of real-world events, such as when The Boys used Homelander to mock Donald Trump's new sneakers, this has been taken to a whole other level with the advent of the latest season. In an interview with The Wrap, Kripke revealed that the show's growing tendency to resemble current events in the eyes of the American audience was not something he necessarily relished, despite being something that attracts many viewers to the latest season of the series. The conversation surrounding this peaked after the premiere of episode 6, which featured a secret plot to undermine democracy carried out under cover during an alt-right gathering of powerful leaders, and released on the Fourth of July. Kripke also clarified that the release date for the episode has been a total coincidence.\n\n\"This show has an increasingly disturbing track record of reflecting reality one way or another. There's some throwaway dialogue, for example, in that billionaires are talking about how they have to stack the Supreme Court to get the decisions that they need. I'm not happy being Satan's writer's room. I'm starting to get really troubled by it. But there does continue to be a certain eerie similarity between the show and the things that are happening in the real world.\"\n\nWhile there are some criticisms being leveled at the show, such as the fact that The Boys' pivotal Joe Kessler reveal scene was more interesting than the actual twist written into the season as a major plot point and has been earmarked as a sign of fading quality, the way the show invokes real-world situations and tensions has been remarkably consistent. While it certainly does more for the show's popularity than the negative reactions do to mar the show's numbers, Kripke's aversion can certainly be understood on a more human level. Being a beacon of foresight or being seen as a prophetic IP can be great, but not when the message is overly negative.\n\nEven with the politics in the show staying narratively relevant to the very end, Kripke's team has put in amazing effort elsewhere, such as with the redemption arc that has been the most interesting part of The Boys' fourth season so far by a train's length.

Fans praise the show for its realistic portrayal of what life in America would be like if superheroes actually existed -- and how not all of them would be good guys.\n\nThe statement comes after The Boys used several of its storylines to directly parallel the MAGA movement and Trump's influence. The story points are often very on the nose, including reenacting its own versions of Trump's attempts to usurp the office after his 2020 loss and the violent events of January 6. As show creator Eric Kripke told Entertainment Weekly, \"We write about whatever is pissing us off or frightening us at the time.\"\n\nBut the show's producers are now clarifying that the assassination storyline in the latest episode was not one based on the violent events at Trump's Pennsylvania rally, despite the strange timing. (The previous episode title had been \"Assassination Run,\" but was changed to \"Season Four Finale\" on the Prime Video platform, according to USA Today).\n\nFans of The Boys have pointed out several times prior to the season four finale that the show has, at other times, seemed to predict the future. Star Jack Quaid addressed the common coincidences when he told The Daily Beast, \"It's really, really weird.\"\n\n\"It almost feels like a Simpsons thing where we're predicting the future,\" he remarked. \"And I don't love it because it's usually something horrible.

The episode was retitled to simply \"Season Four Finale\" and added a \"viewer discretion advised\" warning at the beginning.\n\n\"The season finale of 'The Boys' contains scenes of fictional political violence, which some viewers may find disturbing, especially in light of the injuries and tragic loss of life sustained during the assassination attempt on former President Trump,\" read a statement shared by Prime Video. \"'The Boys' is a fictitious series that was filmed in 2023, and any scene or plotline similarities are coincidental and unintentional. Prime Video, Amazon MGM Studios, Sony Pictures Television and the producers of 'The Boys' oppose, in the strongest terms, real-world violence of any kind.\"\n\nCreated by Eric Kripke based on the graphic novel series of the same name, \"The Boys\" has covered political storylines that often mirror current events, since its first season launched in 2019. Season 4 has been set in the aftermath of the election of presidential candidate Robert Singer (played by Jim Beaver) and his villainous running mate, the undercover super-powered Victoria Neuman (Claudia Doumit).\n\nNeuman has been working for superhero mega-corporation Vought, and with its supe supremacist leader, Homelander (Antony Starr). Her agenda has made her a target for assassination by the anti-supe squad, The Boys, led by Butcher (Karl Urban) and Hughie (Jack Quaid), who have been attempting to kill her since the season premiere on June 13.\n\nThe sixth episode of Season 4 of \"The Boys\" featured Homelander, Victoria Neuman and supe Sister Sage (Susan Heyward) rally some Federalist Society one-percenters to fall in line with their plan for total supe domination, which includes assassinating Singer following inauguration and upping Neuman to president and then creating internment camps for any of their detractors.\n\n\"When we first pitched the show, it was before Trump was elected,\" Kripke said in a June 18 interview with Variety, explaining the increasing political nature of \"The Boys.\" \"And the idea that a celebrity would actively want to turn themselves into a fascist autocrat was kind of a crazy idea. I mean, it still is. But it turned out to have happened? We sort of lucked into a show whose metaphor is really about the moment we're living in, which is the cross-section of celebrity and authoritarianism.

However, there is one recurring institution in The Boys that has been the center stage for a lot of things that have happened in The Boys. I am talking about the Red River Institution which we get a glimpse of once again in The Boys Season 4 Finale. So, in this article, find out what Red River is in The Boys!\n\nRed River functions as an orphanage for kids who have superpowers. In most cases where kids discover their superpowers in The Boys universe, their first victim turns out to be their parents. So to make sure they don't harm anyone else, they are sent to Red River where they learn how to control their powers. Red River was founded by Vought International in 1965.\n\nThe prime example of this is the protagonist of Gen V, Marie Monroe who unintentionally killed her parents when she discovered her powers of being able to control blood with her mind. After the death of Victoria Neuman at the hands of Butcher using his newfound powers, Zoe (Victoria's daughter) is also sent to Red River and I have a hunch that she will appear in Gen V Season 2 in some way or other.\n\nWe have already seen that Zoe is a supe with her superpower being tentacles emanating from her mouth. Now, in Season 5 or Gen V, Zoe could play a big role and she'll be on the revenge spree to avenge her mother's brutal death in The Boys Season 4.\n\nPreviously, we have seen Red River mentioned in The Boys Season 1 Teddy Stillwell, the son of Madelyn Stillwell was taken to Red River after Homelander killed Madelyn. Next, in The Boys Seas 3, we again saw Hughie visiting Red River to investigate Victoria/Nadia's past and her powers.\n\nIn 2022, Erik Kripke in a conversation with Entertainment Weekly stated that Red River will have a much bigger role in The Boys universe so I think that something much bigger is cooking behind those doors that we really cannot speculate. In his statement, Erik said-\n\n\"It is not the last you will see of Red River. Red River becomes an interestingly bigger and bigger part of The Boys universe.\"\n\nSo let's wait for The Boys Season 5 to come out and you'll be the first ones to hear from us if any new information regarding Gen V Season 2 or The Boys Season 5 comes in.

As Karl Urban's Billy Butcher and the titular team of anti-supe rebels barrel towards its final season, the show feels less like a parody and more like a distressingly accurate play-by-play of current events, accentuated only by lobotimised sex and pubic laserings.\n\n'The Boys' Season 4 premiere review: Superhero abuse and election blues\n\nThis season's climax, with the possibility of a supe ascending to the presidency, raises the stakes to vertiginous heights. Superheroes as political figures? Outlandish, yet disturbingly close to a reality where fist-pumping, super-charged charisma often trumps competence.\n\nThe Boys Season 4 (English)Creator: Eric KripkeCast: Anthony Starr, Karl Urban, Jack Quaid, Karen Fukuhara, Erin MoriartyEpisodes: 8Runtime: 1 hourStoryline: Victoria Neuman, under the control of Homelander, is closer than ever to the Oval Office and with only months to live, Billy Butcher must find a way to work with The Boys to save the world\n\nThe season finale opens with the fresh face of primetime fascism, Firecracker (Valorie Curry), greeting us with a wake-up call: \"Good morning patriots, it's January 6th\". Eric Kripke's lampooning of populist demagoguery feels distressingly prescient. Rather than merely poking fun at the absurdity of MAGA politics, The Boys is now performing an incisive autopsy on it. And this season, they've really ramped up the absurdity, giving us everything from politically charged dismemberments to flesh-eating sheep.\n\nHomelander in a still from 'The Boys' Season 4 | Photo Credit: Amazon Prime Video\n\nIn this election year, the creators have uncorked a bottle of caustic nitroglycerin, focusing their narrative crosshairs on perhaps a little too much. Anthony Starr's Homelander, the despotic poster boy of superhuman narcissism, complete with a fan base that's more cult than constituency, is front and centre for this season's political allegory. His rhetoric, bombastic and vacuous as it is, has reached its narrative peak. In a brief yet gripping tryst with his origins -- involving a cute, whale-shaped cake, chargrilled scientists and a donut-hole through a crotch -- the botched lab experiment with a god-complex finally seems to have shed the frailty of his humanity.\n\nOf Monsters and Supermen: Tracing the roots of TV's most diabolical villains\n\nMeanwhile, the fictional megacorporation that makes Amazon look like a thrift shop (the ironies of The Boys being a Prime Video original are not beyond me) is having a field day, firing shots at its contemporaries. In its latest jab at pop culture giants, the series manages to skewer Marvel's recent missteps, including a pointed jab at the beloved D23 Expo tradition and its plethora of cinematic phases in the franchise.\n\nSuperhero fatigue has been more real than ever before and, The Boys remains an invigorating breath of sulphur. The show's relevance has only honed its edge, ripping a certain web-slinging icon a new one (quite literally), diving deep into the lurid, fetishized sex dungeon of a super-depraved billionaire, and Firecracker's cunning lactic power play that reduces the world's greatest supe to a suckling infant. Also worth mentioning is Sister Sage's (Susan Heyward) debutante dance of manipulation which has been a delight to witness and has ultimately proven that even the star-spangled puppeteers are mere pieces in a darker, more cunning chess match.\n\nSister Sage and Firecracker in a still from 'The Boys' Season 4 | Photo Credit: Amazon Prime Video\n\nSave for some rushed mishaps and patch-ups between the trauma-bonded Frenchie and Kimiko, Butcher's evolving relationship with Ryan provides the emotional anchor to this season's chaos. While a fairly predictable late-season Jeffrey Dean Morgan reveal hinted at things to come, it seems like our cockney maverick might just be gearing up for an Eren Jaeger-esque metamorphosis in the series' climactic next chapter.\n\n'The Boys' to conclude with Season 5\n\nIn a serendipitous and disturbingly foresighted convergence of fact and fiction, the finale dropped amidst a week dominated by startling real-world occurrences, namely, botched political assassinations. While one may have emerged with a political tide-turning, fist raised defiantly high, the other ushered in a new dawn of American superhero mythology, setting the stage for its grand finale and the quest to \"make America super again.\"\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nA post shared by THE BOYS (@theboystv)\n\nAll episodes of 'The Boys' Season 4 are currently streaming on Amazon Prime

Series creator Eric Kripke said the series, which was first pitched in 2016, was conceived as a \"story about the intersection of celebrity and authoritarianism and how social media and entertainment are used to sell fascism,\" noting that the Trump campaign influenced the themes of the series. Some viewers have drawn parallels between one character -- the antagonist superhero, Homelander -- and Trump. Kripke said in 2022 the character has \"always been a Trump analogue for me,\" pointing to his \"combustible mix of complete weakness and insecurity, and just horrible power and ambition.\"\n\nSome \"The Boys\" viewers have been mocked on social media for not realizing the show is a critique of right-wing politics. \"It took some people 4 seasons to realize The Boys was making fun of them the whole time,\" one user tweeted, garnering more than 400,000 likes, citing a scene where a character gives a bizarre speech claiming children are forced to become transgender and peddling the QAnon-affiliated adrenochrome conspiracy theory. Kripke expressed surprise some viewers perceived the villainous Homelander as the hero, stating: \"What do you say to that? The show's many things. Subtle isn't one of them.\"\n\nThe season four finale of \"The Boys\" premiered just five days after Trump survived an assassination attempt at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. He was shot shortly after 6 p.m. on July 13, suffering a wound to his right ear that left his face bloodied. The suspected shooter was later identified as 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks, who was shot and killed by Secret Service agents after he shot Trump. Trump made his first appearance following the shooting at the Republican National Convention this week, where he appeared with a bandaged ear and was proclaimed the Republican nominee for president.\n\nAnti-'Woke' Critics Of 'The Boys' Mocked On Social Media As Creators Say The Series Was Always A Satirical Right-Wing Critique (Forbes)", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boys_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Boys (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Right-wing politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Kripke", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Eric Kripke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superhero", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Superhero"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Prime_Video", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amazon Prime Video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satire", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Satire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authoritarianism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Authoritarianism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fascism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antagonist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Antagonist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbes", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Forbes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgender", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Transgender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secret_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Secret Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conspiracy theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butler,_Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Butler, Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Butler, Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Cartoons", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Cartoons", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 60}], "image": "https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6699229af59900bc19939608/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=3000,1687,x0,y131,safe&height=600&width=1200&fit=bounds", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9736885", "eventUri": "eng-9736885", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-13", "textStart": 1908, "textEnd": 1915}], "sentiment": -0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 133, "relevance": 1}

Like its preceding seasons, there was no shortage of gruesome death scenes, dark humor, and compelling interpersonal drama. The season 4 finale of The Boys aired today, and if you have questions about what transpired at the end, we have got you covered. Here's what happened at the end of The Boys Season 4 finale.\n\nHeavy Spoilers Warning:\n\nSeason 4's conclusion was absolutely diabolical, as every fan wanted it to be. Here is a quick recap of The Boys season 4 ending, broken down into major highlights:\n\nAfter the penultimate episode showcased the shapeshifter to be the main orchestrator of the chaos in the finale, their ultimate plan of taking down the president was put to sleep by Starlight. This resulted in enraging Homelander who was already in a furious state. Thus, he threatened the super-abled Victoria Neuman to stick with his new plan otherwise her beloved family would be slaughtered by himself. Thus, this made Victoria jump ship and seek The Boys' help for the safe space and future she has always wanted in return for helping them kill Homelander and Vought International.\n\nWe finally had a great superpower in hand along with the supe-killing virus to put an end to the wicked plans of Homelander. Well then, Butcher butchered our trump card by killing Victoria Neuman with his new tentacle power.\n\nAs overwhelmed Ryan ran amok killing his aunt Grace Mallory and choosing his path, so did Butcher who finally has come to terms with Joe Kessler's version of himself. That is why Butcher killed Victoria and also stole the supe-killing virus from the team for his grand final plans which will be revealed in season 5.\n\nMeanwhile, Ashley Berrett (yes, Ashely's last name is Berrett, Deep) takes up compound V to avoid herself from being massacred by The Deep. While Ashley's powers were not revealed completely, she was seen to be growing out of her body briefly. We're not sure whether Ashley is dead or has survived the Compound V dosage. We'll get to see more of her in The Boys Season 5 or Gen V Season 2.\n\nButcher's unexpected plan of killing Neuman put all the hopeful things we had in ruins. However, it inadvertently helped Sister Sage accomplish what she wanted along with Homelander in the front. Robert Singer had to be arrested as footage of him saying \"wanting to kill Victoria\" was unveiled to the world. By perfectly exploiting this chaotic situation, Sage assisted Calhoun in assuming the presidency and made him swear his loyalty to a helpless Homelander. Thus, Homelander's dream of being the supreme power in his homeland came to fruition, thanks to Sage.\n\nWith the president by their side, they successfully imposed martial law where the forces of supes and the military of the US assisted Homelander in apprehending his enemies. As this ultimate game has reached the final level and Butcher betrays the gang, the remnants try to escape in each direction.\n\nHowever, the aforementioned forces involving Love Sausage (Derek Johns), Cindy (Ess H\u00f6dlmoser), Cate (Madelaine Rachel Phillips), and Sam (Asa Germann) from Gen V arrested the gang members Hughie, Frenchie, Kimiko, and MM while they tried to flee from the country. Only Starlight aka Annie was able to escape with her super powers and it looks like she will play the savior role in the upcoming season. On the other hand, we saw Butcher becoming the lone wolf (not really as he has Kessler completely with him) to kick off the genocide of the supes.\n\nAs season 4 ended, the creators decided to throw in a surprise as a mid-credits scene. The mid-credit scene finally reveals that Soldier Boy is still alive (kept inside a cryogenic chamber) and he is visited by his son Homelander in the end. The Boys' Season 5 is about to get even more menacing if these two going to team up again!\n\nThat's everything that has happened in the finale of The Boys season 4. This season has successfully laid the foundation for one last showdown in the final season 5. That said, did you like season 4's ending?

States.\n\nThe 'President' declared martial law and handed over control of the country to Homelander who has essentially won.\n\nIf that wasn't enough, as the titular Boys plan to go to ground in the

and what's next.\n\nHe said: \"You know, I think the finale of season four really shows you that we've been planning five years all along, because there's no way a show goes one more season after the events of that finale.\n\n\"As far as we're concerned, it's our show's version of the apocalypse.\"\n\nRegarding Homelander's new role puppeting the president, Kripke said: \"Homelander gets everything he has wanted from the beginning, which is to completely remake the United States in his image, and according to his whims.\n\n\"The boys are at their lowest point, most of them are captured, and we worry for their future.\n\n\"I always look at it as of the five seasons, we're kind of at that point, that's sort of the end of the second act of a movie where everyone's really at their low point, and they've all faced their own personal demons.\n\n\"Now, they need to really come together in the fifth season and save the world.\"\n\nWith only one more season to go, all our

(SPOILER ALERT) | \ud83d\udcfa LatestLY", "body": "The Boys Season 4 has ended, and there is too much ground to cover here. The season finale brought together quite a few twists and turns, some major political upheavals, some major deaths, and the titular Boys once again finding themselves nowhere close to defeating Homelander (Antony Starr), particularly after one of them betrays the whole group. Before we proceed, let's warn you that the following article will be filled with major spoilers about the eighth episode of The Boys S4, which is also its final episode. The Boys Season 4 Episode 7 Recap: From Deep's 'Octopussy' Moment to Starlight's Sex Scene Twist, 9 WTF Moments From Superhero Show That Left Us Shocked.\n\nSo what happens here? There is a failed assassination attempt on US President Singer (Jim Beaver), with Homelander doing his best to bring about a political upheaval in the country, starting with murder and mayhem at Vought. He also pushes VP Victoria Neuman to the corner so much that she seeks out The Boys' help. Too bad how it turned out for her. Butcher (Karl Urban) is in hospital, still pestered by his mental alter-ego Kessler (Jeffrey Dean Morgan), and Ryan (Cameron Crovetti) seeks him out, only to find out what plans Butcher and Mallory (Laila Robins) have in store for him. That also doesn't go down well.\n\nTowards the final episodes, there are some major political upheavals after a certain 'assassination,' and The Boys are now in a deeper mess than they ever were. So is the United States of America -- they just don't know it yet. There are also some excellent performances on display particularly from Erin Moriarty, Karl Urban, Jack Quaid, Claudia Doumit and Antony Starr.\n\nSo, without further ado, here are some major WTF moments from the season finale and what they mean for the next season.\n\nPreviously, the finale of season 4 was titled \"Assassination Run\", the name which was dropped during the airing in the wake of the assassination attempt on Donald Trump, who is running again for the President of the USA for the Republican party. The episode even began with a disclaimer that you can see below.\n\nThe doppelganger Starlight, dubbed by the subs as 'Shifter-Starlighter,' continues to act her part as Hughie's super-girlfriend, even after erasing all of Victoria's wrongdoings that were in Hughie's possession. She overdoes her part at times, like wearing a costume during the crucial Senate hearing and even proposing marriage to a still-oblivious Hughie. Later, they are lying post-coital in bed, where Hughie talks about her having two fingers up his butt. Shifter-Starlight even taunts the OG Starlight, still in her captivity, by saying her boy likes butt stuff.\n\nVictoria has been keeping her superpowers a secret from the world, but an erratic Homelander, impatient about bringing more control to the country, exposes her as a super during Firecracker's live news session. Needless to say, this creates one hell of a political chaos, even getting the elections postponed.\n\nAshley overhears that Homelander and the remaining members of The Seven plan to take down all employees who know their dirty secrets, and she is on top of the list. She frantically runs to Homelander's quarters, takes one of the Compound V doses he has hidden in the secret drawer, and injects the serum within her. Her wig falls off, and we see what working under Homelander has done to her hair. What we don't see is how exactly Compound V has affected her; as the scene cuts after, we see something pulsating on her nearly bald pate, and she is never seen again in the episode.\n\nThe President is shifted to a secret basement, where Hughie, MM, Kimiko, and Shifter-Starlight also join his security detail, waiting for the doppelganger to attack. However, a throwaway line by Shifter-Starlight makes Hughie realise she is not his girlfriend but the assassin. Shifter-Starlight realises her act is up and gruesomely decimates the President's security and even incapacitates Kimiko. The Boys and the President get cornered by the assassin and nearly get killed, if not for the timely intervention by the real Starlight, who has escaped her shackles (in a manner reminiscent of the film Gerald's Game), and she kills her doppelganger. 'The Boys' S4 Finale: Amazon Prime Issues 'Viewer Discretion' Warning at Beginning of Episode 8 of Superhero Series Following Assassination Attempt on Donald Trump.\n\nOn Homelander's orders, The Deep, Black Noir II, and a coughing Firecracker (the breast milk-inducing meds doing her no good) start killing off Vought employees on their list in gory fashion. For instance, The Deep punches a man's face, leaving it as a smashed pulp of bones and viscera, and Black Noir II kills the wrong Ashley. He even gets a 'murder boner' out of it.\n\nIdeally, this romantic moment would not have been a WTF moment had the series played their love story straight. Fans have been waiting for them to fully confess their feelings for each other for four seasons now. But this season saw Frenchie have his separate love track, encouraged by Kimiko herself, and then that went bust before the makers decided to re-establish the relationship status quo. Still, the timing felt a lot off here.\n\nAfter trying to bond with his foster-father Butcher and reuniting with his 'aunt' Mallory at the hospital, Ryan is eventually told that only he is powerful enough to stop Homelander (after being told his birth father had raped his mother). Ryan, unwilling to agree to the plan, tries to leave, but Mallory stops him and pleads with him to stay. A stubborn Ryan instead pushes her away using his super-force, and the impact kills Mallory. That doesn't stop Ryan from leaving. Though we never see him again in the episode, it certainly made Butcher convinced whatever Kessler has been brainwashing him -- Supes are bad.\n\nThe Boys finally agree to bring Victoria Neuman and her supe-daughter Zoey to their hideout to protect them, but Butcher drops in with some malicious intentions. He finally reveals what Compound V has done to him and how he had killed Ezekiel as he reveals tentacles bursting out of his body, tearing apart Victoria and killing her, much to the shock of the rest of the Boys. They can only helplessly watch as Butcher walks away with the virus that Frenchie has made.\n\nSage returns to Homelander, who was devastated by Victoria's death, believing his plans have failed. She reveals nearly everything has gone according to her plan, even predicting that Victoria would go 'patsy.' She then drops her final ace -- a recorded conversation of President Singer from his secret room where he had told MM that they should have listened to him about killing Neuman. Homelander is visibly relieved that his plan is back in place, and Sage asks him to be prepared for 'Phase 2.' Well, we get an idea of what that is in the final moments...\n\nWith Singer getting arrested for Victoria's assassination, the new President is elected, who gives his allegiance to Homelander and instils martial law in the country. Homelander invokes all supes in the country to round up the 'Starlighters' and presumably throw them in internment camps. We see the Boys going their separate ways to save their skins, but each group member gets ambushed by supes -- for instance, MM gets attacked by the one who can elongate his... reproductive organ. Even Hughie gets captured, but Starlight finally finds her power, and she flies off to avoid captivity again. It looks like it is up to her and Kimiko to save their human compatriots from capture in the new season. Meanwhile, we also see Butcher driving away and seeing Kessler in the backseat, confirming his murderous alter-ego has completely taken over him. By the way, where has A-Train escaped to?\n\n11. Soldier-Boy Returns... Sort Of\n\nIn the mid-credit scene, the new President is seen bringing Homelander to a place where they have made a startling discovery. That discovery turns out to be the previously thought-dead super and Homelander's father, Soldier-Boy (Jensen Ackles), who is alive and in some sort of cryosis chamber. Homelander is shocked to see him alive, though what he plans to do with his father remains to be seen.", "source": {"uri": "latestly.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "LatestLY"}, "authors": [],

Now, Prime Video has dropped the title and shared an official statement regarding the main events depicted in the episode and the process behind it (and lack of connection to real-life events).\n\nOf course, last weekend's attempt on Trump's life isn't the first time someone has shot at a President of the U.S. nor a plot point that hasn't been tackled by countless works of fiction, but you can never be sure, especially in the age of social media, fake outrages, and more importantly, tensions in the US reaching dangerously high levels ahead of the next presidential election.\n\nYou can read the full statement, shared by the show and Prime Video's Instagram accounts, here:\n\nFor now (it might get a new title later for all we know), Amazon has retitled the episode 'Season 4 Finale' and has added a \"viewer discretion advised\" warning that shows on-screen at the start. In past interviews, The Boys showrunner Eric Kripke has said that Homelander's rise to power and many flaws were always meant to mirror Trump's journey to the White House, his misdeeds, and the legal cases against him.\n\nThis is yet another case of creative intent going in one direction and corporations going in the opposite one, trying to shield themselves from external criticisms that may come out of the loaded works of fiction they fund themselves. I want to believe most people are able to consume and dissect fiction, as well as any real-life parallels, like functioning adults, but recent pop culture discourse (and reactionary changes made by the studios in order to save face) has told us otherwise far too often. We should be happy The Boys' season 4 finale hasn't been delayed and gutted in post-production, I guess.\n\nThe Boys will be back, likely in 2026, for its fifth and final season, though some cast members have been campaigning for a big-screen conclusion that we hope doesn't happen.", "source": {"uri": "vg247.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "VG247"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boys_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Boys (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Prime_Video", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amazon Prime Video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IGN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "IGN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Kripke", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eric Kripke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactionary", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reactionary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_culture", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Popular culture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Showrunner", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Showrunner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/The-Boys_season-4_Homelander.jpg?width=1200&height=600&fit=crop&enable=upscale&auto=webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9736885", "eventUri": "eng-9736885", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3411764705882353, "wgt": 120, "relevance": 1}

By brilliantly dissecting common superhero clich\u00e9s and exposing the corrupt and dark side of our favorite superhero genre, The Boys instantly became a crowd-puller. Now that The Boys Season 4 has ended and no Season 5 news has arrived, you must be looking for more TV shows like The Boys to binge. So, here is our list of the 10 best superhero shows with gore and humor similar to The Boys by Eric Kripke.\n\nPreacher on AMC was an adaptation of the eponymous comic book series by Garth Ennis and Steve Dillon from the Vertigo lineup of DC Comics. We do not have superheroes in this series. Instead, we have a preacher who is possessed by a supernatural force and now possesses unreal powers. He then partners with a vampire and his ex-girlfriend to find the \"God\" himself. The storyline sounds pretty wacky, right?\n\nSimilar to The Boys TV show, the creators of Preacher had the creative freedom to make changes and developments from the elements of this comic book, which resulted in a hit. Preacher was also highly praised for its distinctive story and refreshing set of characters who make this series supremely entertaining.\n\nThe Doom Patrol is a superhero squad from the DC Comics brought to the live-action medium by Jeremy Carver. Doom Patrol may not be your cup of tea when it comes to the superhero genre as it features a rather quirky story. It is about a group of people endowed with superhero powers after surviving a life-or-death situation. They are put together under one roof by a scientist and are set to ward off dangers surrounding our planet.\n\nDoom Patrol is a meta show that lets its quirkiness shine with its wacky humor and unconventional exploration of the lives of these superheroes. While the series halted the release of new episodes in 2023, it is expected to return with a six-episode run soon. So, you can definitely give it a shot if you want something as rare as The Boys.\n\nHappy is a television series based on Grant Morrison and Darick Robertson's comic novel of the same name. This show, in contrast to others on our list, is the tale of a hero who stepped up to save a girl with the help of an imaginary unicorn friend called Happy.\n\nIn my opinion, it is an underrated TV series that deserves to be seen for its fresh take on a heroic story and its visual feast. Christopher Meloni as Nick Sax and Patton Oswalt as Happy will surely entertain you with their performances.\n\nHappy is wickedly hilarious and amuses you with its distinct set of characters in a world where fantasy meets a crime drama.\n\nBefore The Boys cemented its place as one of the best modern superhero dramas, there was Misfits, a popular show about superheroes from the Brits. On a stormy day, a bolt of lightning struck a team of teenage felons and bestowed them with new superhero powers.\n\nAs the show focuses on telling a tale of young superheroes, one can find that this show is similar to The Boys's spin-off, Gen V, which came out last year.\n\nMisfits was lauded for taking a unique approach in the superhero genre back then. Using this dark angle, the show cleverly portrayed the struggle of edgy teens with their newfound powers. Moreover, this TV series was also filled with plenty of dark humor and jokes within the unraveling drama that you find in The Boys.\n\nWe have yet another superhero adaptation of a comic book from the mind of Gerard Way, the lead singer of My Chemical Romance. The Umbrella Academy features a neglectful superhero family and centers around the adoptive siblings with superhero powers. They finally get together to unravel the enigma surrounding their father's passing and must save the world from impending doom.\n\nJust like The Boys, The Umbrella Academy was acclaimed by the fans for its distinct take on a story tailored around superheroes. The show is set to conclude after half a decade with season 4, which is set to release next month. Hence, gear up for the end of another extraordinary superhero TV series by binge-watching the previous seasons if you haven't already.\n\nHBO's Watchmen is a reimagining of the renowned original graphic novel series by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons. If you love Zack Snyder's version of Watchmen then I'm pretty sure you would fall in love with this retelling as well.\n\nThe story here takes place 34 years after the initial premise, during which time police conceal their identities with masks in an effort to fight racism and confront vigilantes who are regarded as outlaws nowadays.\n\nSimilar to The Boys, this show progresses with a dark and satirical tone involving the exploration of the lives of superheroes. So, it too delves deep into the consequences of being a superhero and their actions. This TV show was highly welcomed and celebrated by the fans when it was released, thus, if you are a DC and The Boys fan, you must give this a shot.\n\nIf you have seen the James Gunn adaptation of The Suicide Squad (2021), you would be familiar with Peacemaker. For those who are unaware, the famous WWE star John Cena plays the role of Peacemaker, aka Christopher Smith, in this standalone TV series. In simple terms, this DC show tells the life story of Peacemaker.\n\nMake sure to watch the Suicide Squad (2021) movie, as this resumes from where the movie ended. This show is a masterful blend of grisly and over-the-top action and crude humor, which you would enjoy if you liked The Boys.\n\nThe immense success of The Boys TV show resulted in an animated spin-off titled \"The Boys Presents: Diabolical\" in 2022. It was an anthology show featuring several animated short films set in the world of The Boys.\n\nKeep in mind that this animated show didn't reach the same level of success or appeal as Gen V or The Boys. However, if you are in the mood to kill some time, you can quickly binge this series and experience the cameos of our favorite stars from \"The Boys\" as well.\n\nAfter The Boys' popularity exploded back in 2019, Amazon decided to go for another adaptation of a comic series by Robert Kirkman but in the animation medium this time around. This series featured a star-studded cast, including Steven Yeun, J.K. Simmons, Gillian Jacobs, Walton Goggins, etc., who brought Kirkman's characters to life.\n\nInvincible tells the tale of Mark Grayson, a teenage boy who finds out he has superpowers that he acquired from his father, Omni-Man, the strongest superhero on Earth.\n\nSimilar to The Boys, Invincible also was filled with intense and gruesome action sequences that can shake you up instantly. It also covers the everyday lives of superheroes and explores their dark side which is pretty much everything you are looking out for now, isn't it? Two seasons of Invincible are out now, and there are more to come, so you should definitely start this one next.\n\nWhen the \"The Boys\" spin-off Gen V was announced, everyone was skeptical about the series being an unnecessary cash grab. However, as the show debuted, it completely turned the tide. Gen V was a fantabulous show on all fronts and wonderfully expanded The Boys' universe.\n\nIt was jam-packed with a great story and terrific performances, and last but not least, it inherited the diabolical nature and humor of its predecessor. This show's events were tied to the storyline of The Boys, and we even saw cameos from some of our favorite characters.\n\nSo, if you have either skipped this one earlier or are looking for a TV show very similar to The Boys, Gen V should be your first pick. Gen V Season 2 is currently under production, so we will get more diabolical action in the coming months.", "source": {"uri": "beebom.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Beebom"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ajith_kumar@beebom.com", "name": "Ajith Kumar", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boys_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Boys (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stranger_Things_(season_4)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stranger Things (season 4)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_Patrol_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Doom Patrol (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superhero_fiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Superhero fiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comic_book", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Comic book"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superhero", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Superhero"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DC_Comics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "DC Comics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preacher_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Preacher (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Umbrella_Academy_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Umbrella Academy (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Carver", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jeremy Carver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Meloni", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Christopher Meloni"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Dillon", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Steve Dillon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misfits_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Misfits (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Kripke", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eric Kripke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garth_Ennis", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Garth Ennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphic_violence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Graphic violence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vampire", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vampire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Live action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMC_(TV_channel)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "AMC (TV channel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "God"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clich\u00e9", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clich\u00e9"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Comics", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marvel Comics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernatural", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supernatural"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gen_V", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gen V"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peacemaker_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Peacemaker (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchmen_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Watchmen (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama_(film_and_television)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drama (film and television)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patton_Oswalt", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Patton Oswalt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darick_Robertson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Darick Robertson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerard_Way", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gerard Way"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Chemical_Romance", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "My Chemical Romance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grant_Morrison", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grant Morrison"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HBO", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "HBO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Gunn", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "James Gunn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omni-Man", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Omni-Man"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_TV", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "This TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._K._Simmons", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "J.

Security Council to Vote on Ending Sudan's Siege | Law-Order", "body": "The United Nations Security Council is set to vote on a British-drafted resolution demanding an end to the siege of al-Fashir by the Rapid Support Forces in Sudan. The draft also calls for an immediate cessation of hostilities and withdrawal of fighters threatening civilians, aiming for peace and de-escalation.\n\nThe United Nations Security Council is likely to vote on Thursday on a British-drafted resolution that demands a halt to the siege of al-Fashir in Sudan's North Dafur region by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), diplomats said on Wednesday.\n\nThe draft text, seen by Reuters, also calls for an immediate halt to the fighting and for de-escalation in and around the city and the withdrawal of all fighters that threaten the safety and security of civilians. Britain has asked for the draft to be voted on by the 15-member council on Thursday afternoon. A resolution needs at least nine votes in favor and no vetoes by Russia, China, the United States, Britain or France to be adopted.\n\nWar erupted in Sudan in April last year between the Sudanese army (SAF) and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), creating the world's largest displacement crisis. Al-Fashir is the last major city in the vast, western Darfur region not under control of the RSF. The RSF and its allies swept through four other Darfur state capitals last year and were blamed for a campaign of ethnically driven killings against non-Arab groups and other abuses in West Darfur.\n\nTop U.N. officials warned the Security Council in April that some 800,000 people in al-Fashir were in \"extreme and immediate danger\" as worsening violence advances and threatens to \"unleash bloody intercommunal strife throughout Darfur.\" The draft Security Council resolution \"demands that all parties to the conflict ensure the protection of civilians, including by allowing civilians wishing to move within and out of Al-Fashir to safer areas to do so.\"\n\nIt also calls on countries \"to refrain from external interference which seeks to foment conflict and instability and instead to support efforts for a durable peace and reminds all parties to the conflict and member states who facilitate the transfers of arms and military material to Darfur of their obligations to comply with the arms embargo measures.\" The U.S. says the warring parties have committed war crimes and the RSF and allied militias have also committed crimes against humanity and ethnic cleansing. The U.N. says that nearly 25 million people - half Sudan's population - need aid and some eight million have fled their homes and hunger is rising.\n\nBetween 10,000 and 15,000 people were killed in one city alone in Sudan's West Darfur region last year in ethnic violence by the RSF and allied Arab militia, according to a U.N. sanctions monitors report, seen by Reuters in January. The draft text to be voted on by the Security Council \"calls on the parties to the conflict to seek an immediate cessation of hostilities, leading to a sustainable resolution to the conflict, through dialogue.\"", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_Support_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rapid Support Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Nations Security Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Fashir", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Al-Fashir"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Al-Fashir"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sudan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darfur", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Darfur"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Darfur"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sudan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sudan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sudan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudanese_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sudanese Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramilitary", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paramilitary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forced_displacement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Forced displacement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Darfur", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "West Darfur"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "West Darfur"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sudan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arabs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arms_embargo", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arms embargo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_sanctions", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economic sanctions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_states_of_the_United_Nations", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Member states of the United Nations"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_cleansing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ethnic cleansing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "War crime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimes_against_humanity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Crimes against humanity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Militia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Militia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Peace", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Peace", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial_Disputes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial Disputes", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Advisories_and_Patches", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Advisories and Patches", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 56}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/aiimagegallery/12_06_2024_23_01_06_9483663.png?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9647878", "eventUri": "eng-9647878", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 239, "relevance": 1}

Security Council adopted a resolution Thursday demanding that Sudan's paramilitary force halt its siege of the only capital in the vast western region of Darfur that it doesn't control.\n\nThe resolution, which was approved by a vote of 14-0 with Russia abstaining, expresses \"grave concern\" at the spreading violence and credible reports that the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces are carrying out \"ethnically motivated violence\" in El Fasher, where more than 800,000 people are reportedly trapped.\n\nSudan plunged into conflict in mid-April 2023, when long-simmering tensions between its military and paramilitary leaders broke out in the capital Khartoum and spread to other regions including Darfur, which became synonymous with genocide two decades ago. The U.N. says over 14,000 people have been killed and 33,000 injured.\n\nTHIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP's earlier story follows below.\n\nThe U.N. Security Council will vote Thursday on a resolution demanding that Sudan's paramilitary force halt its siege of the only capital in the vast western region of Darfur that it doesn't control.\n\nThe draft resolution expressed \"grave concern\" at the spreading violence and credible reports that the Rapid Support Forces are carrying out \"ethnically motivated violence\" in El Fasher, where more than 800,000 people are reportedly trapped.\n\nSudan plunged into conflict in mid-April 2023, when long-simmering tensions between its military led by Gen. Abdel Fattah Burhan, and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces commanded by Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo, broke out into street battles in the capital, Khartoum. Fighting has spread to other parts of the country, especially urban areas and the vast western Darfur region, and the U.N. says over 14,000 people have been killed and 33,000 injured.\n\nTwo decades ago, Darfur became synonymous with genocide and war crimes, particularly by the notorious Janjaweed Arab militias, against populations that identify as Central or East African. Up to 300,000 people were killed and 2.7 million were driven from their homes.\n\nThat legacy appears to have returned, with the International Criminal Court's prosecutor, Karim Khan, saying in January there are grounds to believe both sides may be committing war crimes, crimes against humanity, or genocide in Darfur.\n\nThe RSF was formed from Janjaweed fighters by former Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir, who ruled the country for three decades before being overthrown during a popular uprising in 2019. He is wanted by the ICC on charges of genocide and other crimes during the conflict in Darfur in the 2000s.\n\nThe draft resolution demands that the RSF and government forces ensure the protection of civilians, including allowing those wishing to move in El Fasher or leave the North Darfur capital to safer areas.\n\nIt calls for an immediate halt to the fighting and de-escalation around El Fasher, and for \"the withdrawal of all fighters that threaten the safety and security of civilians.\"\n\nThe draft resolution calls on both sides \"to seek an immediate cessation of hostilities, leading to a sustainable resolution to the conflict, through dialogue,\" supported by U.N. envoy Ramtane Lamamra and the African Union's High-Level Panel on Sudan.\n\nIt also calls on all nations to halt interference fomenting conflict and instability instead of peace efforts and to remind countries supplying weapons to the combatants that they are violating a U.N. arms embargo and could face sanctions.\n\nU.N. political chief Rosemary DiCarlo told the council on April 19 that the year-long war has been fueled by weapons from foreign supporters who continue to flout U.N. sanctions aimed at helping end the conflict. \"This is illegal, it is immoral, and it must stop,\" she said.\n\nShe didn't name any of the foreign supporters.\n\nBut Burhan, who led a military takeover of Sudan in 2021, is a close ally of neighboring Egypt and its president, former army chief Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi. In February, Sudan's foreign minister held talks in Tehran with his Iranian counterpart amid unconfirmed reports of drone purchases for government forces.\n\nDagalo, the leader of the RSF, has reportedly received support from Russia's Wagner mercenary group. U.N. experts said in a recent report that the RSF has also received support from Arab allied communities and new military supply lines running through Chad, Libya and South Sudan.\n\nThe draft expresses concern at \"the catastrophic and deteriorating humanitarian situation, including crisis-level or worse acute food insecurity, and the imminent risk of famine, particularly in Darfur.\"\n\nThe U.N. humanitarian office said Tuesday that the U.N. and aid organizations \"are working against the clock to stave off famine and mitigate the most pressing humanitarian needs in Sudan.", "source": {"uri": "hosted.ap.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Associated Press"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_Support_Forces", "type": "wiki",

Security Council will vote on a resolution demanding that Sudan's paramilitary force halt its siege of the only capital in the vast western region of Darfur that it doesn't control\n\nUNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The U.N. Security Council will vote Thursday on a resolution demanding that Sudan's paramilitary force halt its siege of the only capital in the vast western region of Darfur that it doesn't control.\n\nThe draft resolution expressed \"grave concern\" at the spreading violence and credible reports that the Rapid Support Forces are carrying out \"ethnically motivated violence\" in El Fasher, where more than 800,000 people are reportedly trapped.\n\nSudan plunged into conflict in mid-April 2023, when long-simmering tensions between its military led by Gen. Abdel Fattah Burhan, and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces commanded by Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo, broke out into street battles in the capital, Khartoum. Fighting has spread to other parts of the country, especially urban areas and the vast western Darfur region, and the U.N. says over 14,000 people have been killed and 33,000 injured.\n\nTwo decades ago, Darfur became synonymous with genocide and war crimes, particularly by the notorious Janjaweed Arab militias, against populations that identify as Central or East African. Up to 300,000 people were killed and 2.7 million were driven from their homes.\n\nThat legacy appears to have returned, with the International Criminal Court's prosecutor, Karim Khan, saying in January there are grounds to believe both sides may be committing war crimes, crimes against humanity, or genocide in Darfur.\n\nThe RSF was formed from Janjaweed fighters by former Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir, who ruled the country for three decades before being overthrown during a popular uprising in 2019. He is wanted by the ICC on charges of genocide and other crimes during the conflict in Darfur in the 2000s.\n\nThe draft resolution demands that the RSF and government forces ensure the protection of civilians, including allowing those wishing to move in El Fasher or leave the North Darfur capital to safer areas.\n\nIt calls for an immediate halt to the fighting and de-escalation around El Fasher, and for \"the withdrawal of all fighters that threaten the safety and security of civilians.\"\n\nThe draft resolution calls on both sides \"to seek an immediate cessation of hostilities, leading to a sustainable resolution to the conflict, through dialogue,\" supported by U.N. envoy Ramtane Lamamra and the African Union's High-Level Panel on Sudan.\n\nIt also calls on all nations to halt interference fomenting conflict and instability instead of peace efforts and to remind countries supplying weapons to the combatants that they are violating a U.N. arms embargo and could face sanctions.\n\nU.N. political chief Rosemary DiCarlo told the council on April 19 that the year-long war has been fueled by weapons from foreign supporters who continue to flout U.N. sanctions aimed at helping end the conflict. \"This is illegal, it is immoral, and it must stop,\" she said.\n\nShe didn't name any of the foreign supporters.\n\nBut Burhan, who led a military takeover of Sudan in 2021, is a close ally of neighboring Egypt and its president, former army chief Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi. In February, Sudan's foreign minister held talks in Tehran with his Iranian counterpart amid unconfirmed reports of drone purchases for government forces.\n\nDagalo, the leader of the RSF, has reportedly received support from Russia's Wagner mercenary group. U.N. experts said in a recent report that the RSF has also received support from Arab allied communities and new military supply lines running through Chad, Libya and South Sudan.\n\nThe draft expresses concern at \"the catastrophic and deteriorating humanitarian situation, including crisis-level or worse acute food insecurity, and the imminent risk of famine, particularly in Darfur.\"\n\nThe U.N. humanitarian office said Tuesday that the U.N. and aid organizations \"are working against the clock to stave off famine and mitigate the most pressing humanitarian needs in Sudan.\n\nBut the U.N. said this is \"incredibly challenging\" because this year's humanitarian appeal for Sudan is just 16% cent funded -- with less than $441 million received of the $2.7 billion required.", "source": {"uri": "wboc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WBOC TV-16"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@wboc.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "edith_m_lederer@wboc.com", "name": "Edith M.

A resolution needs at least nine votes in favor and no vetoes by Russia, China, the United States, Britain or France to be adopted.\n\nWar erupted in Sudan in April last year between the Sudanese army (SAF) and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), creating the world's largest displacement crisis.\n\nAl-Fashir is the last major city in the vast, western Darfur region not under control of the RSF. The RSF and its allies swept through four other Darfur state capitals last year and were blamed for a campaign of ethnically driven killings against non-Arab groups and other abuses in West Darfur.\n\nTop U.N. officials warned the Security Council in April that some 800,000 people in al-Fashir were in \"extreme and immediate danger\" as worsening violence advances and threatens to \"unleash bloody intercommunal strife throughout Darfur.\"\n\nThe draft Security Council resolution \"demands that all parties to the conflict ensure the protection of civilians, including by allowing civilians wishing to move within and out of Al-Fashir to safer areas to do so.\"\n\nIt also calls on countries \"to refrain from external interference which seeks to foment conflict and instability and instead to support efforts for a durable peace and reminds all parties to the conflict and member states who facilitate the transfers of arms and military material to Darfur of their obligations to comply with the arms embargo measures.\"\n\nThe U.S. says the warring parties have committed war crimes and the RSF and allied militias have also committed crimes against humanity and ethnic cleansing. The U.N. says that nearly 25 million people - half Sudan's population - need aid and some eight million have fled their homes and hunger is rising.\n\nBetween 10,000 and 15,000 people were killed in one city alone in Sudan's West Darfur region last year in ethnic violence by the RSF and allied Arab militia, according to a U.N. sanctions monitors report, seen by Reuters in January.\n\nThe draft text to be voted on by the Security Council \"calls on the parties to the conflict to seek an immediate cessation of hostilities, leading to a sustainable resolution to the conflict, through dialogue.\"\n\n(Reporting by Michelle Nichols;

Security Council will vote Thursday on a resolution demanding that Sudan's paramilitary force halt its siege of the only capital in the vast western region of Darfur that it doesn't control.\n\nThe draft resolution expressed \"grave concern\" at the spreading violence and credible reports that the Rapid Support Forces are carrying out \"ethnically motivated violence\" in El Fasher, where more than 800,000 people are reportedly trapped.\n\nSudan plunged into conflict in mid-April 2023, when long-simmering tensions between its military led by Gen. Abdel Fattah Burhan, and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces commanded by Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo, broke out into street battles in the capital, Khartoum. Fighting has spread to other parts of the country, especially urban areas and the vast western Darfur region, and the U.N. says over 14,000 people have been killed and 33,000 injured.\n\nTwo decades ago, Darfur became synonymous with genocide and war crimes, particularly by the notorious Janjaweed Arab militias, against populations that identify as Central or East African. Up to 300,000 people were killed and 2.7 million were driven from their homes.\n\nThat legacy appears to have returned, with the International Criminal Court's prosecutor, Karim Khan, saying in January there are grounds to believe both sides may be committing war crimes, crimes against humanity, or genocide in Darfur.\n\nThe RSF was formed from Janjaweed fighters by former Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir, who ruled the country for three decades before being overthrown during a popular uprising in 2019. He is wanted by the ICC on charges of genocide and other crimes during the conflict in Darfur in the 2000s.\n\nThe draft resolution demands that the RSF and government forces ensure the protection of civilians, including allowing those wishing to move in El Fasher or leave the North Darfur capital to safer areas.\n\nIt calls for an immediate halt to the fighting and de-escalation around El Fasher, and for \"the withdrawal of all fighters that threaten the safety and security of civilians.\"\n\nThe draft resolution calls on both sides \"to seek an immediate cessation of hostilities, leading to a sustainable resolution to the conflict, through dialogue,\" supported by U.N. envoy Ramtane Lamamra and the African Union's High-Level Panel on Sudan.\n\nIt also calls on all nations to halt interference fomenting conflict and instability instead of peace efforts and to remind countries supplying weapons to the combatants that they are violating a U.N. arms embargo and could face sanctions.\n\nU.N. political chief Rosemary DiCarlo told the council on April 19 that the year-long war has been fueled by weapons from foreign supporters who continue to flout U.N. sanctions aimed at helping end the conflict. \"This is illegal, it is immoral, and it must stop,\" she said.\n\nShe didn't name any of the foreign supporters.\n\nBut Burhan, who led a military takeover of Sudan in 2021, is a close ally of neighboring Egypt and its president, former army chief Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi. In February, Sudan's foreign minister held talks in Tehran with his Iranian counterpart amid unconfirmed reports of drone purchases for government forces.\n\nDagalo, the leader of the RSF, has reportedly received support from Russia's Wagner mercenary group. U.N. experts said in a recent report that the RSF has also received support from Arab allied communities and new military supply lines running through Chad, Libya and South Sudan.\n\nThe draft expresses concern at \"the catastrophic and deteriorating humanitarian situation, including crisis-level or worse acute food insecurity, and the imminent risk of famine, particularly in Darfur.\"\n\nThe U.N. humanitarian office said Tuesday that the U.N. and aid organizations \"are working against the clock to stave off famine and mitigate the most pressing humanitarian needs in Sudan.\n\nBut the U.N. said this is \"incredibly challenging\" because this year's humanitarian appeal for Sudan is just 16% cent funded -- with less than $441 million received of the $2.7 billion required.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Ambassador Barbara Woodward told the council. \"This council has sent a strong signal to the parties to the conflict today. This brutal and unjust conflict needs to end.\"\n\nWar erupted in Sudan in April last year between the Sudanese army and the RSF, triggering the world's largest displacement crisis. Top U.N. officials have warned the worsening violence around al-Fashir threatens to unleash bloody intercommunal strife throughout Darfur.\n\nThe British-drafted resolution received 14 votes in favor, while Russia abstained.\n\nU.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Linda Thomas-Greenfield said it was a \"precarious moment.\"\n\n\"The people of al-Fashir are trapped. They're surrounded by heavily-armed RSF. Food, water, medicine and other essentials are drying up,\" she said. \"Famine is setting in and the threat of further violence, including a large scale massacre, looms large.\"\n\nAl-Fashir's main hospital has been attacked by the RSF and put out of service, Doctors Without Borders said on Sunday. Some 130,000 residents have fled the city due to fighting in April and May, the U.N. has said, but leaving is dangerous as those fleeing have been attacked on the main RSF-controlled road out.\n\nThe Security Council called on the warring parties to allow civilians to move to safer areas within and outside al-Fashir.\n\nA June 5 report by the Yale Humanitarian Research Lab found some 40 settlements outside the city have been razed by arson since the end of March.\n\nThe Security Council urged countries \"to refrain from external interference which seeks to foment conflict and instability ... and reminds all parties to the conflict and member states who facilitate the transfers of arms and military material to Darfur of their obligations to comply with the arms embargo measures.\"\n\nU.N. sanctions monitors have described as \"credible\" accusations that the United Arab Emirates has provided military support to the RSF. The UAE has denied it.\n\nThe U.N. has said nearly 25 million people, half Sudan's population, need aid and some 8 million have fled their homes.\n\nA United Nations-backed global authority on food security has said immediate action is needed to \"prevent widespread death and total collapse of livelihoods and avert a catastrophic hunger crisis in Sudan.\"\n\nThe U.S. says the warring parties have committed war crimes and the RSF and allied militias have also committed crimes against humanity and ethnic cleansing.\n\nBetween 10,000 and 15,000 people were killed in one city alone in West Darfur last year in ethnic violence orchestrated by the RSF and allied Arab militia, according to a U.N. sanctions monitors report, seen by Reuters in January.

The council demands the withdrawal of all fighters and urges warring parties to allow civilians to relocate safely. The ongoing conflict has triggered a severe humanitarian crisis.\n\nThe United Nations Security Council on Thursday demanded a halt to the siege of al-Fashir - a city of 1.8 million people in Sudan's North Darfur region - by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) and an immediate end to fighting in the area. The 15-member council adopted a British-drafted resolution that also calls for the withdrawal of all fighters who threaten the safety and security of civilians in al-Fashir, the last big city in the vast, western Darfur region not under RSF control.\n\n\"An attack on the city would be catastrophic,\" Britain's U.N. Ambassador Barbara Woodward told the council. \"This council has sent a strong signal to the parties to the conflict today. This brutal and unjust conflict needs to end.\" War erupted in Sudan in April last year between the Sudanese army and the RSF, triggering the world's largest displacement crisis. Top U.N. officials have warned the worsening violence around al-Fashir threatens to unleash bloody intercommunal strife throughout Darfur.\n\nThe British-drafted resolution received 14 votes in favor, while Russia abstained. U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Linda Thomas-Greenfield said it was a \"precarious moment.\"\n\n\"The people of al-Fashir are trapped. They're surrounded by heavily-armed RSF. Food, water, medicine and other essentials are drying up,\" she said. \"Famine is setting in and the threat of further violence, including a large scale massacre, looms large.\" Al-Fashir's main hospital has been attacked by the RSF and put out of service, Doctors Without Borders said on Sunday. Some 130,000 residents have fled the city due to fighting in April and May, the U.N. has said, but leaving is dangerous as those fleeing have been attacked on the main RSF-controlled road out.\n\nThe Security Council called on the warring parties to allow civilians to move to safer areas within and outside al-Fashir. A June 5 report by the Yale Humanitarian Research Lab found some 40 settlements outside the city have been razed by arson since the end of March.\n\nThe Security Council urged countries \"to refrain from external interference which seeks to foment conflict and instability ... and reminds all parties to the conflict and member states who facilitate the transfers of arms and military material to Darfur of their obligations to comply with the arms embargo measures.\" U.N. sanctions monitors have described as \"credible\" accusations that the United Arab Emirates has provided military support to the RSF. The UAE has denied it.\n\nThe U.N. has said nearly 25 million people, half Sudan's population, need aid and some 8 million have fled their homes. A United Nations-backed global authority on food security has said immediate action is needed to \"prevent widespread death and total collapse of livelihoods and avert a catastrophic hunger crisis in Sudan.\"\n\nThe U.S. says the warring parties have committed war crimes and the RSF and allied militias have also committed crimes against humanity and ethnic cleansing. Between 10,000 and 15,000 people were killed in one city alone in West Darfur last year in ethnic violence orchestrated by the RSF and allied Arab militia, according to a U.N. sanctions monitors report, seen by Reuters in January.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news",

Security Council adopted a resolution Thursday demanding that Sudan\u00b4s paramilitary force halt its siege of the only capital in the vast western region of Darfur that it doesn\u00b4t control.\n\nThe resolution, which was approved by a vote of 14-0 with Russia abstaining, expresses \"grave concern\" at the spreading violence and credible reports that the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces are carrying out \"ethnically motivated violence\" in El Fasher, where more than 800,000 people are reportedly trapped.\n\nSudan plunged into conflict in mid-April 2023, when long-simmering tensions between its military and paramilitary leaders broke out in the capital Khartoum and spread to other regions including Darfur, which became synonymous with genocide two decades ago. The U.N. says over 14,000 people have been killed and 33,000 injured.\n\nTHIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP\u00b4s earlier story follows below.\n\nThe U.N. Security Council will vote Thursday on a resolution demanding that Sudan\u00b4s paramilitary force halt its siege of the only capital in the vast western region of Darfur that it doesn\u00b4t control.\n\nThe draft resolution expressed \"grave concern\" at the spreading violence and credible reports that the Rapid Support Forces are carrying out \"ethnically motivated violence\" in El Fasher, where more than 800,000 people are reportedly trapped.\n\nSudan plunged into conflict in mid-April 2023, when long-simmering tensions between its military led by Gen. Abdel Fattah Burhan, and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces commanded by Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo, broke out into street battles in the capital, Khartoum. Fighting has spread to other parts of the country, especially urban areas and the vast western Darfur region, and the U.N. says over 14,000 people have been killed and 33,000 injured.\n\nTwo decades ago, Darfur became synonymous with genocide and war crimes, particularly by the notorious Janjaweed Arab militias, against populations that identify as Central or East African. Up to 300,000 people were killed and 2.7 million were driven from their homes.\n\nThat legacy appears to have returned, with the International Criminal Court\u00b4s prosecutor, Karim Khan, saying in January there are grounds to believe both sides may be committing war crimes, crimes against humanity, or genocide in Darfur.\n\nThe RSF was formed from Janjaweed fighters by former Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir, who ruled the country for three decades before being overthrown during a popular uprising in 2019. He is wanted by the ICC on charges of genocide and other crimes during the conflict in Darfur in the 2000s.\n\nThe draft resolution demands that the RSF and government forces ensure the protection of civilians, including allowing those wishing to move in El Fasher or leave the North Darfur capital to safer areas.\n\nIt calls for an immediate halt to the fighting and de-escalation around El Fasher, and for \"the withdrawal of all fighters that threaten the safety and security of civilians.\"\n\nThe draft resolution calls on both sides \"to seek an immediate cessation of hostilities, leading to a sustainable resolution to the conflict, through dialogue,\" supported by U.N. envoy Ramtane Lamamra and the African Union\u00b4s High-Level Panel on Sudan.\n\nIt also calls on all nations to halt interference fomenting conflict and instability instead of peace efforts and to remind countries supplying weapons to the combatants that they are violating a U.N. arms embargo and could face sanctions.\n\nU.N. political chief Rosemary DiCarlo told the council on April 19 that the year-long war has been fueled by weapons from foreign supporters who continue to flout U.N. sanctions aimed at helping end the conflict. \"This is illegal, it is immoral, and it must stop,\" she said.\n\nShe didn\u00b4t name any of the foreign supporters.\n\nBut Burhan, who led a military takeover of Sudan in 2021, is a close ally of neighboring Egypt and its president, former army chief Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi. In February, Sudan\u00b4s foreign minister held talks in Tehran with his Iranian counterpart amid unconfirmed reports of drone purchases for government forces.\n\nDagalo, the leader of the RSF, has reportedly received support from Russia\u00b4s Wagner mercenary group. U.N. experts said in a recent report that the RSF has also received support from Arab allied communities and new military supply lines running through Chad, Libya and South Sudan.\n\nThe draft expresses concern at \"the catastrophic and deteriorating humanitarian situation, including crisis-level or worse acute food insecurity, and the imminent risk of famine, particularly in Darfur.\"\n\nThe U.N. humanitarian office said Tuesday that the U.N. and aid organizations \"are working against the clock to stave off famine and mitigate the most pressing humanitarian needs in Sudan.\n\nBut the U.N. said this is \"incredibly challenging\" because this year\u00b4s humanitarian appeal for Sudan is just 16% cent funded -- with less than $441 million received of the $2.7 billion required.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_Support_Forces",

Security Council will vote Thursday on a resolution demanding that Sudan's paramilitary force halt its siege of the only capital in the vast western region of Darfur that it doesn't control.\n\nThe draft resolution expressed \"grave concern\" at the spreading violence and credible reports that the Rapid Support Forces are carrying out \"ethnically motivated violence\" in El Fasher, where more than 800,000 people are reportedly trapped.\n\nSudan plunged into conflict in mid-April 2023, when long-simmering tensions between its military led by Gen. Abdel Fattah Burhan, and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces commanded by Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo, broke out into street battles in the capital, Khartoum.

Up to 300,000 people were killed and 2.7 million were driven from their homes.\n\nThat legacy appears to have returned, with the International Criminal Court's prosecutor, Karim Khan, saying in January there are grounds to believe both sides may be committing war crimes, crimes against humanity, or genocide in Darfur.\n\nThe RSF was formed from Janjaweed fighters by former Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir, who ruled the country for three decades before being overthrown during a popular uprising in 2019. He is wanted by the ICC on charges of genocide and other crimes during the conflict in Darfur in the 2000s.\n\nThe resolution demands that the RSF and government forces ensure the protection of civilians, including allowing those wishing to move in El Fasher or leave the North Darfur capital to safer areas.\n\nIt calls for an immediate halt to the fighting and de-escalation around El Fasher, and for \"the withdrawal of all fighters that threaten the safety and security of civilians.\"\n\nThe resolution calls on both sides \"to seek an immediate cessation of hostilities, leading to a sustainable resolution to the conflict, through dialogue,\" supported by U.N. envoy Ramtane Lamamra and the African Union's High-Level Panel on Sudan.\n\nIt also calls on all nations to halt interference fomenting conflict and instability instead of peace efforts and to remind countries supplying weapons to the combatants that they are violating a U.N. arms embargo and could face sanctions.\n\nU.N. political chief Rosemary DiCarlo told the council on April 19 that the year-long war has been fueled by weapons from foreign supporters who continue to flout U.N. sanctions aimed at helping end the conflict. \"This is illegal, it is immoral, and it must stop,\" she said.\n\nShe didn't name any of the foreign supporters.\n\nBut Burhan, who led a military takeover of Sudan in 2021, is a close ally of neighboring Egypt and its president, former army chief Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi. In February, Sudan's foreign minister held talks in Tehran with his Iranian counterpart amid unconfirmed reports of drone purchases for government forces.\n\nDagalo, the leader of the RSF, has reportedly received support from Russia's Wagner mercenary group. U.N. experts said in a recent report that the RSF has also received support from Arab allied communities and new military supply lines running through Chad, Libya and South Sudan.\n\nThe resolution expresses concern at \"the catastrophic and deteriorating humanitarian situation, including crisis-level or worse acute food insecurity, and the imminent risk of famine, particularly in Darfur.\"\n\nThe U.N. humanitarian office said Tuesday that the U.N. and aid organizations \"are working against the clock to stave off famine and mitigate the most pressing humanitarian needs in Sudan.", "source": {"uri": "chatnewstoday.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "CHAT News Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janjaweed", "type": "wiki", "score":

of el-Fasher in Sudan's Darfur", "body": "Resolution calls on Sudanese military and RSF to ensure protection of civilians and seek immediate end to violence.\n\nThe United Nations Security Council (UNSC) has approved a resolution demanding that Sudan's paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) halt the siege of el-Fasher in North Darfur region and end fighting in the area.\n\nThe resolution, approved in a vote of 14-0 with Russia abstaining on Thursday, expressed \"grave concern\" at the spreading violence and reports that the RSF is carrying out \"ethnically motivated violence\" in el-Fasher.\n\nThe conflict in Sudan broke out in April 2023 between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF), led by Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and the RSF, which are loyal to General Mohamed Hamdan \"Hemedti\" Dagalo.\n\nThursday's resolution demanded that the RSF and government forces ensure the protection of civilians, including allowing those wishing to leave el-Fasher to do so.\n\nHundreds of thousands of people are trapped in el-Fasher - the last large urban centre in the vast, western Darfur region not under RSF control.\n\nThe UNSC measure called for de-escalation around el-Fasher and for \"the withdrawal of all fighters that threaten the safety and security of civilians\".\n\nIt called on the RSF and military \"to seek an immediate cessation of hostilities, leading to a sustainable resolution to the conflict, through dialogue\".\n\nIt also called on all nations to end interference fomenting conflict and instability instead of peace efforts.\n\n\"Crucial roads out of el-Fasher are blocked, preventing civilians from reaching safer areas, while at the same time limiting the amount of food and other humanitarian aid coming into the city,\" said Othman Belbeisi, the International Organization for Migration regional director for the Middle East and North Africa.\n\nLouis Charbonneau, UN director at Human Rights Watch, welcomed the resolution on Thursday.\n\n\"Today's resolution puts the Sudanese Armed Forces & Rapid Support Forces on notice that the world is watching,\" Charbonneau wrote in a social media post. \"It warns of imminent famine, especially in Darfur, & calls for accountability for violations of int'l humanitarian & human rights law.\"\n\nEarlier this week, the International Criminal Court's (ICC) chief prosecutor, Karim Khan, appealed for evidence for an investigation by his office into alleged war crimes in Darfur.\n\n\"I am extremely concerned about allegations of widespread international crimes being committed in el-Fasher and its surrounding areas,\" Khan said in a video statement on Tuesday.\n\nHe added that the probe \"seems to disclose an organised, systematic and a profound attack on human dignity\".\n\nIn 2009, the ICC issued arrest warrants for former Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir on charges including genocide allegedly committed in Darfur between 2003-2008.\n\nThe RSF was born out of the Popular Defence Forces militias, commonly known as Janjaweed, mobilised by al-Bashir against non-Arab tribes in Darfur.\n\nThe Sudanese military removed al-Bashir from power in 2019 after months of antigovernment protests.\n\nA promised transition to full civilian rule in the post-Bashir era did not materialise, and the Sudanese military staged a coup against the civilian government of Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok in October 2021, leading to his resignation early in 2022.\n\nWeeks before violence between the military and RSF erupted last year, Sudan's leaders appeared set to sign a deal to return the country to its democratic transition, but the accord was delayed because of outstanding disagreements.", "source": {"uri": "aljazeera.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Al Jazeera

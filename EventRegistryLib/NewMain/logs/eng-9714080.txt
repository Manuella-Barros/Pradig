Gandhi pledged to collaborate with people of Manipur towards peace. Meanwhile, the Indigenous Tribal Leaders' Forum urged Gandhi for an immediate political solution to ethnic hostilities. Notably, Gandhi was accompanied by Manipur's Lok Sabha MPs Angomcha Bimol Akoijam (Inner Manipur) and Alfred Kanngam S Arthur (Outer Manipur (ST)), along with Congress General Secretary KC Venugopal and other senior party leaders.\n\nTo recall, Manipur conflict became a flashpoint during inaugural session of the 18th Lok Sabha. During the PM's address to the Lower House, opposition disrupted his speech with relentless chants of \"Manipur, Manipur\" and \"We want justice.\" A day later, the PM in his address to the Rajya Sabha said that the violence in Manipur is decreasing and the government is actively working to curb it. He also criticized the opposition for politicizing the sensitive issue.", "source": {"uri": "newsbytesapp.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NewsBytes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indian National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Narendra Modi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahatma_Gandhi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mahatma Gandhi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manipur", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manipur"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manipur"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Member of parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rahul_Gandhi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rahul Gandhi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindi", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hindi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lok_Sabha", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lok Sabha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leader_of_the_Opposition", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Leader of the Opposition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Churachandpur_district", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Churachandpur district"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Churachandpur district"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Parliament of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imphal", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Imphal"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Imphal"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_Manipur_Lok_Sabha_constituency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Outer Manipur Lok Sabha constituency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajya_Sabha", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rajya Sabha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_house", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lower house"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial_Disputes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial Disputes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Sikhism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Sikhism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://i.cdn.newsbytesapp.com/images/31430371720696258.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9714080", "eventUri": "eng-9714080", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 215, "relevance": 1}

Here's a look at some of the reactions to Ramesh's recent remarks drawing comparisons between PM Modi's Moscow visit to Rahul Gandhi's visit to Manipur:\n\nEarlier today, PM Modi, in his departure statement, emphasized India's commitment to enhancing bilateral ties with Russia across various sectors, including trade, energy, and defence. He underscored India's role in fostering a peaceful and stable regional environment, aligning with broader global interests.\n\n\"The special and privileged strategic partnership between India and Russia has advanced over the past 10 years, including in areas of energy, security, trade, investment, health, education, culture, tourism and people-to-people exchanges,\" Modi said in his departure statement.\n\n\"I look forward to reviewing all aspects of bilateral cooperation with my friend President Vladimir Putin and sharing perspectives on various regional and global issues,\" he said.\n\n\"We seek to play a supportive role for a peaceful and stable region,\" he said without making any specific references.\n\nAlso read: Modi's Investment in Pezeshkian's Iran: The Strategic

Leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi on Thursday made it clear that \"Congress and INDIA bloc will raise the Manipur issue with full force in Parliament.\"\n\nRahul, who recently made his third visit to the strife-torn state, reiterated that Prime Minister Narendra Modi should personally visit Manipur, listen to the problems of the people and appeal for peace.\n\nThe former Congress chief, who met victims of violence in three relief camps, assured people that his party will raise the problems being faced by the people of Manipur in the upcoming session of Parliament.\n\n\"We can put pressure (on the government) and we will put pressure on them. I can help you, I can raise the issue and put pressure but I can't reassure you when you will be able to go back to your homes because the government has the answer to this. You will see in the next session, I will raise your voice,\" Rahul is heard telling people in videos shared of his visit to a relief camp in Manipur.\n\nParliament will reconvene on July 22 for the Budget session. The opposition has been relentless in its attacks on the government over its failure to end violence in Manipur. Their main target is Prime Minister Modi who has not visited the state since it plunged into violence on May 3 last year after ethnic clashes broke out between the Meiteis and the Kukis. Some 200 people have been killed till now while thousands have been displaced following large-scale arson that gutted homes and government buildings.\n\nIn the just concluded Parliament session, the Prime Minister faced opposition sloganeering over Manipur situation right through his reply to the Motion of Thanks on the President's address. The Lok Sabha later adopted a motion moved by defence minister Rajnath Singh condemning the behaviour of opposition members and accusing them of violating parliamentary traditions. The Congress, however, justified the sloganeering blaming the government's unwillingness to give an MP from Manipur five minutes to speak before the PM's reply in Lok Sabha.\n\nWhile PM Modi did not mention Manipur in his speech in Lok Sabha, in Rajya Sabha he blamed the opposition for politicising a sensitive issue.\n\n\"We are continuously trying to maintain peace and stability in Manipur. More than 11,000 FIRs have been registered, and more than 500 people have been arrested in Manipur, which is a very small state. Now, the incidents of violence are coming down. This means peace is possible,\" the PM said in his speech.\n\n\"Both Central and state governments are actively working to resolve regional issues with patience and peace. Union Home Minister Amit Shah visited Manipur and stayed for weeks there, engaging with relevant stakeholders,\" he added.\n\n'PM's visit should not be made an issue'\n\nManipur chief minister N Biren Singh, who has faced opposition flak for his failure to end violence, feels whether Prime Minister Narendra Modi visits the state or not should not be made an issue. \"We are keeping in touch with the PM round-the-clock and working under his guidance. All security-related, relief, and other works are being planned and performed as per the Prime Minister's advice and approval,\" the Manipur chief minister said countering the Congress's attacks on PM Modi.\n\nHowever, the Congress, which wrested two Lok Sabha seats of the state from the BJP, has made Modi's visit to the state a political issue and is unlikely to tone down its attack till the Prime Minister actually decides to visit the troubled northeast state. Rahul, who had visited Manipur weeks after ethnic violence and also began his 'Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra' from the state in January 2024, will continue to try and capitalise on the issue.\n\n(With inputs from agencies)\n\nThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.

On the other hand, the Congress slammed PM Modi for not making the long-due trip to Manipur but visiting Russia.\n\nBJP IT cell chief Amit Malviya, who called the violence in Manipur a \"legacy\" of the Congress, also accused the newly installed Leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha of indulging in \"sick tragedy tourism\".\n\n\"The ethnic conflict in Manipur is a legacy of the Congress party. The state has witnessed the killing of civilians, police and Army personnel for decades, while the Congress was in power,\" said Malviya.\n\nCongress slams PM Modi for not paying visit to Manipur\n\nThe Congress, meanwhile, slammed Prime Minister Narendra Modi over his visit to Russia and not making a trip to Manipur since the ethnic violence broke out there.\n\n\"Today, the non-biological PM goes to Moscow while the Leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha heads for Assam and Manipur. Of course, the drum beaters of the non-biological PM have claimed that he stopped the Russia-Ukraine war for some time. Presumably, this Moscow trip will lead to even more bizarre claims,\" said Congress leader Jairam Ramesh.\n\nRahul Gandhi's trip to northeast\n\nIn his visit to the northeast, Gandhi first met flood-affected people and displaced Kuki-Zo members in BJP-ruled Assam before heading to neighbouring Manipur where he interacted with people affected by the year-long ethnic violence.\n\nGandhi said that the flood situation in Assam \"reflected the gross and grave mismanagement by BJP's double-engine government\".\n\nIn the first session of the new Lok Sabha, the Congress leaders highlighted the ethnic conflict in Manipur in both Houses of Parliament. Though the party has been raising the issue repeatedly, Gandhi's visit to the northeast coincides with PM Modi travelling to Russia.

It means there are no jobs here. They are desperate, they are looking for jobs and they have to go and become agniveers for Russia. And two of them have died. So who is recruiting them? Which is this contractor? What are its political links? We can't give jobs to our youth...

This is his third visit. In the last 17 months, the Prime Minister has not said anything about Manipur.

A woman from the Jiribam relief camp revealed that her grandmother remains trapped in a conflict zone, and they have no means to reach her. \"Even if we contact her, neither she can come here, nor we can go there,\" she lamented.\n\nIn Thalai, Assam, another woman recounted losing her brother due to inadequate medical care.

Thousands of families have been harmed,' Gandhi noted, urging for immediate government intervention.\n\nAddressing a press conference, Gandhi expressed his disappointment over the state's ongoing strife and called for solidarity. 'We need to get out of this suffering as soon as possible,' he said, stressing that violence and hatred will not provide a solution.

Mr Narendra Modi must turn his lofty rhetoric -- the need to act independently of political considerations -- into action\n\nSpeaking in the Rajya Sabha after a parliamentarian from Manipur criticised the silence -- inertia -- of the country's political leadership towards Manipur, the prime minister had stated that there was a need to rise above partisan politics to return the troubled state to peace and harmony. It now appears that it is the leader of the Opposition -- not Narendra Modi -- who has risen above political fault lines to lend a healing touch to Manipur. There is no doubt about the fact that Mr Modi's government at the Centre as well as the Bharatiya Janata Party that is in power in Manipur has failed the state. The loss of over 200 lives in an ethnic conflict between Meiteis and Kuki-Zo people that continues sporadically has not been deemed enough by Mr Modi to visit the strife-torn state. In a typical act of deflecting blame, the prime minister had asked the Opposition not to \"add fuel to the fire\" at a time when Manipur, in his eyes, was returning to normalcy. Perhaps Mr Modi thinks that normalcy entails the lack of rehabilitation of over 60,000 displaced Manipuris as well as the existence of deep divisions between the communities. Mr Gandhi, unlike the prime minister, has visited the state thrice since Manipur began to burn: a true leader, after all, needs to be among the people in a crisis.\n\nWhat Mr Gandhi stated on this occasion is perhaps as significant as his constant efforts to turn the attention of an indifferent government towards the sufferings of Manipur. Eschewing the lure of competitive politics, Mr Gandhi urged the prime minister to take time off to visit the state and -- this is important -- added that his party would support measures to improve the situation on the ground. In fact, there is a case for stakeholders -- the Central and the state governments, Meiteis and Kukis, civil society and philanthropic entities -- to take a leaf out of Mr Gandhi's emphasis on collective action and build a bridge across the gaping chasm that has divided Manipur. Only empathy and collaboration can make that bridge durable. Mr Modi must turn his lofty rhetoric -- the need to act independently of political considerations -- into action. A joint effort by the Centre and the Opposition to rescue Manipur would be a wonderful example of India's federal spirit.", "source": {"uri": "telegraphindia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Telegraph"}, "authors": [{"uri": "editorial_board@telegraphindia.com", "name": "Editorial Board", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Narendra Modi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manipur", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manipur"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manipur"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Prime minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Member of parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rahul_Gandhi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rahul Gandhi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajya_Sabha", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rajya Sabha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahatma_Gandhi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mahatma Gandhi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leader_of_the_Opposition", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Leader of the Opposition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_party", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Political party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meitei_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Meitei people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_conflict", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ethnic conflict"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internally_displaced_person", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Internally displaced person"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_governments_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "State governments of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuki_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kuki people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Collective action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philanthropy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Philanthropy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_society", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Civil society"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Structural_Engineering", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Structural Engineering", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial_Disputes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial Disputes", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads_and_Highways/Bridges_and_Tunnels", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads and Highways/Bridges and Tunnels", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Humor", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://assets.telegraphindia.com/telegraph/2024/Jul/1720238166_rahul-gandhi-congress.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9714080", "eventUri": "eng-9714080", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1607843137254902, "wgt": 147, "relevance": 1}

(Source: X)Source : Other\n\nThe viral video, dated January 1, 2024, is from Nagaon district in Assam. It is unrelated to Rahul Gandhi's recent visit to Manipur.\n\nA video circulating on X (formerly Twitter) shows a group of people chanting \"Rahul Gandhi go back\" and \"Rahul Gandhi haye haye (down with Rahul Gandhi).\"\n\nThe post claims this occurred during the Lok Sabha Leader of Opposition's recent visit to Manipur. In the footage, protesters hold posters with slogans in English and Assamese, including \"Rakibul Hussain Go Back\" and \"Rakibul Hatao, Samaguri Basao (Remove Rabikul, save Samaguri),\" referencing Dhubri Lok Sabha Member of Parliament Rakibul Hussain, who was formerly the Member of Legislative Assembly from Samaguri.\n\nOther visible slogans include \"Annay Yatra (Injustice March)\" and \"Rahul Gandhi Go Back.\" Congress leader Gaurav Gogoi appears in the video alongside Gandhi as authorities escort them away from the protesting crowd.\n\nPosts claiming that the video showing people are raising slogans against Rahul Gandhi is from his recent visit to Manipur. (Source: X/Modified by Logically Facts)\n\nOne post stated, \"Rahul Gandhi has been asked to go back in Manipur by residents, as his inflammatory speeches would trigger new clashes. This was Yesterday, 8-7-2024, so he had to return (sic).\" Arun Pudur, a social media user previously known for sharing misinformation, also shared the claim. Archives of such posts can be accessed here, here, and here, with over 400k views combined.\n\nHowever, our investigation reveals that this video is neither recent nor from Manipur, but rather an older clip from Assam.\n\nWe identified the Indian news agency ANI's watermark in the top-right corner of the frame in the viral video.\n\nThe ANI watermark is visible in the frame of the video. (Source: X/Modified by Logically Facts)\n\nThis led us to a slightly longer version of the video posted on ANI's official X account (archived here) on January 21, 2024. The post was captioned: \"Assam: A large number of people carrying posters of 'Rahul Gandhi go back' and 'Anyaya Yatra' held a protest against Congress leader Rahul Gandhi in the Ambagan area of Nagaon this evening.\"\n\nWe also found a Press Trust of India news report published by the Deccan Herald detailing the incident. According to this report, the footage was captured outside an eatery in Ambagan while Gandhi was traveling to Rupohi in Assam for the Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra. The report also stated that State Congress chief Bhupen Kumar Borah was assaulted earlier that day, and Congress leader Jairam Ramesh's car was attacked in a separate incident.\n\nUpon closer inspection of the video, we noticed a shop called \"Puja Gift Store\" and a sign reading \"Gurukul Global Academy\" in front of it.\n\nScreengrabs from the viral video. (Source: X/Modified by Logically Facts)\n\nA Google search for this shop allowed us to geolocate it to Pachim Sualani, Assam. The \"Gurukul Global Academy\" sign is also visible in front of the storefront in available Google Images. The shop's signboard clearly states its location as Ambagan, Nagaon, Assam, confirming that the incident occurred in Assam, not Manipur as claimed.\n\nWe were able to locate the store seen in the video to Pachim Sualani in Assam. (Source: Google Maps)\n\nWe found no news reports of protests during Gandhi's recent visit to Manipur on July 8, 2024. Manipur has been experiencing ethnic conflict since May 2023. According to The Hindu, over 221 people had been killed and more than 50,000 internally displaced as of May 2023.\n\nThe claim is false. The video is from Assam in January 2024 and is unrelated to Rahul Gandhi's recent visit to Manipur.\n\n(This report first appeared on logicallyfacts.com, and has been republished on ABP Live as part of a special arrangement.

She is a rising senior majoring in Journalism at Pepperdine, where she is the editor-in-chief of the school's magazine.\n\nJennifer Hudson is revealing a big discovery she previously made about her family.\n\nThe singer, 42, is on this week's finale episode of Your Mama's Kitchen: Conversations from the Heart of the Home podcast this week to talk about her family life. When asked about siblings, Hudson had a surprising story to tell.\n\n\"Your father had a big personality,\" host Michelle Norris said. \"And you went with your siblings and went and found him at some point and found that you had a lot more siblings?\"\n\n\"Yes, a lot of us. Apparently he had 27 children,\" Hudson shared.\n\nA shocked Norris noted \"that's a lot of children,\" before the EGOT winner went on to explain that she never met them all, but \"that's what we were always told.\" She said that when she found out about them at 16, she wanted to look deeper into her family.\n\n\"It was my dream to have all of us at this grand Thanksgiving or Christmas table, and we all sit and eat together -- that was my goal at 16,\" she explained.\n\nThe talk show host explained that she ended up meeting six or seven of them along with the siblings she grew up with, Jason and Julia.\n\n\"We found quite a few of us,\" she said, adding, \"And I'm the youngest of all of them.\"\n\nAs for them finding out about her, Hudson said it was her father's side of the family that helped unite the siblings she ended up meeting.\n\n\"When my grandma on his side passed, my siblings over there were like, 'Y'all got a sister that can really sing, you should meet her,'\" she revealed. \"And eventually we all came together.\"\n\nHudson is the mother to a son, 14-year-old David Daniel Otunga Jr. -- who she shares with ex David Otunga. Last year, she brought him to the White House for Juneteenth and later opened up about the importance of raising a young Black man in her cover story for Real Simple.\n\n\"I want my son to be a part of those things -- and his cousins and friends,\" she said. \"Little David has a really big heart, and he always wants to include them. So I said, 'I'll sing, but I have to bring my boys.'\"\n\n\"And I told the guys, 'When you all get old and you have children, you're going to say, 'I was there for the first Juneteenth.' And to be able to sing for it -- that's something I will never forget.\"\n\nOn the podcast, Hudson spoke about wanting her son to grow up around family, explaining, \"I love to try to make sure he has the closest thing to him... just making sure he has his cousins circle and that base and foundation. That's part of why I had moved back to Chicago, because I wanted him to have the surroundings of his family around him growing up.\"\n\n\"Now we're here in L.A. and so we make a point to like, have our Sunday dinners. That's one thing that's very important,\" she continued. \"And then he has cousins that come in and out. One of them is here right now. And so to keep that family burning... So he has that same upbringing or going to see the loved ones I talked to.\"\n\n\"We have a huge family. People like the fact that y'all are this close and your family is this big.

For those who aren't up to date on their music history, Jennifer Hudson was rocketed to fame after she was a finalist on the third season of American Idol. Before that, she and her two siblings was raised in Chicago by their mother. Even though her father wasn't in the picture, Hudson went looking for him at age 14. During the process, she found out that she didn't just have two siblings: instead, her father had 27 children, and Jennifer Hudson's on a mission to meet them all.\n\nJennifer Hudson was born in 1981 in Chicago as the youngest child of Darnell Donerson and Samuel Simpson, a Greyhound bus driver. The talk show host and her siblings, Julia and Jason, were raised by their mother until age 14, when Jennifer set out to find her absent father. What she found, however, was the kind of realization that shook her to her foundations. Her father had been very busy along his bus routes because rather than the two siblings Jennifer Hudson had grown up with, she had 27 half-siblings on her father's side.\n\nHudson first revealed her discovery to the press back in April, but she recently sat down with People and discussed her journey to reunite her entire family, no matter how unexpectedly big it was.\n\n\"It was my dream to have all of us at this grand Thanksgiving or Christmas table, and we all sit and eat together -- that was my goal at 16.\"\n\nIn the same interview, Hudson explained that while she's never met all of her nearly thirty half-siblings, she has found six or seven. While some of the credit for tracking down her long-lost siblings goes to Jennifer Hudson's status as a public figure, she also attributed some of it to her father's side of the family, where some of the siblings she's already connected with have begun to connect with more of the 27.

And I'm the youngest of all of them.\"\n\nThe singer shared that her dad's side of the family played a role in connecting the siblings.\n\n\"When my grandma on his side passed, my siblings over there were like, 'Y'all got a sister that can really sing, you should meet her,'\" she said. \"And eventually we all came together.\"\n\nBefore she went looking for her dad as a teenager and discovered her large clan, Hudson was raised by her mom, Darnell Donerson, alongside sister Julia and brother Jason. Hudson tragically lost Darnell, Jason and nephew Julian in 2008 after her sister's estranged husband, William Balfour, shot and killed them. Balfour received three life sentences plus 120 years in prison in May 2012.\n\nHudson has said that her now-14-year-old son, David Jr., who was born one year after the murders, helped her heal.\n\n\"I went from being an aunt, having a mom and being a child to not having a mom, becoming a mom and raising my own child,\" she told Glamour in 2015. \"I tell David all the time, 'You saved my life.'\"\n\nHudson shares her son with ex-fianc\u00e9 David Otunga. The former couple split in 2017. Hudson has since moved on with Common, whom she met in 2022 while filming their movie Breathe. After almost two years of romance speculation, the pair confirmed their relationship in January when Common, 52, appeared on an episode of The Jennifer Hudson Show.\n\n\"I'm in a relationship that is with one of the most beautiful people I've met in life,\" Common said on the show, not naming Hudson outright but hinting that his girlfriend is an EGOT winner and has her own talk show. \"She's smart, she loves God, she has something real down-to-earth about her. She's talented.\"\n\nCommon then playfully asked Hudson whether she was seeing anyone.\n\n\"I'm dating this brother, and I am very happy,\" she replied.\n\nOne month later, Jimmy Kimmel asked Hudson about the relationship reveal during an episode of Jimmy Kimmel Live!\n\n\"Is that what you gathered? Because I thought he was dating Whoopi Goldberg,\" Hudson jokingly replied. Goldberg, 68, is an EGOT winner just like Hudson and had her own titular talk show from 1992 to 1993.", "source": {"uri": "usmagazine.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Us Weekly"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sara_donnellan@usmagazine.com", "name": "Sara Donnellan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thanksgiving_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thanksgiving (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Otunga", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "David Otunga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Christmas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glamour_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Glamour (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Jennifer_Hudson_Show", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Jennifer Hudson Show"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_EGOT_winners", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "List of EGOT winners"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk_show", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Talk show"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whoopi_Goldberg", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Whoopi Goldberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Kimmel_Live!", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jimmy Kimmel Live!"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Kimmel", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jimmy Kimmel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "God"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Parenting", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Parenting", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Advice", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Small_Business/Home_Office", "label": "dmoz/Business/Small Business/Home Office", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Jennifer-Hudson-Reveals-Her-Father-Has-27-Children.jpg?crop=0px%2C100px%2C1331px%2C699px&resize=1200%2C630&quality=86&strip=all", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9666342", "eventUri": "eng-9666342", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-19", "textStart": 20, "textEnd": 27}, {"amb": false, "date": "2012-05-", "textStart": 1156, "textEnd": 1164}], "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

{"id": 232080386, "title": "Ian McKellen Thinks the Gollum Movie Could Be His Final Job", "text": "It\u2019s only been about a month since Warner Bros. revealed it was working on a new Lord of the Rings movie. With Andy Serkis in the director\u2019s chair and mocap suit, the studio\u2019s fully set to get the Hunt for Gollum prequel film in theaters by 2026, and that\u2019s naturally got people talking about if any actors from the original movies\u2014and for whom it makes sense\u2014could pop up here in their original role. During a recent interview with the UK paper The Times, Sir Ian McKellen briefly touched on Gollum and his chances of coming back as beloved wizard Gandalf the White (n\u00e9e the Grey). He\u2019s quite aware of the recent \u201cstirrings in Tolkein\u2019s land,\u201d and that his character\u2019s intended to pop up in the film. But while there\u2019s there\u2019s \u201cno script, there is no offer, [or] plan,\u201d he\u2019s more than down to do it...provided he\u2019s actually still alive when Gollum actually goes into production. McKellen turned 85 at the end of May, and his Times interview opens with him saying \u201cyou are aware that this life doesn\u2019t go on for ever. By the time the original Rings trilogy was filming, he was in his early-to-mid 60s, and he ended the Hobbit trilogy in his mid 70s. He continues to get a healthy amount of work across stage and screen, but he was also candid about being more selective in what parts he goes for nowadays. \u201cWhen a script [or offer] comes through, you think, \u2018This might be my last job. No. I\u2019m not doing that.\u2019\u201d Come next month, McKellen will reprise his role as Magneto in Deadpool & Wolverine, the other big film role that he became known for in the 2000s. The apparent idea of him trying to choose what\u2019ll be his last role in either theatre or film is honestly endearing, and more than a little sweet that he hopes to bring things full circle in some capacity.

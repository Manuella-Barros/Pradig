The group of students from Jawaharlal Nehru University were waylaid when they were mistaken as \"Muslims\" and \"cattle thieves\".\n\nThe incident took place on the night of August 15. A group of seven friends including both both boys and girls had gone to Surajkund on Tuesday in the morning for a picnic. They were returning in the night at about 9 pm when the incident took place. The complainant alleged to the police that after the picnic was over, she, along with her friends, had decided to book a cab. As the cab was taking some time to come, she decided to go with her two male friends on the bike as she was too tired to walk. Her complaint further read that as she sat in the bike and was heading towards the city with her friends, a gang of four to five men allegedly intercepted them.\n\n\"The man with a cane stopped us. They then asked us where we were going. When we tried to tell them, the man began assaulting us. One of them held my hand and slapped me, calling me a characterless woman. The others were beating my friends,\" said the complainant. The horror continued for the girl when one of the men allegedly groped her, dragged her into the temporary tin shed and was advised by his friends to rape her after tying her against a tree.\n\nThe complainant further told the police that the men didn't stop there. They called the male students Muslims and beat them brutally. The complainant said that the cops slammed her and called her a slut when she called them. \"The policeman said that you people from JNU are very fond of free sex culture,\" the girl claimed.\n\nThe cops forced us to write an apology letter and asked us to give them an undertaking that we would not repeat the same mistake. The incident came to light when the complainant approached the Vasant Kunj police and registered a plaint in this regard. \"We have registered a zero FIR under IPC Sections 354 (molestation) and 365 (attempt to rape).

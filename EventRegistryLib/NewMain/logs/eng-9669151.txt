There's no excuse for that,' Shearer said while working as a co-commentator for the BBC.\n\nREAD MORE Woeful England lacked fluency, confidence and cohesion in 1-1 draw with Denmark, writes OLIVER HOLT\n\n'It was very poor, it wasn't good enough, and listening to Kyle Walker's interview, we've all been there as players,' Shearer said on BBC. 'Yes, you do try and take the positive, and yes it is tournament football, but it's our job and the coach's job to dissect what's gone wrong, and where do you start there?\n\n'There was no energy, no pace to the game. We didn't run in behind until the last 10 or 15 minutes, we got caught too many times on the ball, too many sloppy passes and in truth, Denmark were the better team and deserved to win.\n\n'It was very poor, it wasn't good enough. I wouldn't say lack of effort, not trying, but there's so much more to come from those players.'\n\nShearer went onto dissect England's issues in attack, offering a solution for what Southgate should play to get the most out of his frontline.\n\nShearer believes Newcastle's Anthony Gordon (middle) could be the answer to their issues\n\nShearer bluntly claimed that Southgate is struggling to get the most out of England's best stars\n\n'When I got into my thirties and lost half a yard of pace, I needed legs around me,' Shearer continued. 'I needed pace around me. I could still hold the ball up and head it and had a good touch and still score goals, but the one thing I couldn't constantly do was run in behind. So he needs players in and around him to do that.\n\nREAD MORE ENGLAND PLAYER RATINGS: Which player 'went AWOL' and whose sudden decline made them look a 'shadow'?\n\n'That's why I would have [Anthony] Gordon in the team. He has the energy and ability to run in behind and get up near him.\n\n'When [Phil] Foden is doing that, he wants to be tight and play in the No 10 role like Harry Kane does. He's [Kane] a brilliant goalscorer and he'll always score goals, but what he does lack is that yard and that energy. Someone else can do it alongside him!\n\n'That's one of the reasons I retired from my international football - because I couldn't do it for England and for Newcastle.\n\n'Harry is in to his thirties. He's never really been the quickest. He can still make really good runs, but he needs pace around him. That's why I would have played Gordon.\n\n'I look at Jude [Bellingham] tonight, he couldn't put one foot in front of the other. He couldn't get forward.\n\n'I look at Foden on the left. Is he affecting the game? No, no chance.\n\n'I look at [Bukayo] Saka and Kane. I know he got his goal. I mentioned in commentary about running in behind, at least when [Ollie] Watkins came on the defenders were running in behind. It was really really poor and it is concerning, absolutely.\n\nShearer claimed Jude Bellingham (left) struggled to get forward against the Danes\n\n'Let's use John Stones as an example. How many times do you see him get the ball and run into midfield or get the ball to his back and turn in the Man City team? So many times, he's brilliant at it. How many times has he done it in the two England games? I can't remember any.\n\n'How many times do you see Declan Rice get that ball and burst forward? How many times have you seen him do it in an England shirt in the last two games? None.\n\n'How many times do you see Foden get the ball in the middle of the park and turn? Maybe once when he had the shot and hit the post.\n\n'Gareth at the minute is not getting the best out of best players.'\n\nFormer England defender Rio Ferdinand also bemoaned the tactics adopted by Southgate.\n\nAsked about the performance, Ferdinand said: 'Lacklustre, lacked any sort of direction in my eyes, tactically well below par - we were overshadowed tactically, I thought, by the Denmark team.\n\nPhil Foden has struggled to replicate his performances that won him player of the year\n\n'You have to give them that respect, they were well-drilled, tactically superior, pressed us better, pressed us together.\n\n'I thought England looked very average. Our best players, our most decisive players, our best players (are) at the top of the pitch and we choose to set up to defend.\n\n'We've got too good players to sit back and hope to get through a game.

It is tournament football and it is our job to dissect what has gone wrong and there is plenty to look at there. Where do you start? No energy, no guile. I would not say lack of effort but there is so much more to come from those players.\n\n\"Look at Jude [Bellingham] tonight, he could not get one foot in front of another. He could not get forward. I look at Phil Foden, is he affecting the game? No chance. I look at [Bukayo] Saka and Kane. I know he got his goal, but I said on commentary about running in behind. It was really poor. It is concerning, absolutely.\n\n\"Use John Stones as an example. How many times do you see him step into midfield and turn his back and run with the ball in a Man City team?\n\n\"He is brilliant at it. How many times have you seen it in the last two England games? Not many. How many times do you see Declan Rice get the ball and go on a bursting run? None. How many times do you see Foden get the ball and turn, maybe once tonight when he hit the post. Gareth at the minute is not getting the best out of England's best players.\"\n\nRio Ferdinand, also a BBC pundit and former England player, agreed with Shearer by adding: \"The current balance of the team is not allowing the players to reach the levels that they have done for clubs.\n\n\"Phil Foden is out of position and not playing his best, maybe Jude Bellingham would be better playing at number eight. It is a big concern.\"\n\nHarry Kane's decision to continue to drop deep also came under criticism from Shearer who called for the England captain to be taken off in place for Ollie Watkins which Southgate finally did in the 70th-minute.\n\nShearer, who scored 30 goals in 62 appearances for England, also called for Southgate to pair Kane with players who are willing to run in behind after suggesting Kane is going through a similar experience to himself when he reached over 30 and started to see his pace dwindle.\n\n\"As I got older I needed pace in and around me,\" Shearer added. \"I could still score goals, head the ball, get into positions in the box, but one thing I could not do is run in behind. Harry Kane is the same now, he needs players that have the legs to run beyond and make the space.\n\n\"That's why I would have Anthony Gordon in the team, Phil Foden is occupying the same spaces as Kane at the moment and it's not working. He is a brilliant goal scorer and he will always score goals but what he lacks is that yard and energy. Someone else can do it alongside him.\n\n\"It is one of the reasons why I retired from international football. I could not do it for Newcastle and England with my lack of place. Harry is not the quickest, he needs pace in and around him and that is why I would play Gordon.\"\n\nFellow former England striker and BBC pundit Gary Lineker added: \"In all honesty, I think Harry Kane needs to do a lot better.\n\n\"His movement was minimal. He did not look to get in behind and he doesn't often but even when he is coming short he is doing it lethargically and plodding short.\n\n\"As a striker you have two jobs, score goals, which Harry Kane has been good at all his career, and make space. He needs his manager to come to him and ask a little bit more of him.\n\n\"I would have expected that if I'd put in that kind of performance. Against a back three he has to stretch the play, run one way and then come short so you don't have to come too far to receive it. He needs to make more space for the midfield players behind him to create chances.\"", "source": {"uri": "telegraph.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Telegraph"}, "authors": [{"uri": "frankie_christou@telegraph.co.uk", "name": "Frankie Christou", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Kane", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Harry Kane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Shearer", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alan Shearer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Foden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Phil Foden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jude_Bellingham", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jude Bellingham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_European_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA European Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bukayo_Saka", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bukayo Saka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declan_Rice", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Declan Rice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Stones", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John Stones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_Ferdinand", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rio Ferdinand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Lineker", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gary Lineker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newcastle_upon_Tyne", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Newcastle upon Tyne"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Newcastle upon Tyne"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ollie_Watkins", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ollie Watkins"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2024/06/20/TELEMMGLPICT000382622776_17189112328470_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqlyjLB990yNM1ZdswIy127-Lf7gUTqdFjMi-pVf1nen0.jpeg?impolicy=logo-overlay", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9669151", "eventUri": "eng-9669151", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

He told the BBC: \"I think it's tournament football.\n\n\"This is a good Denmark team. We're top of the group so let's try to take a positive from this game. We've not lost, we've conceded a great streak from outside the box. We're top of the group so let's move on to the next game.\n\n\"I think it's just the game. You're sensing the game, their feeling. As defenders you try and think of 'what if', rather than me charging forward they go and score. Let's take it as a well-deserved point.\n\n\"The manager wants us to play free, attacking football. Sometimes in tournament football you have to manage the game. It's tough when you come to these grounds, hostile environments. We're top of the group so let's move on.\"\n\nHowever, in response to Walker's comments, Shearer slammed England's performance and singled out Jude Bellingham, Phil Foden and Harry Kane as three players he felt were particularly lacklustre.\n\n\"It was very poor, it wasn't good enough, and listening to Kyle Walker's interview, we've all been there as players,\" Shearer told the BBC. \"Yes, you do try and take the positive, and yes it is tournament football, but it's our job and the coach's job to dissect what's gone wrong and there's plenty to look at there.\n\n\"Where do you start? There was no energy, no guile and there's so much more to come from those players. Look at Jude tonight. He couldn't put one foot in front of the other, he couldn't get forward.\n\n\"I look at Phil Foden on the left. Is he affecting the game? No chance. I look at Harry Kane, I know he got his goal and I mentioned it in commentary about running in behind. At least when [Ollie] Watkins came on he was running in behind. It was really, really poor and it is concerning.\"\n\nEngland will be back in action next Tuesday when they take on Slovenia in Cologne and they will be hoping to confirm their spot in the last 16.\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

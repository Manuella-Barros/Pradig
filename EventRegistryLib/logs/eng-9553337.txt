Hartford, Waterbury, New Haven and Bridgeport top the list.\n\n\"We have the red wrong way signs with this new technology,\" DOT spokesperson Josh Morgan said. \"Those red signs are now outfitted with LED lights, and the white letters that say wrong way are back-illuminated to make them a little more visible.\"\n\nIn many cases, our reporting showed that these wrong-way crashes often involve impaired drivers.\n\nConnecticut State Police said if you find yourself going the wrong way, pull over immediately and turn your car in the correct direction when it's safe.", "source": {"uri": "wtnh.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WTNH"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jenn_brink@wtnh.com", "name": "Jenn Brink", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratford,_Connecticut", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stratford, Connecticut"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Stratford, Connecticut"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut_Department_of_Transportation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Connecticut Department of Transportation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merritt_Parkway", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Merritt Parkway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstate_84_(Pennsylvania\u2013Massachusetts)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Interstate 84 (Pennsylvania\u2013Massachusetts)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstate_95", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Interstate 95"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branford,_Connecticut", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Branford, Connecticut"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Branford, Connecticut"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farmington,_Connecticut", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Farmington, Connecticut"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Farmington, Connecticut"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut_State_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Connecticut State Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridgeport,_Connecticut", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bridgeport, Connecticut"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bridgeport, Connecticut"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterbury,_Connecticut", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Waterbury, Connecticut"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Waterbury, Connecticut"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Haven,_Connecticut", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Haven, Connecticut"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Haven, Connecticut"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hartford,_Connecticut", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hartford, Connecticut"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hartford, Connecticut"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Letterboxing", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Letterboxing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Anomalies_and_Alternative_Science/Anomalous_Sounds", "label": "dmoz/Science/Anomalies and Alternative Science/Anomalous Sounds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads_and_Highways/Fictional", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads and Highways/Fictional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 62}], "image": "https://www.wtnh.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/100/2019/09/wrong-way-sign-1477308361XOG-e1568604589464.jpg?strip=1&w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9553337", "eventUri": "eng-9553337", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Stratford, Connecticut"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2784313725490196, "wgt": 126, "relevance": 1}

He said: \"We came through a difficult period with Covid, and then with the war in Ukraine. \"We spent \u00a3100bn making sure the businesses stayed open and individuals were looked after and we managed to bring down the inevitable inflation very quickly to around 2%.\" He attacked Labour for its running of health and education in Wales. But Labour shadow Welsh Secretary Jo Stevens said: \"There is a reason why the Conservatives are so negative about Wales - it's because they can't run on their own record because it's such an appalling record.\" She said: \"What matters to people in this election is about getting change, about getting economic stability. \"That is why we have set out six steps about bringing economic stability so that people can keep mortgage interest rates down.\" Ms Saville-Roberts said Plaid will be the voice for Wales, and people \"want change\". \"They look at the Tories, they look at Labour. \"That is why it is so important to make sure that the voice of a party like Plaid Cymru can talk for our constituencies concentrating on Wales.\" She also called on Plaid Cymru to be included in Welsh-specific debates during the election campaign. Liberal Democrat councillor Rodney Berman said: \"There is a recognition that we have something valid to say that we offer, perhaps a more sensible alternative, and people are turning to us more.\"", "summary": "Welsh secretary denies Wales will miss out on funding from Conservatives' national service plans.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgeenpgzw5eo", "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/f309/live/58324750-1b6d-11ef-abaf-37a7226419b1.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 14:46:21", "author": "Teleri Glyn Jones", "authors": ["Teleri Glyn Jones"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.033}

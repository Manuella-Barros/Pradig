Once again, the Robins fell to defeat on the road to one of Super League's top-half sides, with Warrington Wolves coming away as deserved 20-8 winners.\n\nWillie Peters' side have continued to show up their doubters this year but questions about their ability to pick up wins against the big teams away from Craven Park still remain. It's 15 months since Rovers last won outside of Yorkshire and while they dragged their way into this contest, the opening quarter of this game saw them outplayed.\n\nWarrington, it must be said, were excellent. Sam Burgess side were on it from the start and deserved their win. And Rovers shouldn't be too dispirited given their back-to-back wins over Wigan Warriors and St Helens. This sequence of games have still shown they're among the top sides. But they do still have this away-day itch that needs scratching.\n\nTwo changes were forced on Willie Peters. Elliot Minchella always faced a race against time to be fit after a groin complaint at the weekend, and he ultimately succumbed to time, but an unexpected absentee was Sam Luckley, ruled out with a hand injury. George King and Jack Brown, the boyhood Robin signed from Hull FC in the week, were drafted in on the bench. Kelepi Tanginoa was promoted to starting back-row, with Dean Hadley playing at loose forward.\n\nLacking the presence of their captain, Rovers started the game lacking the energy and intensity that has been so evident in recent weeks. Warrington were bang at it from the get-go. They were full-throttle, the handbrake well and truly off. Rovers looked to be in second gear; they couldn't match them.\n\nAfter quickly gaining a territorial advantage, Warrington would land the first blow. It became a common theme for them to go digging down Rovers' right-edge. They regularly struck gold, too. Matty Ashton was given enough space to scorch down the touchline and then pass in-field to Toby King to open the scoring.\n\nJosh Thewlis tagged on the extras and then got a chance to add another from in front of the sticks. Warrington were awarded a penalty try after Joe Burgess' illegal tackle was adjudged to have denied Ashton a try in the corner. 12-0 after 12 minutes, and Rovers could have no complaints.\n\nThe barrage continues. Rovers were giving penalties away, piggybacking Warrington upfield, while Danny Walker kicked a sublime 40-20. Rovers scrambled well for a while, but eventually King would grab a second. Mikey Lewis was penalised for a high tackle and then Rovers' right-edge got their bearings wrong. That allowed King to step inside scrambling defenders to finish, with Thewlis making it 18-0 from the boot.\n\nRovers had, by this point, started to get a foothold in the game. Credit must go to Warrington; they had been sublime to this point, conceding no penalties or handling errors in their own half. They had been outstanding. But when they finally gave Rovers a chance, they took it. Zane Musgrove produced a loose carry in his own half and from the following set, Kelepi Tanginoa crashed over George Williams, offloading the ball to Niall Evalds, who in turn released the ball to Jack Broadbent, who stepped Matt Dufty to score his second try in as many outings for the club. It gave Rovers a glimmer of hope at the break, with the score 18-4.\n\nRovers came out much better after the break; not for the first time this season, and displayed some promising signs. They had a try disallowed after Ryan Hall juggled a ball in the build-up but minutes later, Magic Mikey came to the fore. Rovers had perhaps been fortunate to receive a penalty after Dufty was adjudged to have illegally stolen the ball off Tyrone May, despite the former having the ball before a contested strip. With that territory, Lewis gathered his initial kick that had rebounded to him before scurrying to the sideline, dancing inside and scoring out of nothing. He did miss the conversion, meaning it was still a 18-8 deficit.\n\nBut Rovers were well in the contest at this point. From the kick return they broke through the middle with Litten and earned a repeat set in Warrington's half. But they couldn't capitalise. They huffed and puffed after that and did have some moments - Niall Evalds looked particularly threatening, but Warrington stood up strong defensively and restricted their chances. At the other end, Hiku did superbly to deny Ashton his second when he dived to the corner.\n\nRovers eventually ran out of time, but the damage had ultimately done in the opening stages. Rovers simply left themselves with too much to do. Thewlis added a penalty goal late on.\n\nWarrington Wolves: Matt Dufty, Josh Thewlis, Toby King, Rodrick Tai, Matty Ashton, George Williams, Josh Drinkwater, James Harrison, Danny Walker, Paul Vaughan, Matty Nicholson, Lachlan Fitzgibbon, Ben Currie.

Josh Thewlis knocking over three goals.\n\nJack Broadbent's score gave Rovers something to take into the break and the visitors came out transformed as Mikey Lewis' try brought them back within 10

His double helped Sam Burgess' side storm into a 18-0 lead before he helped stave off a second-half Rovers onslaught. Both sides hold hopes of claiming a maiden Super League title this year and each knew victory here would put them into first.\n\nRovers had beaten champions Wigan and St Helens in their last two outings to show their title credentials. Yet they looked anything but contenders as red-hot Warrington surged 12-0 up inside as many minutes. They targeted KR's nervous right-edge who looked clueless working out which runners to pick off.\n\nJosh Drinkwater gave space for King, a Grand Final winner with Wigan last year, to exchange passes with Matty Ashton for the opener.

They saw a Evalds try ruled out for a Ryan Hall knock-on and Thewlis also needed to be on hand to deny Jez Litten.\n\nBut the improving visitors did eventually cross again when Mikey Lewis regathered his ricocheted kick and scampered over on 51 minutes. But the England scrum-half again failed to convert and Wire held on. Rovers badly missed captain Elliot Minchella who missed his first game of the season with a groin issue.\n\nThey'll desperately hope he's fit for next Saturday's Challenge Cup semi-final against Wigan.

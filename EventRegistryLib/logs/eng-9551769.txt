He did not name the company.\n\nMulino, a 64-year-old former security minister, won Panama's election on Sunday with 34% of the vote after stepping in to replace former President Ricardo Martinelli, who was barred from running due to a money laundering conviction.\n\nAfter his victory, Mulino promised his government would be pro-investment and pro-business, adding that the Central American country would honor its debts, while he vowed to not forget the poor.\n\nPanama's debt amounts to over 50% of its GDP, totaling $49.8 billion, and analysts have called for the new administration to curb the rising trend.\n\nMulino said his administration will make important sacrifices in public spending to curb unnecessary spending, while also eyeing major infrastructure projects to maintain dynamism in the economy.\n\nThe president-elect noted he will focus on effective tax collection rather than tax hikes.\n\nFitch ratings in March downgraded Panama's debt to speculative grade, citing fiscal and governance pressures aggravated by the government-ordered closure of a giant copper mine run by First Quantum Minerals.\n\nBoth S&P and Moody's told Reuters before the election they would monitor the government's first steps before taking any decision.\n\nMulino said he was confident other rating agencies would maintain Panama's investment grade rating and that agencies would be satisfied with his government's economic plans.\n\n\"I am sure that they (ratings agencies) will give their endorsement to what we are going to propose,\" he said. \"I'm really positive and optimistic.\"\n\nMulino also said he has spoken with various world leaders following his win, including U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.\n\nAfter the talk with Blinken, Mulino expressed his commitment to create a team devoted to streamline the process for U.S. companies to invest in Panama, and also said he agreed with Lula to explore the possibility of Panama joining the South American Mercosur trade bloc.\n\nAs for Panama's state pension fund, which is running perilously low on reserves, Mulino said he enlisted a team of experts to find a solution, while requesting the outgoing government to hand over all related information to streamline the process.\n\n\"Don't sweep anything under the rug because I'm going to pull it up anyway,\" he said.\n\nReforms to the system will need to go through Panama's Congress, which after the change of government will be comprised mostly by independent lawmakers with whom Mulino says he is confident that agreements will be reached.\n\nMulino also noted Panama has yet to take full advantage of its strategic geographical position, and pointed to logistics as one of the sectors Panama needs to put more efforts into boosting.\n\nThe president-elect will take office on July 1 for a five-year term.\n\n(Reporting by Valentine Hilaire and Elida Moreno; editing by Stephen Eisenhammer, Leslie Adler and Michael Perry)\n\nSign Up for Springs AM Update\n\nYour morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.\n\nSuccess!

Little did he know that by the time his term was about to end in mid-2024, all the pillars that made Panama the most successful Latin American economy of the past 30 years would be shaking.\n\nSince Cortizo's remarks, the Central American nation has endured social unrest, the cancellation of a $10 billion copper mine (the country's biggest private investment) and serious doubts about the government's fiscal sustainability after losing its investment grade with Fitch Ratings. The country's engineering marvel, the Panama Canal, has been hit by ahistoric drought that has created a cargo bottleneck and forced emergency plans to fix a channel that handles $270 billion a year in global trade.\n\nThis combination represents an existential crisis for Panama: The country that captivated corporations and bankers with open trade, business-friendly legislation and its dollarized economy -- turning Panama City into a high-rise-packed financial center akin to Miami -- requires urgent\n\nreinvention.\n\nIt's through this prism that the presidency of Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Mulino, who won\n\nSunday's elections and will take power on July 1, should be seen: Despite the vote's largely muted international repercussions, we should pay close attention to the new government's approach because Panama's\n\ngeopolitical weight transcends its slender geography (slightly smaller than South Carolina). In fact, the problems that Mulino will inherit are a\n\nmicrocosm of Latin America's big challenges: political divisions, popular discontent amid corruption and lack of quality jobs, increasing migration, fast-deteriorating public finances and the impact of climate change on business. Despite doubling the region's average GDP per capita this century and achieving the income levels of an Eastern European country,\n\nPanama remains embroiled in the same difficulties as its neighbours.\n\nThe good news is that unlike some of his regional peers, the incoming\n\npresident has a strong pro-private sector bias: \"We will promote a pro-investment, pro-private company government,\" he told supporters during his first rally as president-elect on May 5, also pledging to build a team \"with the best people\" without forgetting the needy.\n\nThe bad news is that Mulino came to power via the kind of unorthodox arrangement that has all too often destabilized other Latin American countries: He owes his win to popular former president Ricardo Martinelli, who gave up his frontrunner status in order to seek asylum at the Nicaraguan embassy in Panama and avoid prison after losing an appeal to overturn his conviction for money laundering.\n\nMulino, who was Martinelli's running mate, inherited the candidacy. He has vowed to constitute a \"national unity\" government after capturing just 34 percent of the vote: That's key considering the atomized unicameral assembly, where independents are the first force. He will need to cut deals to be able to pass legislation, but the lingering question continues to be how the new president will deal with the former one. \"Mulino must first address the issue of Ricardo Martinelli, and then ensure governance with the different political, social, and civic groups of the country,\" Rita V\u00e1squez, director of La Prensa newspaper, told me from Panama City. \"Once that's achieved, address the other important issues that his government must solve.\"\n\nThe combination of a long to-do list and a brittle public mood bodes ill: One of the lessons of the past two administrations is that support can quickly evaporate in this young democracy. The 64-year-old lawyer campaigned promising to return to the super growth rates of Martinelli's years, when the economy expanded more than 7 percent per year on average. That's now a chimera, with Panama constrained by a growing pension crisis and the threat of additional downgrades after the surge in indebtedness following the pandemic.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund sees the country growing just 2.5 percent this year, improving to 3 percent in 2025. Others are much more pessimistic: Economists at JPMorgan Chase & Co expect a 0.5 percent expansion in 2024, putting the economy in a virtual recession.\n\nAccelerating growth will only be one of Mulino's pressing issues. There is no easy, quick resolution to either the dispute with First Quantum Minerals Ltd. over the giant shuttered mine or the drought afflicting water management for the canal. In addition, Panama has a crucial role to play in addressing the humanitarian crisis of migrants crossing the dangerous\n\nDarien Gap connecting South with Central America as they venture toward the US.\n\n\"All these challenges, plus the depletion of funds to meet pension spending, have Panama with its back against the wall,\" JPMorgan's Steven Palacio and his colleagues wrote in their May 6 report. \"The problems are easily identifiable, the solutions are not clear.\"\n\nMulino can't afford a paint-by-numbers presidency. Panama needs to rewire its economic and political system to adapt it to a new world where supply chains and trade flows are shifting and nearshoring and energy transition emerge as opportunities for Central America. The country can't just be a paradise for capital and maritime refugees anymore; it also needs to satisfy the growing societal demands of its 4.4 million people, not least for greater transparency and accountability. And it has to do so while regaining fiscal credibility.\n\nA new government always offers the chance for a radical course correction.\n\nMulino's initial consensus-building, head-on strategy goes in the right direction. But for all its short-term appeal, relying on the disgraced Martinelli as the mainstay of his political support will come at a cost. Mulino can't govern if he's seen as the puppet of a strongman in the shadows. And an electorate already angry about corruption will become even angrier if Panama doesn't regain its economic momentum. Mulino needs to solve his Martinelli problem quickly, and rally the broad-based support necessary to put Panama back on the path to prosperity.", "source": {"uri": "moneycontrol.com", "dataType":

With that in mind, we may need to look for some help elsewhere. Could that help be delivered by Jose Raul Mulino, the newly elected president of Panama? He suggested as much last week in an address to his nation. He didn't guarantee that he could shut down the flow of migrants through his country, but he did say that he would \"make the effort to end this migratory crisis\" and do so in a way that demonstrates \"respect for human rights and with sincere international participation.\" We may as well let him give it a try. What else do we have to lose? Our colleague Leah Barkoukis has the details at Townhall.\n\nPanama's newly elected president, Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Mulino, vowed to close a major passageway for migrants heading toward the U.S. border.\n\n\"I will make the effort to end this migratory crisis in our territory with respect for human rights and with sincere international participation,\" Mulino said last week.\n\n\"The border of the United States, instead of being in Texas, moved to Panama,\" said Mulino, the former public security minister who was elected on Sunday. \"We're going to close the Darien and we're going to repatriate all these people.\"\n\nLast year, more than half a million people crossed the hazardous Darien Gap on the border with Columbia. In addition to the difficult terrain, many migrants also become victims of sexual violence.\n\nIt isn't immediately clear what motivated Mulino to take this position. He's an interesting character who started out his professional life as an attorney specializing in maritime law. He later moved into politics and held a few different positions in the Panamanian government before replacing his running mate this year and being elected president.\n\nMulino doesn't seem like the sort of person who would go out of his way to help Joe Biden, but that may not be what's going on here. He's a member of the Realizing Goals party, which is considered to be right-wing by Panamanian political standards. Being an experienced politician, I would assume that he keeps a close eye on international affairs, including the upcoming elections in the United States. It's possible that he's been watching the poll numbers like the rest of us and he's trying to score some early points with Donald Trump in case he returns to office. Trump is a good friend to have if you are leading a comparatively impoverished nation.\n\nBut could Mulino make good on this plan? If you take a good look at a map of Panama, you will note that they have a much smaller border to defend than the United States or nearly anyone else in the Americas. Panama shares a border of barely 100 miles with both Colombia and Costa Rica. If you plan to reach the United States on foot, Panama is the ultimate chokepoint along your journey, hence why they chose to build the canal there.\n\nSo it's a relatively short border, but could Mulino shut it down? Panama doesn't have a military in the traditional sense of the term, but the government does maintain a public security force that serves most of the same functions. That security force (the Fuerza P\u00fablica de la Rep\u00fablica de Panam\u00e1) has roughly 30,000 troops, though they refer to them as \"employees.\" You can cover quite a bit of territory with that many people, though of course they couldn't all be suddenly transferred to the border, ignoring the rest of the country.\n\nI doubt Joe Biden would be interested in helping Mulino secure his border because it would run contrary to his political goals. But if we had Donald Trump back in office and a reasonable majority in both the House and the Senate, I would wager that they would be willing to arrange for some money and resources to shut down the stream of migrants. Heck, we might even help them build a wall. A good construction crew could put up one hundred miles of wall fairly quickly.

Endorsed by former President Ricardo Martinelli, Mulino's win concludes one of Panama's most contentious electoral cycles and underscores the enduring influence of populist figures in Latin America.\n\nMulino's candidacy was closely tied to Martinelli's political project, which boasted claims of economic stability despite corruption scandals. Martinelli's tenure (2009-14) oversaw significant economic growth and development in Panama, contributing to his enduring popularity among many citizens. However, post-presidency, Martinelli, 72, has been embroiled in numerous corruption allegations, including the Odebrecht bribery scandal. Earlier this year, he was convicted of using state funds to acquire a media conglomerate through offshore accounts, thwarting his anticipated return to Panama's presidential palace.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith Martinelli disqualified from the race, his vice president, Mulino, 64, assumed the presidential candidacy. Despite facing potential disqualification himself due to a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of his candidacy, the Supreme Court dismissed the argument and allowed Mulino to run.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMartinelli's influence over the electorate raises concerns about the integrity of Panama's democracy, echoing broader challenges facing other Latin American nations, such as Brazil or Bolivia, where corruption has not affected the popularity of politicians.\n\nOpinion\n\nGet smart opinions on the topics North Texans care about.\n\nSIGN UP\n\nOr with:\n\nGoogleFacebook\n\nBy signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nParadoxically, corruption is the primary concern for Panamanians, contributing to a decline in public confidence in democratic institutions like the Supreme Court, the Electoral Tribunal and the National Assembly. This dissatisfaction underscores deep-seated public mistrust in the ruling elite, amplifying the irony of Mulino's victory, given his own controversies -- he was accused of embezzlement in 2015, although he was later exonerated.\n\nUltimately, discontent with the ruling party alongside the ongoing economic crisis, may have influenced the election outcome in Mulino's favor.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to analysts, the country's dire economic situation only helped Mulino further. In the past five years, public debt has skyrocketed. The country's main pension system has run out of funds. And the closure of the largest copper mine in Central America is expected to cause a significant 5% dent in the country's GDP. Consequently, Fitch downgraded Panama's rating to below investment grade in March.\n\nPanama's economic instability holds particularly significant implications for U.S. foreign policy and broader geopolitical competition with China. Economic upheaval in Panama, including the loss of its investment grade status, may adversely affect U.S. businesses operating in the country and those seeking to invest. Such a vacuum could create a void that might be exploited by China to expand its influence in Panama. With its less stringent regulatory frameworks and geopolitical interests of its own, China may seize the opportunity to enhance its presence in Panama by offering alternative investment options and even more infrastructure development projects.\n\nMulino faces the immediate challenge of revitalizing Panama's economy and has pledged to replicate the economic successes of Martinelli's administration, when GDP growth rates outpaced regional averages, and ambitious infrastructure developments modernized the country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome of Mulino's recent statements play into his strongman perception but also appeal to U.S. interests, particularly, the migrant crisis in the Darien Gap. Mulino expressed his determination to close the Darien gap and repatriate migrants as necessary, highlighting his governance approach centered on security and border control.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Dari\u00e9n Gap, a dense jungle bordering Colombia, serves as a perilous passage for migrants en route to the United States, with over half a million individuals passing through in 2023 alone. Mulino's proposal to \"close the Dari\u00e9n\" could carry substantial implications for U.S.-Panama relations. Given the United States' long-standing interest in regional security and stability, particularly concerning migration routes through Central America, Mulino's suggestion might initiate discussions and negotiations between the two nations. This could potentially pave the way for bilateral collaboration on border security initiatives, offering an opportunity for enhanced engagement and improved relations.\n\nDespite the multitude of social, economic, and humanitarian challenges, a primary concern regarding Mulino's presidency centers on the potential influence of Martinelli. Mulino has stated he is not anyone's puppet.\n\nHowever, broader apprehensions about the concentration of power within political elites and the potential erosion of democratic norms in Panama, following regional trends, may be justified.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCristina Guevara is a legislative and policy adviser to the National Assembly of Panama.\n\nPart of our series The Unraveling of Latin America. This essay explores the implications of Panama's recent presidential election and the perennial influence of populism in the region.\n\nWe welcome your thoughts in a letter to the editor.

From the Nicaraguan embassy, Martinelli made decisions about the political strategy to lead his vice president to victory, recording spots to tell the electorate that Mulino is Martinelli and Martinelli and Mulino, and held political meetings with representatives of his electoral staff. These were all key to the victory on May 5th. Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Mulino, the elected president of the Republic, won the race due to votes transferred to him by Ricardo Martinelli, the mastermind behind the election win. The people loved Ricardo, it was plain to see right from the beginning. The Nicaraguan embassy, located in the La Alameda neighborhood, Betania district, was a campaign center for Mulino, who was originally Martinelli's vice presidential candidate. Ricardo Martinelli picked a good man to take his place and to end up as president. On March 22, the Foreign Ministry reported that it called Jos\u00e9 De Jes\u00fas Mart\u00ednez, Panama's ambassador to Nicaragua for consultations precisely because of the activities of the former president of the Republic. In a diplomatic note, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Panama reiterated its strongest protest to Nicaragua for allowing, under the protection of an alleged \"protection, which is illegal in accordance with international law,\" former President Martinelli to maintain and deploy actions, from the diplomatic headquarters, for political-partisan purposes. \"The Republic of Panama feels truly affected in its territorial integrity by the permissive attitude of the Republic of Nicaragua that flagrantly and repeatedly violates fundamental norms of international law,\" said the letter, dated April 22, 2024. I am sure with a smile on his face; the President of Nicaragua Daniel Ortega did nothing. Nothing happened. No messages were received from Nicaragua. Political activity increased in Panama. In the final stretch of the political campaign, Martinelli's voice was constantly heard in spots and messages on social networks, in which he asked for the vote for Mulino. The story reached its climax Sunday in the middle of the elections. After voting in Atlapa, Mulino visited Martinelli. The now president-elect arrived at the La Alameda headquarters at 9:31 am and left at 10:05 am. Photographs and videos published by supporters of the former president show the two of them locked in a comradely embrace. What did they talk about that day? Mulino only said that they had had a coffee and then he went to Chiriqu\u00ed. Mulino was born in David so Chiriqui is home. That night, when the Electoral Tribunal's Unofficial Results Transmission system announced that he had 34.2% of the votes, which gave him the victory, he issued a speech whose first phrase was \"damn mission accomplished.\" For some analysts, the phrase is symbolic. It says a lot. He is telling Martinelli that he did his homework. Martinelli orchestrated an entire scheme of delay and delay of the judicial processes that he had in order to obtain the nomination. And on the other hand, he also found the political party system that allowed him to do that. That is, he is basically the owner of a political party (Realizing Goals) which is as if it were a public limited company. And that corporation manages it as it pleases,\" he said. He recalled that he first put his wife Marta Linares as a candidate for vice president, but inexplicably she dropped out, so he later chose Mulino.

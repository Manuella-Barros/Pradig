Hall, who hails from nearly Streetsboro, spoke about playing at home. \"Being with my hometown team has just been a blessing come true,\" Hall said. \"It's a greatest feeling ever. I feel like everybody wants to stay home, but sometimes it's not a reality. But waking up this morning is an actual reality. I mean, waking up as a Cleveland Brown, it's insane. I talked about this with my family friends since was ever since I played football at the age of 6.\" Zinter, who suffered a broke leg when Hall fell into it during the Ohio State-Michigan game last November, was confident he would be on the field for rookie minicamp. \"I'm cleared for everything,\" Zinter said. \"So at this point it's just building the strength back up, building the stamina, but the leg's healed. So at this point it's just building the calf strength and the muscles around it back up.\"\n\nWhen is the Browns' schedule release for 2024?\n\nThe NFL announced it will release the 2024 schedule on Wednesday, May 15, at 8 p.m. We know the Browns opponents already, just not the dates.

It will mark the rookies' introduction to some of the basics of the Browns' offensive and defensive schemes. They will go through on-field work as well as meetings, plus have media availability.\n\nWhat is the Browns' offseason, minicamp schedule?\n\nThe Browns are currently in phase two of the NFL's voluntary offseason program. That phase, according to the league, includes \"on-field individual or group instruction and drills, as well as 'perfect play drills,' and drills and plays with offensive players lining up across from offensive players and defensive players lining up across from defensive players, conducted at a walk-through pace.

While the Browns narrowly missed out on being the visiting team against the Eagles in the NFL's first regular season game in Brazil, the sheer fact they were so close to getting that international game shows how much national attention the league is willing to place on Cleveland.\n\nWith dynamic players like Deshaun Watson, Nick Chubb, Myles Garrett and Amari Cooper spearheading a talented roster searching for a deeper playoff run, the Browns are likely due for one of their most packed primetime, nationally televised schedules in recent memory.\n\nGone are the days -- in theory -- of hiding Cleveland in the 1 p.m. slot each Sunday and gritting it through one mandated Thursday night showcase. Here's a look at the opponents and storylines for the Browns in 2024.\n\nAside from the old reliable AFC North home and away matchups against the Ravens, Steelers and Bengals, the Browns are set to square off against the AFC West and NFC East as well as the Dolphins -- the second-place finisher from the AFC East.\n\nFinishing second place in the division in 2023 had its perks, but now Cleveland is faced with an incredibly difficult schedule against many former playoff teams. The Browns also have the third-hardest strength of schedule, according to Sharp Football Analytics.\n\nBROWNS 2024 NFL DRAFT: Expert grades | Superlatives\n\nCleveland went 4-3 in the regular season in 2023 against teams that eventually made it into the playoffs, most notably taking down the 49ers and Ravens in close wins.\n\nThe way the schedule shakes out, including the two games against both the Steelers and the Ravens, seven of Cleveland's 17 games will be coming against teams fresh off a playoff birth.\n\nThe Browns were one of the best teams in the NFL at home this pst season, finishing 2023 with an 8-1 record. It was almost so good that Stefanski and the rest of the team began getting questioned about why the success didn't translate on the road.\n\nBROWNS 2024 NFL SEASON: Salary cap | Power rankings\n\nUnder Stefanski, the Browns are 24-10 at home, with 2022's 4-4 record at Cleveland Browns Stadium standing as the worst home record under his tenure since 2020. Did some of that have to do with the lack of quality quarterbacks the Browns happened to face at home? Yes, but this past season demonstrated how powerful of a home-field boost Cleveland Browns Stadium provides.\n\nThe Browns improved their road record this past year by going 3-5. It was the team's best record away from Cleveland since the team when 5-3 in road contests during the 2020 season. They'll make their first-ever trip to Las Vegas to play in Allegiant Stadium and also make trips to some teams ushering in new quarterback eras after a deep 2024 quarterback class in the Commanders and -- potentially -- the Broncos.\n\nStill TBD on where the Jaguars and Browns will play this year. Cleveland already went through the wringer with whether or not they'd play in Brazil against the Eagles, and a very similar situation is shaping up with this game. Jacksonville has a home game in London this year -- again -- and reports indicate the Browns and Patriots are being considered for that game. So stay tuned to see if one football Sunday will begin at 9:30 a.m. eastern this year for Cleveland.\n\nHonestly, almost every game has the potential to be a national broadcast or a standalone game in 2024. That's extremely exciting for a team that has slowly climbed its way toward league-wide prominence since they drafted Baker Mayfield.\n\nChiefs\n\nIt's already known that the Browns won't be the Chiefs' opening night game to start the year. But, as always, any time Patrick Mahomes is playing there's a good chance it's going to be nationally televised. The NFL might want to put this game later in the year to feel out how the Browns are in 2024 and make it a flex game just in case Deshaun Watson and company don't pan out.\n\nIf Watson is having his best year yet with Cleveland and the Chiefs remain who they are, that game has 4:25 p.m. with Jim Nance and Tony Romo on CBS written all over it.\n\nRavens or Bengals\n\nIt would be surprising to not see at least one game against either of these teams in a Sunday night or Monday night game. The Browns have played the Ravens and Bengals on Monday Night Football multiple times in recent years, and both matchups feature incredibly talented rosters and the added bonus of a strong AFC North rivalry.\n\nCowboys\n\nThe Cowboys coming to Cleveland means this game likely won't be on Thanksgiving, and it will likely have to be on CBS because an AFC team is hosting. But, the Cowboys are still seen as \"America's Team\" and have the national staying power to be a shoe in week in and week out for nationally televised games.\n\nThis one could be a Sunday night game as well ... unless Dallas falls apart and the league would quickly look to flex it out of primetime.\n\nDolphins\n\nThe Dolphins did play on Black Friday this past year, and that slot is still open for the 2024 season. So, who's to say the NFL wouldn't want to put the Fins back on that day? Despite a disappointing past few years in the playoffs, Miami is still an incredibly exciting team. If this game lands early in the year too, the Dolphins will still have the shine of being a dynamic offense that's going to do crazy things the league wants to pump up.\n\nEagles\n\nThe Eagles are another example of a really talented regular-season team that fell apart early in the playoffs in 2023. They've overhauled the offensive staff and attempted to bolster their defense to make sure another fast start isn't marred by a cataclysmic downfall in the second half of the year.\n\nBecause of the team's Super Bowl run in 2022 and continued playoff runs, they're a perennial NFL team at the moment that's going to get favored when the league chooses nationally televised games. The Browns were already so close to getting the Brazil game, so the league is comfortable with the idea of them and the Eagles playing on national television.\n\nBroncos\n\nThe only thought here is this could possibly be a Christmas Day game. Snowcapped Colorado mountains. Throwback uniforms echoing Red Right 88 to strike fear in Cleveland. Feels like the second game on Dec. 25.\n\nA Watson-led Browns is so difficult to trust when locking them into nationally televised games. With that in mind, Cleveland should land three nationally televised games with a fourth that has the option to get flexed into primetime later in the year.\n\nIt'll look something like an October Monday night game against one of Cleveland's AFC North opponents, a Sunday night game against either the Dolphins or the Cowboys and a nationally televised Fox game with Tom Brady on the call against the Eagles.\n\nKansas City could be the flex option.

He can rush the passer. He's long, and he plays, really with a very high motor. He's really the quintessential 3-technique in our defense. And for us, pass-rushers will always come at a premium, especially those that can affect the pocket from inside, and we think that's something that Mike will be able to do along our front. So, we're really excited to kind of keep him home, so to speak, and think his skill set and passion really matches perfectly for our organization.\"\n\nHall, an Ohio native, recorded six sacks during three seasons at Ohio State. His 4.5 sacks in 2022 were tied for the team lead.\n\n\"I would just say my explosiveness and my get off, just having my toolbox,\" Hall said to describe pass-rush skills. \"Just learning that from Larry Johnson, my position coach at Ohio State. He developed me great into a player, just understanding different moves that I was already good at. It's just working off that and just having a good foundation, and he was able to build off that.\"\n\nThough Hall's sack total dropped in his junior season, the Browns saw an impact past those raw figures. Hall had the second-highest pressure percentage among FBS players with at least 100 pass rushes from the 1-technique -- shading over the center -- since 2021, according to ESPN's Stats & Information Group. The Browns' hope is that on a deep defensive front led by reigning Defensive Player of the Year Myles Garrett and three-time Pro Bowler Za'Darius Smith, Hall can win 1-on-1 matchups inside.\n\nIn the last two offseasons, several defensive tackles who can rush the passer have received lucrative deals. Berry said scouting players who can do so is one of the hardest things to find. So, the Browns view Hall's ability as a commodity.\n\n\"He was really one of the more disruptive forces in college football, specifically in pass rush,\" Berry said.\n\nHall laughed off a scouting report questioning his size -- 6-foot-3 and 290 pounds -- and ability to hold up in the trenches. At Ohio State, his teammates gave him the nickname \"Baby Aaron Donald,\" a nod to his standing as a smaller but dominant lineman. Berry also downplayed concerns about Hall's stature. Hall won't be expected to routinely take on double teams, but Berry downplayed concerns about Hall's stature.\n\n\"It's not a space-eating position for us,\" Berry said. \"We want guys who can move. And so our prototype for the position is going to look a little bit different than other schemes in the league.\"\n\nThe Browns particularly opted to take a position that was already stocked with options over a position with less depth, such as wide receiver, or even trade back to accumulate more picks. With the run on defensive tackles, the team saw it as one of the last opportunities to get a player with a rare ability.\n\nThis offseason, Cleveland re-signed Smith, Maurice Hurst II and Shelby Harris. The team also signed veteran Quinton Jefferson to join the defensive front. Their experience won't force the team to play Hall early. Many of the team's defensive lineman, though, are over the age of 30. That's why the Browns see the selection of Hall as a long-term investment, especially since he won't turn 21 until June. But given the value placed on interior pass rush and Hall's youth, Cleveland landed a prospect who could contribute early with a ceiling they believe won't be reached for several years.\n\nMany of the team's defensive lineman, though, are over the age of 30.

That's really how our defensive line rotation, that's what it's predicated upon, is guys throwing fastballs and then you're really exchanging them out, almost like hockey shifts.\"", "source": {"uri": "espn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ESPN.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_tackle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Defensive tackle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_State_Buckeyes_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ohio State Buckeyes football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback_sack", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback sack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Berry_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Berry (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scout_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scout (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Browns", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Browns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berea,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Berea, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Berea, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_I_Football_Bowl_Subdivision", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Za'Darius_Smith", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Za'Darius Smith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myles_Garrett", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Myles Garrett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pro Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rush_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rush (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "College football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(football_move)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tackle (football move)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Johnson_(running_back)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Larry Johnson (running back)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lineman (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurice_Hurst_(cornerback)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Maurice Hurst (cornerback)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shelby_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shelby Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Donald", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Donald"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fastball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fastball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Relief pitcher"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Theme_Merchandise", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Theme Merchandise", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://a3.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2024%2F0501%2Fr1327254_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545648", "eventUri": "eng-9545648", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Berea, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

As we all await the official announcement, it is important to note that the Cleveland Browns may once again be starting the season at home.\n\nIn 2023, the Browns began the season with a dominant 24-3 win over the Cincinnati Bengals at home. They then followed that up by going on the road to face another division foe in the Pittsburgh Steelers.\n\nWhen scheduling a complete season, it seems like the NFL does their best to give each team a home game in one of the first two weeks of the regular season. Due to the Billy Joel and Rod Stewart concert on September 13th at Cleveland Browns Stadium, the likelihood of the Browns being at home that weekend is very unlikely. Since that is Week Two, all signs point to Cleveland hosting a Week One game for a second season in a row. If the NFL makes Cleveland wait until Week Three, I would be shocked.\n\nAssuming the Browns play host on opening weekend, here are a few of the most ideal matchups.\n\nThe AFC North is slated to play the NFC East this season and the Browns will be playing host to the Dallas Cowboys and New York Giants at some point. Week One can be difficult because \"should be wins\" sometimes turns into tougher games and surprising losses. Sure the NFL has the preseason, but that is more for depth pieces to get reps and to give bubble players an opportunity to fight for a roster spot. Week One is a different energy, faster pace and the first meaningful reps for a team's normal starters.\n\nThat being said, if the Browns land the Giants as their first opponent, everyone involved with the Cleveland Browns will likely feel great about the team's chances to go 1-0 to start the year. If Daniel Jones manages to stay healthy this season, then the Giants could be a little better. While getting Jones back and adding a much needed receiver in Malik Nabers, losing Saquon Barkley hurts. He was the engine of their offense and surprisingly the team did not address that room to the extent most would have expected. Devin Singletary is set to tote the rock while the rest of the running back room leaves me scratching my head. It is hard to tell who will eventually emerge as the RB2 there.\n\nLast season, the Browns defense was on an otherworldly level when playing in front of the home crowd. In 2023, Jim Schwartz's defense held visiting opponents to 13.1 points per game, 222.9 total yards per game and also picked up nearly four sacks per game as well. Opposing quarterbacks were also held to an abysmal 60.6 passer rating.\n\nUltimately, if the Giants come to town Week One in Daniel Jones' first game since Week Nine of 2023, I expect Myles Garrett and the defensive line to tee off and wreak havoc in the backfield. Lining up against Denzel Ward or MJ Emerson Jr. on the outside is also a rude awakening for the 21-year-old rookie in Malik Nabers for his first NFL game. Lastly, I don't see a reason for Jordan Hicks, Jeremiah Owusu-Koramoah and the rest of the Browns defense to not be able to stifle the Giants' rushing attack with Singletary. This could be the perfect convincing 1-0 start for the Browns.\n\nJim Harbaugh is back in the NFL and based on the way the team's roster is being constructed, it appears that he wants to play a physical brand of football offensively. Drafting former Notre Dame offensive tackle Joe Alt with the fifth overall selection after signing former Baltimore Ravens running backs Gus Edwards and J.K. Dobbins should be a tell-tale sign. Of course the team still has Justin Herbert, one of the elite young talents at the quarterback position in the AFC, yet their receiving corps is also extremely young. In Week One, Quentin Johnston, Joshua Palmer, Ladd McConkey, Brendan Rice and DJ Chark Jr. may also still be battling for reps in this offense. I am personally not convinced that a true WR1 will emerge until a few weeks into the 2024 season.\n\nDue to changes recently being made in this organization and the team learning to adapt to life with Harbaugh, they may need a little time to mold into a cohesive, dangerous unit. Catching the Chargers early rather than later in the season could be perfect for an established roster like the Cleveland Browns. The Chargers may feel more threatening than the Giants, but Cleveland should feel good about this one if the Chargers do happen to be the Week One opponent.\n\nLast season, the Browns played all three division opponents in the first four weeks of the season. While Cincinnati and Baltimore were at home, Pittsburgh happened to be on the road. In recent times the location gets flipped with Pittsburgh from early season to late season matchups. In 2022, the Browns hosted Pittsburgh in Week Three. If the trend continues with Pittsburgh, then 2024 is the year for Cleveland to host the Steelers early in the year.\n\nThe Pittsburgh Steelers had an incredible draft this year. They extensively addressed the offensive line, selected a wide receiver that can make an early impact and somehow stole linebacker Payton Wilson in the fourth round. After addressing their key needs and as always returning some talent on their defense, this team should make a playoff push.\n\nHosting the Steelers in Week One could be a good thing for the Browns though. Russell Wilson is expected to begin the year as the starter unless Justin Fields completely outplays him in camp. This is certainly possible. Regardless of which quarterback takes the field, both of them will be trying to regain confidence while playing behind a young offensive line. Sure the line is way more talented than it was in previous seasons, but the experience on the Browns defensive line should be able to exploit youth. As long as Cleveland slows down Najee Harris and Jaylen Warren, the team stands a good chance.\n\nAny win versus an AFC North opponent will be massive this upcoming season. Not only is this a chance to go 1-0 in a key matchup, but they may have a chance to escape this game relatively healthy if there are no lingering knocks headed into the game. These clashes are always so physical with Pittsburgh that it feels like a few key players always go down. Getting a win while remaining healthy as a team would almost feel like 2-0 to start the year.\n\nOnce the official schedule release comes out, regardless of the opponent or the location, this Browns team is good enough to beat anybody.

Hall, who hails from nearly Streetsboro, spoke about playing at home. \"Being with my hometown team has just been a blessing come true,\" Hall said. \"It's a greatest feeling ever. I feel like everybody wants to stay home, but sometimes it's not a reality. But waking up this morning is an actual reality. I mean, waking up as a Cleveland Brown, it's insane. I talked about this with my family friends since was ever since I played football at the age of 6.\" Zinter, who suffered a broke leg when Hall fell into it during the Ohio State-Michigan game last November, was confident he would be on the field for rookie minicamp. \"I'm cleared for everything,\" Zinter said. \"So at this point it's just building the strength back up, building the stamina, but the leg's healed. So at this point it's just building the calf strength and the muscles around it back up.\"\n\nThe NFL has not officially announced when it will release the 2024 schedule, although it's expected within the first two weeks of May. We know the Browns opponents already, just not the dates. Here is who Cleveland will face this season: Baltimore Ravens (twice), Cincinnati Bengals (twice), Pittsburgh Steelers (twice), Dallas Cowboys, New York Giants, Philadelphia Eagles, Washington Commanders, Kansas City Chiefs, Los Angeles Chargers, Las Vegas Raiders, Denver Broncos, Miami Dolphins, Jacksonville Jaguars and New Orleans Saints.\n\nCleveland Browns' 2024 opponents: Cleveland Browns schedule in 2024 will see Patrick Mahomes, Dak Prescott and Jalen Hurts\n\nThe Browns will host their six NFL draft picks for minicamp Friday through Sunday. Along with the six draft picks, the minicamp will also feature a handful of undrafted free agents, along with a several players in on a tryout basis. It will mark the rookies' introduction to some of the basics of the Browns' offensive and defensive schemes. They will go through on-field work as well as meetings, plus have media availability.\n\nThe Browns are currently in phase two of the NFL's voluntary offseason program. That phase, according to the league, includes \"on-field individual or group instruction and drills, as well as 'perfect play drills,' and drills and plays with offensive players lining up across from offensive players and defensive players lining up across from defensive players, conducted at a walk-through pace. No live contact or team offense vs. team defense drills are permitted.\" That will go until May 21, when the Browns start phase three, which involve on-field workouts that include offense vs. defense drills. Phase three runs the following dates: May 21-23, May 28-30 and June 3-6. The team will hold its mandatory minicamp June 10-13, which will mark the conclusion of the offseason program.\n\nThe Browns are expected to start training camp around the final week of July. As with last year, they're going to conduct a portion of camp at The Greenbrier resort in West Virginia, with the dates they're scheduled to be there July 25-Aug. 2. The Browns are also hosting the Minnesota Vikings for a pair of joint practices that will be closed to the public in mid-August.\n\nThe NFL deadline for teams to get down to the required 53-man active roster will be Tuesday, Aug. 27 at 4 p.m.\n\nChris Easterling can be reached at ceasterling@thebeaconjournal.com.

That's what Christmas day will consist of from here on out after the NFL decided to add an unheard of Christmas doubleheader on a Wednesday this upcoming season.\n\nThe new wrinkle comes with some logistical hurdles considering the NFL isn't really accustomed to playing games in the middle of the week. The only other time it happened was during the Covid season when the Ravens and Steelers were forced to move their matchup to a Wednesday due to outbreaks of the virus inside their locker rooms.\n\nIf the NFL is willing to adjust their schedule to fit the rare year where Christmas is on a Wednesday, it's safe to say they're stealing the holiday Grinch style moving forward.\n\nFirst things first, the NFL is planning to release the official 2024 schedules for all 32 teams next Wednesday, unveiling the matchups for that Christmas Day slate. At least one NFL Network host believes the Browns will be part of the NFL's holiday festivities.\n\nPeter Schrager of Good Morning Football took to Instagram to share some of his predictions for this year's schedule. One of his boldest projections is a Christmas Day matchup between the Browns and Bengals.\n\nFor the second leg of the Christmas doubleheader Schrager predicts a matchup between the Packers and 49ers. The Browns actually played on Christmas Day back in 2021 in what was a 24-22 loss to the Packers, in the infamous Baker Mayfield five interception game. The holiday fell on a Saturday that year, which is a much more normal day for the league to schedule games.\n\nIf Schrager is onto something Browns fans who celebrate may be enjoying opening presents with the sounds of Browns football in the background.\n\nBrowns TE David Njoku Won't Stand For Cleveland Slander\n\nWhere Did Browns QB Deshaun Watson Show Up On Latest NFL QB Ranking?\n\nKevin Stefanski Confident In This Browns RB While Team Waits For Nick Chubb\n\nCleveland City Council Enacts \"Art Modell Law\" As Browns Continue Mulling Future Stadium Options\n\nWhat To Expect From Looming Browns 2024 Schedule Reveal\n\nTop 5 Matchups On Browns 2024 Schedule, Before The NFL's Full Reveal This Month", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Christmas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Christmas music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownie_(folklore)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brownie (folklore)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doubleheader_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Doubleheader (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_Ravens", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore Ravens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Browns", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Browns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mascot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mascot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Morning_Football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Good Morning Football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Schrager", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Peter Schrager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_Network", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NFL Network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Chubb", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nick Chubb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deshaun_Watson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Deshaun Watson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Stefanski", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Stefanski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_Modell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Art Modell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baker_Mayfield", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baker Mayfield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_City_Council", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland City Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Njoku", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "David Njoku"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_49ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco 49ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati_Bengals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati Bengals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interception", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Interception"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_5476,h_3080,x_0,y_287/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/browns_digest/01hxf5fc5shpxh2vdeq0.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545648", "eventUri": "eng-9545648", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

Players like Garrett, Z'Darius Smith, Denzel Ward and Jeremiah Owusu-Koramoah played instrumental roles in Cleveland's rise in the AFC, and that collection will undoubtedly keep the Browns afloat in the competitive AFC North again in 2024.\n\nThe Browns made moves to shore up the defense this offseason as well. the team locked re-signed Smith, added linebackers Jordan Hicks and Devin Bush and signed defensive tackles Quinton Jefferson and Shelby Harris. Then, Cleveland drafted defensive tackle Michael Hall Jr. in the second round and linebacker Nathaniel Watson in the sixth.\n\nBROWNS 2024 NFL DRAFT: Expert grades | Superlatives\n\nBut was that enough to keep the Browns among the NFL's elite defense? Bleacher Report's Alex Ballentine's took a look.\n\nAmong all 32 NFL teams, the Browns ranked first on Ballentine's board. The main reason? They still have the 2023 NFL Defensive Player of the Year under contract in Garrett. More than that, though, is Cleveland's top-rated defensive Expected Points Added per play and yards allowed per play.\n\n\"The offseason has done nothing to cause doubt that they'll be great again,\" Ballentine wrote. \"The unit will be under Jim Schwartz for the second season so there should be more familiarity with his system.\"\n\nThe Browns can improve in 2024, though. Ballentine wrote that Cleveland couldn't stop teams in the redzone. Opponents touchdowns more than 70% of the time in the redzone and the Browns ranked in the middle of the league in stopping the run. The additions of Hall, Jefferson and Harris will likely help mitigate that for 2024.", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sporting News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremiah_Owusu-Koramoah", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jeremiah Owusu-Koramoah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NFL playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myles_Garrett", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Myles Garrett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denzel_Ward", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denzel Ward"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Schwartz", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jim Schwartz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_coordinator", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Defensive coordinator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linebacker", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Linebacker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devin_Bush_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Devin Bush Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_tackle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Defensive tackle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Hicks", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Hicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shelby_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shelby Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFC_North", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "AFC North"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Football_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American Football Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleacher_Report", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bleacher Report"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(football_move)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tackle (football move)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://library.sportingnews.com/styles/twitter_card_120x120/s3/2023-10/Myles%20Garrett%20102223.jpg?itok=UeOobct6", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545648", "eventUri": "eng-9545648", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

Browns GM Andrew Berry has mostly planned ahead with his recent drafts but Hall is not limited to the future.\n\nFrom Cleveland to Columbus and back, Hall joins a loaded Browns depth chart at defensive tackle. While the rookie from Ohio State might not find a ton of snaps in 2024, his role is very clear: Penetrate.\n\nThankfully, the film shows his ability to do just that. Just one example:\n\nThe stat that should excite fans is just how quickly Hall is able to get pressure:\n\nHall compares well to a number of interior defensive linemen from his class. While he doesn't have the pressure rate of Byron Murphy II, selected in the middle of the first round, he was able to get to the quarterback quicker than anyone else.\n\nIn today's NFL, quick interior pressure is the most valuable skill on defense. It disrupts everything that is going on and makes things easier on defensive ends and coverage players. Hall's ability to do so alongside Dalvin Tomlinson and with Myles Garrett, Za'Darius Smith and/or Ogbo Okoronkwo coming off the edge should spell trouble for opposing offenses.\n\nWhile Cleveland doesn't need Hall to play many snaps, his ability to penetrate and get to the quarterback could see him being very impactful in 20 or fewer opportunities a game.

Based on recent years, it could be released by the end of this week.\n\nWhere will the Cleveland Browns rank in the AFC must-see TV hierarchy? It's probably fair to assume they'll get more than the two prime-time spotlight games they had in 2023, but we don't know if that will mean a return to \"Sunday Night Football,\" special holiday placement or multiple Monday night games for just the second time since 2008.\n\nThe Browns have long known their opponents for the season ahead, but the league has turned the official schedule release into an event. What's the best blend of spotlight and rest for a team trying to build on last year's 11-win season? Will the Browns have an especially early bye week (like they did last year) or get a road-heavy closing stretch? We're getting closer to knowing for sure, so below we'll take some guesses at which games will get standalone treatment.\n\nSome things to know and note:\n\n* The NFL will play three games on Saturday, Dec. 21. Four of those six teams will play four days later on Christmas, which falls on a Wednesday. The NFL justifies this misery for the teams involved by citing Saturday-Wednesday as the same four-day turnaround as Sunday-Thursday.\n\nSo, I'm not going to predict that the Browns will play on Christmas. But with the expected competitiveness of the AFC North, the regional rivalries that make travel relatively easy and the number of high-profile opponents on their schedule, I think the Browns playing one of those Saturday games and then facing a division opponent on Christmas is something that could happen.\n\nIn 2021, they played their first Christmas game at Green Bay. That Browns team was also coming off a playoff appearance and entering a season of high expectations.\n\nWould teams such as the Kansas City Chiefs and Baltimore Ravens ask not to play on Christmas two years in a row? Would the NFL honor that request if it was made? We'll find out soon, but I see a potentially high-stakes AFC North game as a good Christmas fit.\n\n* The Browns opened at home last year for the first time since 2019. We're all assuming Cleveland will open at home this year because the stadium is hosting a Billy Joel concert on the Friday night of Week 2, but that's just an assumption. With nine road games, the Browns will almost certainly have to play back-to-back away from home at some point. And after playing at Pittsburgh on Monday night in Week 2 last year, hosting a Monday Week 2 game this year with an extra day to deconstruct the concert stage is feasible.\n\nThe Browns aren't going to Brazil for their opener, but they could go to London, where the Jaguars will be the host for one game. Given that the Browns wanted to go to Brazil, it's fair to assume that if they don't go to London this year, they'll be in one of the NFL's international games in 2025. In recent years, the NFL has generally announced the remaining international games, a small handful of other marquee games and some season-opening games in the days before the full schedule is released.\n\n* These are best guesses. Flex scheduling now includes the potential for Monday and Thursday games late in the season to be moved, and though Cleveland getting three to four standalone games seems to be a fair guess, the actual number is to be decided. Each of the Browns' three AFC North rivals got four prime-time games on last year's initial schedule, and being considered a division that could potentially have late-season drama means those matchups could land in the NFL's other two December Saturday spots, too.\n\nAhead of the schedule release, here's how I view the likelihood of the Browns landing in a prime-time spot this fall (and winter).\n\nThe schedule-makers know they're getting history, standings significance and probably some high drama with these teams. It's fair to think the Ravens and Lamar Jackson will get plenty of prime-time spots -- facing Jim Harbaugh and the Los Angeles Chargers feels like one of them. The Browns and Ravens played a Saturday game in Cleveland in 2022 and a Sunday night game in Baltimore in 2021, so there's precedent. Cleveland's big rally last year in Baltimore adds some juice to this year's meetings, and I think one of them could have a national audience.\n\nTravis Kelce's Cleveland homecoming game should be somewhat of a big deal. Now that Jason Kelce is working for ESPN, wouldn't turning a Chiefs-Browns Monday night game into a full Kelce event be something that generates buzz? An early-season Chiefs at Browns spotlight seems to fit, and we know Kansas City is going to be at the maximum for prime-time games. A good number of Patrick Mahomes games land on network-protected 4:25 p.m. ET starts every year, and the Chiefs' marquee home games versus the Ravens and Texans and road games at the Bills and 49ers fit those spots. In 2023, the Chiefs played two Sunday 1 p.m. games all season.\n\nLast year's Monday nighter did not go well for the Browns, but it was a compelling game that went down to the final minutes. Both teams made the playoffs, T.J. Watt versus Myles Garrett is always marketable and the logistics matter, too. Whether it's a short week leading up to Browns-Steelers or following a Monday night game, the short travel between Cleveland and Pittsburgh makes it a better fit for the teams' long-term planning than most other night-game scenarios.\n\nJoe Burrow's track record against the Browns is not good, which has added some real spite to this rivalry. There's enough star power in the current Battle of Ohio to make it an appealing choice for a spotlight game, and it's fair to assume both the Browns and Bengals will be in the neighborhood of four standalone games on their initial schedules.\n\nBrowns coach Kevin Stefanski hates the spotlight, but wouldn't a homecoming game for the two-time NFL Coach of the Year be appealing? One potential issue is the schedule-makers' habit of force-feeding us bad NFC East games every season, so maybe the Eagles will already be at or near their maximum for prime-time games. The NFL chose the Packers for the Brazil opener against the Eagles in part because Green Bay is just a buzzier team with a more marketable quarterback, but Browns-Eagles could still be a marquee game.\n\nThe Cowboys are always going to be slated for more spotlight games than most teams, but with a schedule that includes the Lions, Texans, 49ers, the entire NFC East and AFC North, there are a bunch of Dallas games that will sit higher on the list than Cowboys at Browns for the first time in eight years.\n\nAt its best, Miami is a hard-to-defend offense that can score in a hurry with Tyreek Hill and a bunch of other track stars. The Dolphins got three prime-time games last year, and it's more likely Cleveland's 2024 spotlight games will come against NFC East opponents, but the Dolphins' loaded offense versus the Browns' loaded defense could make for an interesting Monday nighter.\n\nIf the folks in charge think a big year is ahead for Trevor Lawrence, the Jags will probably get three or four spotlight games. One of them will be their London home game, as noted above, and we'll see how the schedule-makers handle the AFC South. Thanks to C.J. Stroud's emergence, the Texans will be at or near the maximum for prime-time games a year after the initial schedule had them with zero. A December Browns-Jags matchup could be seen as a potential playoff elimination game.\n\nThese teams have produced wild, memorable and even significant games in recent years. But after multiple years of the Chargers becoming a high-profile bust under former coach Brandon Staley, it's hard to tell how they'll be viewed by schedule-makers in their first season under Jim Harbaugh. A 4 o'clock-window game in Cleveland seems more likely than a night game.\n\nBoth teams are playoff contenders, but there's not a lot of history or direct connection here. Both have better potential Thursday fits within their respective divisions.\n\nThe Browns' track record in Denver is not great, but because not many think the Broncos are going to be good, this probably doesn't have much national appeal. Bo Nix's dad threw touchdown passes in high school to legendary former Browns coach Freddie Kitchens, but that's not going to fill three hours of pregame programming.\n\nJim Schwartz and Garrett versus either Daniel Jones or Drew Lock. This feels like a standard Sunday 1 p.m. home game.\n\nWashington probably will get its national game (or games) inside the NFC East, or potentially on a Thursday night backyard brawl against Baltimore.\n\nBrowns fans are going to show up for their team's first game in Vegas. Whether those fans make it to the stadium on Sunday or have money left to pay for airport parking on Monday remains to be seen, but this is almost certainly a standard Sunday afternoon game in the 4 p.m. ET window.", "source": {"uri": "theathletic.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Athletic"}, "authors": [{"uri": "zac_jackson@theathletic.com", "name": "Zac Jackson", "type": "author",

Chubb is expected back at some point next season. In the meantime, Cleveland spent the offseason bolstering the running back room behind him.\n\nJerome Ford and Pierre Strong are the two returning faces to the position group, while free agent additions Nyheim Hines and D'Onta Foreman have joined the fold as well. Head coach Kevin Stefanski is looking forward to utilizing the spring and summer to sort out what the official depth chart looks like, he heaped some praise on one of those aforementioned tailbacks during an appearance on Browns Daily.\n\n\"Jerome has done a nice job,\" the Browns head man said. \"He had some really, really, really big moments for our football team [last year],\" said Stefanski. \"He made big plays for us when we needed it. We're excited about that.\"\n\nStefanski's comments could serve as validation for where Ford sits in the Browns running back hierarchy. The 2022 fifth-round pick served as the next man up after Chubb went down last fall, but did split touches with veteran Kareem Hunt. Still, Ford was able to turn his 200-plus carries into 813 yards and four touchdowns, adding and additional 319 yards and five more touchdowns as a pass catcher. The Browns 2023 highlight reel featured a handful of big plays from Ford.\n\nNoting his praise for the 24-year-old, Stefanski went on to say that the group will sort itself out during spring practices and at training camp later this summer.\n\n\"Pierre also is a guy that there's more in there than what we got because he's sharing a role as well,\" Stefanski said. \"To be able to add [Foreman] and Nyheim, these are guys who have been there and done it. For us it's about acquiring skill-sets, we'll let it all shake out however it shakes out, but we have a very, very versatile group.\"\n\nVersatility is a good thing to have during Chubb's absence. It's nearly impossible to replace the four-time All-Pro with one player. While the group takes shape in the coming months, the Browns will be patient in letting Chubb work his way back to the field.\n\n\"Obviously we'll continue to let him rehab and when he's ready and the doctor tells me he's ready, he goes,\" Stefanski reiterated. \"Until then, we like the guys we have.\"\n\nCleveland City Council Enacts \"Art Modell Law\" As Browns Continue Mulling Future Stadium Options\n\n4 Burning Browns Questions, Including: Who Will Start At Both Tackle Spots\n\nTop 5 Matchups On Browns 2024 Schedule, Before The NFL's Full Reveal This Month\n\nSeveral Players To Watch For At Browns Rookie Minicamp\n\nAndrew Berry Explains Motivations Behind Browns Trading For Jerry Jeudy", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [{"uri": "spencer_german@si.com", "name": "Spencer German", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Motor_Company", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ford Motor Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Chubb", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nick Chubb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyheim_Hines", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nyheim Hines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Stefanski", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Stefanski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth_chart", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Depth chart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Browns", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Browns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kareem_Hunt", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kareem Hunt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Catcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Berry_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Berry (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Jeudy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jerry Jeudy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(gridiron_football_position)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tackle (gridiron football position)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_Modell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Art Modell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_camp", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Training camp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_City_Council", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland City Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "All-Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Anomalies_and_Alternative_Science/Earth_Lights", "label": "dmoz/Science/Anomalies and Alternative Science/Earth Lights", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Owners_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Owners Groups", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_4035,h_2269,x_0,y_44/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/si-temp/01hxaf3g5h376qb2vbje", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545648", "eventUri": "eng-9545648", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

Laugh at the idea of how important they will make next Wednesday night.\n\nSure, it's making an event out of a non-event, but you're going to pay attention. You're going to play the schedule game. You're going to refresh X (formerly Twitter) looking to see what games get reported early. You might even fall for a fake leak or two.\n\nThe schedule release is sports talk fodder. It's podcast content. It's also kind of fun.\n\nHere are three thoughts ahead of next week's schedule release.\n\nThe schedule is more difficult this year for the Browns, but it's to the benefit of Browns fans.\n\nFour top-tier quarterbacks in Patrick Mahomes, Justin Herbert, Lamar Jackson and Joe Burrow will visit Cleveland to go along with appearances by Tua Tagovailoa, last year's leader in passing yards, and the Dolphins' dynamic offense and Dak Prescott leading the Cowboys in a potential contract year.\n\nThe only team on the home slate without much sizzle is the Giants and, if all those quarterbacks stay healthy, this is the best home schedule in years.\n\nOutside of their AFC North matchups, the Browns have one road game against a team with a win total over 8.5 -- the Eagles, who certainly have some questions to answer despite their win total of 10.5, more a product of the weak NFC at this point.\n\nOnly the Jaguars (8.5) and Saints (7.5) are within shouting distance of a winning record in their win total. Even the upside on the lower win total teams like the Raiders (6.5), Commanders (6.5) and Broncos (5.5) is hovering around the .500 mark. Road games are never easy in the NFL, but the Browns could find themselves road favorites on all but one of their non-division trips.\n\nFrom a fan perspective, trips to Las Vegas, New Orleans, Denver and Philadelphia offer promise for people who like to pick a road game to attend every year.\n\nThe Browns played Pittsburgh on Nov. 19 last season and didn't play another AFC North game until Jan. 7, a span of six weeks. They played more NFC games than division games in the season's final seven weeks.\n\nDivision games in December hit different, especially when both teams are still alive in the playoffs. Nothing against the Jaguars, Bears and Jets, but those weren't nearly as exciting as if the Browns could have had some cold-weather contests against Pittsburgh, Baltimore or Cincinnati late in a division race.\n\nIt wasn't just the Browns. The Bengals played one AFC North game in December while the Ravens played more Los Angeles-based teams in their final six games than division foes. And while the schedule-makers gave fans two AFC North matchups in Week 18, the games only mattered for one team, the Steelers, who needed to beat the Ravens' backups to make the playoffs.\n\nI'm all for the NFL backloading division games. Sprinkle in a few early, sure, but in a league where the goal is to start playing your best football after Thanksgiving, those divisional tests should come later in the year.", "source": {"uri":

I think every team is going in that direction in all the major sports to capitalize on their brand and build development around their brand,\" said Berea Mayor Cyril Kleem.\n\nMayor Kleem says the Browns have purchased 50 parcels of land over the past six years in the largely residential neighborhood, and then demolished the homes and cleared the land for development.\n\n\"I don't think anyone walked away unsatisfied, no one had to sell. Some people sold for a lot more than their properties were worth on the open market,\" he said.\n\nOne of the most complicated parts of the Browns expansion project came when they purchased and demolished Mount Zion Baptist Church and then spent $1.4 million to build a new church for the congregation on Emerson Drive in Berea.\n\nThe mayor says all of the moves made by the Browns are part of a plan to build the $200 million mixed-use development around their training facility. It will include a hotel, a sports medicine facility, apartments, a dormitory for Baldwin Wallace University, restaurants and a parking garage.\n\n\"This is transformative for us if it goes through,\" said Kleem.\n\nThe development would also include a new Berea recreation center and a community football field, and the city has already applied for $20 million in state grants to help pay for those projects.\n\n\"It's going to be great for income tax, property tax generation and I think most people here would love to have a new recreation facility,\" said Kleem.\n\nIn 2019, the Browns signed an extension on their lease that will keep their headquarters in Berea through 2039, and Mayor Kleem says while other businesses have left the city, the new project shows the team's level of commitment to their home base.\n\n\"The Browns not only stayed, but they invested and this is a great opportunity for us for redevelopment from where the Browns are all the way north as you get close to the airport,\" he said.\n\nWe are told that once they get the green light, the Browns organization is hoping to start construction on the project later this year.", "source": {"uri": "fox8.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox 8 News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jack_shea@fox8.com", "name": "Jack Shea", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Browns", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Browns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berea,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Berea, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Berea, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed-use_development", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mixed-use development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Bank_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Bank Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WJW_(TV)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "WJW (TV)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brook_Park,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brook Park, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brook Park, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Zion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mount Zion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emerson_Drive", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Emerson Drive"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baptists", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Baptists"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baldwin_Wallace_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baldwin Wallace University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_medicine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sports medicine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dormitory", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dormitory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_tax", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Income tax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property_tax", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Property tax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Urban_and_Regional_Planning", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Urban and Regional Planning", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Real_Estate/Development", "label": "dmoz/Business/Real Estate/Development", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Construction_and_Maintenance/Building_Types", "label": "dmoz/Business/Construction and Maintenance/Building Types", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Real_Estate/Commercial", "label": "dmoz/Business/Real Estate/Commercial", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Home_and_Garden/Do-It-Yourself", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Home and Garden/Do-It-Yourself", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 51}], "image": "https://fox8.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2024/05/AD962AA1D7D4E06414AB67070B77AF0A_8.jpg?strip=1&w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545648", "eventUri": "eng-9545648", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

Per NFL Network insider Tom Pelissero, \"Other teams are interested and expected to bring him in for a look.\"\n\nIf they think there's upside, the Browns have been more than willing to take a shot on players who have had off-field troubles. Bryant, 32, has had plenty of that. But he has also shown some upside in his career. He could be a nice addition to add some depth to the wide receiver position and would come at a very low cost.\n\nBryant has 145 catches for 2,183 yards and 17 touchdowns over four NFL seasons with the Pittsburgh Steelers and Raiders. Before being signed by the Cowboys, Bryant served a five-year suspension for repeated violations of the league's substance abuse policy.\n\nBryant kept busy during his suspension. He played in several indoor football leagues, as well as the CFL and XFL.\n\nBryant won't come in and be a game-changer for the Browns. However, he's a veteran target who could be an interesting practice squad addition. His presence might also push younger wide receivers like David Bell, Cedric Tillman and Michael Woods II.\n\nThe Browns did some work this season to build up their receiver depth, trading for former first-round pick Jerry Jeudy. He joins Amari Cooper and Elijah Moore as key contributors in the passing game.\n\nJeudy was a first-round pick. The Broncos selected him No. 15 overall in 2020. He has notched 3,053 yards on 211 catches with 11 touchdowns in his career. His best year came in 2022 when he posted career highs with 67 catches for 972 yards and six touchdowns.\n\nThe Browns sent fifth- and sixth-round picks to the Denver Broncos for Jeudy. Cleveland moved quickly after that, inking Jeudy to a three-year extension that will pay him up to $58 million.\n\nCleveland also drafted Jamari Thrash in the fifth round of the draft. The Louisville product notched 63 receptions for 858 receiving yards (13.6 per) and 6 touchdowns last season.\n\nTrash can be a field stretcher for the Browns. He ran a 4.46-second 40-yard dash at the combine.\n\n\"He's a competitive kid. He's had production inside and out throughout his college career, and he's a good playmaker with the ball in his hands,\" Browns Director of Player Personnel Dan Saganey said. \"So, add him to the room and let him compete.\"\n\nDeshaun Watson will be back for the Browns next season after being limited to just six games last year due to injuries. Much of the offense will hinge on his performance, and the Browns are confident he's ready.\n\n\"We feel very good about the transition. He is in a good spot mentally and physically,\" Browns GM Andrew Berry said on The Pat McAfee Show on May 6. \"Obviously, he's been rehabbing the shoulder injury, but he is well on his way there and in a really strong spot. I think he's a lot more comfortable within the organization. You know, we have a core group of guys on offense that have now played together for a number of years.\n\n\"We do expect to hit the ground running on that side of the ball, and I know he is very excited about returning to the playing field and getting over this injury. We do have high expectations for him and the offense this season.\"", "source": {"uri": "heavy.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Heavy"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reception_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Reception (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martavis_Bryant", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Martavis Bryant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryant_University", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bryant University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Browns", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Browns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Broncos", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denver Broncos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Cowboys", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Cowboys"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_Network", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NFL Network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Steelers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Woods_II", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michael Woods II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elijah_Moore", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Elijah Moore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XFL_(2020)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "XFL (2020)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Jeudy", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jerry Jeudy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Practice_squad", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Practice squad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indoor_American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indoor American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amari_Cooper", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amari Cooper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deshaun_Watson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Deshaun Watson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_McAfee", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pat McAfee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/40-yard_dash", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "40-yard dash"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisville,_Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Louisville, Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisville, Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://heavy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1776640082-1-e1715250626752.jpg?quality=65&strip=all&w=780", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545648", "eventUri": "eng-9545648", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-09", "textStart": 274, "textEnd": 279}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-06", "textStart": 2875, "textEnd": 2880}], "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

The draft picks and other players under contract will join the team's formal offseason program next week. On May 21, Cleveland will hold its first of 10 organized team activity practices.\n\nRookie minicamp is mostly an orientation weekend with limited on-field activity. There's an occasional veteran who participates as a tryout player or via injury exemption, but it's mostly instructional and introductory. The Browns are trying to get their draft picks ready for the weeks and months ahead. With that in mind, we kick off rookie minicamp with a refresher and overview of the six draft picks and how each player best fits into the team's plans.\n\nThe Browns explored other possibilities with their first pick of this year's draft, but they always had Hall near the top of their list because of his athleticism and natural pass-rush ability. Cleveland will give Hall the full menu when it comes to learning the scheme and the responsibilities the team's defensive tackles have in it, but Hall's primary job is to rush the passer.\n\nThe Browns believe Hall's ceiling is high in large part because he has rare explosiveness, and they view him as an ideal fit for defensive coordinator Jim Schwartz's pressure scheme.\n\n\"I think when you look at how we play (that) position, how we ask our guys to get off the ball and how athletic and quick you need to be, that is what (Hall) is going to bring to the table,\" Browns assistant general manager Catherine Raiche said. \"(After the pick) Jim got on the phone with him and gave him a quiz and he was ready to roll. (Schwartz) told him he is about to be the engine of this defense, and I am not going to use the words they used, but let's just say 'mess things up' in the front there. I think that is what he is going to bring to the table.\"\n\nHall doesn't turn 21 until next month. He could add weight over the course of his rookie contract, and add to his individual resume. But if Hall plays as a rookie, it will be as part of the team's pass-down packages. Expect to see him working behind -- and learning from -- veterans Shelby Harris and Maurice Hurst this summer.\n\nZinter played in a lot of big games throughout his Michigan career, and the Browns were aware of him as a prospect before Zinter decided to return to school for his final season in 2023.\n\nZinter, who mostly played right guard in college, first will learn and focus on the team's guard spots. But he spent time early in his college career preparing to play center, and at some point this summer he's likely to work in that spot.\n\n\"Very rarely will we bring a lineman in and have him work at one spot,\" Browns general manager Andrew Berry said. \"Especially young players. We want them to have positional flexibility. Zak is incredibly smart and someone that we expect to be able to handle the load of (learning) multiple spots.\"\n\nThe Athletic's draft guru Dane Brugler wrote in his annual draft guide that Zinter \"won't impress with explosion or leverage, but he is big, smart and physical, which allows him to control defenders, especially in closed quarters.\"\n\nThe Browns are again at least somewhat revamping their offense and receiving corps. They're not counting on Thrash to be a superstar -- or even an immediate contributor -- but the folks in charge believe he can play inside, outside and on special teams. Thrash wasn't a returner in college, but he figures to be given chances both to cover and return kicks this summer.\n\nVersatility will be key to Thrash winning a role and a roster spot as a rookie, but the Browns believe he can stick because he can get open and he's comfortable lining up across the formation. Thrash led his college team in receiving three times, twice (2021-2022) at Georgia State and last season at Louisville.\n\n\"With Jamari, the thing that stands out to us is his ability to separate naturally,\" said Browns director of player personnel Dan Saganey. \"He's kind of proven that at two different (college) levels now, and then at the Senior Bowl as well.\"\n\nWho falls out of the wide receiver rotation if Thrash is ready to crack it? We'll be tracking that during the summer.\n\nA six-year college player, Watson led the SEC in tackles and tied for the lead in sacks last season. There are snaps to be won in the Browns' linebacker rotation, though Watson's most immediate path to action is via special teams.\n\nCleveland had long tracked Watson, both throughout his college career and in the run-up to the draft. On paper, Jordan Hicks and Jeremiah Owusu-Koramoah are the team's clear top-two linebackers. After that, the rotation seems unsettled.\n\n\"One of the things that we thought a lot about (with Watson) is when we lost Sione (Takitaki) in free agency this spring, was that when he (Takitaki) played both Mike (middle linebacker) and Sam (strong-side linebacker) it added a little bit more stoutness in the middle of the defense, particularly at the point of attack,\" Berry said. \"And we think that Nathaniel, he's got good range, he's incredibly smart and he has good instincts, but he provides maybe a little bit of a diverse profile in that linebacker room because he does have a little bit more strength and power at the point of attack. So we see him as a player that has the potential to maybe develop into that type of role as a Mike, Sam, flex and ultimately be someone who's a candidate to call the defense after he gets (comfortable).\"\n\nBrugler wrote that Watson was \"a tackling machine\" in college who had extensive experience on kickoff coverage.\n\nThe first FCS player drafted by Berry, Harden was an outside cornerback at South Dakota but probably best fits as a slot corner and special teams player in the NFL.\n\nThe Browns saw Harden at the East-West Shrine Bowl as well as in multiple big games over his final two college seasons, including a matchup last fall with Missouri's Luther Burden, a potential high first-round pick in 2025.\n\n\"Harden wasn't really a sleeper to most NFL teams,\" said Eric Galko, director of football operations for the Shrine Bowl. \"I think around the league there was a lot of surprise that he lasted until the seventh round. You'll see a lot of projections that he's best inside in the slot because he has shorter arms, but he's a smart, confident kid. He'll show up the first day in Cleveland like he belongs.\"\n\nThough Harden was a four-year starter at South Dakota, he suffered season-ending injuries in 2021 and 2022 and only played in 29 career games. Brugler wrote that Harden \"doesn't offer ideal length or long speed\" but is a \"quick, confident ... roughneck competitor\" who \"has the traits to earn a starting nickel job as a rookie.\" He'll be a long way from the top of the Browns' depth chart this month, but he's certainly one to track this summer.\n\nHe was on Bruce Feldman's Freaks List, an annual collection of college football's most athletic players. Briggs also had long been on NFL radars after a big 2022 season saw him earn first-team All-AAC honors.\n\nBriggs started his college career at Virginia before transferring back to Cincinnati, his hometown school, for his final three seasons. In Cleveland, Briggs will start out behind at least six other defensive tackles -- and the Browns started their draft with Hall. So they clearly wanted Briggs as part of their program when they selected him in the seventh round.\n\n\"Huge combine snub,\" Galko said. \"He's an upfield penetrator-type, which the Browns like, and he's really a good athlete for a man his size. I think he played a little out of position (in 2023), but he has the tools and athleticism to be a guy who makes a rotation.\n\n\"It's too early to say (the Browns) would be able to sneak a guy like Briggs through to the practice squad or whatever, but he's the kind of guy who's going to relish the chance to compete. He'll make the guys around him and the guys blocking him better in training camp because he's going to bring it every practice.\"", "source": {"uri": "theathletic.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

The biggest example of that is possibly offensive tackle Dawand Jones, a fourth-round selection in 2023 who found himself in the starting lineup in Week 2 and quickly proved he deserved his spot on the roster.\n\nRelated: This Michael Hall stat, along with film, should excite fans for 2024\n\nCleveland is hoping that scenario plays itself out again this year with defensive tackle Michael Hall Jr., who the club selected in the second round of this year's draft. Hall has talent but fell into day two of the draft as questions surfaced about his desire to consistently play at a high level.\n\nRelated: Get to know Michael Hall Jr.\n\nESPN's Jeremy Fowler took a look this week at the draft classes of the league's 32 teams to identify a rookie who may make a key impact on each team. After speaking with executives, scouts, and coaches, Fowler highlighted Jones' development as a reason to be optimistic about what Hall will bring to the Browns (story is paywalled):\n\nFair or not, multiple teams had similar concerns about Michael Hall Jr., the Browns' second-round pick, namely his ability to be a consistent pro. For example, Hall looked great pre-draft, more stout at around 298 pounds compared to playing in the 280s at Ohio State. After he ran in the 4.7s at his pro day, some teams wondered why he didn't contribute more at that size in college, where he started just 11 games. It played into the underachieving label.\n\n\"With Dawand Jones starting games in the NFL and being productive, Cleveland must be doing something right,\" an AFC scout said. \"Not sure what they are doing there, but if Dawand can do that, Mike Hall can, too. The talent is there, he'll just need a bit of help and guidance to become a pro.\"\n\nThe Browns take pride in their large, diverse staffs to support players. The coaching staff, for example, features 23 coaches along with a nine-member performance staff, including director of player development Carson Walch and player development coordinator Anthony Fabiano. This group is in place to help players transition, and the Browns hope the approach pays off again.\n\nPast performance is not always indicative of future results, but the Browns appear to be onto something in their approach to developing players and getting them ready for the field, with Hall and the rest of the 2024 draft class that next group of players who will be put to the test beginning on Friday during the three-day rookie minicamp in Berea.", "source": {"uri": "dawgsbynature.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Dawgs By Nature"}, "authors": [{"uri": "thomas_moore@dawgsbynature.com", "name": "Thomas Moore", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Hall_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mike Hall (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scout_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Scout (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dawand_Jones", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dawand Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Berry_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Berry (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(gridiron_football_position)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tackle (gridiron football position)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Stefanski", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Stefanski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Browns", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Browns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_tackle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Defensive tackle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starting_lineup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Starting lineup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Football_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American Football Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_State_Buckeyes_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ohio State Buckeyes football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sterling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pound sterling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berea,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Berea, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Berea, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Lacrosse", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Lacrosse", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Squash/Schools_and_Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Squash/Schools and Instruction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tcQ4FkndtGFmw0aqthAj8j7dNXY=/0x0:5760x2880/fit-in/1200x600/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25439133/1243779368.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545648", "eventUri": "eng-9545648", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.411764705882353, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

A sour taste was left in our mouths after the Texans beat up on an injured version of the group in the first round of the playoffs. Prior to that game, the unit put together historic showings week to week.\n\nThe best part is that heading into 2024, the Browns return a vast majority of their contributing players.\n\nThe Browns' secondary will look exactly the same with the combination of Denzel Ward, Greg Newsome and MJ Emerson at corner, while Grant Delpit, Ronnie Hickman and Juan Thornhill will align at safety.\n\nUp front it is that same story. Cleveland was able to bring back almost the entire defensive line that wrecked games in 2023. The resignings of Za'Darius Smith, Maurice Hurst and Shelby Harris to go along with Myles Garrett and second-round draft pick Mike Hall Jr. will be crucial.\n\nCleveland will look different at the second level of the defense as former Browns, Sione Takitaki and Anthony Walker Jr. both hit free agency and found opportunities better for themselves. Returning is future superstar Jeremiah Owusu-Koramoah and newly-acquired veterans Jordan Hicks and Devin Bush.\n\nSo where does this defense rank according to Bleacher Report? How about first place.\n\nFinally, the respect that the Cleveland Browns deserve. This defense was far and away the best in the NFL and it was largely thanks to the change in culture and philosophy brought by Jim Schwartz. Schwartz's entry to Cleveland unlocked a level of confidence that hasn't been seen in Cleveland in a long time.\n\nThe group has swagger, confidence and elite play-making ability. They also have the reigning Defensive Player of the Year from 2023.

The Haslams are in the process of purchasing the 176-acre property, where the structure could be built.\n\nThe section of law being executed by Cleveland city council is more formally know as Ohio Revised Code, Section 9.67, which states:\n\nNo owner of a professional sports team that uses a tax-supported facility for most of its home games and receives financial assistance from the state or a political subdivision thereof shall cease playing most of its home games at the facility and begin playing most of its home games elsewhere unless the owner either:\n\n(A) Enters into an agreement with the political subdivision permitting the team to play most of its home games elsewhere;\n\n(B) Gives the political subdivision in which the facility is located not less than six months' advance notice of the owner's intention to cease playing most of its home games at the facility and, during the six months after such notice, gives the political subdivision or any individual or group of individuals who reside in the area the opportunity to purchase the team.\n\nEssentially, the piece of legislatures prevents the Haslams from moving the Browns out of the \"tax-supported\" facility that is Cleveland Browns Stadium without six month notice of doing so, or else they must give other local groups a chance to purchase the the franchise. Despite the fact that the Haslams plan would simply move the team to the suburbs, Kazy and company believe the \"Art Modell Law\" still applies, even though it's introduction in 1996 was meant to prevent owners from following in Modell's footsteps and moving a local pro team to a different city entirely.\n\nThe Haslams have been adamant throughout these ongoing stadium negotiations that they intend to keep the team in Northeast Ohio and that it wouldn't begin playing games elsewhere until after the current lease on the building expires in 2028. They even suggested they would look to extend the lease if needed to give adequate time for a new facility to be completed.\n\nFor what its worth, the other stadium option consists of dumping more than $1 billion into the current structure to overhaul it, with the bill being split 50-50 between public and private funding. That project would not include adding a dome to the stadium, which is something the Haslams have seemed keen on bringing to the area.\n\nAccording to Signal Cleveland, Representatives from the Haslam Sports Group met with state lawmakers about the Brook Park proposal, a meeting that seems to have produced a recent rendering of the facility that's been shared on social media. While that project is projected to cost upwards of $2 billion the Haslams would seek state and potentially local funding to help split that bill as well.\n\nWhat To Expect From Looming Browns 2024 Schedule Reveal\n\nTop 5 Matchups On Browns 2024 Schedule, Before The NFL's Full Reveal This Month\n\nSeveral Players To Watch For At Browns Rookie Minicamp\n\nAndrew Berry Explains Motivations Behind Browns Trading For Jerry Jeudy\n\nA Way Too Early Projection Of The Browns Wide Receiver Room", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [{"uri": "spencer_german@si.com", "name": "Spencer German", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Bibb", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Justin Bibb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dee_Haslam", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dee Haslam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_Modell", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Art Modell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Hopkins_International_Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Hopkins International Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_the_District_of_Columbia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Council of the District of Columbia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_City_Council", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland City Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Local government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Browns_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Browns Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_Revised_Code", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ohio Revised Code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brook_Park,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brook Park, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brook Park, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Berry_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Berry (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Jeudy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jerry Jeudy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeast_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Northeast Ohio"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suburb", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Suburb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_League_Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minor League Baseball"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home", "label": "dmoz/Home", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Airsoft", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Airsoft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners", "label": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Stadiums", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Stadiums", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 47}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_6000,h_3375,x_0,y_0/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/si-temp/01hxa6d3z2w6fwsny6h4", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545648", "eventUri": "eng-9545648", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

Some believe they reached early, but there has been a lot of praise for their day three picks, where they found tremendous value relative to their draft position, including not having a fourth-round pick. However, could players like Siaki Ika and David Bell find their roster spot in jeopardy?\n\nWith rookie minicamp coming up this weekend (May 10th-12th), the newest Browns will begin fighting for roster spots. In turn, some players on the 53-man roster last year will be beaten out this year by draft picks and potentially UDFAs.\n\nThe defensive tackle room is full after the Browns added two draft picks to the group, including using their top pick on Ohio State's Michael Hall Jr., meaning they'll have to cut someone from last year's group.\n\nHere are the five players I think will most likely lose their job to a rookie at the end of training camp this summer.\n\n[affiliatewidget_smgtolocal] G Michael Dunn\n\nDec 3, 2023; Inglewood, California, USA; Cleveland Browns guard Michael Dunn (68) spikes the ball during the second half in a game against the Los Angeles Rams at SoFi Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Yannick Peterhans-USA TODAY Sports\n\nVeteran offensive guard Michael Dunn is likely the odd man out for the interior of the offensive line. The team drafted Zak Zinter in the second and signed Miami FL guard Javion Cohen as an undrafted free agent.\n\nCohen is a guy who could surprise some people and earn a roster spot; it was shocking that he didn't get drafted. Add in second-year player Luke Wypler, and that room is getting full. Dunn has been productive for the team when needed, but he will turn 30 this year, and the injuries are starting to add up for the veteran.\n\nLB Tony Fields II\n\n(Ken Blaze-USA TODAY Sports)\n\nFourth-year linebacker Tony Fields II has struggled to find his footing in the NFL after a rookie season marred by injury. Cleveland took him in the fifth round the same year as Jeremiah Owusu-Koramoah, and except for a few bright spots here and there, it hasn't paid off. However, it is worth noting that Fields played well on special teams under Bubba Ventrone in 2023.\n\nThough drafted even later than Fields, rookie Nathaniel Watson is a very intriguing player. When you lead the SEC in tackles and sacks as an off-ball linebacker, it means you must be doing something right. Watson brings a ton of production and experience to the position. With Fields struggling outside of special teams, his days are likely numbered in Cleveland.\n\nWR David Bell\n\nCLEVELAND, OHIO - DECEMBER 10: David Bell #18 of the Cleveland Browns runs for a touchdown during the fourth quarter against the Jacksonville Jaguars at Cleveland Browns Stadium on December 10, 2023 in Cleveland, Ohio. (Photo by Gregory Shamus/Getty Images)\n\nAndrew Berry and the Browns continue to take chances on wide receivers in the draft after adding Jamari Thrash in the fifth round this year. One is going to be left out in the cold and off the roster, and right now, it seems like it might be David Bell who could potentially find himself on the team's practice squad.\n\nFor me, trying to figure out which fringe guy misses the cut, it is the guy who is the least physically gifted. Cedric Tillman has size and physicality, while Jamari Thrash is a great separator and can create explosive plays by getting vertical, leaving David Bell fighting for a roster spot.\n\nDT Maurice Hurst II or Siaki Ika\n\nCANTON, OHIO - AUGUST 03: Siaki Ika #62 of the Cleveland Browns celebrates a third down stop during the second half of the 2023 Pro Hall of Fame Game against the New York Jets at Tom Benson Hall Of Fame Stadium on August 3, 2023 in Canton, Ohio. (Photo by Nick Cammett/Getty Images)\n\nIt was a big surprise when the Browns decided to take two defensive tackles in this year's draft with the current room they have already in place. In the end, one of the guys from last year won't be here this year, though there is a chance seventh-round pick Jowon Briggs ends up on the practice squad. Even then, it's a crowded room, so either Maurice Hurst II or last year's third-round pick Siaki Ika could be on their way out of town.\n\nIf I were picking, Ika would be the guy to cut. He was borderline unplayable last year when they were forced to play him, and his play style doesn't match what Jim Schwartz wants from the position. But we know that Andrew Berry doesn't like to give up on his draft picks so quickly, and with Hurst's injury history, that could mean he is the odd man out.\n\nOT James Hudson III\n\nNov 12, 2023; Baltimore, Maryland, USA; Cleveland Browns offensive tackle James Hudson III (66) celebrates a first down against the Baltimore Ravens during the second half at M&T Bank Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Jessica Rapfogel-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe James Hudson III experiment could be coming to an end, as he has struggled as a pass protector at both right and left tackle. Coming into the NFL, Hudson had changed from defensive tackle to offensive tackle in college and had just not played a ton of games at the position.\n\nHe was a raw developmental player with nice physical traits, but he might just be best served kicking inside to guard. Cleveland has added some veterans to take over as the swing tackle, and the Browns could take a swing on another developmental tackle in UDFA Jalen Sundell (who also played center) over keeping Hudson another year.", "source": {"uri": "brownswire.usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Browns Wire"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jacob_roach@brownswire.usatoday.com", "name": "Jacob Roach", "type":

The $1.2 billion in public funding for a new stadium, in turn, would be split evenly between state and local governments.\n\nCleveland.com/The Plain Dealer has reached out to a Browns spokesman for comment on Stephens' remarks and to see if the team still considers it possible to build its proposed new stadium without $600 million from the state.\n\nSeveral lawmakers who attended last month's meetings indicated to cleveland.com/The Plain Dealer that the proposal for $600 million in state funding wasn't a total nonstarter.\n\nHowever, they said, the meetings were intended for the Browns to make introductory presentations on their stadium plans and field general questions from lawmakers, not for team representatives to make a specific request for state funding.\n\n\"I think most every lawmaker there just wants to make sure that there's a good deal for taxpayers if we're using taxpayer dollars, and that it makes sense for taxpayers,\" state Rep. Bride Rose Sweeney, a Westlake Democrat who spearheaded the largest of the meetings with several Northeast Ohio state representatives, said at the time.\n\nOhio House Finance Committee Chair Jay Edwards, an Athens County Republican who talked with Browns representatives in a different meeting, previously said he thinks the team is looking for lawmakers to include state funding - whether it's for a new stadium or a renovation of its existing one - either in next year's two-year state operating budget or in a 2026 state capital budget.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether Stephens will still be House speaker when either of those two spending bills move forward, as term-limited Senate President Matt Huffman, a Lima Republican, is looking to take the speaker's gavel from Stephens next year.\n\nIf the Browns move ahead with the Brook Park stadium, they want to open it in time for the 2029 NFL season, a year after the lease on their current stadium ends, Edwards said he was told.\n\nEven if state lawmakers approve Browns stadium funding of some sort, any such appropriation would have to be signed into law by Gov. Mike DeWine.\n\nDeWine spokesman Dan Tierney previously said the governor is generally supportive in principle about providing state funding for stadium projects because they contribute to a better quality of life in Ohio and help lure in out-of-state businesses. The governor spoke about the Browns' stadium plans with team owners Jimmy and Dee Haslam, as well as NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, in Cleveland last December, prior to attending a game between the Browns and the Chicago Bears.\n\nBut Tierney said Tuesday that he wouldn't comment on whether the governor supports the idea of spending $600 million - or any amount of state money -- on a new Browns stadium until team and local government officials reach a final agreement on what each of them would contribute to the project.\n\n\"It's a bit premature to comment on any funding split, because we don't have a concrete plan,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "cleveland.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Cleveland"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

That trend carried over in 2024. Cleveland traded away three first-round picks to the Houston Texans for Deshaun Watson back in 2022. This year was the final year the Browns' first-rounder had to make way to Houston, so they will have all the resources available to them in the future. Though Cleveland lacked the premium capital at the top of the draft, that didn't stop them from making sound moves later on.\n\nDrafting Michael Hall\n\nCleveland's first pick was spent on Ohio State defensive tackle Michael Hall. It makes sense why the Browns would go that route. Last season, they ranked 15th in the NFL in EPA allowed per rush. It was the one blemish to an otherwise outstanding defensive unit a year ago. They led the league in EPA allowed per play and in EPA allowed per dropback, so it would make sense to shore up their run defense.\n\nIf that was their goal, then Hall should be able to help them there. Hall is a lane clogger at 6-foot-2 and 280 pounds. In addition to that, he is super athletic and very young. His RAS score from the testing results at the combine and his pro day was off the charts. That not only helps him out in the run game, but as a pass rusher as well. He posted one of the best pass rush win rates among this year's class of interior defensive linemen.\n\nSome have pointed out that Hall's consistency on tape wasn't always there. That's fair, but it is also important to point out that he is only 20 years old. He will turn 21 in June. And yet, there is already a ton to work with regarding Hall's game. His development will be key to monitor, but the strength of Cleveland's defensive front will help Hall immensely.\n\nDrafting Zak Zinter\n\nIt was a must for the Browns to add to their offensive line depth. Three of Cleveland's mainstays up front in Jedrick Wills, Jack Conlin, and Joel Bitonio all missed time last season due to injury. To help with that, the Browns snagged Michigan guard Zak Zinter in the third round. Zinter was stout for the National Champion Michigan Wolverines. He didn't allow a single sack a year ago on 287 pass block snaps according to PFF.\n\nBarring an injury, Zinter likely doesn't have a path to becoming a starter as a rookie. Bitonio is one of the best guards in the league on the left side and Wyatt Teller has held down the right guard spot for the Browns since 2019. It's never a bad idea to add depth, however, and Zinter can play well in a pinch if necessary.\n\nDrafting Jamari Thrash\n\nThe Browns have continuously looked to add to their wide receiver core. In 2022, Cleveland traded a fifth-round pick for Amari Cooper. Last year, they acquired Elijah Moore from the New York Jets for a swap from the second round to the third. This offseason, the Browns dealt a fifth-round pick to the Denver Broncos for Jerry Jeudy and a sixth. They've also spent a third-round pick on David Bell and Cedric Tillman in that time.\n\nThey love to take shots on receivers, and the Browns did the same in the fifth round with Louisville's Jamari Thrash. Thrash is an underrated player. He started at Georgia State before transferring to Louisville for his final season. He played well in his lone season at a Power conference school. Thrash put up 63 receptions for 858 yards and six touchdowns in 2023. He's a sleeper.\n\nThrash was one of the most efficient receivers in college football the last two seasons against single coverage. That could help him find a long-term role with the Browns. Cooper and Moore can both be free agents in 2025. Bell and Tillman have yet to distinguish themselves as difference-makers either.\n\nThere's a chance Thrash emerges from this group and becomes a starter in the future. That's all anybody can ask for from a fifth-round pick. Cleveland has to find some gems with the draft capital they've sent out over the last three years. Thrash could be one.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "shervon_fakhimi@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Shervon Fakhimi", "type":

Club spokesman Peter John-Baptiste tells the publication the territory will include a hotel, offices, retail stores, and new housing along with a rec center and youth sports fields.\n\n\"We've seen this trend in the NFL where facilities are being used as catalysts for development within their community,\" John-Baptiste said, adding the Browns would roughly double their footprint in Berea by adding more than 16 acres of land.\n\nAccording to McDonnell, the Browns have already bought up and demolished dozens of homes in the formerly residential neighborhood that suffered a decline from increased railroad traffic from nearby CSX and Norfolk Southern. The organization also wants to tear down the former Serpentini Collision Center on Front Street and pay for a new Mount Zion Baptist Church building roughly a mile away.\n\n\"From my perspective this would be transformative in whatever form it takes,\" Berea Mayor Cyril Kleem told Cleveland.com. \"We know it's the Browns. It's not going to be something we wouldn't be proud of.\"\n\nThe news out of Berea comes as the Browns continue negotiations for a potential new stadium in Brook Park, less than 10 minutes away from team headquarters. The club is seeking to either build a new stadium in the suburbs for around $2.4 billion or renovate the existing downtown Cleveland venue for $1 billion.\n\nUnlike the stadium projects, McDonnell says the Browns' Berea proposal would be paid for nearly entirely with private funds. The city will ask the state of Ohio for about $15 million for the public rec center and sports fields.\n\nJohn-Baptiste says the Browns hope to break ground on the project by the end of the year.

Author of my 11-year-old self's fantasy story about his road to FIFA World Cup glory. Perfecting the art of writing about people who do what I said I was going to do.\n\nThe Cleveland Browns, who in March were granted international marketing rights for the country through the NFL's Global Marketing program, made a practical choice in choosing Nigeria as their partner nation.\n\nThe Browns have cited the presence of Nigerian players in their team, and the large following they have in Lagos, as key reasons for their decision to prioritize the market.\n\nThey have already got to work on utilizing their opportunity to engage the market, with former Big Brother Naija contestant Ozo Chukwu announcing Jamari Thrash as the Browns' fifth round draft pick - the 156th overall - from Lagos.\n\n\"There were several reasons why Nigeria was our target market for expanding our rights outside of Ohio,\" Brent Rossi, the Browns' senior vice president of marketing and media, told ESPN.\n\n\"First, we wanted to identify a market that had an authentic connection with the Cleveland Browns. Nigeria made a ton of sense based on the various Browns players who have strong connections to the country, most notably, David Njoku, who is a chief in Nigeria.\n\n\"We also looked at our fanbase outside of our core market and found that Nigeria and Lagos, specifically, are top 5 markets for us when it comes to followers on our social media channels. We also wanted to be first to market and there were no other NFL teams who had rights to Nigeria.\n\n\"Last, just the sheer size of the market and Nigeria being the largest country in Africa and the 6th largest in the world, was a decisive factor.\"\n\nNjoku, a tight end who has been with the Browns since he was drafted in 2017, formally became a chief in March, in recognition of his humanitarian efforts, following in his father's footsteps.\n\nNigeria has dominated as far as representation from African countries in the NFL goes and he is far from the only star to come from the country. Rossi envisions Africa drawing interest from several teams looking to acquire similar marketing deals to the one the Browns have in Nigeria and the Philadelphia Eagles struck in Ghana in 2022.\n\nRossi added: \"I think as we see interest in the game of football develop and increase over the next several years within Africa, NFL teams will take notice and look to expand their brands into the continent.\n\n\"I think it's important for any team and brand to be first to market, which is why we're so excited about the opportunities we have to grow the game of football and our Cleveland Browns brand in Nigeria.\"\n\nNigerian players have contributed to the interest in the country by actively getting involved in community efforts in Africa. Several have participated in camps on the continent, including Nigeria's Ogbo Okoronkwo and Ghana's Jeremiah Owusu-Koramoah from the Browns.\n\nTwo-time Super Bowl champion Osi Umenyiora's Uprise program and the NFL camps in Africa have provided a clearer pathway for Nigerian players and those from elsewhere in Africa to reach the NFL International Player Pathway Program (IPPP) than existed before.\n\nThe Ejike Ugboaja Foundation and Educational Basketball, two programs that initially focused on basketball talent, began producing American football players. They have been major feeders into the NFL IPP Program. The Ejike Ugboaja Foundation maintains a partnership with the Uprise program, while Educational Basketball is independent.\n\nOutside of this, other business minds are applying their minds to ways to capitalize off the NFL's growth in Nigeria. On April 17, SWA Sports hosted the Sports as a Business Conference in Abuja for both in-person and virtual attendees from the industry.\n\n\"There's so much untapped potential and market opportunities for sports in Africa and many players are doing such a remarkable job with so little resources,\" said the Houston Texans' Folorunso Fatukasi, previously with the Jacksonville Jaguars, in a Q&A provided to ESPN by SWA.\n\n\"Investing in elite training facilities and infrastructure is vital to unleashing the full potential of the abundant local talent pool.\n\n\"Social media also serves as a powerful amplifier, bridging global communities. Leveraging platforms like X, TikTok, Snapchat, and Instagram etc to showcase competitive sporting events can attract global brand sponsorships and partnerships from various sectors.\"\n\nOn his own personal journey, Fatukasi, a virtual attendee at the conference, said: \"Both of my parents hail from Yoruba land, and the bedrock of my cultural heritage has greatly contributed to shaping my path. The values instilled by my parents have been instrumental in propelling me towards my goals.\n\n\"They have consistently emphasized the importance of hard work and diligence, teaching my brothers and me that achieving our ambitions - whether it's being a doctor, lawyer or pro athlete - requires unwavering effort.\n\n\"The sense of honor that comes from pursuing a goal and ultimately attaining it is a principle deeply ingrained in me. I carry with me the weight of this honor and responsibility and my cultural roots serve as a guiding force throughout my journey.\"\n\nMeanwhile, as per his own SWA Q&A, Washington Commanders defensive end Efe Obada said that his ultimate goal is to help bring NFL games and facilities to Africa.\n\n\"A lot of it comes down to investing...time, energy and resources. Osi runs annual grassroots programs through The Uprise for talent scouting across the continent, the Browns just announced their international marketing rights for Nigeria, joining the Eagles who have the rights in Ghana via the NFL's Global Markets Program,\" Obada said in a quote provided to ESPN.\n\n\"Every year, more players and teams are holding youth and talent camps in their countries of origin on the continent. NFL Africa has invested in community and fan programming in Ghana, Kenya and South Africa across the last two years, which is only expanding in coming years.\n\n\"I think also providing a pathway for potential coaches coming from Africa will further help to flesh out the development of the sport. Long term, my hope is that we are playing games and have facilities on the ground.\"\n\nAs far as positioning themselves within the Nigerian market goes, the Browns have made a major step.\n\n\"The Cleveland Browns are uniquely positioned to seize growing opportunities within the Nigerian market as the first NFL team in Africa to build a passionate fanbase,\" said SWA Sports advisor Udochi Igbokwe.\n\n\"By spearheading commercialization efforts, the Browns can increase interest and participation in American football, creating a domino effect that can foster a thriving economic ecosystem into the region - job creation and local talent development.\"\n\nWhile remaining coy on dates for their plans, Rossi said: \"We're going to have a presence in the market that will start this summer. We're still developing our timelines, but we're looking to hold football camps in Nigeria, fan fest events, while also engaging with members of the community in a meaningful and impactful way.\"",

Since Joel Bitonio came to town, he has locked that position down and could eventually find himself in Canton if his great play continues for a few more seasons.\n\nPFF has released their most valuable offensive line since 2021, and it was no surprise to see Bitonio as the best left guard during that period. Bitonio is a six-time Pro Bowler and a two-time first-team All-Pro player.\n\nHe has battled some injuries the last couple of years, but his play hasn't suffered much as he guts it out week in and week out. The Browns will begin looking for his replacement at some point, and whoever ends up being there should get the chance to learn behind him before he rides off into the sunset. Browns fans have watched one of the best left tackles and left guards over the past decade; hopefully, everyone appreciates that.

The Browns did not have a first-round pick. But they are going to see plenty of them this season.\n\nWe know which teams the Browns are playing, so we know which of the top rookies they will have to try and face this season.\n\nThey will only have to see one of the top quarterbacks from this draft as a rookie, but there are other players they'll have to watch out for this season. Here are three top rookies on the Browns schedule outside of the AFC North.\n\nThe No. 2 pick of this draft and last year's Heisman Trophy winner, Daniels is the face of the Commanders rebuild as they try to close the gap on the Cowboys and Eagles. Daniels has a game reminiscent of Lamar Jackson. He may not be quite as special a runner as Jackson was coming out of Louisville, but he is a better passer now than Jackson was in college.\n\nIt won't be a surprise if Daniels is the Day 1 starter for the Commanders going forward. What will help him as he goes through the rigors of his first NFL season are some good skill players to work with including receiver Terry McLaurin and running back Brian Robinson Jr.\n\nWhile he may not have been my No. 2 quarterback behind top overall pick Caleb Williams, Daniels is still very electric and has all the tools to give opposing defenses fits.\n\nEven if there are questions about whether Daniel Jones is the long-term answer for the Giants at quarterback, there's no question he now has a No. 1 receiver in Nabers.\n\nThe LSU star was considered by some as the best receiver in this draft class ahead of Marvin Harrison Jr., who went fourth to the Cardinals. It's easy to understand why because there isn't much Nabers can't do on the field. He can win in any level down the field and has high-end speed combined with great ability in contested catches.\n\nNabers gives the Giants a legitimate receiver that any defense will have to account for on every snap, including the Browns.\n\nOffense is going 3-for-3 here in large part because this was an offense-heavy draft at the top. The Browns will see Brock Bowers, Brian Thomas Jr. and Ladd McConkey among other offensive players to watch.\n\nBut I'm spotlighting Worthy because he couldn't have gone to a better place to maximize his world-class speed. He set the 40-yard dash record at the NFL combine (4.21 seconds), and now he gets to catch passes from Patrick Mahomes.\n\nThe Chiefs are hard enough to stop already. But if Mahomes can get the most out of Worthy, who has the speed to make plays underneath as well as down the field, he could be one of the most impactful rookie receivers in this year's class.", "source": {"uri": "cleveland.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Cleveland"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFC_North", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "AFC North"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heisman_Trophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Heisman Trophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson,_Mississippi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Robinson_Jr.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brian Robinson Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_McLaurin", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Terry McLaurin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Jones_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Daniel Jones (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Eagles", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia Eagles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamar_Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lamar Jackson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisville,_Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Louisville, Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisville, Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvin_Harrison_Jr.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marvin Harrison Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ladd_McConkey", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ladd McConkey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brock_Bowers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brock Bowers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Mahomes", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Mahomes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_Scouting_Combine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NFL Scouting Combine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LSU_Tigers_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LSU Tigers football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_Cardinals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arizona Cardinals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Chiefs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Chiefs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/40-yard_dash", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "40-yard dash"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://www.cleveland.com/resizer/v2/SPJVTDJXEZDIDLLXZFU7E6VDDU.jpg?auth=21a69a05af553c75704ab43a2b1923f67dd3d6d2d6cb7de452c2912e0b894a36&width=1280&quality=90", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545648", "eventUri": "eng-9545648", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 130, "relevance": 1}

If Browns tight end David Njoku get his way, Cleveland slander will be eradicated from this earth one day.\n\nSpeaking publicly at an event aimed at promoting his upcoming Celebrity Softball Game on June 8, Njoku explained why he's so quick to defend the city he was drafted to.\n\n\"Cleveland raised me from a boy to a man,\" Njoku said. \"I got drafted at 20 years old, that was 7-8 years ago, I turn 28 in July. Becoming a man in this city it means more than what most may think.\"\n\nThe comments come after Njoku was captured just last week answering questions with Dave Richard of CBS Sports, and when Richard took an unnecessary shot at the Browns, Njoku shut it down.\n\nThat wasn't the first time this offseason that Njoku was quick to put an end to some Cleveland slander. At the Pro Bowl in Orlando back in February, Cowboys pass rusher Micah Parsons fired off a few shots at Cleveland while playing Njoku in Madden and the Browns tight end was quick to fire back.\n\n\"'Cleveland is Cleveland' but we're both here,\" Njoku said at the time.\n\nIt hasn't always been warm and fuzzy between Njoku and the Browns organization. Upon head coach Kevin Stefanski being hired in 2020, Njoku actually requested a trade out of Cleveland prior to training camp that year. It's an experience the Miami product has opened up about in recent years, sharing that he and Stefanski butted heads initially.\n\nNjoku wound up taking his trade request off the table and eventually wound up earning an extension in 2022, making him one of the highest paid tight ends in football. His 180 spin on the city he now calls home has gone a long way with fans who universally embrace the professional athletes who embrace them.\n\n\"With Parsons and that other idiot (Dave Richard), talking down on Cleveland is something I won't accept,\" Njoku said. \"No matter what happens I will never accept it. With that being said, respect the city bro. It's very simple. It's a very small thing.\"\n\nWhere Did Browns QB Deshaun Watson Show Up On Latest NFL QB Ranking?\n\nKevin Stefanski Confident In This Browns RB While Team Waits For Nick Chubb\n\nCleveland City Council Enacts \"Art Modell Law\" As Browns Continue Mulling Future Stadium Options\n\nWhat To Expect From Looming Browns 2024 Schedule Reveal\n\nTop 5 Matchups On Browns 2024 Schedule, Before The NFL's Full Reveal This Month", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Njoku", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "David Njoku"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "CBS Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlando,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Orlando, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Orlando, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Football_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American Football Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeast_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Northeast Ohio"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Browns", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Browns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Softball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micah_Parsons", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Micah Parsons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Stefanski", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Stefanski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madden_NFL", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Madden NFL"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pro Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Chubb", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nick Chubb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deshaun_Watson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Deshaun Watson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_Modell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Art Modell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_City_Council", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland City Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Anomalies_and_Alternative_Science/Earth_Lights", "label": "dmoz/Science/Anomalies and Alternative Science/Earth Lights", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_2951,h_1659,x_0,y_52/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/browns_digest/01hxdhfm06y2j2bhkkqk.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545648", "eventUri": "eng-9545648", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-08", "textStart": 432, "textEnd": 438}], "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 128, "relevance": 1}

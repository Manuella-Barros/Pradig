Doha airport \"to bring all Qatari pilgrims on his expenses\".\n\nRIYADH: Saudi Arabia's King Salman has ordered that the border with Qatar be reopened to allow pilgrims to carry out their annual haj pilgrimage to Mecca, official state media said Thursday.\n\nThe decision represents the first step forward since a diplomatic crisis began when Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates severed diplomatic and trade ties with Qatar on June 5.\n\nThe border decision came after the kingdom's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman received an envoy from Doha, according to a statement from the Saudi News Agency.\n\nThe king has ordered that Qatari pilgrims be allowed \"to enter Saudi Arabia through the border crossing to do the pilgrimage,\" it said.\n\nHe even ordered that private jets belonging to Saudi airlines be sent to Doha airport \"to bring all Qatari pilgrims on his expenses\".\n\nThe crown prince emphasised the \"historical relations between Saudi and Qatari people, and between the Saudi leadership and the royal family in Qatar\", the statement added.\n\nQatari authorities last month accused Saudi Arabia of jeopardising the pilgrimage to Mecca by refusing to guarantee their pilgrims' safety.\n\nSaudi Arabia and its Arab allies shut down air, maritime and land links with Qatar, and imposed economic sanctions, accusing Doha of supporting \"terrorists\" and of being too close to Iran.\n\nQatar denies the charges and has accused its Gulf neighbours of seeking to strangle its economy.\n\nThe tiny emirate with a population of 2.6 million, 80% of them foreigners, ranks as the world's richest on a per-capita basis, according to the International Monetary Fund.\n\nIt holds a staggering $330 billion in a sovereign wealth fund, with assets heavily

reopened to allow pilgrims to carry out their annual hajj pilgrimage to Mecca, official state media said on Thursday.\n\nThe decision represents the first step forward since a diplomatic crisis began when Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates severed diplomatic and trade ties with Qatar on June 5.\n\nThe border decision came after the kingdom's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman received an envoy from Doha, according to a statement from the Saudi News Agency.\n\nThe King has ordered that Qatari pilgrims be allowed \"to enter Saudi Arabia through the border crossing to do the pilgrimage,\" it said.\n\nHe even ordered that private jets belonging to Saudi airlines be sent to Doha airport \"to bring all Qatari pilgrims on his expenses\".\n\nThe Crown Prince emphasised the \"historical relations between Saudi and Qatari people, and between the Saudi leadership and the royal family in Qatar\", the statement added.\n\nQatari authorities last month accused Saudi Arabia of jeopardising the pilgrimage to Mecca by refusing to guarantee their pilgrims' safety.\n\nSaudi Arabia and its Arab allies shut down air, maritime and land links with Qatar, and imposed economic sanctions, accusing Doha of supporting \"terrorists\" and of being too close to Iran.\n\nQatar denies the charges and has accused its Gulf neighbours of seeking to strangle its economy.\n\nThe tiny emirate with a population of 2.6 million, 80 per cent of them foreigners, ranks as the world's richest on a per-capita basis, according to the International Monetary Fund.\n\nIt holds a staggering $330 billion in a sovereign wealth fund, with assets heavily invested abroad. -- AFP", "dateTime": "2017-08-17T04:33:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 384, "textStart": 378, "date": "-06-05",

The Salwa border crossing, a key passage for Muslims on the annual hajj pilgrimage, has been closed since June in a major crisis that saw Riyadh and its regional allies cut relations with Doha over allegations that the emirate supported Islamist extremists.\n\nQatar has denied the charge and in turn accused Riyadh of politicizing the hajj by restricting its citizens from making the pilgrimage to Makkah, the holiest site in Islam that is located in western Saudi Arabia. Around 120 Qataris entered Saudi territory yesterday through the Salwa border, also known as Abu Samrah, Saudi state television reported, after King Salman called for the border to be opened for pilgrims without electronic permits. He also ordered that private jets belonging to Saudi airlines be sent to Doha airport \"to bring all Qatari pilgrims at his expense\", state news agency SPA announced.\n\nQatar welcomed the decision but also lashed out at what it called Riyadh's politicization of religious freedoms. \"Regardless of the manner in which pilgrims from Qatar were banned from the pilgrimage, which was politically motivated... the government of Qatar welcomes the decision and will respond positively,\" Qatari Foreign Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani told reporters on a visit to Stockholm. \"What matters to us is the bottom line, which is that our citizens now have a way to attend the hajj, and we uphold our demand that hajj be spared politicization.\"\n\nThe hajj, a pillar of Islam that capable Muslims must perform at least once, is to take place this year at the start of September and it is expected to draw around two million Muslims from around the world.\n\n'Right to pilgrimage'\n\nOn June 5, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates severed diplomatic and trade ties with Qatar in what has emerged as the worst political crisis to grip the region in decades. The kingdom's decision to reopen the frontier came shortly after its powerful Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman met Qatari envoy Sheikh Abdullah bin Ali bin Abdullah bin Jassim Al-Thani, a member of Qatar's ruling dynasty.\n\nThe meeting on Wednesday in the Saudi Red Sea city of Jeddah was the first public high-level encounter between the nations since the crisis erupted more than two months ago. The Qatari foreign minister, however, said that Sheikh Abdullah had acted on a \"personal initiative\" and not on behalf of the Doha government. The decision also came after SPA reported that Prince Mohammed had received a phone call from US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who has sought repeatedly to defuse the regional crisis.\n\nSheikh Abdullah, who's lived previously for some years in Saudi Arabia and has gone back on private visits, has no role in government and his last position was as head of the equestrian and camel racing federation in the 1970s and 1980s, said Gerd Nonneman, a professor of International Relations and Gulf Studies at Georgetown University in Qatar. Sheikh Abdullah's grandfather, father and brother were rulers of Qatar until a palace coup ousted his branch of the royal family in 1972.\n\n\"He's certainly not an envoy of the Qatari government. This was not a deal that was struck,\" Nonneman said, describing it as a Saudi \"propaganda ploy\" to catch the Qatari government off-guard. He said Saudi outreach to various individuals within Qatar's large royal family causes discomfort and \"needles the Qatari leadership\". Sheikh Abdullah was quoted as telling the Saudi prince that the ties between the two countries \"are brotherly relations rooted in history.\" Saudi Arabia's crown prince responded in kind, emphasizing the historical ties between the two royal families, according to the Saudi Press Agency.\n\nCautious\n\nQatar's National Human Rights Committee issued a brief statement yesterday responding to what it said were \"reports in Saudi media\" outlining the kingdom's measures for Qatari pilgrims. The committee expressed its \"satisfaction\" with the decisions, but reiterated its demands that the hajj not be politicized and said the Saudi measures remain \"unclear\", particularly regarding the facilitation of hajj for foreigners residing in Qatar. The statement noted that the agreement does not include allowing Qatar Airways flights carrying pilgrims. The statement also called \"for further measures to lift the siege entirely on citizens and residents of Qatar.\"\n\nAnalysts cautioned yesterday that the dispute was far from over. \"This is a goodwill gesture towards the Qatari people and not a breakthrough with the Qatari\" government, Ali Shihabi of Washington-based think-tank Arabia Foundation said on Twitter, referring to the border reopening.\n\nThe decision also drew strong comments on social media, with many Qataris reacting critically. \"We do not need the (Saudi) king's charity. The Qatari right to pilgrimage is not given as charity from the king,\" one Qatari wrote on Twitter. Some Qataris said that even with permission to enter Saudi Arabia they would be concerned for their safety. \"I think it is very risky to go to Makkah this year, there could be hate crimes against Qataris,\" said Fatima Al-Mohannadi, a Qatari student.\n\nA tiny gas-rich emirate with a population of 2.6 million, 80 percent of them foreigners, Qatar ranks as the world's richest country on a per capita basis, according to the International Monetary Fund. - Agencies", "dateTime": "2017-08-17T18:16:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 1891, "textStart": 1885, "date": "-06-05", "amb": false}],

border with Qatar to facilitate the annual Haj pilgrimage, state media said on Thursday, in the first signs of a thaw after the region's worst diplomatic crisis in years.\n\nThe Salwa border crossing had been shut after regional kingpin Saudi Arabia as well as Egypt, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates severed diplomatic and trade ties with Qatar on June 5, accusing the emirate of fostering Islamist extremist groups.\n\nThe announcement to reopen the border for Qatari pilgrims came after Saudi Arabia's powerful Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman received an envoy from Doha, according to the official Saudi Press Agency, in the first public high-level encounter between the nations after the crisis erupted.\n\nThe king has permitted \"the entry of Qatari pilgrims to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia through Salwa border crossing to perform Haj, and to allow all Qatari nationals who wish to enter for Haj without electronic permits\", a statement on SPA said.\n\nHe also ordered that private jets belonging to Saudi Arabian Airlines be sent to Doha airport \"to bring all Qatari pilgrims on his expenses\".\n\nThe crown prince emphasised the \"historical relations between Saudi and Qatari people\" after his meeting with Qatari Sheikh Abdullah bin Ali bin Abdullah bin Jassim al-Thani, the statement added.\n\nLast month, Saudi Arabia had said that Qataris wanting to perform this year's Haj would be allowed to enter the kingdom, but imposed certain restrictions including that those arriving by plane must use airlines in agreement with Riyadh.\n\nQatari authorities had subsequently accused Saudi Arabia of politicising Haj and jeopardising the pilgrimage to Mecca by refusing to guarantee their pilgrims' safety.\n\nSome observers cautioned that the diplomatic crisis was far from

The decision represents the first step forward since a diplomatic crisis began when Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates severed diplomatic and trade ties with Qatar on June 5.\n\nThe border decision came after the kingdom's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman received an envoy from Doha, according to a statement from the Saudi News Agency. The king has ordered that Qatari pilgrims be allowed \"to enter Saudi Arabia through the border crossing to do the pilgrimage,\" it said. He even ordered that private jets belonging to Saudi airlines be sent to Doha airport \"to bring all Qatari pilgrims on his expenses\".\n\nThe crown prince emphasised the \"historical relations between Saudi and Qatari people, and between the Saudi leadership and the royal family in Qatar\", the statement added.\n\nQatari authorities last month accused Saudi Arabia of jeopardising the pilgrimage to Mecca by refusing to guarantee their pilgrims' safety. Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies shut down air, maritime and land links with Qatar, and imposed economic sanctions, accusing Doha of supporting \"terrorists\" and of being too close to Iran.\n\nQatar denies the charges and has accused its Gulf neighbours of seeking to strangle its economy.

Saudi-owned al-Arabiya television and state television reported that 50 Qatari pilgrims had entered Saudi territory on Thursday through the Salwa crossing, which was opened for the first time since the four-nation boycott of Qatar began.\n\nThe pilgrims entered as guests of the Saudi king, al-Arabiya said. There was no immediate confirmation of the report by border officials on the Qatari side of the frontier.\n\n\"Despite the fact it's been politically motivated to ban the Qatari people from hajj and politically motivated that they allow them [in]..., we welcome such a step, which is a step forward to get rid of this blockade that is imposed against my country,\" Sheikh Mohammed told a news conference on a visit to Sweden.\n\nHe did not elaborate on what he meant by \"politically motivated.\"\n\nSaudi Arabia had already said Qatari pilgrims would not be affected by the travel restrictions, but some Qataris have said they faced difficulties organizing the trip.\n\nQatari pilgrims can cross the frontier without the permits usually needed to be obtained in advance for the hajj, SPA said. The Saudi king has ordered the dispatch of a Saudi Airlines plane to fly Qatari pilgrims to Jeddah at his own expense, SPA added. Qatari pilgrims would also be able to pass through two of the kingdom's airports, it added.\n\nBetween two million and three million Muslims from around the world travel to Mecca, Islam's holiest city, for the pilgrimage each year. Every able-bodied Muslim is supposed to undertake it at least once in their lifetime.\n\nQatar had accused Saudi Arabia of politicizing the pilgrimage and complained to the UN Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion last month.\n\nIt was not clear how far the opening of the border to pilgrims would go to help heal the rift, the worst involving U.S-allied Gulf Arab countries for years.\n\nA Qatari government spokesman said Qatari Sheikh Abdullah bin Ali bin Abdullah bin Jassim al-Thani had held talks with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman before the announcement was made, though he did not have a post in the Qatari government.\n\nSheikh Mohammed, the foreign minister, said the ruling family member had been there on a personal basis. A Qatari semi-government rights body gave a cautious welcome to the Saudi move.\n\n\"This is a step toward removing the obstacles and difficulties [Qataris] faced during hajj procedures this year,\" the National Human Rights Committee said in a statement.\n\nSome Qataris said that even with permission to enter Saudi Arabia they would be concerned for their safety.\n\n\"I think it is very risky to go to Mecca this yearp; there could be hate crimes against Qataris,\" said Fatima al-Mohannadi, a Qatari student.", "dateTime": "2017-08-17T14:04:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim":

Qatar did not officially comment on the deal until its foreign minister was pressed Thursday by reporters during a briefing in Sweden, about 12 hours later.\n\nForeign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani said he welcomed the Saudi decision but that the measures also must include a full lifting of the blockade.\n\nThe way in which the deal was reached and announced out of Saudi Arabia raised questions about the level of the Qatari government's involvement.\n\nQatari officials did not immediately respond to an Associated Press request for comment.\n\nThe official Saudi Press Agency reported that Qatari pilgrims will be allowed to enter the kingdom by land and would then be flown onward from two Saudi airports in Dammam and al-Ahsa at the king's expense.\n\nThe king also ordered that aircraft from the country's flagship carrier be dispatched to Qatar's capital, Doha, to fly Qatari pilgrims to the Red Sea city of Jiddah -- nearest to Mecca -- and to host them at his expense for the hajj.\n\nSaudi state TV said 100 Qataris had arrived at the border crossing Thursday.\n\nThe decision came after Prince Mohammed met with Qatari royal family member Sheikh Abdullah Al Thani late Wednesday at a palace in Jiddah.\n\nImages broadcast on Saudi media outlets showed the two men seated and smiling for cameras.\n\nAbdullah, who has lived previously for some years in Saudi Arabia and has gone back on private visits, has no role in government and his last position was as head of the equestrian and camel racing federation in the 1970s and 1980s, said Gerd Nonneman, a professor of International Relations and Gulf Studies at Georgetown University in Qatar.\n\nAbdullah's grandfather, father and brother were rulers of Qatar until a palace coup ousted his branch of the royal family in 1972.\n\n\"He's certainly not an envoy of the Qatari government.\n\nThis was not a deal that was struck,\" Nonneman said, describing it as a Saudi \"propaganda ploy\" to catch the Qatari government off-guard.\n\nHe said Saudi outreach to various individuals within Qatar's large royal family causes discomfort and \"needles the Qatari leadership.\"\n\nAbdullah was quoted as telling the Saudi prince that the ties between the two countries \"are brotherly relations rooted in history.\" Saudi Arabia's crown prince responded in kind, emphasizing the historical ties between the two royal families, according to the Saudi Press Agency.\n\nThe meeting in Jiddah was the first by a Qatari royal in Saudi Arabia since a political standoff began 10 weeks ago when the kingdom, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt severed ties with Qatar.\n\nThe quartet also halted direct flights, expelled Qatari residents and the three Persian Gulf countries ordered their citizens in Qatar to leave.\n\nSaudi Arabia sealed Qatar's only land border.\n\nMixed-nationality families in the Persian Gulf were affected by the measures, and Qatari students in the Gulf countries were pulled out of final exams.\n\nThe crisis also has strained traditional kinships in the region.\n\nQatar's National Human Rights Committee issued a brief statement Thursday responding to what it said were \"reports in Saudi media\" outlining the kingdom's measures for Qatari pilgrims.\n\nThe committee expressed its \"satisfaction\" with the decisions, but reiterated its demands that the hajj not be politicized and said the Saudi measures remain \"unclear,\" particularly regarding the facilitation of hajj for foreigners residing in Qatar.\n\nThe statement noted that the agreement does not include allowing Qatar Airways flights carrying pilgrims.\n\nThe statement also called \"for further measures to lift the siege entirely on citizens and residents of Qatar.\"\n\nHundreds of thousands of pilgrims from around the world have already arrived in Saudi Arabia for the hajj, which begins late next week.\n\nSaudi Arabia prides itself on hosting millions of pilgrims annually at Islam's holiest sites in Mecca and Medina.\n\nInformation for this article was contributed by Adam Schreck, Jon Gambrell and Jan M.

The Qatari right to pilgrimage is not given as charity from the king,\" one Qatari wrote on Twitter.\n\nREAD: Arab states vow to maintain boycotts on Qatar\n\nSaudi Arabia and its Arab allies have shut down air, maritime and land links with Qatar, and imposed economic sanctions, accusing Doha of supporting \"terrorists\" and of being too close to their regional nemesis Iran.\n\nQatar has denied the allegations and denounced what it called a \"blockade\" aimed at bringing the wealthy emirate to its knees.\n\nThe tiny emirate with a population of 2.6 million, 80 percent of them foreigners, ranks as the world's richest country on a per capita basis, according to the International Monetary Fund.\n\nIt holds a staggering $330-billion (R4.3-trillion) in a sovereign wealth fund, with assets heavily invested abroad.\n\nThe hajj, a pillar of Islam that capable Muslims must perform at least once in a lifetime, is to take place at the beginning of September.\n\nThe pilgrimage is expected to draw around two million people this year.", "dateTime": "2017-08-17T10:52:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 374, "textStart": 368, "date": "-06-05", "amb": false}], "sim": 0.8549019694328308,

Qatar did not officially comment on the deal until its foreign minister was pressed on Thursday by reporters during a briefing in Sweden, some 12 hours later.\n\nForeign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani said he welcomed the Saudi decision, but that the measures must also include a full lifting of the blockade.\n\nThe way in which the deal was reached and announced out of Saudi Arabia raised questions about the level of the Qatari government's involvement. Qatari officials did not immediately respond to an Associated Press request for comment.\n\nThe official Saudi Press Agency reported that Qatari pilgrims will be allowed to enter the kingdom by land and would then be flown onward from two Saudi airports in Dammam and al-Ahsa at the king's expense. The king also ordered that aircraft from the country's flagship carrier be dispatched to Qatar's capital, Doha, to fly Qatari pilgrims to the Red Sea city of Jiddah -- nearest to Mecca -- and to host them at his expense for the hajj.\n\nSaudi state TV said 100 Qataris had arrived at the border crossing on Thursday.\n\nThe decision came after Prince Mohammed met with Qatari royal family member Sheikh Abdullah Al Thani late Wednesday at a palace in Jiddah. Images broadcast on Saudi media showed the two men seated and smiling for cameras.\n\nSheikh Abdullah, who's lived previously for some years in Saudi Arabia and has gone back on private visits, has no role in government and his last position was as head of the equestrian and camel racing federation in the 1970s and 1980s, said Gerd Nonneman, a professor of International Relations and Gulf Studies at Georgetown University in Qatar.\n\nSheikh Abdullah's grandfather, father and brother were rulers of Qatar until a palace coup ousted his branch of the royal family in 1972.\n\n\"He's certainly not an envoy of the Qatari government. This was not a deal that was struck,\" Nonneman said, describing it as a Saudi \"propaganda ploy\" to catch the Qatari government off-guard.\n\nHe said Saudi outreach to various individuals within Qatar's large royal family causes discomfort and \"needles the Qatari leadership.\"\n\nSheikh Abdullah was quoted as telling the Saudi prince that the ties between the two countries \"are brotherly relations rooted in history.\" Saudi Arabia's crown prince responded in kind, emphasizing the historical ties between the two royal families, according to the Saudi Press Agency.\n\nThe meeting in Jiddah was the first by a Qatari royal in Saudi Arabia since a political standoff erupted 10 weeks ago when the kingdom, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt severed ties with Qatar. The quartet also halted direct flights, expelled Qatari residents; and the three Gulf countries ordered their citizens in Qatar to leave. Saudi Arabia sealed Qatar's only land border.\n\nMixed-nationality families in the Gulf were affected by the measures, and Qatari students in the Gulf countries were pulled out of final exams. The crisis has also strained traditional kinships in the region.\n\nQatar's National Human Rights Committee issued a brief statement Thursday responding to what it said were \"reports in Saudi media\" outlining the kingdom's measures for Qatari pilgrims.\n\nThe committee expressed its \"satisfaction\" with the decisions, but reiterated its demands that the hajj not be politicized and said the Saudi measures remain \"unclear,\" particularly regarding the facilitation of hajj for foreigners residing in Qatar. The statement noted that the agreement does not include allowing Qatar Airways flights carrying pilgrims.\n\nThe statement also called \"for further measures to lift the siege entirely on citizens and residents of Qatar.\"\n\nHundreds of thousands of pilgrims from around the world have already arrived in Saudi Arabia for the hajj, which begins late next week. Saudi Arabia prides itself on hosting millions of pilgrims annually at Islam's holiest sites in Mecca and Medina.\n\nQatar's human rights committee had previously filed a complaint with the U.N. special rapporteur on freedom of belief and religion over restrictions placed on its nationals who wanted to attend the hajj this year. Saudi Arabia's Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir said Qatar's complaint amounted to a \"declaration of war\" against the kingdom's management of the holy sites.\n\nDespite the goodwill measure announced Thursday, tensions remain. The quartet accuses the small Gulf nation of supporting extremists. Qatar denies the allegation and says the charges are politically motivated.\n\nBahrain on Wednesday said it was investigating an alleged telephone call between Qatar's prime minister and Ali Salman, a Bahraini Shiite opposition leader who is serving a nine-year prison sentence for his role in the country's 2011 protests. Bahrain's public prosecutor said the alleged call centered on how to \"exacerbate (tensions) and undermine Bahrain's interests and stability.\"", "dateTime": "2017-08-17T21:27:00Z", "extractedDates":

The Qatari right to pilgrimage is not given as charity from the king,\" one Qatari wrote on Twitter.\n\n\"He (King Salman) didn't invite them to his own house. And every Muslim has the right to go to hajj,\" wrote another Twitter user.\n\nA tiny gas-rich emirate with a population of 2.6 million, 80 percent of them foreigners, Qatar ranks as the world's

with Qatar to Muslim pilgrims, a move which Doha said was welcome but too little to heal relations between the feuding Gulf neighbours.\n\nThe Salwa border crossing, also known as Abu Samrah, a key passage for Muslims on the annual hajj pilgrimage to Makkah, has been closed since June in a diplomatic crisis that saw Riyadh cut ties with Doha over accusations the emirate supported Islamist extremists.\n\nQatar has denied the allegation and in turn accused Riyadh of restricting its citizens' right to make the hajj, or annual pilgrimage to Makkah, the holiest site in Islam, located in western Saudi Arabia.\n\nSaudi King Salman authorised \"the entry of Qatari pilgrims to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia through Salwa border crossing to perform hajj, and to allow all Qatari nationals who wish to enter for hajj without electronic permits\", state news agency SPA announced.\n\nHe also ordered that private jets belonging to Saudi airlines be sent to Doha airport \"to bring all Qatari pilgrims at his expense\".\n\nQatar's foreign minister welcomed the decision but lashed out at Riyadh's ongoing \"politicisation\" of religious freedoms.\n\n\"Regardless of the manner in which pilgrims from Qatar or living in Qatar were banned from the pilgrimage, which was politically motivated, and the manner in which they were subsequently permitted to make the pilgrimage, which was also politicised and which was announced with other goals in mind... the government of Qatar welcomes the decision and will respond positively,\" Foreign Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani told a press conference in Stockholm.\n\n\"What matters to us is the bottom line, which is that our citizens now have a way to attend the hajj, and we uphold our demand that hajj be spared politicisation and remain separate from our political issues.\"\n\nThe hajj, a pillar of Islam that capable Muslims must perform at least once, is to take place this year at the start of September and it is expected to draw around two million Muslims from around the world.\n\nOn June 5, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates severed diplomatic and trade ties with Qatar in what has emerged as the worst political crisis to grip the region in decades.\n\nThe Saudi decision to reopen the frontier for Qatari pilgrims came shortly after the kingdom's powerful Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman met with Qatari envoy Sheikh Abdullah bin Ali bin Abdullah bin Jassim al-Thani, a member of Qatar's ruling dynasty.\n\nIt was the first public high-level encounter between the nations since the crisis erupted.\n\nThe Qatari foreign minister, however, said Sheikh Abdullah had acted on a \"personal initiative\" by meeting the crown prince on Wednesday in the Saudi city of Jeddah and not on behalf of the Doha government.\n\nThe decision also came after SPA reported that Crown Prince Mohammed had received a phone call from US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who has sought repeatedly to defuse the regional crisis.\n\nSaudi Arabia last month said Qatari pilgrims would be allowed to enter the kingdom for hajj this year but imposed several travel restrictions, including flying in only on airlines approved by Riyadh.\n\nDoha has accused Riyadh of jeopardising the pilgrimage to Makkah by refusing to guarantee the safety of Qatari citizens.\n\n\"We hope that the Saudi authorities cooperate with our government agencies to ensure the security of the Qatari people,\" the foreign minister said in Stockholm.\n\nAnalysts cautioned yesterday that the diplomatic crisis was far from over.\n\n\"This

Saudi leadership and the royal family in Qatar\", the statement added.\n\nSaudi Arabia and its Arab allies shut down air, maritime and land links with Qatar, and imposed economic sanctions, accusing Doha of supporting terrorists and of being too close to Iran.\n\nQatar denies the charges and has accused its Gulf neighbours of seeking to strangle its economy.\n\nThe tiny emirate with a population

Qatar did not officially comment on the deal until its foreign minister was pressed on Thursday by reporters during a briefing in Sweden, some 12 hours later.\n\nForeign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani said he welcomed the Saudi decision, but that the measures must also include a full lifting of the blockade.\n\nThe way in which the deal was reached and announced out of Saudi Arabia raised questions about the level of the Qatari government's involvement. Qatari officials did not immediately respond to an Associated Press request for comment.\n\nThe official Saudi Press Agency reported that Qatari pilgrims will be allowed to enter the kingdom by land and would then be flown onward from two Saudi airports in Dammam and al-Ahsa at the king's expense. The king also ordered that aircraft from the country's flagship carrier be dispatched to Qatar's capital, Doha, to fly Qatari pilgrims to the Red Sea city of Jiddah - nearest to Mecca - and to host them at his expense for the hajj.\n\nSaudi state TV said 100 Qataris had arrived at the border crossing on Thursday.\n\nThe decision came after Prince Mohammed met with Qatari royal family member Sheikh Abdullah Al Thani late Wednesday at a palace in Jiddah. Images broadcast on Saudi media showed the two men seated and smiling for cameras.\n\nSheikh Abdullah, who's lived previously for some years in Saudi Arabia and has gone back on private visits, has no role in government and his last position was as head of the equestrian and camel racing federation in the 1970s and 1980s, said Gerd Nonneman, a professor of International Relations and Gulf Studies at Georgetown University in Qatar.\n\nSheikh Abdullah's grandfather, father and brother were rulers of Qatar until a palace coup ousted his branch of the royal family in 1972.\n\n\"He's certainly not an envoy of the Qatari government. This was not a deal that was struck,\" Nonneman said, describing it as a Saudi \"propaganda ploy\" to catch the Qatari government off-guard.\n\nHe said Saudi outreach to various individuals within Qatar's large royal family causes discomfort and \"needles the Qatari leadership.\"\n\nSheikh Abdullah was quoted as telling the Saudi prince that the ties between the two countries \"are brotherly relations rooted in history.\" Saudi Arabia's crown prince responded in kind, emphasizing the historical ties between the two royal families, according to the Saudi Press Agency.\n\nThe meeting in Jiddah was the first by a Qatari royal in Saudi Arabia since a political standoff erupted 10 weeks ago when the kingdom, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt severed ties with Qatar. The quartet also halted direct flights, expelled Qatari residents and the three Gulf countries ordered their citizens in Qatar to leave. Saudi Arabia sealed Qatar's only land border.\n\nMixed-nationality families in the Gulf were affected by the measures, and Qatari students in the Gulf countries were pulled out of final exams. The crisis has also strained traditional kinships in the region.\n\nQatar's National Human Rights Committee issued a brief statement Thursday responding to what it said were \"reports in Saudi media\" outlining the kingdom's measures for Qatari pilgrims.\n\nThe committee expressed its \"satisfaction\" with the decisions, but reiterated its demands that the hajj not be politicized and said the Saudi measures remain \"unclear,\" particularly regarding the facilitation of hajj for foreigners residing in Qatar. The statement noted that the agreement does not include allowing Qatar Airways flights carrying pilgrims.\n\nThe statement also called \"for further measures to lift the siege entirely on citizens and residents of Qatar.\"\n\nHundreds of thousands of pilgrims from around the world have already arrived in Saudi Arabia for the hajj, which begins late next week. Saudi Arabia prides itself on hosting millions of pilgrims annually at Islam's holiest sites in Mecca and Medina.\n\nQatar's human rights committee had previously filed a complaint with the U.N. special rapporteur on freedom of belief and religion over restrictions placed on its nationals who wanted to attend the hajj this year. Saudi Arabia's Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir said Qatar's complaint amounted to a \"declaration of war\" against the kingdom's management of the holy sites.\n\nDespite the goodwill measure announced Thursday, tensions remain. The quartet accuses the small Gulf nation of supporting extremists. Qatar denies the allegation and says the charges are politically motivated.\n\nBahrain on Wednesday said it was investigating an alleged telephone call between Qatar's prime minister and Ali Salman, a Bahraini Shiite opposition leader who is serving a nine-year prison sentence for his role in the country's 2011 protests. Bahrain's public prosecutor said the alleged call centered on how to \"exacerbate (tensions) and undermine Bahrain's interests and stability.\"", "dateTime": "2017-08-17T16:27:00Z", "extractedDates":

Qatar has denied the accusation.\n\nThe announcement to reopen the border for Qatari pilgrims came after powerful Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman received an envoy from Doha, the official Saudi Press Agency said, in the first public high-level encounter between the nations since the crisis erupted.\n\nThe king has allowed \"the entry of Qatari pilgrims to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia through Salwa border crossing to perform hajj, and to allow all Qatari nationals who wish to enter for hajj without electronic permits\", a statement on SPA said.\n\nHe also ordered that private jets belonging to Saudi airlines be sent to Doha airport \"to bring all Qatari pilgrims on his expenses\".\n\nThe announcement came after Prince Salman received a phone call from US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who has sought repeatedly to defuse the regional crisis, SPA reported, without revealing the details of the conversation.\n\nSaudi Arabia last month said Qataris wanting to perform this year's hajj would be allowed to enter the kingdom, but imposed certain restrictions including that those arriving by plane use airlines in agreement with Riyadh.\n\nDoha then accused Riyadh of politicising the hajj, and of jeopardising the pilgrimage to Mecca by refusing to guarantee the safety of pilgrims.\n\n- 'Goodwill gesture' -\n\nSome observers cautioned that the diplomatic crisis was far from over despite the announcement.\n\n\"This is a goodwill gesture towards the Qatari people and not a breakthrough with the Qatari\" government, Ali Shihabi from the Washington-based think tank Arabia Foundation said on Twitter, referring to the reopening of the border.\n\nThere was no immediate official reaction from Doha, but Qataris responded to the move on social media.\n\n\"We do not need the (Saudi) king's charity. The Qatari right to pilgrimage is not given as charity from the king,\" one Qatari wrote on Twitter.\n\nSaudi Arabia and its Arab allies have shut down air, maritime and land links with Qatar, and imposed economic sanctions, accusing Doha of supporting \"terrorists\" and of being too close to their regional nemesis Iran.\n\nQatar has denied the allegations and denounced what it called a \"blockade\" aimed at bringing the wealthy emirate to its knees.\n\nThe tiny emirate with a population of 2.6 million, 80 percent of them foreigners, ranks as the world's richest country on a per capita basis, according to the International Monetary Fund.\n\nIt holds a staggering $330 billion in a sovereign wealth fund, with assets heavily invested abroad.\n\nThe hajj, a pillar of Islam that capable Muslims must perform at least once in a lifetime, is to take place at the beginning of September.\n\nThe pilgrimage is expected to draw around two million people this year.", "dateTime":

Qatar did not officially comment on the deal until its foreign minister was pressed by reporters during a briefing in Sweden some 12 hours later.\n\nForeign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani said he welcomed the Saudi decision, but that the measures must also include a full lifting of the blockade.\n\nThe way in which the deal was reached and announced out of Saudi Arabia raised questions about the level of the Qatari government's involvement. Qatari officials did not immediately respond to an Associated Press request for comment.\n\nThe official Saudi Press Agency reported that Qatari pilgrims will be allowed to enter the kingdom by land and would then be flown onward from two Saudi airports in Dammam and al-Ahsa at the king's expense. The king also ordered that aircraft from the country's flagship carrier be dispatched to Qatar's capital, Doha, to fly Qatari pilgrims to the Red Sea city of Jiddah -- nearest to Mecca -- and to host them at his expense for the hajj.\n\nSaudi state TV said 100 Qataris had arrived at the border crossing on Thursday.\n\nThe decision came after Prince Mohammed met with Qatari royal family member Sheikh Abdullah Al Thani late Wednesday at a palace in Jiddah. Images broadcast on Saudi media showed the two men seated and smiling for cameras.\n\nSheikh Abdullah, who's lived previously for some years in Saudi Arabia and has gone back on private visits, has no role in government and his last position was as head of the equestrian and camel racing federation in the 1970s and 1980s, said Gerd Nonneman, a professor of International Relations and Gulf Studies at Georgetown University in Qatar.\n\nSheikh Abdullah's grandfather, father and brother were rulers of Qatar until a palace coup ousted his branch of the royal family in 1972.\n\n\"He's certainly not an envoy of the Qatari government. This was not a deal that was struck,\" Nonneman said, describing it as a Saudi \"propaganda ploy\" to catch the Qatari government off-guard.\n\nHe said Saudi outreach to various individuals within Qatar's large royal family causes discomfort and \"needles the Qatari leadership.\"\n\nSheikh Abdullah was quoted as telling the Saudi prince that the ties between the two countries \"are brotherly relations rooted in history.\" Saudi Arabia's crown prince responded in kind, emphasizing the historical ties between the two royal families, according to the Saudi Press Agency.\n\nThe meeting in Jiddah was the first by a Qatari royal in Saudi Arabia since a political standoff erupted 10 weeks ago when the kingdom, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt severed ties with Qatar. The quartet also halted direct flights, expelled Qatari residents and the three Gulf countries ordered their citizens in Qatar to leave. Saudi Arabia sealed Qatar's only land border.\n\nMixed-nationality families in the Gulf were affected by the measures, and Qatari students in the Gulf countries were pulled out of final exams. The crisis has also strained traditional kinships in the region.\n\nQatar's National Human Rights Committee issued a brief statement Thursday responding to what it said were \"reports in Saudi media\" outlining the kingdom's measures for Qatari pilgrims.\n\nThe committee expressed its \"satisfaction\" with the decisions, but reiterated its demands that the hajj not be politicized and said the Saudi measures remain \"unclear,\" particularly regarding the facilitation of hajj for foreigners residing in Qatar. The statement noted that the agreement does not include allowing Qatar Airways flights carrying pilgrims.\n\nThe statement also called \"for further measures to lift the siege entirely on citizens and residents of Qatar.\"\n\nHundreds of thousands of pilgrims from around the world have already arrived in Saudi Arabia for the hajj, which begins late next week. Saudi Arabia prides itself on hosting millions of pilgrims annually at Islam's holiest sites in Mecca and Medina.\n\nQatar's human rights committee had previously filed a complaint with the U.N. special rapporteur on freedom of belief and religion over restrictions placed on its nationals who wanted to attend the hajj this year. Saudi Arabia's Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir said Qatar's complaint amounted to a \"declaration of war\" against the kingdom's management of the holy sites.\n\nDespite the goodwill measure announced Thursday, tensions remain. The quartet accuses the small Gulf nation of supporting extremists. Qatar denies the allegation and says the charges are politically motivated.\n\nBahrain on Wednesday said it was investigating an alleged telephone call between Qatar's prime minister and Ali Salman, a Bahraini Shiite opposition leader who is serving a nine-year prison sentence for his role in the country's 2011 protests. Bahrain's public prosecutor said the alleged call centered on how to \"exacerbate (tensions) and undermine Bahrain's interests and stability.\"\n\n___\n\nBatrawy reported from Dubai, United Arab Emirates.

The decision came after Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman held a surprise meeting with a Qatari royal family member whose branch of the family was ousted in a palace coup in 1972.\n\nSaudi state media broke the news overnight. Qatar did not officially comment on the deal until its foreign minister was pressed on Thursday by reporters during a briefing in Sweden, some 12 hours later.\n\nForeign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani said he welcomed the Saudi decision, but that the measures must also include a full lifting of the blockade. The way in which the deal was reached and announced out of Saudi Arabia raised questions about the level of the Qatari government's involvement.\n\nQatari officials did not immediately respond to an Associated Press request for comment. The official Saudi Press Agency reported that Qatari pilgrims will be allowed to enter the kingdom by land and would then be flown onward from two Saudi airports in Dammam and al-Ahsa at the king's expense.\n\nThe king also ordered that aircraft from the country's flagship carrier be dispatched to Qatar's capital, Doha, to fly Qatari pilgrims to the Red Sea city of Jeddah -- nearest to Makkah -- and to host them at his expense for the Hajj. Saudi state TV said 100 Qataris had arrived at the border crossing on Thursday. The decision came after Prince Mohammed met with Qatari royal family member Sheikh Abdullah Al-Thani late Wednesday at a palace in Jeddah. Images broadcast on Saudi media showed the two men seated and smiling for cameras. Sheikh Abdullah, who's lived previously for some years in Saudi Arabia and has gone back on private visits, has no role in government and his last position was as head of the equestrian and camel racing federation in the 1970s and 1980s, said Gerd Nonneman, a professor of International Relations and Gulf Studies at Georgetown University in Qatar.\n\nSheikh Abdullah's grandfather, father and brother were rulers of Qatar until a palace coup ousted his branch of the royal family in 1972. \"He's certainly not an envoy of the Qatari government. This was not a deal that was struck,\" Nonneman said, describing it as a Saudi \"propaganda ploy\" to catch the Qatari government off-guard. He said Saudi outreach to various individuals within Qatar's large royal family causes discomfort and \"needles the Qatari leadership.\" Sheikh Abdullah was quoted as telling the Saudi prince that the ties between the two countries \"are brotherly relations rooted in history.\" Saudi Arabia's crown prince responded in kind, emphasizing the historical ties between the two royal families, according to the Saudi Press Agency.\n\nThe meeting in Jeddah was the first by a Qatari royal in Saudi Arabia since a political standoff erupted 10 weeks ago when the kingdom, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt severed ties with Qatar.\n\nThe quartet also halted direct flights, expelled Qatari residents and the three Gulf countries ordered their citizens in Qatar to leave. Saudi Arabia sealed Qatar's only land border. Mixed-nationality families in the Gulf were affected by the measures, and Qatari students in the Gulf countries were pulled out of final exams. The crisis has also strained traditional kinships in the region. Qatar's National Human Rights Committee issued a brief statement Thursday responding to what it said were \"reports in Saudi media\" outlining the kingdom's measures for Qatari pilgrims. The committee expressed its \"satisfaction\" with the decisions, but reiterated its demands that the Hajj not be politicized and said the Saudi measures remain \"unclear\", particularly regarding the facilitation of Hajj for foreigners residing in Qatar. The statement noted that the agreement does not include allowing Qatar Airways flights carrying pilgrims.", "dateTime": "2017-08-18T03:19:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 28, "textStart": 22,

Qatar has denied the accusation.\n\nThe announcement to reopen the border for Qatari pilgrims came after powerful Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman received an envoy from Doha, the official Saudi Press Agency said, in the first public high-level encounter between the nations since the crisis erupted.\n\nThe king has allowed \"the entry of Qatari pilgrims to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia through Salwa border crossing to perform hajj, and to allow all Qatari nationals who wish to enter for hajj without electronic permits\", a statement on SPA said.\n\nHe also ordered that private jets belonging to Saudi airlines be sent to Doha airport \"to bring all Qatari pilgrims on his expenses\".\n\nThe announcement came after Prince Salman received a phone call from US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who has sought repeatedly to defuse the regional crisis, SPA reported, without revealing the details of the conversation.\n\nSaudi Arabia last month said Qataris wanting to perform this year's hajj would be allowed to enter the kingdom, but imposed certain restrictions including that those arriving by plane use airlines in agreement with Riyadh.\n\nDoha then accused Riyadh of politicising the hajj, and of jeopardising the pilgrimage to Mecca by refusing to guarantee the safety of pilgrims.\n\n- 'Goodwill gesture' -\n\nSome observers cautioned that the diplomatic crisis was far from over despite the announcement.\n\n\"This is a goodwill gesture towards the Qatari people and not a breakthrough with the Qatari\" government, Ali Shihabi from the Washington-based think tank Arabia Foundation said on Twitter, referring to the reopening of the border.\n\nThere was no immediate official reaction from Doha, but Qataris responded to the move on social media.\n\n\"We do not need the (Saudi) king's charity. The Qatari right to pilgrimage is not given as charity from the king,\" one Qatari wrote on Twitter.\n\nSaudi Arabia and its Arab allies have shut down air, maritime and land links with Qatar, and imposed economic sanctions, accusing Doha of supporting \"terrorists\" and of being too close to their regional nemesis Iran.\n\nQatar has denied the allegations and denounced what it called a \"blockade\" aimed at bringing the wealthy emirate to its knees.\n\nThe tiny emirate with a population of 2.6 million, 80 percent of them foreigners, ranks as the world's richest country on a per capita basis, according to the International Monetary Fund.\n\nIt holds a staggering $330 billion in a sovereign wealth fund, with assets heavily invested abroad.\n\nThe hajj, a pillar of Islam that capable Muslims must perform at least once in a lifetime, is to take place at the beginning of September.\n\nThe pilgrimage is expected to draw around two million people this year.", "dateTime":

hajj pilgrimage to Makkah, official state media said on Thursday.\n\nA statement on the official Saudi Press Agency said the Salwa border point would be open for Qatari citizens who wish to perform the annual pilgrimage to pass through with no electronic permissions needed.\n\nThe statement added that Saudi Arabia's King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud has invited Qatari pilgrims to perform this year's Hajj pilgrimage at his expense, ordering private jets belonging to Saudi airlines to be sent to Doha airport.\n\nThe border decision came after the kingdom's Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman received an envoy from Doha, according to a statement from the Saudi News Agency.\n\nThe decision represents the first step forward since a diplomatic crisis began when Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates severed diplomatic and trade ties with Qatar on 5 June, accusing Doha of supporting \"terrorism\".\n\nThe Salwa border crossing had been shut as the four Arab allies shut down air, maritime and land links with Qatar, and imposed economic sanctions.\n\nQatar denies the accusations.\n\nQatari authorities had subsequently accused Saudi Arabia of politicising hajj and jeopardising the pilgrimage to Mecca by refusing to guarantee their pilgrims' safety.\n\nQatar's National Human Rights Committee (NHRC) demanded on Saturday that Saudi Arabia lift all land and air restrictions on Qatar-based pilgrims traveling to Mecca for the Hajj pilgrimage.\n\nThe crown prince emphasised the \"historical relations between Saudi and Qatari people, and between the Saudi leadership and the royal family in Qatar\", the statement added.\n\nJeddah is the airport hub for pilgrims travelling to Mecca and Medina to perform the annual Hajj pilgrimage.\n\nUnder the same royal directive, Qatari citizens will also be transported to Mecca from King Fahad airport and Ihsaa airport in the east of the country.\n\nThere has been no reaction yet by Qatar's government to the

pilgrims to carry out their annual hajj pilgrimage to Mecca, official state media said on Friday.\n\nThe decision represents the first step forward since a diplomatic crisis began when Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates severed diplomatic and trade ties with Qatar on 5 June.\n\nThe border decision came after the kingdom's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman received an envoy from Doha, according to a statement from the Saudi News Agency.\n\nThe King has ordered that Qatari pilgrims be allowed \"to enter Saudi Arabia through the border crossing to do the pilgrimage,\" it said.\n\nHe even ordered that private jets belonging to Saudi airlines be sent to Doha airport \"to bring all Qatari pilgrims on his expense\".\n\nThe crown prince emphasised the \"historical relations between Saudi and Qatari people, and between the Saudi leadership and the royal family in Qatar\", the statement added.\n\nAlso Read: Qatar's Fallout With Arab Neighbours: Here's What You Need To Know\n\nQatari authorities last month accused Saudi Arabia of jeopardising the pilgrimage to Mecca by refusing to guarantee their pilgrims' safety.\n\nSaudi Arabia and its Arab allies shut down air, maritime and land links with Qatar, and imposed economic sanctions, accusing Doha of supporting \"terrorists\" and of being too close to Iran.\n\nQatar denies the charges and has accused its Gulf neighbours of seeking to strangle its economy.\n\nAlso Read: Qatar Crisis, House of Saud Shakeup Show a Gulf on Edge\n\nThe tiny emirate with a population of 2.6 million, 80 per cent of them foreigners, ranks as the world's richest on a per-capita basis, according to the International Monetary Fund.\n\nIt holds a staggering US $330 billion in a sovereign wealth fund, with assets heavily invested abroad.\n\nFirst published: 17 August, 2017 1:13 PM IST", "dateTime": "2017-08-17T06:00:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 382, "textStart": 376, "date": "-06-05", "amb": false},

But on Thursday, Saudi Arabia announced that it plans to open its border to allow pilgrims from the tiny Gulf country to make the annual hajj to Islam's holiest sites.\n\nThe announcement comes after a meeting between Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and a member of the Qatari royal family, Sheikh Abdullah Al Thani.\n\nAccording to a report in the Saudi state news agency, both men spoke about the \"brotherly feelings\" between the two nations -- a marked change in tone from the highly public spat in which Saudi Arabia has accused Qatar of funding terrorist organizations and has blockaded the country.\n\nThe Saudi crown prince said the country would open the Salwa border crossing to Qatari citizens who wanted to perform the hajj, without requiring them to obtain electronic permits. The hajj, a pilgrimage to Mecca required of every Muslim who can afford it and is physically able to make it at least once in their life, begins later this month and ends in early September.\n\nThe official news agency added that the Saudi king would dispatch Saudi planes to Qatar's capital, Doha, \"to fly all Qatari pilgrims at his own expense to the city of Jeddah and host them completely at the expense of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques.\"\n\nA Saudi official named Hussein Al-Sharif, undersecretary of the Ministry of Hajj and Umrah, told the Saudi broadcaster Al Arabiya that Saudi Arabia has reserved a 4,000-square-meter plot for some 2,400 Qatari pilgrims in \"the most desirable area\" along a primary hajj route.\n\nJust last month, Saudi Arabia had said pilgrims from Qatar \"would face certain restrictions if they wanted to attend the Hajj,\" according to the BBC. In response, a Qatari human rights organization complained to the U.N. special rapporteur on freedom of belief and religion.\n\nIt's worth noting that the Qatari royal family member who met with the Saudi crown prince does not hold an official government position and his \"branch of the family was ousted in a place coup in 1972,\" The Associated Press reports.\n\n\"He's certainly not an envoy of the Qatari government. This was not a deal that was struck,\" Gerd Nonneman, professor of international relations and Gulf studies at Georgetown University in Qatar, tells the wire service.\n\nNonnemann added that Sheikh Abdullah has lived in Saudi Arabia previously and that \"his last position was as head of the equestrian and camel racing federation in the 1970s and 1980s.\"\n\nThere was no comment from Qatari government officials for about 12 hours after the news broke, according to the AP.\n\nAt a news conference in Sweden, Qatari Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani called it a \"step forward\" but warned that it was \"politically motivated,\" the BBC reported.\n\nSaudi Arabia's actions are being praised by regional allies such as the United Arab Emirates. The country's state minister for foreign affairs, Anwar Gargash, tweeted, \"Every day, Saudi proves how big it is, and Qatar's clamor and politicization of the hajj must end. ... There are things bigger than politics.\"", "dateTime": "2017-08-17T18:37:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.8274509906768799, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "details": {"gpCnt": 4, "liCnt": 7},

kingdom's airports, it added.\n\nBetween 2 million and 3 million Muslims from around the world travel to Mecca, Islam's holiest city, for the pilgrimage each year.\n\nIt was not clear how far the

There was no immediate confirmation of the report by border officials on the Qatari side of the frontier.\n\n\"Despite the fact it's been politically motivated to ban the Qatari people from haj and politically motivated that they allow them (in)..., we welcome such a step, which is a step forward to get rid of this blockade that is imposed against my country,\" Sheikh Mohammed told a news conference on a visit to Sweden.\n\nHe did not elaborate on what he meant by \"politically motivated\".\n\nSaudi Arabia had already said Qatari pilgrims would not be affected by the travel restrictions, but some Qataris have said they faced difficulties organising the trip.\n\nQatari pilgrims can cross the frontier without the permits usually needed to be obtained in advance for the haj, SPA said.\n\nThe Saudi king has ordered the dispatch of a Saudi Airlines plane to fly Qatari pilgrims to Jeddah at his own expense, SPA added. Qatari pilgrims would also be able to pass through two of the kingdom's airports, it added.\n\nCOMPLAINT Between 2 million and 3 million Muslims from around the world travel to Mecca, Islam's holiest city, for the pilgrimage each year. Every able-bodied Muslim is supposed to undertake it at least once in the lifetime.\n\nQatar had accused Saudi Arabia of politicising the pilgrimage and complained to the U.N. Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion last month.\n\nIt was not clear how far the opening of the border to pilgrims would go to help heal the rift, the worst involving U.S-allied Gulf Arab countries for years.\n\nA Qatari government spokesman said Qatari Sheikh Abdullah bin Ali bin Abdullah bin Jassim al-Thani had held talks with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman before the announcement was made though he did not have a post in the Qatari government.\n\nSheikh Mohammed, the foreign minister, said the ruling family member had been there on a personal basis.\n\nA Qatari semi-government rights body gave a cautious welcome to the Saudi move. \"This is a step toward removing the obstacles and difficulties (Qataris) faced during haj procedures this year,\" the National Human Rights Committee said in a statement.\n\nSome Qataris said that even with permission to enter Saudi Arabia they would be concerned for their safety.\n\n\"I think it is very risky to go to Mecca this year, there could be hate crimes against Qataris,\" said Fatima al-Mohannadi, a Qatari student.", "dateTime": "2017-08-17T13:11:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.8196078538894653,

Qatar did not officially comment on the deal until its foreign minister was pressed by reporters during a briefing in Sweden some 12 hours later.\n\nForeign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani said he welcomed the Saudi decision, but that the measures must also include a full lifting of the blockade.\n\nThe way in which the deal was reached and announced out of Saudi Arabia raised questions about the level of the Qatari government's involvement. Qatari officials did not immediately respond to an Associated Press request for comment.\n\nThe official Saudi Press Agency reported that Qatari pilgrims will be allowed to enter the kingdom by land and would then be flown onward from two Saudi airports in Dammam and al-Ahsa at the king's expense. The king also ordered that aircraft from the country's flagship carrier be dispatched to Qatar's capital, Doha, to fly Qatari pilgrims to the Red Sea city of Jiddah - nearest to Mecca - and to host them at his expense for the hajj.\n\nSaudi state TV said 100 Qataris had arrived at the border crossing on Thursday.\n\nThe decision came after Prince Mohammed met with Qatari royal family member Sheikh Abdullah Al Thani late Wednesday at a palace in Jiddah. Images broadcast on Saudi media showed the two men seated and smiling for cameras.\n\nSheikh Abdullah, who's lived mostly in Saudi Arabia in recent years, has no role in government and his last position was as head of the equestrian and camel racing federation in the 1970s and 1980s, said Gerd Nonneman, a professor of International Relations and Gulf Studies at Georgetown University in Qatar.\n\nSheikh Abdullah's grandfather, father and brother were rulers of Qatar until a palace coup ousted his branch of the royal family in 1972.\n\n\"He's certainly not an envoy of the Qatari government. This was not a deal that was struck,\" Nonneman said, describing it as a Saudi \"propaganda ploy\" to catch the Qatari government off-guard.\n\nHe said Saudi outreach to various individuals within Qatar's large royal family causes discomfort and \"needles the Qatari leadership.\"\n\nSheikh Abdullah was quoted as telling the Saudi prince that the ties between the two countries \"are brotherly relations rooted in history.\" Saudi Arabia's crown prince responded in kind, emphasizing the historical ties between the two royal families, according to the Saudi Press Agency.\n\nThe meeting in Jiddah was the first by a Qatari royal in Saudi Arabia since a political standoff erupted 10 weeks ago when the kingdom, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt severed ties with Qatar. The quartet also halted direct flights, expelled Qatari residents and the three Gulf countries ordered their citizens in Qatar to leave. Saudi Arabia sealed Qatar's only land border.\n\nMixed-nationality families in the Gulf were affected by the measures, and Qatari students in the Gulf countries were pulled out of final exams. The crisis has also strained traditional kinships in the region.\n\nQatar's National Human Rights Committee issued a brief statement Thursday responding to what it said were \"reports in Saudi media\" outlining the kingdom's measures for Qatari pilgrims.\n\nThe committee expressed its \"satisfaction\" with the decisions, but reiterated its demands that the hajj not be politicized and said the Saudi measures remain \"unclear,\" particularly regarding the facilitation of hajj for foreigners residing in Qatar. The statement noted that the agreement does not include allowing Qatar Airways flights carrying pilgrims.\n\nThe statement also called \"for further measures to lift the siege entirely on citizens and residents of Qatar.\"\n\nHundreds of thousands of pilgrims from around the world have already arrived in Saudi Arabia for the hajj, which begins late next week. Saudi Arabia prides itself on hosting millions of pilgrims annually at Islam's holiest sites in Mecca and Medina.\n\nQatar's human rights committee had previously filed a complaint with the U.N. special rapporteur on freedom of belief and religion over restrictions placed on its nationals who wanted to attend the hajj this year. Saudi Arabia's Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir said Qatar's complaint amounted to a \"declaration of war\" against the kingdom's management of the holy sites.\n\nDespite the goodwill measure announced Thursday, tensions remain. The quartet accuses the small Gulf nation of supporting extremists. Qatar denies the allegation and says the charges are politically motivated.\n\nBahrain on Wednesday said it was investigating an alleged telephone call between Qatar's prime minister and Ali Salman, a Bahraini Shiite opposition leader who is serving a nine-year prison sentence for his role in the country's 2011 protests. Bahrain's public prosecutor said the alleged call centred on how to \"exacerbate (tensions) and undermine Bahrain's interests and stability.\"\n\n___\n\nBatrawy reported from Dubai, United Arab Emirates.

A handout picture provided by the Saudi Press Agency (SPA) shows Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (R) meeting with Qatari envoy Sheikh Abdullah bin Ali bin Jassim al-Thani in Jeddah on August 16, 2017. AFP PHOTO / HO / SPA RIYADH, Saudi Arabia -\n\nThe Salwa border crossing, a key passage for Muslims on the annual hajj pilgrimage, has been closed since June in a major diplomatic crisis that saw Riyadh and its regional allies cut relations with Doha over allegations that the emirate supported Islamist extremists.\n\nQatar has denied the charge and in turn accused Riyadh of politicizing the hajj by restricting its citizens from making the pilgrimage to Mecca, the holiest site in Islam that is located in western Saudi Arabia.\n\nAround 120 Qataris entered Saudi territory on Thursday through the Salwa border, also known as Abu Samrah, Saudi state television reported, after King Salman called for the border to be opened for pilgrims without electronic permits.\n\nThe government separately allocated 7 flights of the Saudi national carrier to bring pilgrims from Doha at the monarch's expense, state news agency SPA announced.\n\nQatar welcomed the decision but also lashed out at what it called Riyadh's politicization of religious freedoms.\n\n\"Regardless of the manner in which pilgrims from Qatar were banned from the pilgrimage, which was politically motivated... the government of Qatar welcomes the decision and will respond positively,\" Qatari Foreign Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani told reporters on a visit to Stockholm.\n\n\"What matters to us is the bottom line, which is that our citizens now have a way to attend the hajj, and we uphold our demand that hajj be spared politicization.\"\n\nThe hajj, a pillar of Islam that capable Muslims must perform at least once, is to take place this year at the start of September and it is expected to draw around two million Muslims from around the world.\n\n'Right to pilgrimage'\n\nOn June 5, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates severed diplomatic and trade ties with Qatar in what has evolved as the worst political crisis to grip the Gulf region in decades.\n\nThe kingdom's decision to reopen the frontier came shortly after its powerful Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman met Qatari envoy Sheikh Abdullah bin Ali bin Abdullah bin Jassim al-Thani, a member of Qatar's ruling dynasty.\n\nThe meeting on Wednesday, August 16, in the Saudi Red Sea city of Jeddah was the first public high-level encounter between the nations since the crisis erupted more than two months ago.\n\nThe Qatari foreign minister, however, said that Sheikh Abdullah had acted on a \"personal initiative\" and not on behalf of the Doha government.\n\nThe decision also came after SPA reported that Prince Mohammed had received a phone call from US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who has sought repeatedly to defuse the regional crisis.\n\nAnalysts cautioned Thursday that the dispute was far from over.\n\n\"This is a goodwill gesture towards the Qatari people and not a breakthrough with the Qatari\" government, Ali Shihabi of Washington-based think-tank Arabia Foundation said on Twitter, referring to the border reopening.\n\nThe decision also drew strong comments on social media, with many Qataris reacting critically.\n\n\"We do not need the (Saudi) king's charity. The Qatari right to pilgrimage is not given as charity from the king,\" one Qatari wrote on Twitter.\n\nA tiny gas-rich emirate with a population of 2.6 million, 80% of them foreigners, Qatar ranks as the world's richest country on a per capita basis, according to the International Monetary Fund. - Rappler.com", "dateTime": "2017-08-20T02:10:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 217, "textStart":

Qatar did not officially comment on the deal until its foreign minister was pressed by reporters during a briefing in Sweden some 12 hours later.\n\nForeign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani said he welcomed the Saudi decision, but that the measures must also include a full lifting of the blockade.\n\nThe way in which the deal was reached and announced out of Saudi Arabia raised questions about the level of the Qatari government's involvement. Qatari officials did not immediately respond to an Associated Press request for comment.\n\nThe official Saudi Press Agency reported that Qatari pilgrims will be allowed to enter the kingdom by land and would then be flown onward from two Saudi airports in Dammam and al-Ahsa at the king's expense. The king also ordered that aircraft from the country's flagship carrier be dispatched to Qatar's capital, Doha, to fly Qatari pilgrims to the Red Sea city of Jiddah -- nearest to Mecca -- and to host them at his expense for the hajj.\n\nSaudi state TV said 100 Qataris had arrived at the border crossing on Thursday.\n\nThe decision came after Prince Mohammed met with Qatari royal family member Sheikh Abdullah Al Thani late Wednesday at a palace in Jiddah. Images broadcast on Saudi media showed the two men seated and smiling for cameras.\n\nSheikh Abdullah, who's lived mostly in Saudi Arabia in recent years, has no role in government and his last position was as head of the equestrian and camel racing federation in the 1970s and 1980s, said Gerd Nonneman, a professor of International Relations and Gulf Studies at Georgetown University in Qatar.\n\nSheikh Abdullah's grandfather, father and brother were rulers of Qatar until a palace coup ousted his branch of the royal family in 1972.\n\n\"He's certainly not an envoy of the Qatari government. This was not a deal that was struck,\" Nonneman said, describing it as a Saudi \"propaganda ploy\" to catch the Qatari government off-guard.\n\nHe said Saudi outreach to various individuals within Qatar's large royal family causes discomfort and \"needles the Qatari leadership.\"\n\nSheikh Abdullah was quoted as telling the Saudi prince that the ties between the two countries \"are brotherly relations rooted in history.\" Saudi Arabia's crown prince responded in kind, emphasizing the historical ties between the two royal families, according to the Saudi Press Agency.\n\nThe meeting in Jiddah was the first by a Qatari royal in Saudi Arabia since a political standoff erupted 10 weeks ago when the kingdom, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt severed ties with Qatar. The quartet also halted direct flights, expelled Qatari residents and the three Gulf countries ordered their citizens in Qatar to leave. Saudi Arabia sealed Qatar's only land border.\n\nMixed-nationality families in the Gulf were affected by the measures, and Qatari students in the Gulf countries were pulled out of final exams. The crisis has also strained traditional kinships in the region.\n\nQatar's National Human Rights Committee issued a brief statement Thursday responding to what it said were \"reports in Saudi media\" outlining the kingdom's measures for Qatari pilgrims.\n\nThe committee expressed its \"satisfaction\" with the decisions, but reiterated its demands that the hajj not be politicized and said the Saudi measures remain \"unclear,\" particularly regarding the facilitation of hajj for foreigners residing in Qatar. The statement noted that the agreement does not include allowing Qatar Airways flights carrying pilgrims.\n\nThe statement also called \"for further measures to lift the siege entirely on citizens and residents of Qatar.\"\n\nHundreds of thousands of pilgrims from around the world have already arrived in Saudi Arabia for the hajj, which begins late next week. Saudi Arabia prides itself on hosting millions of pilgrims annually at Islam's holiest sites in Mecca and Medina.\n\nQatar's human rights committee had previously filed a complaint with the U.N. special rapporteur on freedom of belief and religion over restrictions placed on its nationals who wanted to attend the hajj this year. Saudi Arabia's Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir said Qatar's complaint amounted to a \"declaration of war\" against the kingdom's management of the holy sites.\n\nDespite the goodwill measure announced Thursday, tensions remain. The quartet accuses the small Gulf nation of supporting extremists. Qatar denies the allegation and says the charges are politically motivated.\n\nBahrain on Wednesday said it was investigating an alleged telephone call between Qatar's prime minister and Ali Salman, a Bahraini Shiite opposition leader who is serving a nine-year prison sentence for his role in the country's 2011 protests. Bahrain's public prosecutor said the alleged call centred on how to \"exacerbate (tensions) and undermine Bahrain's interests and stability.\"", "dateTime": "2017-08-17T11:08:00Z", "extractedDates":

There was no immediate confirmation of the report by border officials on the Qatari side of the frontier.\n\n\"Despite the fact it's been politically motivated to ban the Qatari people from haj and politically motivated that they allow them (in)..., we welcome such a step, which is a step forward to get rid of this blockade that is imposed against my country,\" Sheikh Mohammed told a news conference on a visit to Sweden.\n\nHe did not elaborate on what he meant by \"politically motivated\".\n\nSaudi Arabia had already said Qatari pilgrims would not be affected by the travel restrictions, but some Qataris have said they faced difficulties organising the trip.\n\nQatari pilgrims can cross the frontier without the permits usually needed to be obtained in advance for the haj, SPA said.\n\nThe Saudi king has ordered the dispatch of a Saudi Airlines plane to fly Qatari pilgrims to Jeddah at his own expense, SPA added. Qatari pilgrims would also be able to pass through two of the kingdom's airports, it added.\n\nCOMPLAINT\n\nBetween 2 million and 3 million Muslims from around the world travel to Mecca, Islam's holiest city, for the pilgrimage each year. Every able-bodied Muslim is supposed to undertake it at least once in the lifetime.\n\nQatar had accused Saudi Arabia of politicising the pilgrimage and complained to the U.N. Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion last month.\n\nIt was not clear how far the opening of the border to pilgrims would go to help heal the rift, the worst involving U.S-allied Gulf Arab countries for years.\n\nA Qatari government spokesman said Qatari Sheikh Abdullah bin Ali bin Abdullah bin Jassim al-Thani had held talks with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman before the announcement was made though he did not have a post in the Qatari government.\n\nSheikh Mohammed, the foreign minister, said the ruling family member had been there on a personal basis.\n\nA Qatari semi-government rights body gave a cautious welcome to the Saudi move. \"This is a step toward removing the obstacles and difficulties (Qataris) faced during haj procedures this year,\" the National Human Rights Committee said in a statement.\n\nSome Qataris said that even with permission to enter Saudi Arabia they would be concerned for their safety.\n\n\"I think it is very risky to go to Mecca this year, there could be hate crimes against Qataris,\" said Fatima al-Mohannadi, a Qatari student.\n\n(This article has not been edited by DNA's editorial team and is auto-generated from an agency

Saudi Arabia and other Gulf countries cut ties with Qatar and implemented an embargo on the movement of people and goods in one of the worst diplomatic crises in the region in decades.\n\nIn order to ease tensions over Qatari Muslims being able to make the pilgrimage, King Salman has chartered seven Boeing 777s, the world's largest twinjet aircraft, to fly the Qataris from Doha to the port city of Jeddah in western Saudi Arabia, according to the kingdom's official press agency. The flights, hired from Saudi Arabia's national carrier Saudia, will depart from August 22 to August 25 and return on September 5, the end of the annual Hajj prilgrimage.\n\nRead More: Saudi Arabian actress offers private planes to fly Qatari pilgrims to Islam's holy sites\n\nKeep up with this story and more by subscribing now\n\nTo ease the passage of Qatar's pilgrims to Islam's holiest city, Saudi Arabia has also reopened the Salwa border crossing with Qatar. The reopening of the crossing point, the only overland connection between the two gulf nations, will allow Qatari nationals on the Hajj to drive to the holy sites, The Wall Street Journal reported.\n\nQataris have been permitted to enter Saudi Arabia without the usual electronic permits issued to pilgrims. The first 120 crossed the border on Thursday.\n\nMuslims circle the Kaaba inside the Grand Mosque in Mecca on December 13, 2007. REUTERS/Ali Jarekji\n\nThe relaxation of restrictions for pilgrims was arranged in a meeting in Jeddah between Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Sheikh Abdullah bin Ali Al-Thani, a member of Qatar's ruling family, though the agreement on religious matters appears unlikely to lead to a wider political arrangement.\n\nMounting tensions between Qatar and its neighbors spilled over in June, when Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the UAE and Bahrain all cut diplomatic ties, accusing Qatar of supporting terrorism and backing regional rival Iran. Four nations issued a list of 13 provisos for the resumption of normal relations with tiny, gas-producing Qatar, also the location of the largest U.S. military base in the region. The list of demands includes closing the Doha-based, state-funded television station Al Jazeera, severing ties with Iran and closing Turkey's air base in Qatar.\n\nDespite the schism, Qatari pilgrims to Mecca and Medina, the two holiest cities in the Muslim faith, were initially unimpeded by Saudi Arabia in their trip to the Muslim holy lands. However, in early August, Qatar said Saudi Arabia had hindered Qatari pilgrims as they made their way to the Hajj, addressing the United Nations special rapporteur on freedom of religion. In response, Riyadh accused Qatar of a \"declaration of war\" over Islam's revered sites.\n\nAs the Muslim calendar entered the five-day period of the annual Muslim pilgrimage to Mecca at the end of August, the schism between Qatar and Saudi Arabia had become increasingly faith-based prior to the intervention by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Sheikh Abdullah bin Ali Al-Thani.\n\nQatar has tried to distance itself from the agreement over the entry of Qatari pilgrims, avoiding it as a political issue. One Qatari source told the Journal that Sheikh Abdullah had been acting in a private capacity when he visited Jeddah, rather than as an official government envoy.", "dateTime": "2017-08-19T03:44:00Z",

There was no immediate confirmation of the report by border officials on the Qatari side of the frontier.\n\n\"Despite the fact it's been politically motivated to ban the Qatari people from haj and politically motivated that they allow them (in)..., we welcome such a step, which is a step forward to get rid of this blockade that is imposed against my country,\" Sheikh Mohammed told a news conference on a visit to Sweden.\n\nHe did not elaborate on what he meant by \"politically motivated\".\n\nSaudi Arabia had already stated that Qatari pilgrims would not be affected by the travel restrictions, but some Qataris have said they faced difficulties organizing the trip.\n\nQatari pilgrims can cross the frontier without the permits usually needed to be obtained in advance for the haj, SPA said.\n\nThe Saudi king has ordered the dispatch of a Saudi Airlines plane to fly Qatari pilgrims to Jeddah at his own expense, it added. Qatari pilgrims would also be able to pass through two of the kingdom's airports.\n\nCOMPLAINT\n\nBetween 2 million and 3 million Muslims from around the world travel to Mecca, Islam's holiest city, for the pilgrimage each year. Every able-bodied Muslim is supposed to undertake it at least once in the lifetime.\n\nQatar had accused Saudi Arabia of politicizing the pilgrimage and complained to the U.N. Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion last month.\n\nIt was not clear how far the opening of the border to pilgrims would go to help heal the worst rift involving U.S-allied Gulf Arab countries for years.\n\nA Qatari government spokesman said Qatari Sheikh Abdullah bin Ali bin Abdullah bin Jassim al-Thani had held talks with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman before the announcement was made though he did not have a post in the Qatari government.\n\nSheikh Mohammed, the foreign minister, said the ruling family member had been there on a personal basis.\n\nA Qatari semi-government rights body gave a cautious welcome to the Saudi move. \"This is a step toward removing the obstacles and difficulties (Qataris) faced during haj procedures this year,\" the National Human Rights Committee said in a statement.\n\nSome Qataris said that even with permission to enter Saudi Arabia they would be concerned for their safety.\n\n\"I think it is very risky to go to Mecca this year, there could be hate crimes against Qataris,\" said Fatima al-Mohannadi, a Qatari student.\n\n(Reporting by Ali Abdelaty in Cairo, Tom Finn in Doha, Katie Paul in Riyadh, Daniel Dickson and Anna

Qatar did not officially comment on the deal until its foreign minister was pressed by reporters during a briefing in Sweden some 12 hours later.\n\nForeign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani said he welcomed the Saudi decision, but that the measures must also include a full lifting of the blockade.\n\nThe way in which the deal was reached and announced out of Saudi Arabia raised questions about the level of the Qatari government's involvement. Qatari officials did not immediately respond to an Associated Press request for comment.\n\nThe official Saudi Press Agency reported that Qatari pilgrims will be allowed to enter the kingdom by land and would then be flown onward from two Saudi airports in Dammam and al-Ahsa at the king's expense. The king also ordered that aircraft from the country's flagship carrier be dispatched to Qatar's capital, Doha, to fly Qatari pilgrims to the Red Sea city of Jiddah - nearest to Mecca - and to host them at his expense for the hajj.\n\nSaudi state TV said 100 Qataris had arrived at the border crossing on Thursday.\n\nThe decision came after Prince Mohammed met with Qatari royal family member Sheikh Abdullah Al Thani late Wednesday at a palace in Jiddah. Images broadcast on Saudi media showed the two men seated and smiling for cameras.\n\nSheikh Abdullah, who's lived mostly in Saudi Arabia in recent years, has no role in government and his last position was as head of the equestrian and camel racing federation in the 1970s and 1980s, said Gerd Nonneman, a professor of International Relations and Gulf Studies at Georgetown University in Qatar.\n\nSheikh Abdullah's grandfather, father and brother were rulers of Qatar until a palace coup ousted his branch of the royal family in 1972.\n\n\"He's certainly not an envoy of the Qatari government. This was not a deal that was struck,\" Nonneman said, describing it as a Saudi \"propaganda ploy\" to catch the Qatari government off-guard.\n\nHe said Saudi outreach to various individuals within Qatar's large royal family causes discomfort and \"needles the Qatari leadership.\"\n\nSheikh Abdullah was quoted as telling the Saudi prince that the ties between the two countries \"are brotherly relations rooted in history.\" Saudi Arabia's crown prince responded in kind, emphasizing the historical ties between the two royal families, according to the Saudi Press Agency.\n\nThe meeting in Jiddah was the first by a Qatari royal in Saudi Arabia since a political standoff erupted 10 weeks ago when the kingdom, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt severed ties with Qatar. The quartet also halted direct flights, expelled Qatari residents and the three Gulf countries ordered their citizens in Qatar to leave. Saudi Arabia sealed Qatar's only land border.\n\nMixed-nationality families in the Gulf were affected by the measures, and Qatari students in the Gulf countries were pulled out of final exams. The crisis has also strained traditional kinships in the region.\n\nQatar's National Human Rights Committee issued a brief statement Thursday responding to what it said were \"reports in Saudi media\" outlining the kingdom's measures for Qatari pilgrims.\n\nThe committee expressed its \"satisfaction\" with the decisions, but reiterated its demands that the hajj not be politicized and said the Saudi measures remain \"unclear,\" particularly regarding the facilitation of hajj for foreigners residing in Qatar. The statement noted that the agreement does not include allowing Qatar Airways flights carrying pilgrims.\n\nThe statement also called \"for further measures to lift the siege entirely on citizens and residents of Qatar.\"\n\nHundreds of thousands of pilgrims from around the world have already arrived in Saudi Arabia for the hajj, which begins late next week. Saudi Arabia prides itself on hosting millions of pilgrims annually at Islam's holiest sites in Mecca and Medina.\n\nQatar's human rights committee had previously filed a complaint with the U.N. special rapporteur on freedom of belief and religion over restrictions placed on its nationals who wanted to attend the hajj this year. Saudi Arabia's Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir said Qatar's complaint amounted to a \"declaration of war\" against the kingdom's management of the holy sites.\n\nDespite the goodwill measure announced Thursday, tensions remain. The quartet accuses the small Gulf nation of supporting extremists. Qatar denies the allegation and says the charges are politically motivated.\n\nBahrain on Wednesday said it was investigating an alleged telephone call between Qatar's prime minister and Ali Salman, a Bahraini Shiite opposition leader who is serving a nine-year prison sentence for his role in the country's 2011 protests. Bahrain's public prosecutor said the alleged call centered on how to \"exacerbate (tensions) and undermine Bahrain's interests and stability.\"\n\n___\n\nBatrawy reported from Dubai, United Arab Emirates.

He was responding to questions at a press conference in Sweden on Thursday.\n\nThe official Saudi Press Agency reported that Qatari pilgrims will be allowed to enter the kingdom by land and that pilgrims would then be flown onward from two Saudi airports in Dammam and al-Ahsa at the king's expense.\n\nFile image of Qatar's foreign minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani. Reuters\n\nThe king also ordered that aircraft from the country's flagship carrier be dispatched to Qatar's capital, Doha, to fly Qatari pilgrims to the Red Sea city of Jiddah -- nearest to Mecca -- and to host them at his expense for the hajj. Saudi state TV said already 100 Qataris had arrived at the border crossing on Thursday.\n\nThe decision came after Prince Mohammed met with Qatari royal family member Sheikh Abdullah Al Thani late on Wednesday at a palace in Jiddah. Images broadcast on Saudi media showed the two men seated and smiling for cameras.\n\nSheikh Abdullah was quoted as telling the Saudi prince that the ties between the two countries \"are brotherly relations rooted in history.\"\n\nSaudi Arabia's crown prince responded in kind, emphasising the historical ties between the two royal families, according to the Saudi Press Agency.\n\nIt was not clear, however, in what capacity Sheikh Abdullah was representing the Qatari government during the meeting. His grandfather, father and brother were rulers of Qatar until a palace coup ousted his branch of the royal family in 1972.\n\nThe meeting in Jiddah was the first by a Qatari to Saudi Arabia since a tense political standoff erupted 10 weeks ago when the kingdom, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt severed ties with Qatar.\n\nThe quartet also halted direct flights, expelled Qatari residents and ordered their citizens in Qatar to leave. Saudi Arabia sealed Qatar's only land border.\n\nQatar's National Human Rights Committee issued a brief statement on Thursday responding to what it said were \"reports in Saudi media\" outlining the kingdom's measures for Qatari pilgrims. The statement noted that the agreement does not include allowing Qatar Airways flights carrying pilgrims.\n\nThe committee expressed its \"satisfaction\" with the decisions, but reiterated its demands that the hajj not be politicised and said the Saudi measures remain \"unclear,\" particularly regarding the facilitation of hajj for foreigners residing in Qatar.\n\nThe committee also reiterated \"calls for further measures to lift the siege entirely on citizens and residents of Qatar,\" the statement said.\n\nQatar's human rights committee had previously filed a complaint with the UN special rapporteur on freedom of belief and religion over restrictions placed on its nationals who wanted to attend the hajj this year.\n\nSaudi Arabia's foreign minister Adel al-Jubeir said Qatar's complaint amounted to a \"declaration of war\" against the kingdom's management of the holy sites.\n\nDespite the goodwill measure announced on Thursday, tensions remain. The quartet accuses the small Gulf nation of supporting extremists. Qatar denies the allegation and says the charges are politically motivated.\n\nAt issue is Qatar's support for Islamist opposition groups in the region, which Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Egypt view as a threat.\n\nA top Emirati official, commenting on Thursday's breakthrough, called on Qatar to \"end its politicization of hajj\". UAE Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, Anwar Gargash, also used the opportunity on Twitter to commend Saudi Arabia for the initiative to send planes.\n\nHundreds of thousands of pilgrims from around the world have already arrived in Saudi Arabia for the hajj, which begins late next week. Saudi Arabia prides itself on hosting millions of pilgrims annually at Islam's holiest sites in Mecca and Medina.\n\nPublished Date: Aug 17, 2017 05:43 pm | Updated Date: Aug 17, 2017 05:43 pm\n\nTags

border in a move that Doha welcomed, but saw as \"politically motivated\" as regional tensions simmer.\n\nThe Salwa border crossing, a key passage for Muslims on the annual hajj, has been closed since June in a major diplomatic crisis that saw Riyadh and its regional allies cut relations with Doha over allegations that the emirate supported extremists.\n\nQatar has denied the charge and in turn accused Riyadh of politicizing the hajj by restricting its citizens from making the pilgrimage to Mecca, the holiest site in Islam that is located in western Saudi Arabia.\n\nAbout 120 Qataris entered Saudi territory on Thursday through the Salwa border, also known as Abu Samrah, Saudi state television reported, after Saudi Arabia's King Salman called for the border to be opened for pilgrims without electronic permits.\n\nThe Saudi government separately allocated seven flights of the Saudi national carrier to bring pilgrims from Doha at the monarch's expense, state news agency SPA reported.\n\nQatar welcomed the decision, but also lashed out at what it called Riyadh's politicization of religious freedoms.\n\n\"Regardless of the manner in which pilgrims from Qatar were banned from the pilgrimage, which was politically motivated ... the government of Qatar welcomes the decision and will respond positively,\" Qatari Minister of Foreign Affairs Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani told reporters on a visit to Stockholm.\n\n\"What matters to us is the bottom line, which is that our citizens now have a way to attend the hajj, and we uphold our demand that hajj be spared politicization,\" he said.\n\nThe kingdom's decision to reopen the border came shortly after its powerful Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman met Qatari envoy Sheikh Abdullah bin Ali bin Abdullah bin Jassim Al Thani, a member of Qatar's ruling dynasty.\n\nThe meeting on Wednesday in Jeddah was the first public high-level encounter between the nations since the crisis erupted more than two months ago.\n\nThe decision also came after SPA reported that Prince Mohammed had received a telephone call from US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who has sought repeatedly to defuse the regional crisis.\n\nAnalysts on Thursday said that the dispute was far from over.\n\n\"This is a goodwill gesture towards the Qatari people and not a breakthrough with the Qatari\" government, Ali Shihabi of Washington-based think tank the Arabia Foundation said on Twitter, referring to the border reopening.", "dateTime": "2017-08-18T16:46:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.7921568751335144,

Qatari pilgrims would also be able to pass through two of the Kingdom's airports, SPA said.\n\nQatar had accused Saudi Arabia of politicizing the pilgrimage and complained to the U.N.

But on Thursday, Saudi Arabia announced it plans to open its border to allow pilgrims from the tiny Gulf country to attend the annual hajj to Islam's holiest sites.\n\nThe announcement comes after a meeting between Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and a member of the Qatari royal family, Sheikh Abdullah Al Thani.\n\nAccording to a report in the Saudi state news agency, both men spoke about the \"brotherly feelings\" between the two nations -- a marked change in tone from the highly public spat in which Saudi has accusing Qatar of funding terrorist organizations and is blockading the country.\n\nThe Saudi crown prince said the country would open the Salwa border crossing to Qatari citizens who wanted to perform the hajj, without requiring them to obtain electronic permits. The hajj begins later this month and ends in early September.\n\nThe official news agency added that the Saudi king would dispatch Saudi planes to Qatar's capital, Doha, \"to fly all Qatari pilgrims at his own expense to the city of Jeddah and host them completely at the expense of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques.\"\n\nA Saudi official named Hussein Al-Sharif, undersecretary of the Ministry of Hajj and Umrah, told the Saudi broadcaster Al Arabiya that Saudi has reserved a 4,000 square meter plot for some 2,400 Qatari pilgrims in \"the most desirable area\" along a primary hajj route.\n\nJust last month, Saudi had said pilgrims from Qatar \"would face certain restrictions if they wanted to attend the Hajj,\" according to the BBC. In response, a Qatari human rights organization complained to the U.N. special rapporteur on freedom of belief and religion.\n\nIt's worth noting that the Qatari royal family member who met with the Saudi crown prince does not hold an official government position and his \"branch of the family was ousted in a place coup in 1972,\" The Associated Press reports.\n\n\"He's certainly not an envoy of the Qatari government. This was not a deal that was struck,\" Gerd Nonneman, professor of International Relations and Gulf Studies at Georgetown University in Qatar, tells the wire service.\n\nNonnemann added that Sheikh Abdullah has lived in Saudi previously and \"his last position was as head of the equestrian and camel racing federation in the 1970s and 1980s.\"\n\nThere was no comment from Qatari government officials for about 12 hours after the news broke, according to the AP.\n\nAt a news conference in Sweden, Qatari Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani called it a \"step forward\" but warned that it was \"politically motivated,\" the BBC reported.\n\nSaudi Arabia's actions are being praised by regional allies such as the UAE. The country's State Minister for Foreign Affairs Anwar Gargash tweeted, \"Every day, Saudi proves how big it is, and Qatar's clamor and politicization of the hajj must end. ... There are things bigger than politics.\"", "dateTime": "2017-08-17T17:29:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.7882353067398071, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3367569",

He was responding to questions at a press conference in Sweden today.\n\nThe official Saudi Press Agency reported that Qatari pilgrims will be allowed to enter the kingdom by land and that pilgrims would then be flown onward from two Saudi airports in Dammam and al-Ahsa at the king's expense.\n\nThe king also ordered that aircraft from the country's flagship carrier be dispatched to Qatar's capital, Doha, to fly Qatari pilgrims to the Red Sea city of Jiddah \u00e2\u20ac\" nearest to Mecca, and to host them at his expense for the hajj. Saudi state TV said already 100 Qataris had arrived at the border crossing today.\n\nThe decision came after Prince Mohammed met with Qatari royal family member Sheikh Abdullah Al Thani late Wednesday at a palace in Jiddah. Images broadcast on Saudi media showed the two men seated and smiling for cameras.\n\nSheikh Abdullah was quoted as telling the Saudi prince that the ties between the two countries \"are brotherly relations rooted in history.\"\n\nSaudi Arabia's crown prince responded in kind, emphasising the historical ties between the two royal families, according to the Saudi Press Agency.\n\nIt was not clear, however, in what capacity Sheikh Abdullah was representing the Qatari government during the meeting. His grandfather, father and brother were rulers of Qatar until a palace coup ousted his branch of the royal family in 1972.\n\nThe meeting in Jiddah was the first by a Qatari to Saudi Arabia since a tense political standoff erupted 10 weeks ago when the kingdom, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt severed ties with Qatar.\n\nThe quartet also halted direct flights, expelled Qatari residents and ordered their citizens in Qatar to leave. Saudi Arabia sealed Qatar's only land border.\n\nQatar's National Human Rights Committee issued a brief statement Thursday responding to what it said were \"reports in Saudi media\" outlining the kingdom's measures for Qatari pilgrims. The statement noted that the agreement does not include allowing Qatar Airways flights carrying pilgrims.\n\nThe committee expressed its \"satisfaction\" with the decisions, but reiterated its demands that the hajj not be politicised and said the Saudi measures remain \"unclear,\" particularly regarding the facilitation of hajj for foreigners residing in Qatar.\n\nThe committee also reiterated \"calls for further measures to lift the siege entirely on citizens and residents of Qatar,\" the statement said.\n\nQatar's human rights committee had previously filed a complaint with the UN special rapporteur on freedom of belief and religion over restrictions placed on its nationals who wanted to attend the hajj this year.\n\nSaudi Arabia's Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir said Qatar's complaint amounted to a \"declaration of war\" against the kingdom's management of the holy sites.\n\nDespite the goodwill measure announced today, tensions remain. The quartet accuses the small Gulf nation of supporting extremists. Qatar denies the allegation and says the charges are politically motivated.\n\nAt issue is Qatar's support for Islamist opposition groups in the region, which Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Egypt view as a threat.\n\nA top Emirati official, commenting on today's breakthrough, called on Qatar to \"end its politicization of hajj.\" UAE Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, Anwar Gargash, also used the opportunity on Twitter to commend Saudi Arabia for the initiative to send planes.\n\nHundreds of thousands of pilgrims from around the world have already arrived in Saudi Arabia for the hajj, which begins late next week. Saudi Arabia prides itself on hosting millions of pilgrims annually at Islam's holiest sites in Mecca and Medina.", "dateTime": "2017-08-17T12:20:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim":

Qatar did not officially comment on the deal until its foreign minister was pressed on Thursday by reporters during a briefing in Sweden, some 12 hours later.\n\nForeign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani said he welcomed the Saudi decision, but that the measures must also include a full lifting of the blockade.\n\nThe way in which the deal was reached and announced out of Saudi Arabia raised questions about the level of the Qatari government's involvement. Qatari officials did not immediately respond to an Associated Press request for comment.\n\nThe official Saudi Press Agency reported that Qatari pilgrims will be allowed to enter the kingdom by land and would then be flown onward from two Saudi airports in Dammam and al-Ahsa at the king's expense. The king also ordered that aircraft from the country's flagship carrier be dispatched to Qatar's capital, Doha, to fly Qatari pilgrims to the Red Sea city of Jiddah -- nearest to Mecca -- and to host them at his expense for the hajj.\n\nSaudi state TV said 100 Qataris had arrived at the border crossing on Thursday.\n\nThe decision came after Prince Mohammed met with Qatari royal family member Sheikh Abdullah Al Thani late Wednesday at a palace in Jiddah. Images broadcast on Saudi media showed the two men seated and smiling for cameras.\n\nSheikh Abdullah, who's lived previously for some years in Saudi Arabia and has gone back on private visits, has no role in government and his last position was as head of the equestrian and camel racing federation in the 1970s and 1980s, said Gerd Nonneman, a professor of International Relations and Gulf Studies at Georgetown University in Qatar.\n\nSheikh Abdullah's grandfather, father and brother were rulers of Qatar until a palace coup ousted his branch of the royal family in 1972.\n\n\"He's certainly not an envoy of the Qatari government. This was not a deal that was struck,\" Nonneman said, describing it as a Saudi \"propaganda ploy\" to catch the Qatari government off-guard.\n\nHe said Saudi outreach to various individuals within Qatar's large royal family causes discomfort and \"needles the Qatari leadership.\"\n\nCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE\n\nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press.

pilgrimage and provide a plane to fly pilgrims in, in spite of a rift in which Saudi Arabia and other states in the region severed transport links with Qatar.\n\nSaudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt cut transport links with Qatar in June and imposed sanctions, accusing it of supporting Islamist militants and Iran, which Doha denies.\n\nThe state-run Saudi Press Agency (SPA) said the Salwa border point would be open for Qataris making the haj, which this year runs from late August to early September.\n\nSaudi Arabia had said Qatari pilgrims would not be affected by the travel restrictions, but some Qataris have said they faced difficulties organising the trip.\n\nQatari pilgrims can pass through the crossing without the permits usually needed to be obtained in advance for the haj, SPA said.\n\nSPA reported that Saudi king has ordered the dispatch of a Saudi Airlines plane to fly Qatari pilgrims to Jeddah at his own expense.\n\nQatari pilgrims would also be able to pass through two of the Kingdom's airports, SPA said.\n\nQatar had accused Saudi Arabia of politicising the pilgrimage and complained to the UN Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion last month.\n\nIt was not clear how far the opening of the border to pilgrims would go to help heal the rift, the worst among U.S-allied Gulf Arab countries for years.\n\nQatari media did not immediately carry the Saudi report.\n\nA Qatari government spokesman had no immediate comment but said Qatari Abdullah Al-Thani who held talks with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Salman before the announcement was made, did not hold a position in the Qatari government.\n\nA Qatari semi-government rights body gave a cautious welcome to the Saudi move.\n\n\"This is a step towards removing the obstacles and difficulties (Qataris) faced during haj procedures this year,\" the National Human Rights Committee said in a statement.\n\nSome Qataris said that even with permission to enter Saudi Arabia they would be concerned for their safety.\n\n\"I think it is very risky to go to Mecca this year, there could be hate crimes against Qataris,\" said Fatima al-Mohannadi, a Qatari student.\n\nBetween two and three million Muslims from around the world travel to Islam's holiest city for the pilgrimage each year.\n\nEvery able-bodied Muslim is supposed to undertake it at least once.", "dateTime":

allowed to enter Saudi Arabia, where he has offered to host them at his own expense.\n\nThe move follows accusations that Saudi authorities were hindering the entry of Qatari pilgrims into Saudi Arabia, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims are set to perform the Hajj pilgrimage later this month.\n\nSince early June, Qatar has been the target of a land, sea and air embargo by a four-nation bloc of Arab states led by Saudi Arabia.\n\nIn an apparent response to the accusations, the official Saudi Press Agency (SPA) reported late Wednesday that King Salman had \"agreed to recommendations made by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman regarding the entry of Qatari pilgrims into the [Saudi] kingdom via the Salwa land border crossing to perform the Hajj\".\n\nThe king, the news agency added, had consented to allow \"all Qatari citizens who wish to perform the Hajj [into the kingdom] without required electronic permits\".\n\nAccording to the SPA, the king's decision was \"based on the mediation efforts of Sheikh Abdullah bin Ali bin Abdullah bin Jassim Al Thani, a member of Qatar's ruling family who was received by bin Salman in Jeddah on Wednesday\".\n\nThe news agency went on to report that King Salman had dispatched a Saudi Airlines aircraft to Doha's international airport \"to transport all Qatari pilgrims at his own expense to the city of Jeddah\".\n\nLast month, Qatar's National Human Rights Committee told the UN's special rapporteur on religious freedom that Hajj pilgrims from Qatar were being discriminated against by the Saudi authorities.\n\nCommittee head Ali bin Smeikh al-Marri called on the Saudi authorities to \"facilitate Hajj procedures and remove restrictions\" facing Qatari pilgrims.\n\nOn June 5, four Arab states -- including Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Emirates and Bahrain -- abruptly cut diplomatic ties with Qatar, accusing it of supporting terrorism.\n\nSaudi Arabia also closed its land border with Qatar, geographically isolating the tiny Gulf state.\n\nDoha, for its part, strenuously denies accusations that it supports terrorism, describing attempts to isolate it as \"unjustified\" and in breach of international law.", "dateTime":

He was responding to questions at a press conference in Sweden on Thursday.\n\nThe official Saudi Press Agency reported that Qatari pilgrims will be allowed to enter the kingdom by land and that pilgrims would then be flown onward from two Saudi airports in Dammam and al-Ahsa at the king's expense.\n\nThe king also ordered that aircraft from the country's flagship carrier be dispatched to Qatar's capital, Doha, to fly Qatari pilgrims to the Red Sea city of Jiddah - nearest to Mecca - and to host them at his expense for the hajj.\n\nSaudi state TV said already 100 Qataris had arrived at the border crossing on Thursday.\n\nThe decision came after Prince Mohammed met with Qatari royal family member Sheikh Abdullah Al Thani late Wednesday at a palace in Jiddah. Images broadcast on Saudi media showed the two men seated and smiling for cameras.\n\nSheikh Abdullah was quoted as telling the Saudi prince that the ties between the two countries \"are brotherly relations rooted in history.\" Saudi Arabia's crown prince responded in kind, emphasizing the historical ties between the two royal families, according to the Saudi Press Agency.\n\nIt was not clear, however, in what capacity Sheikh Abdullah was representing the Qatari government during the meeting. His grandfather, father and brother were rulers of Qatar until a palace coup ousted his branch of the royal family in 1972.\n\nThe meeting in Jiddah was the first by a Qatari to Saudi Arabia since a tense political standoff erupted 10 weeks ago when the kingdom, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt severed ties with Qatar. The quartet also halted direct flights, expelled Qatari residents and ordered their citizens in Qatar to leave. Saudi Arabia sealed Qatar's only land border.\n\nQatar's National Human Rights Committee issued a brief statement Thursday responding to what it said were \"reports in Saudi media\" outlining the kingdom's measures for Qatari pilgrims. The statement noted that the agreement does not include allowing Qatar Airways flights carrying pilgrims.\n\nThe committee expressed its \"satisfaction\" with the decisions, but reiterated its demands that the hajj not be politicized and said the Saudi measures remain \"unclear,\" particularly regarding the facilitation of hajj for foreigners residing in Qatar.\n\nThe committee also reiterated \"calls for further measures to lift the siege entirely on citizens and residents of Qatar,\" the statement said.\n\nQatar's human rights committee had previously filed a complaint with the U.N. special rapporteur on freedom of belief and religion over restrictions placed on its nationals who wanted to attend the hajj this year. Saudi Arabia's Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir said Qatar's complaint amounted to a \"declaration of war\" against the kingdom's management of the holy sites.\n\nDespite the goodwill measure announced Thursday, tensions remain. The quartet accuses the small Gulf nation of supporting extremists. Qatar denies the allegation and says the charges are politically motivated. At issue is Qatar's support for Islamist opposition groups in the region, which Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Egypt view as a threat.\n\nA top Emirati official, commenting on Thursday's breakthrough, called on Qatar to \"end its politicization of hajj.\" UAE Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, Anwar Gargash, also used the opportunity on Twitter to commend Saudi Arabia for the initiative to send planes.\n\nHundreds of thousands of pilgrims from around the world have already arrived in Saudi Arabia for the hajj, which begins late next week. Saudi Arabia prides itself on hosting millions of pilgrims annually at Islam's holiest sites in Mecca and Medina.\n\n___\n\nBatrawy reported from Dubai, United Arab Emirates.

The pilgrimage is expected to draw around two million people this year.\n\nPrince Mohammed emphasised the \"historical relations between Saudi and Qatari people\" after his meeting with the Qatari envoy, Sheikh Abdullah bin Ali bin Abdullah bin Jassim al-Thani, SPA said.\n\nBut some observers cautioned that the diplomatic crisis was far from over despite the apparent bonhomie.\n\n\"This is a goodwill gesture towards the Qatari people and not a breakthrough with the Qatari (government),\" Mr Ali Shihabi of Washington-based think-tank Arabia Foundation said on Twitter, referring to the reopening of the border.\n\nA Qatari government spokes- man also appeared to downplay any breakthrough, saying the envoy did not have a post in the government.\n\nQatari Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed said the envoy had been in Riyadh on a personal basis.\n\nWhile welcoming the latest Saudi decision, the minister also lashed out at the \"politicisation\" of the haj.\n\nAGENCE

Qatar\n\nSaudi King Salman bin Abdul Aziz has ordered that Hajj pilgrims from Qatar be allowed to enter Saudi Arabia, where he has offered to host them at his own expense.\n\nThe move follows accusations that Saudi authorities were hindering the entry of Qatari pilgrims into Saudi Arabia, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims are set to perform the Hajj pilgrimage later this month.\n\nSince early June, Qatar has been the target of a land, sea and air embargo by a four-nation bloc of Arab states led by Saudi Arabia.\n\nIn an apparent response to the accusations, the official Saudi Press Agency (SPA) reported late Wednesday that King Salman had \"agreed to recommendations made by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman regarding the entry of Qatari pilgrims into the [Saudi] kingdom via the Salwa land border crossing to perform the Hajj\".\n\nThe king, the news agency added, had consented to allow \"all Qatari citizens who wish to perform the Hajj [into the kingdom] without required electronic permits\".\n\nAccording to the SPA, the king's decision was \"based on the mediation efforts of Sheikh Abdullah bin Ali bin Abdullah bin Jassim Al Thani, a member of Qatar's ruling family who was received by bin Salman in Jeddah on Wednesday\".\n\nThe news agency went on to report that King Salman had dispatched a Saudi Airlines aircraft to Doha's international airport \"to transport all Qatari pilgrims at his own expense to the city of Jeddah\".\n\nLast month, Qatar's National Human Rights Committee told the UN's special rapporteur on religious freedom that Hajj pilgrims from Qatar were being discriminated against by the Saudi authorities.\n\nCommittee head Ali bin al-Marri called on the Saudi authorities to \"facilitate Hajj procedures and remove restrictions\" facing Qatari pilgrims.\n\nOn June 5, four Arab states -- including Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Emirates and Bahrain -- abruptly cut diplomatic ties with Qatar, accusing it of supporting terrorism.\n\nSaudi Arabia also closed its land border with Qatar, geographically isolating the tiny Gulf state.\n\nDoha, for its part, strenuously denies accusations that it supports terrorism, describing attempts to isolate it as \"unjustified\" and in breach of international law.", "dateTime": "2017-08-17T09:00:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 1871, "textStart": 1865,

He also allowed direct flights from Doha as long as Qatar Airways does not operate them, according to the newest development in the pilgrims' issue that occurred in the wake of the Gulf crisis.\n\nThe National Human Rights Committee in Qatar said in a statement that it \"is deeply satisfied with the decision of the Saudi authorities\" and considers it \"a step forward to remove all obstacles and difficulties that have been facing the Qatari pilgrims this year\".\n\nThe committee added that \"since the beginning of the siege, it demanded the facilitation of the pilgrimage procedures for citizens and residents of Qatar, without the imposition of any obstacles or restrictions. The demands have been accompanied by regional and international efforts to lift any injustice towards the pilgrims and in order to refrain from any politicization of the pilgrimage or its use as a way to punish people or put pressure on governments.\"\n\nSince 5 June, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt have cut diplomatic ties with Qatar. The first three countries have imposed measures that they perceive as a \"boycott\", whereas Doha perceives them as a \"siege\", after it has been accused of supporting terrorism, which it denies, saying that it is facing a campaign of fabricated lies that aims at imposing \"guardianship\" and threatens its sovereignty.\n\nThe Qatari Human Rights Committee stressed that \"the issue of pilgrimage cannot be subjected to any personal or political calculations, and that it is an inherent right enshrined in all international conventions and international human rights conventions as well as in the Islamic law.\"\n\nThe committee considered that \"the decision of the Saudi authorities is still ambiguous, especially when it comes to the non-Qatari pilgrims who reside in Qatar\". It also demanded that \"measures to facilitate their pilgrimage be taken without discrimination and that more measures be implemented to completely lift the siege on the citizens, residents of Qatar, as well as the citizens of the Gulf Cooperation Council countries.\n\nPrior to the decision of the Saudi King, the Kingdom required that Qatari pilgrims travel only by air, onboard of any airline company, as long as it is not Qatar Airways.\n\nQatar accused Saudi Arabia then of making pilgrimage for Qataris impossible and full of obstacles, which Riyadh denies. This comes amid exchanged accusations of using pilgrimage as a tool to increase the pressure on Qatar during the Gulf crisis.\n\nAl-Arabiya TV Channel reported that 50 Qatari pilgrims have entered the Saudi territories to perform Hajj after the authorities opened the Salwa border crossing for the first time since the diplomatic dispute erupted between the two countries back in June.\n\nAl-Arabiya said that pilgrims will be entering the kingdom as guests of the Saudi King.", "dateTime": "2017-08-18T02:46:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 1983, "textStart": 1977, "date": "-06-05", "amb":

He was responding to questions at a press conference in Sweden on Thursday.\n\nThe official Saudi Press Agency reported that Qatari pilgrims will be allowed to enter the kingdom by land and that pilgrims would then be flown onward from two Saudi airports in Dammam and al-Ahsa at the king's expense.\n\nThe king also ordered that aircraft from the country's flagship carrier be dispatched to Qatar's capital, Doha, to fly Qatari pilgrims to the Red Sea city of Jiddah - nearest to Mecca - and to host them at his expense for the hajj.\n\nSaudi state TV said already 100 Qataris had arrived at the border crossing on Thursday.\n\nThe decision came after Prince Mohammed met with Qatari royal family member Sheikh Abdullah Al Thani late Wednesday at a palace in Jiddah. Images broadcast on Saudi media showed the two men seated and smiling for cameras.\n\nSheikh Abdullah was quoted as telling the Saudi prince that the ties between the two countries \"are brotherly relations rooted in history.\" Saudi Arabia's crown prince responded in kind, emphasizing the historical ties between the two royal families, according to the Saudi Press Agency.\n\nIt was not clear, however, in what capacity Sheikh Abdullah was representing the Qatari government during the meeting. His grandfather, father and brother were rulers of Qatar until a palace coup ousted his branch of the royal family in 1972.\n\nThe meeting in Jiddah was the first by a Qatari to Saudi Arabia since a tense political standoff erupted 10 weeks ago when the kingdom, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt severed ties with Qatar. The quartet also halted direct flights, expelled Qatari residents and ordered their citizens in Qatar to leave. Saudi Arabia sealed Qatar's only land border.\n\nQatar's National Human Rights Committee issued a brief statement Thursday responding to what it said were \"reports in Saudi media\" outlining the kingdom's measures for Qatari pilgrims. The statement noted that the agreement does not include allowing Qatar Airways flights carrying pilgrims.\n\nThe committee expressed its \"satisfaction\" with the decisions, but reiterated its demands that the hajj not be politicized and said the Saudi measures remain \"unclear,\" particularly regarding the facilitation of hajj for foreigners residing in Qatar.\n\nThe committee also reiterated \"calls for further measures to lift the siege entirely on citizens and residents of Qatar,\" the statement said.\n\nQatar's human rights committee had previously filed a complaint with the U.N. special rapporteur on freedom of belief and religion over restrictions placed on its nationals who wanted to attend the hajj this year. Saudi Arabia's Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir said Qatar's complaint amounted to a \"declaration of war\" against the kingdom's management of the holy sites.\n\nDespite the goodwill measure announced Thursday, tensions remain. The quartet accuses the small Gulf nation of supporting extremists. Qatar denies the allegation and says the charges are politically motivated. At issue is Qatar's support for Islamist opposition groups in the region, which Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Egypt view as a threat.\n\nA top Emirati official, commenting on Thursday's breakthrough, called on Qatar to \"end its politicization of hajj.\" UAE Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, Anwar Gargash, also used the opportunity on Twitter to commend Saudi Arabia for the initiative to send planes.\n\nHundreds of thousands of pilgrims from around the world have already arrived in Saudi Arabia for the hajj, which begins late next week. Saudi Arabia prides itself on hosting millions of pilgrims annually at Islam's holiest sites in Mecca and Medina.\n\n___\n\nBatrawy reported from Dubai, United Arab Emirates.

Qatari foreign minister on Thursday welcomed Saudi Arabia's decision to reopen the two countries' border to Muslim pilgrims -- while lashing out at Riyadh's \"politicisation\" of religious freedoms, Hindustantimes reported.\n\n\"Regardless of the manner in which pilgrims from Qatar or living in Qatar were banned from the pilgrimage, which was politically motivated, and the manner in which they were subsequently permitted to make the pilgrimage, which was also politicised and which was announced with other goals in mind... the government of Qatar welcomes the decision and will respond

the Salwa border crossing to Qatari pilgrims for the annual hajj pilgrimage to the city of Mecca, the birthplace of the Prophet Mohamed and Islam's holiest site, in the west of the kingdom.\n\nThe crossing had been sealed off for more than two months as a diplomatic crisis between the Saudi and Qatari governments has seen severe restrictions on travel imposed on citizens across the region.\n\nOn June 5, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt announced a cut in ties with Qatar, recalled ambassadors and sealed off borders and airspace to the emirate over allegations Doha backed Islamist extremists and was too close to Iran.\n\nQatar has denied the allegations.\n\nRiyadh's decision to reopen the border came hours after Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman met on Wednesday with Qatari envoy Sheikh Abdullah bin Ali bin Abdullah bin Jassim Al-Thani, a member of the ruling dynasty in Doha.\n\nThe Qatari foreign minister, however, said Sheikh Abdullah had acted on a \"personal initiative\" by meeting the crown prince in the Saudi city of Jeddah and not on behalf of the Doha government.\n\nDoha has consistently accused Riyadh of politicising the hajj and

The king also ordered aircraft from the country's flagship carrier be dispatched to Qatar's capital, Doha, to fly pilgrims to the Red Sea city of Jiddah - nearest to Mecca - and to host them at his expense for the Hajj.\n\nSaudi state TV said 100 Qataris had arrived at the border crossing yesterday.\n\nThe decision came after Prince Mohammed met Qatari royal family member Sheikh Abdullah Al Thani late on Wednesday in Jiddah.\n\nSheikh Abdullah, who lived for some years in Saudi Arabia and has gone back on private visits, has no role in government and his last position was as head of the equestrian and camel racing federation in the 1970s and 1980s, said Gerd Nonneman, a professor of International Relations and Gulf Studies at Georgetown University in Qatar.\n\nSheikh Abdullah's grandfather, father and brother were rulers of Qatar until a palace coup ousted his branch of the royal family in 1972.\n\n\"He's not an envoy of the Qatari government. This was not a deal that was struck,\" Nonneman said, describing it as a Saudi \"propaganda ploy\" to catch the Qatari government off-guard.", "dateTime": "2017-08-17T20:28:00Z", "extractedDates":

He was responding to questions at a press conference in Sweden on Thursday.\n\nThe official Saudi Press Agency reported that Qatari pilgrims will be allowed to enter the kingdom by land and that pilgrims would then be flown onward from two Saudi airports in Dammam and al-Ahsa at the king's expense.\n\nThe king also ordered that aircraft from the country's flagship carrier be dispatched to Qatar's capital, Doha, to fly Qatari pilgrims to the Red Sea city of Jiddah -- nearest to Mecca -- and to host them at his expense for the hajj.\n\nSaudi state TV said already 100 Qataris had arrived at the border crossing on Thursday.\n\nThe decision came after Prince Mohammed met with Qatari royal family member Sheikh Abdullah Al Thani late Wednesday at a palace in Jiddah. Images broadcast on Saudi media showed the two men seated and smiling for cameras.\n\nSheikh Abdullah was quoted as telling the Saudi prince that the ties between the two countries \"are brotherly relations rooted in history.\" Saudi Arabia's crown prince responded in kind, emphasizing the historical ties between the two royal families, according to the Saudi Press Agency.\n\nIt was not clear, however, in what capacity Sheikh Abdullah was representing the Qatari government during the meeting. His grandfather, father and brother were rulers of Qatar until a palace coup ousted his branch of the royal family in 1972.\n\nThe meeting in Jiddah was the first by a Qatari to Saudi Arabia since a tense political standoff erupted 10 weeks ago when the kingdom, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt severed ties with Qatar. The quartet also halted direct flights, expelled Qatari residents and ordered their citizens in Qatar to leave. Saudi Arabia sealed Qatar's only land border.\n\nQatar's National Human Rights Committee issued a brief statement Thursday responding to what it said were \"reports in Saudi media\" outlining the kingdom's measures for Qatari pilgrims. The statement noted that the agreement does not include allowing Qatar Airways flights carrying pilgrims.\n\nThe committee expressed its \"satisfaction\" with the decisions, but reiterated its demands that the hajj not be politicized and said the Saudi measures remain \"unclear,\" particularly regarding the facilitation of hajj for foreigners residing in Qatar.\n\nThe committee also reiterated \"calls for further measures to lift the siege entirely on citizens and residents of Qatar,\" the statement said.\n\nQatar's human rights committee had previously filed a complaint with the U.N. special rapporteur on freedom of belief and religion over restrictions placed on its nationals who wanted to attend the hajj this year. Saudi Arabia's Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir said Qatar's complaint amounted to a \"declaration of war\" against the kingdom's management of the holy sites.\n\nDespite the goodwill measure announced Thursday, tensions remain. The quartet accuses the small Gulf nation of supporting extremists. Qatar denies the allegation and says the charges are politically motivated. At issue is Qatar's support for Islamist opposition groups in the region, which Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Egypt view as a threat.\n\nA top Emirati official, commenting on Thursday's breakthrough, called on Qatar to \"end its politicization of hajj.\" UAE Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, Anwar Gargash, also used the opportunity on Twitter to commend Saudi Arabia for the initiative to send planes.\n\nHundreds of thousands of pilgrims from around the world have already arrived in Saudi Arabia for the hajj, which begins late next week. Saudi Arabia prides itself on hosting millions of pilgrims annually at Islam's holiest sites in Mecca and Medina.\n\n-- -- --\n\nBatrawy reported from Dubai, United Arab Emirates.

have said they faced difficulties organising the trip.\n\nQatari pilgrims can pass through the crossing without the permits usually needed to be obtained in advance for the haj, SPA said.\n\nSPA reported that Saudi king has ordered the dispatch of a Saudi Airlines plane to fly Qatari pilgrims to Jeddah at his own expense.\n\nQatari pilgrims would also be able to pass through two of the Kingdom's airports, SPA said.\n\nQatar had accused Saudi Arabia of politicising the pilgrimage and complained to the UN Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion last month.\n\nIt was not clear how far the opening of the border to pilgrims would go to help heal the rift, the worst among U.S-allied Gulf Arab countries for years.\n\nQatari media did not immediately carry the Saudi report.\n\nA Qatari government spokesman had no immediate comment but said Qatari Abdullah Al-Thani who held talks with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Salman before the announcement was made, did not hold a position

haj procedures this year,\" the National Human Rights Committee said in a statement.\n\nSome Qataris said that even with permission to enter Saudi Arabia they would be concerned for their safety.\n\n\"I think it is very risky to go to Mecca this year, there could be hate crimes against Qataris,\" said Fatima al-Mohannadi, a Qatari student.\n\nBetween two and three million Muslims from

Qatar responded by accusing Riyadh of politicising the Haj and the UN special rapporteur on freedom of religion expressed concern at Saudi Arabia's measures, BBC reported\n\nIn a statement carried by SPA, the Crown Prince thanked Sheikh Al Thani \"for his brotherly feelings\" as he stressed \"the depth of historical relations\" between Saudis and Qataris.\n\nObservers say that, despite this goodwill gesture, the dispute between Qatar and its neighbours, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Egypt and the UAE is far from over, the BBC report said.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Business Standard staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "dateTime": "2017-08-17T15:21:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.7607843279838562, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3367569", "time": "15:21:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3367569", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "1", "label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Arab_Emirates", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "22", "label": {"eng": "Kingdom of Bahrain"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bahrain", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Kingdom of Bahrain"}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "64", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "187", "label": {"eng": "State of Qatar"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qatar", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "State of Qatar"}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "193", "label": {"eng": "Kingdom of Saudi Arabia"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Kingdom of Saudi Arabia"}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "1765", "label": {"eng": "Riyadh"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riyadh", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Riyadh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Kingdom of Saudi Arabia"}}}, "score": 2}, {"id": "1847", "label": {"eng": "Ad Damm\u0101m"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dammam", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ad Damm\u0101m"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Kingdom of Saudi Arabia"}}}, "score": 2}, {"id": "302926", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "BBC"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "score": 2}, {"id": "303301", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Muhammad"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad", "score": 3}, {"id": "303396", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "score": 2}, {"id": "304453", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Islamism"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamism", "score": 3}, {"id": "313845", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Crown prince"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_prince", "score": 3}, {"id": "318105", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Freedom of religion"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_religion", "score": 2}, {"id": "318182", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "House of Thani"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Thani", "score": 3}, {"id": "323603", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Hajj"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hajj", "score": 5}, {"id": "348936", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Umrah"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umrah", "score": 2}, {"id": "398328", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Ibn Saud"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibn_Saud", "score": 2}, {"id": "414901", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Abdullah of Saudi Arabia"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdullah_of_Saudi_Arabia", "score": 4}, {"id": "460029", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Press Agency"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Press_Agency", "score": 1}, {"id": "690559", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "King Fahd International Airport"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Fahd_International_Airport", "score": 2}, {"id": "939406", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Al-Hasa"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Hasa", "score": 2}, {"id": "1044837", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Salman of Saudi Arabia"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salman_of_Saudi_Arabia", "score": 5}, {"id": "1069195", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Abdullah bin Jassim Al Thani"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdullah_bin_Jassim_Al_Thani", "score": 3}], "image": "http://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/img/common/no_preview.jpg", "timeCrawl": "15:21:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": " Saudi Arabia reopens Qatar border for Haj pilgrims ", "originalArticle": null}

He was responding to questions at a press conference in Sweden on Thursday.\n\nThe official Saudi Press Agency reported that Qatari pilgrims will be allowed to enter the kingdom by land and that pilgrims would then be flown onward from two Saudi airports in Dammam and al-Ahsa at the king's expense.\n\nThe king also ordered that aircraft from the country's flagship carrier be dispatched to Qatar's capital, Doha, to fly Qatari pilgrims to the Red Sea city of Jiddah -- nearest to Mecca -- and to host them at his expense for the hajj.\n\nSaudi state TV said already 100 Qataris had arrived at the border crossing on Thursday.\n\nThe decision came after Prince Mohammed met with Qatari royal family member Sheikh Abdullah Al Thani late Wednesday at a palace in Jiddah. Images broadcast on Saudi media showed the two men seated and smiling for cameras.\n\nSheikh Abdullah was quoted as telling the Saudi prince that the ties between the two countries \"are brotherly relations rooted in history.\" Saudi Arabia's crown prince responded in kind, emphasizing the historical ties between the two royal families, according to the Saudi Press Agency.\n\nIt was not clear, however, in what capacity Sheikh Abdullah was representing the Qatari government during the meeting. His grandfather, father and brother were rulers of Qatar until a palace coup ousted his branch of the royal family in 1972.\n\nThe meeting in Jiddah was the first by a Qatari to Saudi Arabia since a tense political standoff erupted 10 weeks ago when the kingdom, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt severed ties with Qatar. The quartet also halted direct flights, expelled Qatari residents and ordered their citizens in Qatar to leave. Saudi Arabia sealed Qatar's only land border.\n\nQatar's National Human Rights Committee issued a brief statement Thursday responding to what it said were \"reports in Saudi media\" outlining the kingdom's measures for Qatari pilgrims. The statement noted that the agreement does not include allowing Qatar Airways flights carrying pilgrims.\n\nThe committee expressed its \"satisfaction\" with the decisions, but reiterated its demands that the hajj not be politicized and said the Saudi measures remain \"unclear,\" particularly regarding the facilitation of hajj for foreigners residing in Qatar.\n\nThe committee also reiterated \"calls for further measures to lift the siege entirely on citizens and residents of Qatar,\" the statement said.\n\nQatar's human rights committee had previously filed a complaint with the U.N. special rapporteur on freedom of belief and religion over restrictions placed on its nationals who wanted to attend the hajj this year. Saudi Arabia's Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir said Qatar's complaint amounted to a \"declaration of war\" against the kingdom's management of the holy sites.\n\nDespite the goodwill measure announced Thursday, tensions remain. The quartet accuses the small Gulf nation of supporting extremists. Qatar denies the allegation and says the charges are politically motivated. At issue is Qatar's support for Islamist opposition groups in the region, which Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Egypt view as a threat.\n\nA top Emirati official, commenting on Thursday's breakthrough, called on Qatar to \"end its politicization of hajj.\" UAE Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, Anwar Gargash, also used the opportunity on Twitter to commend Saudi Arabia for the initiative to send planes.\n\nHundreds of thousands of pilgrims from around the world have already arrived in Saudi Arabia for the hajj, which begins late next week. Saudi Arabia prides itself on hosting millions of pilgrims annually at Islam's holiest sites in Mecca and Medina.\n\n___\n\nBatrawy reported from Dubai, United Arab Emirates.

He was responding to questions at a press conference in Sweden on Thursday.\n\nThe official Saudi Press Agency reported that Qatari pilgrims will be allowed to enter the kingdom by land and that pilgrims would then be flown onward from two Saudi airports in Dammam and al-Ahsa at the king's expense.\n\nThe king also ordered that aircraft from the country's flagship carrier be dispatched to Qatar's capital, Doha, to fly Qatari pilgrims to the Red Sea city of Jiddah -- nearest to Mecca -- and to host them at his expense for the hajj.\n\nSaudi state TV said already 100 Qataris had arrived at the border crossing on Thursday.\n\nThe decision came after Prince Mohammed met with Qatari royal family member Sheikh Abdullah Al Thani late Wednesday at a palace in Jiddah. Images broadcast on Saudi media showed the two men seated and smiling for cameras.\n\nSheikh Abdullah was quoted as telling the Saudi prince that the ties between the two countries \"are brotherly relations rooted in history.\" Saudi Arabia's crown prince responded in kind, emphasizing the historical ties between the two royal families, according to the Saudi Press Agency.\n\nIt was not clear, however, in what capacity Sheikh Abdullah was representing the Qatari government during the meeting. His grandfather, father and brother were rulers of Qatar until a palace coup ousted his branch of the royal family in 1972.\n\nThe meeting in Jiddah was the first by a Qatari to Saudi Arabia since a tense political standoff erupted 10 weeks ago when the kingdom, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt severed ties with Qatar. The quartet also halted direct flights, expelled Qatari residents and ordered their citizens in Qatar to leave. Saudi Arabia sealed Qatar's only land border.\n\nQatar's National Human Rights Committee issued a brief statement Thursday responding to what it said were \"reports in Saudi media\" outlining the kingdom's measures for Qatari pilgrims. The statement noted that the agreement does not include allowing Qatar Airways flights carrying pilgrims.\n\nThe committee expressed its \"satisfaction\" with the decisions, but reiterated its demands that the hajj not be politicized and said the Saudi measures remain \"unclear,\" particularly regarding the facilitation of hajj for foreigners residing in Qatar.\n\nThe committee also reiterated \"calls for further measures to lift the siege entirely on citizens and residents of Qatar,\" the statement said.\n\nQatar's human rights committee had previously filed a complaint with the U.N. special rapporteur on freedom of belief and religion over restrictions placed on its nationals who wanted to attend the hajj this year. Saudi Arabia's Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir said Qatar's complaint amounted to a \"declaration of war\" against the kingdom's management of the holy sites.\n\nDespite the goodwill measure announced Thursday, tensions remain. The quartet accuses the small Gulf nation of supporting extremists. Qatar denies the allegation and says the charges are politically motivated. At issue is Qatar's support for Islamist opposition groups in the region, which Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Egypt view as a threat.\n\nA top Emirati official, commenting on Thursday's breakthrough, called on Qatar to \"end its politicization of hajj.\" UAE Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, Anwar Gargash, also used the opportunity on Twitter to commend Saudi Arabia for the initiative to send planes.\n\nHundreds of thousands of pilgrims from around the world have already arrived in Saudi Arabia for the hajj, which begins late next week. Saudi Arabia prides itself on hosting millions of pilgrims annually at Islam's holiest sites in Mecca and Medina.\n\n___\n\nBatrawy reported from Dubai, United Arab Emirates.

His grandfather was the third ruler of Qatar, Sheikh Abdullah bin Jassem Al-Thani, his father was the fourth ruler of Qatar, Sheikh Ali bin Abdullah Al-Thani, and his brother was the fifth ruler of Qatar, Sheikh Ahmed bin Ali Al-Thani.\n\nSheikh Abdullah also tweeted that he requested that King Salman establish a hotline for Qataris who wish to visit relatives in Saudi Arabia.\n\n\"The king, as usual, approved my request and ordered the allocation of a special operations room to handle Qatari affairs run by a Saudi crew under my supervision, in light of the severed ties (between the two countries).\"\n\nHe went on to share the hotline number, saying: \"The special operations room for (the) Qatari people -- from pilgrims (to) visitors and business owners -- (is) 00966122367999.\"\n\nHe added: \"I call on all my brothers in Qatar, and those in need, to contact the number and their matters will be solved, God willing.\"\n\nHe later addressed rumors that Qatari currency would no longer be allowed in Saudi Arabia, saying: \"I asked my brother, the governor of the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency (SAMA), about the accuracy of the suspension of the Qatari Riyal exchange for Qatari citizens and (he) denied the news.\"\n\nMeanwhile, many other users suggested he is a \"sheikh of wisdom, voice of reason and a mediator for good.\"\n\nOthers, mainly media personalities linked to Doha, have been skeptical of Sheikh Abdullah's efforts and sought to ridicule his role and say that he does not represent the Qatari people or government.\n\nFor his part, Sheikh Abdullah went on to explain the intentions behind his mediation efforts, saying that he is working for the benefit and comfort of the Qatari people.\n\n\"The descendant of the rulers came looking for the interests of the brotherly Qatari people after the politically-adolescent approach adopted by the government of Qatar,\" said one Twitter user.\n\nEarlier, the Saudi king approved a plan to re-open the Salwa border crossing between Saudi Arabia and Qatar and also approved the dispatch of a private aircraft from Saudia's fleet to Doha to fly Qatari pilgrims to Jeddah.\n\nQatari pilgrims were also allowed to pass through the border crossing for Hajj without electronic permits.\n\nIt has been nearly three months since the Anti-Terror Quartet severed ties with Doha over accusations of its support for terror and meddling in the internal affairs of its neighbors.

Qatar responded by accusing Riyadh of politicising the Haj and the UN special rapporteur on freedom of religion expressed concern at Saudi Arabia's measures, BBC reported\n\nIn a statement carried by SPA, the Crown Prince thanked Sheikh Al Thani \"for his brotherly feelings\" as he stressed \"the depth of historical relations\" between Saudis and Qataris.\n\nObservers say that, despite this goodwill gesture, the dispute between Qatar and its neighbours, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Egypt and the UAE is far from over, the BBC report said.\n\n--IANS\n\nsoni/dg\n\nSEARCH", "dateTime":

The king also ordered that aircraft be dispatched to Qatar's capital, Doha, to fly Qatari pilgrims to the Red Sea city of Jiddah -- nearest to Mecca -- and to host them at his expense for the hajj.\n\nThe decision came after Saudi Arabia's Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman met with Qatari royal family member Sheikh Abdullah bin Ali Al Thani in Jiddah late Wednesday. Images broadcast on Saudi media showed the two princes seated and smiling for cameras.\n\nAl Thani was quoted as telling the Saudi prince that the ties between the two countries \"are brotherly relations rooted in history.\" Saudi Arabia's crown prince responded in kind, according to the Saudi Press Agency.\n\nThe meeting in Jiddah was the first by a Qatari emissary to Saudi Arabia since a tense political standoff erupted 10 weeks ago when the kingdom, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt severed ties with Qatar. The quartet also halted direct flights, expelled Qatari residents and ordered their citizens in Qatar to leave. Saudi Arabia sealed Qatar's only land border.\n\nDespite the goodwill measure announced Thursday, tensions remain. The quartet accuses the small Gulf nation of supporting extremists. Qatar denies the allegation and says the charges are politically motivated. At issue is Qatar's support for Islamist opposition groups in the region, which Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Egypt view as a threat.\n\nA top Emirati official, commenting on Thursday's breakthrough, called on Qatar to \"end its politicization of hajj.\" UAE Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, Anwar Gargash, also used the opportunity on Twitter to commend Saudi Arabia for the initiative to send planes.\n\nHundreds of thousands of pilgrims from around the world have already arrived in Saudi Arabia for the hajj, which begins late next week. Saudi Arabia prides itself on hosting millions of pilgrims annually at Islam's holiest sites in Mecca and Medina.\n\nQatar had previously filed a complaint with the U.N. special rapporteur on freedom of belief and religion over restrictions placed on its nationals who wanted to attend the hajj this year. Saudi Arabia's Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir responded to Qatar's complaint, saying it amounted to a \"declaration of war\" against the kingdom's management of the holy sites.", "dateTime":

The king also ordered that aircraft be dispatched to Qatar's capital, Doha, to fly Qatari pilgrims to the Red Sea city of Jiddah -- nearest to Mecca -- and to host them at his expense for the hajj.\n\nThe decision came after Saudi Arabia's Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman met with Qatari royal family member Sheikh Abdullah bin Ali Al Thani in Jiddah late Wednesday. Images broadcast on Saudi media showed the two princes seated and smiling for cameras.\n\nAl Thani was quoted as telling the Saudi prince that the ties between the two countries \"are brotherly relations rooted in history.\" Saudi Arabia's crown prince responded in kind, according to the Saudi Press Agency.\n\nThe meeting in Jiddah was the first by a Qatari emissary to Saudi Arabia since a tense political standoff erupted 10 weeks ago when the kingdom, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt severed ties with Qatar. The quartet also halted direct flights, expelled Qatari residents and ordered their citizens in Qatar to leave. Saudi Arabia sealed Qatar's only land border.\n\nDespite the goodwill measure announced Thursday, tensions remain. The quartet accuses the small Gulf nation of supporting extremists. Qatar denies the allegation and says the charges are politically motivated. At issue is Qatar's support for Islamist opposition groups in the region, which Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Egypt view as a threat.\n\nGet news headlines sent daily to your inbox Sign Up!

Saudi Arabia prides itself on hosting millions of pilgrims annually at Islam's holiest sites in Mecca and Medina.\n\nQatar had previously filed a complaint with the U.N. special rapporteur on freedom of belief and religion over restrictions placed on its nationals who wanted to attend the hajj this year. Saudi Arabia's Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir responded to Qatar's complaint, saying it amounted to a \"declaration of war\" against the kingdom's management of the holy sites.", "dateTime":

decision to reopen the two countries' border to Muslim pilgrims -- while lashing out at Riyadh's \"politicisation\" of religious freedoms.\n\n\"Regardless of the manner in which pilgrims from Qatar or living in Qatar were banned from the pilgrimage, which was politically motivated, and the manner in which they were subsequently permitted to make the pilgrimage, which was also politicised and which was announced with other goals in mind... the government of Qatar welcomes the decision and will respond positively,\" Foreign Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani told a press conference in Stockholm.\n\n\"What matters to us is the bottom line, which is that our citizens now have a way to attend the hajj (pilgrimage), and we uphold our demand that hajj be spared politicisation and remain separate from our political issues,\" Sheikh Mohammed said.\n\nSaudi Arabia has announced it would open the Salwa border crossing to Qatari pilgrims for the annual hajj pilgrimage to the city of Mecca, the birthplace of the Prophet Mohamed and Islam's holiest site, in the west of the kingdom.\n\nThe crossing had been sealed off for more than two months as a diplomatic crisis between the Saudi and Qatari governments has seen severe restrictions on travel imposed on citizens across the region.\n\nOn June 5, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt announced a cut in ties with Qatar, recalled ambassadors and sealed off borders and airspace to the emirate over allegations Doha backed Islamist extremists and was too close to Shiite Iran.\n\nQatar has denied the allegations.\n\nRiyadh's decision to reopen the border came hours after Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman met on Wednesday with Qatari envoy Sheikh Abdullah bin Ali bin Abdullah bin Jassim Al-Thani, a member of the ruling dynasty in Doha.\n\nThe Qatari foreign minister, however, said Sheikh Abdullah had acted on a \"personal initiative\" by meeting the crown prince in the Saudi city of Jeddah and not on behalf of the Doha government.\n\nDoha has consistently accused Riyadh of politicising the hajj and jeopardising the pilgrimage to Mecca.", "dateTime": "2017-08-17T10:15:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd":

The four countries, which have largely boycotted Qatar, accuse the country of supporting terrorism.\n\nSPA said the king's decision was \"based on the mediation efforts of Sheikh Abdullah bin Ali bin Abdullah bin Jassim Al Thani, a member of Qatar's ruling family.\"\n\nSalman dispatched Saudi Airlines planes to Hamad International Airport in Qatar to transport all pilgrims at his own expense to the city of Jeddah.\n\nIn June, the four nations broke off diplomatic relations with Doha's government.

Salwa border crossing, a key passage for Muslims on the annual Hajj pilgrimage, has been closed since June in a major diplomatic crisis that saw Riyadh and its regional allies cut relations with Doha over allegations that the emirate supported extremists, AFP reported on Friday.\n\nQatar has denied the charge and in turn accused Riyadh of politicizing the Hajj by restricting its citizens from making the pilgrimage to Mecca, the holiest site in Islam that is located in western Saudi Arabia.\n\nAround 120 Qataris entered Saudi territory on Thursday through the Salwa border, also known as Abu Samrah, Saudi state television reported, after King Salman called for the border to be opened for pilgrims without electronic permits.\n\nThe government separately allocated seven flights of the Saudi national carrier to bring pilgrims from Doha at the monarch's expense, state news agency SPA announced.\n\nQatar welcomed the decision but also lashed out at what it called Riyadh's politicization of religious freedoms.\n\n\"Regardless of the manner in which pilgrims from Qatar were banned from the pilgrimage, which was politically motivated... the government of Qatar welcomes the decision and will respond positively,\" Qatari Foreign Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani told reporters on a visit to Stockholm.\n\n\"What matters to us is the bottom line, which is that our citizens now have a way to attend the Hajj, and we uphold our demand that Hajj be spared politicization.\"\n\nThe Hajj, a pillar of Islam that capable Muslims must perform at least once, is to take place this year

trade ties with Qatar in what has evolved as the worst political crisis to grip the Persian Gulf region in decades.\n\nThe kingdom's decision to reopen the frontier came shortly after its powerful Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman met Qatari envoy Sheikh Abdullah bin Ali bin Abdullah bin Jassim Al Thani, a member of Qatar's ruling dynasty.\n\nThe meeting on Wednesday in the Saudi Red Sea city of Jeddah was the first public high-level encounter between the nations since the crisis erupted more than two months ago.\n\nThe Qatari foreign minister, however, said that Sheikh Abdullah had acted on

King Salman also ordered the dispatching of Saudi Airlines planes to Doha to transport Qatari pilgrims for free to Jeddah, the closest airport to Makkah where the Haj rituals are held annually.\n\nAdvertisement Following the decisions, King Salman received Shaikh Abdullah and discussed the issue of Qatari pilgrims.\n\n\"I am grateful to King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammad for their gracious hospitality and their generous responses,\" Shaikh Abdullah said. \"Their keenness on the interests of the people of Qatar prompted me to request a hotline to ease the travel of Qataris to their families or to their properties in Saudi Arabia. I call upon all Qataris who have any kind of request to call 00966 122367999.\"\n\nShaikh Abdullah added that the governor of the Saudi central bank denied allegations that the Qatari riyal was no longer traded in Saudi Arabia and assured him that there were no measures against it and that the currency was accepted in the kingdom.\n\nSaudi Arabia on June 5 severed its diplomatic and trade relations with Qatar and closed the Salwa border crossing, the only terrestrial link between the two neighbours.\n\nQataris were not allowed into Saudi Arabia, but the measure did not include those planning to perform Umrah or Haj.\n\nHead of customs at Salwa border crossing, Othman Al Gamdi, told Saudi daily Okaz that more than 200 Qatari pilgrims had crossed into the kingdom in the first hours of the re-opening.\n\n\"We recorded 350 vehicles, including 50 used by pilgrims and 300 by mixed Saudi-Qatari families,\" he was quoted as saying. \"There are instructions to facilitate the procedures for all Qatari pilgrims to ensure their smooth passage.

nationals who wish to enter for hajj without electronic permits\", state news agency SPA announced.\n\nHe also ordered that private jets belonging to Saudi airlines be sent to Doha airport \"to bring all Qatari pilgrims at his expense\".\n\nQatar's foreign minister welcomed the decision but lashed out at Riyadh's ongoing \"politicisation\" of religious freedoms.\n\n\"Regardless of the manner in which pilgrims from Qatar or living in Qatar were banned from the pilgrimage, which was politically motivated, and the manner in which they were subsequently permitted to make the pilgrimage, which was also politicised and which was announced with other goals in mind... the government of Qatar welcomes the decision and will respond positively,\" Foreign Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani told a press conference in Stockholm.\n\n\"What matters to us is the bottom line, which is that our citizens now have a way to attend the hajj, and we uphold our demand that hajj be spared

King Salman also ordered the dispatching of Saudi Airlines planes to Doha to transport Qatari pilgrims for free to Jeddah, the closest airport to Makkah where the Haj rituals are held annually.\n\nFollowing the decisions, King Salman received Shaikh Abdullah and discussed the issue of Qatari pilgrims.\n\n\"I am grateful to King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammad for their gracious hospitality and their generous responses,\" Shaikh Abdullah said. \"Their keenness on the interests of the people of Qatar prompted me to request a hotline to ease the travel of Qataris to their families or to their properties in Saudi Arabia. I call upon all Qataris who have any kind of request to call 00966 122367999.\"\n\nShaikh Abdullah added that the governor of the Saudi central bank denied allegations that the Qatari riyal was no longer traded in Saudi Arabia and assured him that there were no measures against it and that the currency was accepted in the kingdom.\n\nSaudi Arabia on June 5 severed its diplomatic and trade relations with Qatar and closed the Salwa border crossing, the only terrestrial link between the two neighbours.\n\nQataris were not allowed into Saudi Arabia, but the measure did not include those planning to perform Umrah or Haj.\n\nHead of customs at Salwa border crossing, Othman Al Gamdi, told Saudi daily Okaz that more than 200 Qatari pilgrims had crossed into the kingdom in the first hours of the re-opening.\n\n\"We recorded 350 vehicles, including 50 used by pilgrims and 300 by mixed Saudi-Qatari families,\" he was quoted as saying. \"There are instructions to facilitate the procedures for all Qatari pilgrims to ensure their smooth passage. There is a high level of coordination between all government departments at the crossing to serve the guests of God.\"", "dateTime": "2017-08-19T11:10:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 1696, "textStart": 1690, "date": "-06-05", "amb": false}], "sim": 0.7058823704719543, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-19", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3367569", "time": "11:10:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3367569", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "187", "label": {"eng": "State of Qatar"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qatar", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "State of Qatar"}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "193", "label": {"eng": "Kingdom of Saudi Arabia"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Kingdom of Saudi Arabia"}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "1683", "label": {"eng": "Mecca"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mecca", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mecca"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Kingdom of Saudi Arabia"}}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "1708", "label": {"eng": "Jeddah"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeddah", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jeddah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Kingdom of Saudi Arabia"}}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "1761", "label": {"eng": "Al Min\u0163aqah ash Sharq\u012byah"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Province,_Saudi_Arabia", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Al Min\u0163aqah ash Sharq\u012byah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Kingdom of Saudi Arabia"}}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "1847", "label": {"eng": "Ad Damm\u0101m"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dammam", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ad Damm\u0101m"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Kingdom of Saudi Arabia"}}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "8706", "label": {"eng": "Doha"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doha", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Doha"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "State of Qatar"}}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "8732", "label": {"eng": "Manama"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manama", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Kingdom of Bahrain"}}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "302993", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Currency"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency", "score": 2}, {"id": "303301", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Muhammad"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad", "score": 5}, {"id": "304655", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "score": 2}, {"id": "313845", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Crown prince"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_prince", "score": 4}, {"id": "314196", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "House of Saud"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Saud", "score": 3}, {"id": "318182", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "House of Thani"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Thani", "score": 3}, {"id": "322040", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Ali"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali", "score": 3}, {"id": "323603", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Hajj"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hajj", "score": 4}, {"id": "345713", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Qatari riyal"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qatari_riyal", "score": 2}, {"id": "348936", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Umrah"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umrah", "score": 2}, {"id": "376507", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Sheikh Abdullah"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh_Abdullah", "score": 5}, {"id": "379320", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Terrestrial animal"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrestrial_animal", "score": 2}, {"id": "380351", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Saudia"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudia", "score": 3}, {"id": "548213", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Okaz"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okaz", "score": 1}, {"id": "1044837", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Salman of Saudi Arabia"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salman_of_Saudi_Arabia", "score": 5}], "image": "http://static.gulfnews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2076527!/image/3258557993.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_460346/3258557993.jpg", "timeCrawl": "11:10:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "Riyadh sets up operation room for Qatari pilgrims and visitors", "originalArticle": null}

Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Egypt and Bahrain cut ties with Qatar over its alleged support of terrorism -- a charge it has denied.\n\nSaudi Arabia said the Hajj decrees emerged from mediation between Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Qatari Sheikh Abdullah bin Ali Al Thani, the brother of Qatar's former ruler, Emir Sheikh Ahmad bin Ali Al Thani, who was deposed in 1972.\n\nThese are the first known negotiations between Saudi and Qatari royals since the start of the diplomatic crisis.\n\nQatar FM: Hajj decrees 'politically motivated'\n\nQatar's Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani said his country welcomed the move, though he considered it \"politically motivated.\"\n\n\"Despite the fact it's been politically motivated to ban the Qatari people haj and politically to allow them ... we welcome such a step, which is a step forward to get rid of this blockade which is imposed against my country,\" the minister told a news conference on a visit to Sweden, according to Reuters.\n\nQatar's National Human Rights Committee said it was \"satisfied\" with the move, but asked for further clarification about procedures. It is unclear whether Sheikh Abdullah's role in the mediation was sanctioned by the Qatari government.\n\nQatar's National Human Rights Committee had previously said that Saudi Arabia was restricting Qataris' access to the pilgrimage.\n\nEvery year, millions of Muslims from around the world make their way to the holy city of Mecca in Saudi Arabia to mark the Hajj.\n\nThe pilgrimage -- which this year starts on August 30 -- is one of the pillars of Islam that all Muslims who are financially and physically able must perform at least once in their lifetime.\n\nOfficials from other boycotting Arab states appeared to endorse Saudi Arabia's announcement.\n\n\"The facilitation of Qatari Hajj pilgrims ordered by King Salman have never been done before for any Islamic country and even under regular circumstances,\" Bahrain's Foreign Minister Sheikh Khalid bin Ahmed Al Khalifa said in a tweet Thursday.\n\nThe UAE's minister of state for foreign affairs, Anwar al-Gargash, lambasted Qatar's criticisms of Saudi Arabia's dealings with Qatari pilgrims.\n\n\"Qatar's politicization of Hajj must come to an end following the initiative taken by King Salman,\" Gargash said. \"There are matters that rise above politics.\"\n\nTM & \u00a9 2017 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Egypt and Bahrain cut ties with Qatar over its alleged support of terrorism -- a charge it has denied.\n\nSaudi Arabia said the Hajj decrees emerged from mediation between Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Qatari Sheikh Abdullah bin Ali Al Thani, the brother of Qatar's former ruler, Emir Sheikh Ahmad bin Ali Al Thani, who was deposed in 1972.\n\nThese are the first known negotiations between Saudi and Qatari royals since the start of the diplomatic crisis.\n\nQatar FM: Hajj decrees 'politically motivated'\n\nQatar's Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani said his country welcomed the move, though he considered it \"politically motivated.\"\n\n\"Despite the fact it's been politically motivated to ban the Qatari people haj and politically to allow them ... we welcome such a step, which is a step forward to get rid of this blockade which is imposed against my country,\" the minister told a news conference on a visit to Sweden, according to Reuters.\n\nQatar's National Human Rights Committee said it was \"satisfied\" with the move, but asked for further clarification about procedures. It is unclear whether Sheikh Abdullah's role in the mediation was sanctioned by the Qatari government.\n\nQatar's National Human Rights Committee had previously said that Saudi Arabia was restricting Qataris' access to the pilgrimage.\n\nEvery year, millions of Muslims from around the world make their way to the holy city of Mecca in Saudi Arabia to mark the Hajj.\n\nThe pilgrimage -- which this year starts on August 30 -- is one of the pillars of Islam that all Muslims who are financially and physically able must perform at least once in their lifetime.\n\nOfficials from other boycotting Arab states appeared to endorse Saudi Arabia's announcement.\n\n\"The facilitation of Qatari Hajj pilgrims ordered by King Salman have never been done before for any Islamic country and even under regular circumstances,\" Bahrain's Foreign Minister Sheikh Khalid bin Ahmed Al Khalifa said in a tweet Thursday.\n\nThe UAE's minister of state for foreign affairs, Anwar al-Gargash, lambasted Qatar's criticisms of Saudi Arabia's dealings with Qatari pilgrims.\n\n\"Qatar's politicization of Hajj must come to an end following the initiative taken by King Salman,\" Gargash said. \"There are matters

Wednesday [Anadolu]\n\nKing Salman issues decree offering concessions to Qatari pilgrims following mediation between Saudi crown prince and Qatari royal.\n\nQatar and Saudi Arabia appeared to thaw relations slightly on Wednesday when Riyadh announced that Qatari Hajj pilgrims will be allowed to enter Saudi Arabia by land without electronic permits.\n\nThe royal decree giving the instructions followed mediation efforts between Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman and Qatari royal Sheikh Abdullah bin Jassem al-Thani, according to the Saudi Press Agency.\n\nAs a result of the mediation, Saudi monarch King Salman also ordered that Qatari pilgrims arriving at King Fahad International Airport and al-Ahsa International Airport be provided with free airport transfers on arrival.\n\nThe king has also ordered that national airline planes be sent to Doha to transport Qatari pilgrims directly to Jeddah at his own expense, the SPA reported.\n\nSaudi Arabia and other Gulf countries have enforced a blockade on Qatar, which includes restrictions on Doha flights through its airspace.\n\nDespite the meeting being reported as an occasion during which the Qatari royal \"affirmed that the brotherly relations between the Kingdom and Qatar are deeply rooted in history\", it is not likely to be indicative of a broader cooling in relations between the two disputing states.\n\nWhile Bin Salman has been at the centre of Saudi Arabia's recent foreign policy decisions, Bin Jassem al-Thani is a cousin of the current Qatari emir but not from the leader's inner circle.\n\nA cousin of Emir Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, bin Jassem's father's status as Qatar's heir apparent ended when his grandfather was ousted by the current ruler's grandfather.\n\nIn light of this, Saudi mediation efforts with different sections of the Qatari ruling family may also be seen as part of the kingdom's manoeuvres in Doha.\n\nSince the beginning of the Gulf crisis in May, it has been widely speculated that the hacking of Qatar's official news agency was an attempt to instigate a palace coup.\n\nThe intended coup, it is assumed, would see Emir Tamim replaced by a Qatari royal more inclined toward the UAE and Saudi Arabia's foreign policy.\n\nSince May, Qatar has been locked in a diplomatic dispute with Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, the UAE and Egypt over Doha's alleged support for terrorism.\n\nQatar has vehemently denied the charges levelled against it by the four Arab states and has slammed the crisis as an effort to undermine the state's independent foreign policy.\n\nBlocking entry to the Hajj piligrims to Muslims from a country for political reasons would be a highly controversial move for Saudi Arabia and its custody of Islam's holiest sites might be called into question.", "dateTime":

Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Egypt and Bahrain cut ties with Qatar over its alleged support of terrorism -- a charge it has denied.Saudi Arabia said the Hajj decrees emerged from mediation between Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Qatari Sheikh Abdullah bin Ali Al Thani, the brother of Qatar's former ruler, Emir Sheikh Ahmad bin Ali Al Thani, who was deposed in 1972.These are the first known negotiations between Saudi and Qatari royals since the start of the diplomatic crisis.Read MoreQatar FM: Hajj decrees 'politically motivated'Qatar's Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani said his country welcomed the move, though he considered it \"politically motivated.\"\"Despite the fact it's been politically motivated to ban the Qatari people haj and politically to allow them ... we welcome such a step, which is a step forward to get rid of this blockade which is imposed against my country,\" the minister told a news conference on a visit to Sweden, according to Reuters. Qatar's National Human Rights Committee said it was \"satisfied\" with the move, but asked for further clarification about procedures. It is unclear whether Sheikh Abdullah's role in the mediation was sanctioned by the Qatari government.Qatar's National Human Rights Committee had previously said that Saudi Arabia was restricting Qataris' access to the pilgrimage. Every year, millions of Muslims from around the world make their way to the holy city of Mecca in Saudi Arabia to mark the Hajj.The pilgrimage -- which this year starts on August 30 -- is one of the pillars of Islam that all Muslims who are financially and physically able must perform at least once in their lifetime. Officials from other boycotting Arab states appeared to endorse Saudi Arabia's announcement.\"The facilitation of Qatari Hajj pilgrims ordered by King Salman have never been done before for any Islamic country and even under regular circumstances,\" Bahrain's Foreign Minister Sheikh Khalid bin Ahmed Al Khalifa said in a tweet Thursday.The UAE's minister of state for foreign affairs, Anwar

So far, 120 Qatari pilgrims have used the crossing under King Salman's Guests' Program, Saudi Television and Al Arabiya reported quoting sources. They were accorded a warm welcome.\n\nMeanwhile, Qatari Foreign Minister Mohammed Bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani welcomed Saudi Arabia's decision to reopen the two countries' border to the pilgrims. He made the statement at a press conference in Stockholm.\n\nMeanwhile, Abdul Hakeem Al-Tamimi, President of the General Authority of Civil Aviation (GACA), directed officials at King Fahd International Airport in Dammam and Al-Ahsa International Airport to offer the best possible services to the Qatari brethren.\n\nAl-Tamimi thanked the King and the Crown Prince for their initiatives to remove all hurdles in the way of the Qatari pilgrims. \"In line with the royal directive, airports in Dammam and Al-Ahsa as well as King Abdulaziz International Airport in Jeddah and Prince Muhammad International Airport in Madinah will exert all efforts and mobilize all their potentials to serve the Qatari pilgrims,\" he said.\n\nAl-Tamimi welcomed the Qatari pilgrims, ensuring them all the facilities and services in enabling them to perform their rituals in ease and comfort.\n\nMinister of Transport Sulaiman Al-Hamdan said all sectors under the Kingdom's transport system have been geared up to materialize the royal directives in serving the Qatari pilgrims.\n\n\"The Public Transport Authority has permitted all those associated with land transport to make available all facilities and services for the Qatari pilgrims. All preparations are well in place at the airports in Dammam and Al-Ahsa as well as in Jeddah and Madinah to receive the pilgrims from Qatar,\" he said adding that all roads from Salwa border point to the airports in the Eastern Province are well-poised to facilitate the pilgrim's travel. Al-Ahsa mayoralty has completed its preparations to receive pilgrims from Qatar, Oman and United Arab Emirates at the Pilgrims City on Salwa Road.\n\nThe Qatari pilgrims said that they are expecting the pace to accelerate and that all actions have been taken to facilitate their entry and pilgrimage.\n\nThe royal decree came upon the mediation of Sheikh Abdullah Bin Ali Bin Abdullah Bin Jassem Al-Thani, Saudi Press Agency reported. King Salman also ordered transportation of all Qatari pilgrims from Dammam and Al-Ahsa airports be done free of charge as part of the King Salman Program for Haj and Umrah.\n\nIn addition, King Salman ordered to send Saudi Arabian Airlines planes to Doha to transport all Qatari pilgrims directly to Jeddah and for all their costs to be covered at his expense.\n\nCrown Prince Muhammad Bin Salman had on Wednesday received Sheikh Abdullah at Al-Salam Palace in Jeddah. During the meeting, Sheikh Abdullah affirmed that the brotherly relations between the Kingdom and Qatar are deeply rooted in history. Sheikh Abdullah offered to mediate to open the Salwa border crossing to allow Qatari pilgrims to enter the Kingdom.\n\nThe Crown Prince thanked Sheikh Abdullah for affirming the depth of historic relations between Qatar and Saudi Arabia, their citizens and the leadership in the Kingdom with the royal family of Qatar.\n\nMeanwhile, a Qatari semi-government rights body gave a cautious welcome to the Saudi move, according to agencies. \"This is a step toward removing the obstacles and difficulties (Qataris) faced during Haj procedures this year,\" the National Human Rights Committee said in a statement.\n\nThe committee expressed its satisfaction with the decisions, but reiterated its demands that the Haj not be politicized and said the Saudi measures remain \"unclear,\" particularly regarding the facilitation of Haj for foreigners residing in Qatar. The statement noted that the agreement does not include allowing Qatar Airways flights carrying pilgrims. The statement also called \"for further measures to lift the siege entirely on citizens and residents of Qatar.\"", "dateTime": "2017-08-18T02:57:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim":

Doha refused to fulfill these requirements calling the list unrealistic and not actionable.\n\nThe Qatar crisis remains the most important issue in the Middle East. Many countries, including the US, Turkey and Russia, expressed willingness to mediate between the conflicting sides.\n\nIn 2017, the Hajj, the annual Islamic pilgrimage to Mecca, is expected to begin on August 30 and last until September 4.\n\nJeddah is the airport hub for pilgrims travelling to Mecca and Medina to perform the annual Hajj pilgrimage.

Doha wanted to politicize Hajj, but Riyadh offered all assistance to them to come to the Kingdom for the annual pilgrimage by opening the border and ordering Saudi Arabian Airlines aircraft to be dispatched to Doha to bring Qatari pilgrims to Jeddah,\" he added.\n\n\"Also, Qatari nationals who wish to enter the Kingdom for Hajj will be allowed to come without electronic permits, which were previously required.\"\n\nSaying the Kingdom does not politicize Hajj, Al-Shehri said: \"This is Saudi Arabia, generous and large-hearted. All the time we're interested in helping people and making everything easy for those coming to perform Hajj and Umrah.\"\n\nSalman Al-Ansari, president of the Washington-based Saudi American Public Relation Affairs Committee (SAPRAC), told Arab News that the initiative \"shows how much King Salman cares about the Qatari people.\"\n\nDescribing the move as \"generous,\" the UAE's Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Anwar Al-Gargash tweeted: \"Saudi Arabia proved how large-hearted it is; now Qatar's politics and politicization of the pilgrimage must end after the generous initiative of King Salman. There are things that are above politics.\"\n\nBahraini Foreign Minister Sheikh Khalid bin Ahmed Al-Khalifa described the move as \"unprecedented,\" tweeting that it \"has never been done before for any Islamic country, even under normal circumstances.\"\n\nKing Salman's patronage of pilgrims is a \"historic responsibility that the Kingdom has undertaken for all countries, and no one can deny that,\" Al-Khalifa said.\n\nThe Muslim World League (MWL) also applauded the king's order, saying Saudi Arabia is governed by Islamic law derived from the Holy Qur'an and Sunnah, and its policies help unite the Ummah.\n\nThe plan to reopen the border and dispatch aircraft to Doha was submitted to the king by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who earlier met visiting Qatari Sheikh Abdullah bin Ali bin Abdullah bin Jassem Al-Thani at the Al-Salam Palace in Jeddah. The meeting was the first with a Qatari leader since the start of the rift in June.\n\nThe king also ordered that all Qatari pilgrims be transported to King Fahd, Dammam and Al-Ahsa airports as his guests.\n\nAll expenses are to be paid under the program of the Guests of King Salman for Hajj and Umrah.\n\nSalwa, Qatar's only border crossing, was closed in June when Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, the UAE and Egypt cut ties with Doha, accusing it of backing terrorist groups and developing ties with Iran, which is fomenting sectarian strife in the region.", "dateTime": "2017-08-18T02:56:00Z",

King Salman's issuance of several decrees to facilitate Haj pilgrimage for Qataris has been broadly praised by Gulf citizens and officials. Early yesterday, the king ruled that: 1) The Salwa land border crossing with Qatar be opened. 2) He offered to pay for Qatari flights to Saudi Arabia to perform Haj. 3) He offered Saudi Arabian Airlines to fly the pilgrims in for free. 4) He waived electronic permits for Qatari pilgrims.\n\nPreviously, Qataris registered to perform Haj were told to fly into Saudi Arabia, but Riyadh maintained its ban on Qatar Airways and kept its land border closed after a serious diplomatic rift emerged between Saudi Arabia, UAE, Bahrain and Egypt on one side and Qatar on the other. The Arab bloc accuses Qatar of financing terrorism and supporting the Muslim Brotherhood. Qatar has tirelessly worked to make Saudi Arabia appear as the aggressor in the international community.\n\nThe situation got entirely out of hand when the Qatari-backed Al Jazeera television network suggested that Haj operations be internationalised, claiming Saudis were discriminating against Qatari citizens from carrying out their religious duties. It has also spread lies by saying that Qatari citizens were banned from entering the Grand Mosque. Saudi officials, shocked by the outrageous suggestion, declared the call \"a declaration of war\".\n\nDespite their countless attempts, Qatar has largely failed to prove its isolation. However, instead of stooping to Qatar's level, King Salman has shown the kingdom's true humanitarian face and a big heart.\n\nHaj is a religious duty on all Muslims who are financially and physically capable of making the journey. Therefore, to taint the holy occasion by throwing around reckless accusations, is a serious offence and Qatar should be called out on that. Saudi Arabia has made it abundantly clear that all pilgrims, regardless of their country's politics, are welcome to carry out their religious obligations in the kingdom.\n\nKing Salman has done a commendable service to Qataris and gone above and beyond lifting land border closures by offering to finance their pilgrimages.\n\nThe offer speaks volumes of the Saudi kingdom's commitment to helping Muslims all over the world carry out their religious duties and is a loud-and-clear response to Qatar's senseless accusations.", "dateTime": "2017-08-17T15:11:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.6705882549285889, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3367569", "time": "15:11:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3367569", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "1", "label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Arab_Emirates", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "22", "label": {"eng": "Kingdom of Bahrain"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bahrain", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Kingdom of Bahrain"}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "64", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "187", "label": {"eng": "State of Qatar"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qatar", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "State of Qatar"}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "193", "label": {"eng": "Kingdom of Saudi Arabia"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Kingdom of Saudi Arabia"}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "1765", "label": {"eng": "Riyadh"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riyadh", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Riyadh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Kingdom of Saudi Arabia"}}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "302894", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Pilgrimage"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilgrimage", "score": 5}, {"id": "303629", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Muslim"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim", "score": 2}, {"id": "305826", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Qatar Airways"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qatar_Airways", "score": 3}, {"id": "309890", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Arab people"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_people", "score": 3}, {"id": "315175", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Muslim Brotherhood"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim_Brotherhood", "score": 3}, {"id": "317462", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Al Jazeera"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Jazeera", "score": 2}, {"id": "317944", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Arabian Peninsula"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabian_Peninsula", "score": 5}, {"id": "323603", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Hajj"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hajj", "score": 5}, {"id": "334821", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Masjid al-Haram"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masjid_al-Haram", "score": 2}, {"id": "359290", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Open border"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_border", "score": 3}, {"id": "380351", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Saudia"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudia", "score": 3}, {"id": "1044837", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Salman of Saudi Arabia"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salman_of_Saudi_Arabia", "score": 5}], "image": null, "timeCrawl": "15:11:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "Salman's gesture to Qataris reveals a big heart", "originalArticle": null}

They have also been exempted from obtaining mandatory electronic visas.\n\nUp until noon on Thursday, some 120 Qatari pilgrims had crossed the Salwa border in buses or in their own personal vehicles, the Saudi Passport General Department told Asharq Al-Awsat.\n\nQatari Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani and the National Human Rights Committee in Qatar welcomed on Thursday Riyadh's order to open the passage.\n\nKing Salman's decision to open the border crossing and cover the expenses of the Qatari pilgrims came after Vice Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques Prince Mohammed bin Salman held talks with Qatari mediator Sheikh Abdullah bin Ali bin Abdullah bin Jassem Al Thani. Discussions focused on allowing Qatari pilgrims to enter the Kingdom without electronic visas.\n\nBahraini Foreign Minister Sheikh Khalid bin Ahmed Al Khalifa said that King Salman's order was

The sheikh extended his mediation to open the Salwa border crossing for the entry of Qatari pilgrims to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia's territories,\" the SPA said.\n\nAlso allowed to pass through the border crossing are all Qatari nationals who wish to enter Saudi Arabia for Hajj without electronic permits.\n\nThe king also directed that all Qatari pilgrims be transported from King Fahad International Airport in Dammam and Al-Ahsa International Airport as his guests. All expenses are to be paid for by the King, under the Program of the Guests of Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud for Hajj and Umrah.\n\nThe Salwa crossing, Qatar's only land border outlet, was closed in June when Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt declared a boycott of Qatar.\n\nThe four Arab states, collectively called the Anti-Terror Quartet (ATQ), have accused Doha of hosting or supporting terrorist organizations and individuals, as well as maintaining close ties with Iran, which the ATQ have accused of trying to destabilize the region by fomenting sectarian strife.\n\nCrown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's meeting with Sheikh Abdullah bin Ali's was the first with a Qatari leader since the dispute came to a head.\n\nIn a statement carried by SPA, the Crown Prince thanked Sheikh Abdullah bin Ali \"for his brotherly feelings\" as he stressed \"the depth of historical relations\" between Saudis and Qataris\n\nSaudi Arabia and Qatar are both members of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), along with Bahrain, the UAE, Kuwait and Oman.\n\nSaudi officials had earlier said Qatari pilgrims are welcome to come to the Kingdom to perform Hajj in Makkah despite the ongoing dispute.\n\nThe hajj, a pillar of Islam that capable Muslims must perform at least once in a lifetime, is to take place this year at the end of

would remained closed.\n\nQatari pilgrims were directed to fly into the two international airports on the west coast, Jeddah and Madinah, to reach Makkah and perform Haj.\n\nHowever, on Thursday, King Salman ordered the re-opening of the Salwa land border crossing, offered to pay for Qataris flying from Saudi Arabia's Eastern Province airports to Jeddah or Medina or flying from Qatar on Saudi Arabian Airlines, and waives electronic permits for Qatari pilgrims.\n\nThe decisions, unprecedented for any Islamic nation, drew praise on social media and were welcomed by Qatar.\n\nHaj, the fifth pillar of Islam, is required from all physically-fit and financially-able adult Muslims at least once.\n\nBased on the lunar Islamic calendar, the six-day Haj season is expected to start on August

There are matters that are nobler than politics,\" he wrote on his Twitter account.\n\nOn Thursday, there was no official reaction from Qatar, but several Qataris took to social media to welcome the decisions, hoping for easier days ahead following weeks of tension with unprecedented levels.\n\n\"In the name of the people of Qatar, I thank King Salman Bin Abdul Aziz Al Saud,\" Rashed Al Merri tweeted on the microblog.\n\n\"We are grateful for the royal generosity towards the people of Qatar that shall be recalled forever.\"\n\nIn another tweet, he said that Shaikh Abdullah Bon Ali Bin Abdullah Bin Jassem Al Thani \"went to Saudi Arabia and found a solution, unlike the current government that embarked on shuttle trips to the West and could not find a solution.\"\n\nShaikh Abdullah is the Qatari shaikh who on Wednesday met Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman Al Saud and discussed with him the case of Qatari pilgrims.\n\nKing Salman's decisions to ease restrictions on Qataris, to host Qatari pilgrims and to offer them free transport to perform Haj were based on Prince Mohammad's views following his meeting with Shaikh Abdullah.\n\nShuhood Nayef Al Khalid, another social media user, shared her gratitude to King Salman.\n\n\"Haj in King's hospitality, private aircraft, entry from the land border without permits, thanks to King Salman,\" she said.\n\nHowever, Fatima Al Hudifi posted on her account that \"there was no need for charity work towards the richest nation on the planet.\"\n\nIn Saudi Arabia, users heaped praise on King Salman, offering prayers and expressing gratitude for his decisions.\n\nZahwa Al Zamil said the situation had become clear for all to see and assess.\n\n\"Qataris have been given what no other country has ever received. The Qatari government will assume full responsibility if it does not allow its people to perform Haj,\" she said.\n\nA Saudi user said that Qataris had become more fortunate than Saudis planning to perform Haj.\n\n\"Qataris no longer need a permit and are exceptionally pampered, unlike me a Saudi national who needs a permit to reach Makkah,\" the user, writing under the moniker of \"Das\", posted.\n\nIn June, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain severed diplomatic relations with Qatar, accusing Doha of supporting terrorism.\n\nThe Qatari foreign minister made a surprise visit to Kuwait, which has been mediating to resolve the crisis, on Wednesday but no details were released on what the officials discussed.\n\nEarlier this month, Kuwait's Ruler sent messages to the leaders of the four countries boycotting Qatar, in a move seen by the media as a new Kuwaiti initiative to resolve the crisis.\n\nThe four states have imposed a sea, land and air embargo on Qatar and presented a list of demands for Doha failing which it faces further sanctions.\n\nLast week, Kuwait expressed readiness to provide guarantees, jointly with the United States and the Arab bloc, to ensure that \"no harm is caused by Qatar\".\n\nThe guarantee offer is part of the efforts exerted by Kuwait to mediate in one of the worst crises to hit the Gulf and to prepare for direct dialogue between the Quartet and Qatar.\n\nKuwait has been pushing for mediation that would bring the two sides together.\n\nA first mediation effort ended without visible progress, and the two sides, while acknowledging the significance of the Kuwaiti role, did not budge from their positions.\n\nA second drive was launched by Kuwait when envoys of Emir Shaikh Sabah Al Ahmad Al Jaber Al Sabah on

He served in IDF Military Intelligence for 25 years, specializing in Arab political discourse, Arab mass media, Islamic groups and the Syrian domestic arena. Thoroughly familiar with Arab media in real time, he is frequently interviewed on the various news programs in Israel.More from the author \u25ba\n\nWednesday, August 23, 2017, is the first day of Zhu-l-Hijjat, the Muslim month in which two important events take place: The pilgrimage to Mecca, one of the most central of the five Islamic commandments, and the Holiday of the Offering, Id al-Adha, with which it comes to an end.\n\nThis month is notable in the Muslim world as a result of its religious content, but also due to the political aspects that accompany that content. It is well known that in Islam there can be no separation between religion and state, between religious factors, public issues and politics.\n\nThe Hajj ceremonies in Mecca and its environs last for nine days, from the first to the ninth of the month, with each day having its own specific rituals. The tenth day marks the start of Id al-Adha, the holiday of the offering, which lasts for four days, until the 13th. The House of Saud appointed itself \"guardian of the holy places\" in 1925 when it took over the Hajj. It manages the Hajj with a powerful hand, making sure that all pilgrims observe the rituals in the traditional Islamic manner as interpreted by the Saudi monarchy. This fact is of great significance, because it proves that the Saudi ruler, and no one else, is the most important figure in the Islamic world.\n\nThe decision about when the month of the Hajj begins is an example of this power. The first day of each of the months making up the Islamic year is set by the Sharia court in each country, using the testimony of witnesses who see the new moon with their own eyes and testify to the court. That naturally leads to the months and the 30 day Ramadan fast beginning on different days in various countries, because if it is cloudy and the moon cannot be seen in a specific country, the month is 30 days long, while somewhere else it might be of only 29 days duration. That is why Ramadan, which begins on the first day of the ninth Hajjidic month, does not start on the same day everywhere in the Islamic world.\n\nIn addition, there are cities, such as Bagdad, where there are both Sunni and Shiite residents with separate courts. Sometimes the Sunnis begin a new month while it is the last day of the previous month for the Shiites living in the same city and sometimes it is the other way around due to the different decisions of their separate courts. This is most conspicuous during Ramadan, when one sect begins to fast while the other is still eating; then at the end of the month when the Eid al Fitr holiday begins, the first group celebrates with food and drink while the second is still fasting.\n\nThe month of Hajj differs from other months because the entire Islamic world takes part in the pilgrimage and has to accept the Saudi calendar in order to participate in the date-dependent ceremonies. This includes the Shiites, who refuse to recognize Sunni hegemony over holy Islamic sites, but have no choice but to accept Saudi dictation. The Saudis take advantage of their power and stress the unity of Islam achieved during the period of their control. There were years when the Shiites, mainly Iranians, refused to accept Saudi rule and carried out rituals foreign to Sunni tradition, leading to riots and the death of a large number of pilgrims.\n\nThe rising tensions between Iran and Saudi Arabia as a result of their major conflicts over Syria, Yemen, Iraq and Lebanon, caused Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah ali Khamenei to fear a bloodbath at the Hajj of 2016. He accordingly moved the pilgrimage site to Karbala, Iraq, where in 680 C.E. Mohammed's grandson Hussein ben Ali was beheaded by the Sunni Caliph Yazid ben Mu'awiya's army. One million Iranian pilgrims arrived in Karbala and celebrated the holiday in memory of Hussein ben Ali.\n\nSunni elders, including Egyptian Sheikh Alazar publicized opinions criticizing the Iranian move, accusing Khameini of deepening the schism in Islam. Other Sunnis, mostly Saudi, said that Shiites followed the devil, not Allah, in moving the Hajj from Mecca.\n\nThe import of this remark is that it implies that the Shiites are not part of Islam and their blood can be spilled with impunity Last year's dispute poured oil on the fire of inter-Islamic hate and on the wars between Saudi Arabia, representing the Sunnis, and Iran, representing the Shiites.\n\nWhat can we look forward to this year when the Hajj to Mecca approaches? I do not know, but I will not be surprised if the political tension between the Saudis and Iran, particularly after the Sunni ISIS defeats, Shiite Hezbollah victories and Iran's moving into Iraq, Syria and Lebanon, finds an outlet during the Hajj. It could be in the form of a Shiite boycott of Mecca or Saudi violence against any Shiites who attempt the pilgrimage to Mecca.\n\nIn June, Jerusalem became the site of the struggle (\"Ribat\") between Islam, the religion that expects to take the place of Judaism and Christianity, and Judaism, which is in the midst of a return to its former status as a living, worthy religion. The background of the struggle is the renewal of Jewish sovereignty on the Temple Mount. During the short period of Muslim demonstrations for the right to enter the Al Aqsa Mosque without \"Jewish\" security checks, Saudi Arabia's voice was conspicuously absent.\n\nThe reason for the Saudi silence was the fear that the Muslim Brotherhood and those over whom they hold sway would raise the Al Aqsa Mosque to a level of importance that could contest the centrality of Mecca in Islam.\n\nThis plan was heard in Muslim Brotherhood media pronouncements. In 2012, for example, Safwat Higazi, the Muslim Brotherhood's chief spokesman in Egypt, said that the capital of the Islamic Caliphate that can unite all the Arab nations \"is not Mecca, not Medina, not Cairo, but Jerusalem.\n\nA similar pronouncement was made in 2014, at a demonstration in Jerusalem, by Kamal Khatib, Deputy head of the Northern Branch of the Islamic Movement in Israel, headed by Sheikh Raad Salah,\n\nSheikh Raad Salah himself declared that he intends to bring water from the Zamzam spring in Mecca to pour into the cistern on the Temple Mount in order to sanctify the Al Aqsa Mosque with the holiness of Mecca. The Saudis see this as unacceptable competition and did not permit Salah to attend the Hajj in Mecca. Jerusalem's challenge to Mecca is also evident in the boycott the Saudis declared on Qatar, a country which publicly supports the Muslim Brotherhood's offshoots, such as Hamas, for whom the struggle for Jerusalem and Falestin - which they call Aknaf Bayt al-Maqdis - the sectors of Jerusalem - is the raison d'etre.\n\nQatar has even set aside half a billion dollars for the purpose of removing Jerusalem from within Israel's boundaries. It is using them to buy the media, political figures and organizations like UNESCO\n\nTurkey's Erdogan is playing a role in the struggle for Islamic hegemony by working ceaselessly to strengthen his status as the all-powerful Sultan bringing Turkey back to its status prior to WWI. Erdogan's hegemonic aspirations clash with the Saudis on points of Muslim memory, because they know full well that for 400 years, Turkey ruled the Hijaz, the territory that included Mecca and Medina, until defeated by the Christian heretics - that is, the British. The victors promptly handed over Islam's holy land, the Hijaz (Iraq and historic Palestine which includes today's Jordan) to the Arab friends who had cooperated with them, stabbing the Turks in the back. Today, unsurprisingly, Erdogan supports Qatar, the country the Saudis are trying to bring to its knees.\n\nSaudi sensitivity to the Hijaz stems from the fact that the ruling Al-Saud family is not originally from the part of the Hijaz in the western Arabian peninsula, but from the centrally located Najd Heights. The fact that they conquered the area in 1925 from the Sharif's Notables who claim to be direct descendants of Mohammed, casts a shadow on the Saud family's legitimacy. This is the reason the Saudi king calls himself \"Protector of the holy sites,\" intending for that title to grant him \"kosher\" Islamic status. However, many people in the Sunni world do not buy that and do not entirely accept the Saud family's right to rule and force their Wahabee Islamic traditions to be the norm at sites that are holy to all Muslims.\n\nThe Sauds invest large sums of money to maintain the sites so as to gain legitimacy for ruling over Mecca and Medina, building roads, bridges, railways and amenities that make it easier for the two million Muslims whose annual pilgrimages they allow, to be comfortable and secure. Saudi Arabia imports hundreds of thousands of sheep, mainly from Australia, handing them out to the pilgrims for the holiday celebrated on the tenth of the Hajj month.\n\nNext month, the Hajj is likely to bring the tensions over Islamic hegemony to a boil, when the internal Islamic rifts described above threaten to destabilize the present situation during the Hajj and due to the Hajj: The ethnic Sunni-Shiite rift parallels the Saudi-Iranian political rift, the Wahabee-Muslim Brotherhood ideological rift, and the historic rift between Turkey and Saudi Arabia.\n\nHopefully, these deep differences will not lead once again to dead and wounded pilgrims, most of whom come only in order to be close to Allah, keep the fundamental commandments connected to the Hajj and obtain forgiveness for their transgressions. They are not interested in all the ethnic, political, ideological and historical considerations involved; all they desire is to come closer to the heavens, keep Allah's commandments and do Allah's will.\n\nI wish the pilgrims to Mecca: Haj mabroor wa-saiy mashkoor wa-dhanb maghfoor - a pure holiday, hearts full of gratitude and forgiven sins. May they return safely to their homes.\n\nTranslation by Rochel Sylvetsky\n\nTags:Mecca, Hajj\n\nRelated StoriesSaudi Arabia foils attack on Mecca mosqueJerusalem was never holy to Muslims'Dome of the

They have also been exempted from obtaining mandatory electronic visas.\n\nUp until noon on Thursday, some 120 Qatari pilgrims had crossed the Salwa border in buses or in their own personal vehicles, the Saudi Passport General Department told Asharq Al-Awsat.\n\nQatari Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani and the National Human Rights Committee in Qatar welcomed on Thursday Riyadh's order to open the passage.\n\nKing Salman's decision to open the border crossing and cover the expenses of the Qatari pilgrims came after Vice Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques Prince Mohammed bin Salman held talks with Qatari mediator Sheikh Abdullah bin Ali bin Abdullah bin Jassem Al Thani. Discussions focused on allowing Qatari pilgrims to enter the Kingdom without electronic visas.\n\nBahraini Foreign Minister Sheikh Khalid bin Ahmed Al Khalifa said that King Salman's order was unprecedented in that no other Islamic country has received the same facilitations as Qatar in regards to the Hajj.\n\nUnited Arab Emirates State Minister of Foreign Affairs Dr. Anwar Gargash tweeted that \"Qatar's politicization of the Hajj must end after King Salman's generous initiative.\"\n\nHe added that his gesture proves that there are issues that are greater than politics.\n\nHead of the Salwa border crossing Fahd al-Ataibi told Asharq Al-Awsat that all officials and government sectors are fully prepared to welcome the Qatari pilgrims, who began arriving in the Kingdom on Thursday.\n\n\"All possible services have been put at their disposal for their entry through the Salwa crossing and all obstacles have been removed from their path in accordance to King Salman's order to host the Qatari pilgrims at his expense,\" he added.\n\nThe pilgrims themselves said that their arrival in the Kingdom was \"very easy,\" saying that the border procedures took about 20

In recent days, hereditary Prince Mohammed bin Salman, had received a Doha diplomat in the first high-level meeting between the two countries.\n\nKing Salman agreed \"to the entry of pilgrims from Qatar\" to participate in the Hajj and without having to show the \"electronic permit\". He also ordered private jets from Saudi Airlines to land at Doha Airport to \"transport all Qatari pilgrims at their expense\".\n\nLast month, in view of the major pilgrimage that begins in early September, Saudi Arabia's leaders had allowed the entry of Qatar citizens, in spite of the ongoing crisis with Doha . On the other hand, the leaders of the emirate point their finger at Riyadh, accusing it of \"politicizing\" the Hajj and compromising the pilgrimage, endangering the security of the faithful.\n\nAnalysts and experts point out that this \"opening up\" of the Saudi king seems to be a gesture of good will towards the people of Qatar, Muslims, and certainly not a turning point in diplomatic relations with Doha. Divisions remain and there are no solutions on the horizon.\n\nAccording to some, the clash between Qatar and Saudi Arabia originates from the ties between Doha and Tehran, the Saudis' number one enemy in the region. Other analysts and experts believe that there is a counterattack to Sunni Islam and, in particular, between Doha and Abu Dhabi.\n\nThe controversy also involved Qatar Al Jazeera's satellite channel, which Riyadh wants to close.\n\nMeanwhile, the Bahrain State TV has opened a front, accusing Qatar of fomenting the anti-government revolts that were promoted in the past by the Shiite opposition. The proof lies in a recording of a phone call between Qatar's former prime minister Hamad bin Jassim al-Thani and the leader of outlawed party Wefaq, Ali Salman, in which they agreed to an escalation of the protests.\n\nThe goal was to \"undermine the interests and stability\" of the nation. Bahrain's public prosecutor has opened an investigation, while the Qatar authorities do not want to comment officially.

REUTERS/Amr Abdallah Dalsh\n\n14 August 2017\n\nBy YUSUF MOHAMMED\n\nMADINAH: The Ministry of Islamic Affairs branch in Madinah has implemented its plans for the 2017 Hajj season.\n\nSheikh Fahd Al-Tuwaijri, the director general of the branch, affirmed that preparations for welcoming pilgrims started early on, and involved meetings with officials, supervisors of mosques, and maintenance organizations.\n\nMany field visits were reportedly conducted to mosques in Madinah, such as the Masjid Al-Qiblatayn, and actions were taken to improve the conditions and provide the best environment for visitors.\n\nThese concluded with a visit to Miqat Mosque with the ministry's director general of maintenance, to ensure that the facilities are available to allow pilgrims to perform their rites with ease and comfort.\n\nAl-Tuwaijri added that the Saudi government does its best to overcome any difficulties pilgrims may face in performing Hajj with peace and comfort, regardless of their nationality. Calls for politicizing and internationalizing Hajj will certainly fail, as with all other previous attempts, Al-Tuwaijri added.\n\nAl-Tuwaijri prayed for the protection of Saudi Arabia and its leaders and for the safety and safe return of pilgrims to their home countries.\n\nAdvertisement \u00a9 Arab News 2017", "dateTime": "2017-08-19T21:59:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 254, "textStart": 240, "date": "2017-08-14", "amb": false}, {"textEnd": 210, "textStart": 194, "date": "2016-01-18", "amb": false}], "sim": 0.6000000238418579, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-19", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3373645", "time": "21:59:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3367569", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Kingdom of Saudi Arabia"}}, "concepts": [{"id": "193", "label": {"eng": "Kingdom of Saudi Arabia"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Kingdom of Saudi Arabia"}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "1683", "label": {"eng": "Mecca"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mecca", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mecca"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Kingdom of Saudi Arabia"}}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "1794", "label": {"eng": "Medina"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medina", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Medina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Kingdom of Saudi Arabia"}}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "302588", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "score": 1}, {"id": "302897", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Pilgrim"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilgrim", "score": 3}, {"id": "303218", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Islam"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam", "score": 3}, {"id": "303629", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Muslim"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim", "score": 4}, {"id": "304309", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "General officer"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_officer", "score": 3}, {"id": "304679", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Sheikh"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh", "score": 3}, {"id": "305753", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Mosque"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosque", "score": 4}, {"id": "323603", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Hajj"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hajj", "score": 3}, {"id": "331800", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Politics of Saudi Arabia"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_Saudi_Arabia", "score": 2}, {"id": "331991", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Sacred"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacred", "score": 3}, {"id": "334821", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Masjid al-Haram"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masjid_al-Haram", "score": 3}, {"id": "348936", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Umrah"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umrah", "score": 3}, {"id": "365174", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Kaaba"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaaba", "score": 3}, {"id": "398331", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Al-Masjid an-Nabawi"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Masjid_an-Nabawi", "score": 3}, {"id": "481755", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Fahd of Saudi Arabia"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fahd_of_Saudi_Arabia", "score": 3}, {"id": "606328", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Zuhr prayer"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zuhr_prayer", "score": 4}, {"id": "701676", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Mawlid"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mawlid", "score": 3}, {"id": "739529", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Miqat"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miqat", "score": 2}], "image": "https://images.zawya.com/images/cia/zLarge/160827054259ILFP.jpg", "timeCrawl": "21:59:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "Madinah branch of Islamic Affairs Ministry implements 2017 Hajj plan", "originalArticle": null}

The Foreign Minister expressed the hope that the siege countries would follow Qatar's example and be more responsive to the Kuwaiti mediation.\n\nH E Sheikh Mohamed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani said that the situation in Gaza, the Middle East and the peace process, as well as the situation in Libya, Syria, Yemen, Somalia and Afghanistan were also discussed. On Saudi Arabia's decision to allow Qatari Haj pilgrims to enter its territory to perform the pilgrimage, the Foreign Minister said that \"more than 100 people have entered Saudi Arabia so far, but the Saudi authorities have not yet responded to the demand of the Ministry of Awqaf and Islamic Affairs in Qatar on the safety of the Qatari pilgrims, which means that the safety of those who exceed the Qatari borders to Saudi territories is the responsibility of the Saudi authorities\", the Minister added.\n\nThe Foreign Minister said: \"Our relations with Saudi Arabia have never reached this level of crisis, a level of enacting a law in the Kingdom that prevents even sympathy with the State of Qatar under fines and imprisonment.\n\n\"This is why we are concerned about our people, especially in light of what the Saudi media is doing of spreading hatred against the people of Qatar, so we call on the Saudi authorities to respond to the demand of the Ministry of Awqaf and Islamic Affairs and refrain from politicising the issue of the Haj pilgrimage, as it was prevented for political reasons, and now also permitted for political reasons\", the Minister noted.\n\nAs for whether Saudi Arabia's move came as a result of Kuwaiti mediation or because of the mediation of Sheikh Abdullah bin Ali Al Thani, the Foreign Minister said: \"We have expressed two days ago in a message to the Emir of Kuwait H H Sheikh Sabah Al Ahmad Al Jaber Al Sabah, our readiness to deal with the Kuwaiti mediation and our respect for it, but the four siege countries have not responded up to now. Rather, we have seen continuing escalation and attempt to market the accusation that Qatar supports terrorism without providing any evidence, until they reached a stage of despair to buy a few seconds in the Western channels to publish their advertisements, unfortunately this is their constant behaviour since the beginning of the crisis\", the Foreign Minister added.\n\nThe Foreign Minister continued: \"Talk about permitting the entry of Qatari Haj pilgrims was as a result of mediation, this confirms that they are the ones who politicised the Haj pilgrimage. \"As for the visit of Sheikh Abdullah bin Ali and his meeting with the Saudi Crown Prince, it was for personal reasons, and we have no information about King Salman receiving him\", he said.\n\nH E Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani said that allowing Qatari Haj pilgrims to perform their rites of pilgrimage as a result of mediation was part of series of conspiracies that have been waged against Qatar since the beginning

Likewise if an Al Saud requests a meeting in Doha, the Emir will meet them.\"\n\nThe Foreign Minister said that Qatar welcomes any positive step in this regard to start ending these illegal measures.\n\n\"We hope that these steps will continue, as well as not involving human matters in the political dispute re-uniting the mixed families,\" he added.\n\nSheikh Mohammed affirmed that Qatar's position has been clear and positive from the beginning of the crisis. \"We have not reached the same level of escalation as the siege countries have, and we have supported and dealt with the Emir of Kuwait and his mediation efforts, as well as the US government's efforts in this regard,\" he added.\n\nHe pointed out that Doha can discuss any of the siege countries' concern, explaining that the settlement must be based on clear principles that respect the sovereignty of each party and guarantee non-interference in other's affairs.\n\nOn the other hand, the Minister said that the bilateral relations between Qatar and Sweden are very important, pointing to the need for developing these relations in addition to studying all possible opportunities that contribute to enhancing cooperation between the two countries.\n\nHe added that he had discussed a host of topics with his Swedish counterpart, including the gulf crisis, the illegal measures taken against by the siege countries and the humanitarian issued which came as result of separating families and denying many people access to their properties as well performing Umrah and Hajj.", "dateTime":

(IBT)\n\nBut aviation experts dismissed the graphic animation as \"sensationalist\" and pointed out that aircraft from the Gulf state have a \"legitimate\" right to fly in the skies over Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe footage, which lasts nearly two minutes, was aired by Saudi-owned TV news network Al Arabiya and shows a Russian-made Su-30 Flanker shoot down a Qatari Airbus A320.\n\nA voiceover says: \"International law permits states to shoot down any aircraft that violates a state's airspace, classing it as a legitimate target, especially if flying over a military area.\"\n\nSocial media users described the graphic animation as a warning by Saudi Arabia to passengers who fly with Qatar Airways - as the two Gulf nations remain at loggerheads.\n\nSlideshow: World's most powerful military nations (GES)\n\nAbby wrote: \"Putting out this video is beyond provocative. It's intended to make people worry about flying Qatar for fear of a navigation error costing them their life. You don't make this video without a point.\"\n\nJohn Harper pointed out \"the political implication of a state sanctioned news channel airing a graphic with a missile directed\" at the Airbus.\n\nAviation analyst Alex Macheras said it was \"irresponsible and unprofessional\" for the Saudi network to air the graphic animation but said it had not been taken seriously in the Gulf region.\n\nHe told The Independent: \"The video was full of inaccuracies, and I think it has more to do with a sensationalist approach to covering the Gulf crisis by Al Arabiya, than a real 'threat' from Saudi Arabia.\n\n\"It was irresponsible and unprofessional of the network to air such a report - and passengers flying in the Middle East region should have no fear or worry about the safety of their aircraft.\"\n\nHe added: \"Qatar's reaction has been mostly with humour and wit. It's a report that has more of a Hollywood appeal, rather than truth and reality. On the whole, this Al Arabiya report hasn't been taken seriously, and I think that's for the best.\"\n\nSaudi Arabia today re-opened its land border with neighbouring Qatar to facilitate visitors from there who want to travel to the annual hajj pilgrimage, in the first signs of a thaw in the stand-off.\n\nIt came after Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman received an envoy from Doha, according to the Saudi Press Agency, in the first high-level public encounter between the nations since the crisis erupted.\n\nBut Ali Shihabi, from the Washington-based thinktank Arabia Foundation, warned: \"This

A Saudi video simulating a Saudi warplane shooting down Qatari civilian airplanes is causing international uproar.\n\nThe video was first used in an August 13 report by Saudi pro-government TV network Al-Arabiya, on the options the Saudi government has under international law if Qatari airplanes, even civilian ones, were to cross the kingdom's airspace.\n\nThe simulation was quickly picked up by outraged journalists worldwide, including in Newsweek, The Independent and The Daily Mail.\n\n\"In an apparent overt threat to the fellow Arab nation, a voiceover in the graphic animation says that the Saudi authorities have the right to shoot down any aircraft that enters their airspace,\" wrote Jeff Farell of The Independent.\n\n\"Viewers believe the simulated video of the fighter jet downing a Qatar Airways civilian plane is \"beyond provocative\" and is meant to scare off would-be passengers from flying with the country's national airline.\"\n\nThe footage comes amid an ongoing Saudi-led blockade of Qatar meant to pressure the small gas-rich nation into toeing the kingdom's line on regional policies, by closing land, sea and air links with Doha.\n\nThe video shows a warplane identifyed by Farell as a Russian-made Su-30 Flanker, shoot down a Qatari Airbus A320.\n\nThe video shows a Russian-made Su-30 Flanker, shoot down a Qatari Airbus A320\n\nOn Sunday, Al-Arabiya issued a statement accusing international media of 'manipulating' the footage.\n\nTwitter Post\n\nIt said the video consisted of two parts: One showing warplanes forcing a Qatar Airways flight in Saudi airspace to land, and another showing a missile striking a (obviously civilian) plane without livery after it flies over sensitive installations. Al-Arabiya claimed both are lawful measures under international law.\n\nAviation analyst Alex Macheras told The Independent it was \"irresponsible and unprofessional\" for the Saudi network to air the graphic animation, but that it was a sensationalist move rather than an official Saudi threat.\n\n\"It was irresponsible and unprofessional of the network to air such a report - and passengers flying in the Middle East region should have no fear or worry about the safety of their aircraft.\"\n\nSanctions imposed by Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, the UAE and Egypt included a ban on Qatar using the bloc's ports and airspace.\n\nThe air traffic restrictions have caused headaches for the 2.4 million residents of Qatar, 90 percent of whom are foreigners, as flights were forced to take longer routes, for example, to Southeast Asia.\n\nDoha has lobbied international aviation bodies to intervene.\n\nLast week, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates agreed to open up emergency flight corridors for sanctions-hit Qatar's state-owned flag carrier Qatar Airways.\n\nThe Montreal-based International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) has been working with \"various Middle Eastern states to ensure equitable access to airspace for Qatar-registered aircraft\" since sanctions were announced on June 5, ICAO spokesman Anthony Philbin said at the time.\n\n\"Some existing air route availability has been assured, and some new temporary or contingency routes have also been developed,\" including through Bahrain and UAE airspace, he told AFP.\n\nWould you feel safe flying over Saudi airspace?

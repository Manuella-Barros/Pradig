Youth with hypertension had 2- to 3-times higher associated risk of stroke, hospitalized myocardial infarction or unstable angina, and congestive heart failure but not cardiovascular death.\n\nMeaning In youth diagnosed with hypertension, there is a higher associated risk of long-term cardiovascular disease, justifying the improvement of blood pressure follow-up and control strategies among youth with hypertension.\n\nImportance Hypertension affects 6% of all children, and its prevalence is increasing. Childhood hypertension tracks into adulthood and is associated with subclinical cardiovascular disease; however, there is a lack of evidence linking childhood hypertension to cardiovascular outcomes, which may contribute to underdiagnosis and undertreatment.\n\nObjective To determine the long-term associated risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) among children diagnosed with hypertension.\n\nDesign, Setting, and Participants This was a population-based, retrospective, matched cohort study conducted from 1996 to 2022. The study included all children (aged 3-18 years) alive in Ontario, Canada, from 1996 to 2021, who were identified using provincial administrative health databases. Children with prior kidney replacement therapy were excluded.\n\nExposure Incident hypertension diagnosis, identified by validated case definitions using diagnostic and physician billing claims. Each case was matched with 5 controls without hypertension by age, sex, birth weight, maternal gestational hypertension, prior comorbidities (chronic kidney disease, diabetes, cardiovascular surgery), and a propensity score for hypertension.\n\nMain Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was MACE (a composite of cardiovascular death, stroke, hospitalization for myocardial infarction or unstable angina, or coronary intervention). Time to MACE was evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazards regression.\n\nResults A total of 25\u202f605 children (median [IQR] age, 15 [11-17] years; 14\u202f743 male [57.6%]) with hypertension were matched to 128\u202f025 controls without hypertension. Baseline covariates were balanced after propensity score matching, and prior comorbidities were uncommon (hypertension vs control cohort: malignancy, 1451 [5.7%] vs 7908 [6.2%]; congenital heart disease, 1089 [4.3%] vs 5408 [4.2%]; diabetes, 482 [1.9%] vs 2410 [1.9%]). During a median (IQR) of 13.6 (7.8-19.5) years of follow-up, incidence of MACE was 4.6 per 1000 person-years in children with hypertension vs 2.2 per 1000 person-years in controls (hazard ratio, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.9-2.2). Children with hypertension were at higher associated risk of stroke, hospitalization for myocardial infarction or unstable angina, coronary intervention, and congestive heart failure, but not cardiovascular death, compared with nonhypertensive controls.\n\nConclusions and Relevance Children diagnosed with hypertension had a higher associated long-term risk of MACE compared with controls without hypertension. Improved detection, follow-up, and control of pediatric hypertension may reduce the risk of adult cardiovascular disease.\n\nHypertension is one of the most common causes of preventable death in adults worldwide. There are strong, graded associations between the duration and severity of hypertension and the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD; including myocardial infarction [MI] and stroke). This has led to the development of clear, outcomes-based guidelines on blood pressure (BP) screening, management, and follow-up for adults. Among youth, there has been a 5-fold increase in hypertension prevalence over the past 3 decades, from 1.3% (1990-1999) to 6.0% (2010-2014). There is strong evidence that pediatric BP tracks into adulthood and is associated with subclinical CVD (such as left ventricular hypertrophy and high carotid intima-media thickness). In adults, these subclinical CVD markers are associated with future CVD and death. However, there is currently a lack of evidence that youth diagnosed with hypertension have a higher risk of CVD across their life course.\n\nDespite the rising prevalence of pediatric hypertension and known associations with subclinical CVD, pediatric hypertension remains underrecognized and inadequately treated. Only 11% to 35% of children have regular BP screening (ie, at least annually). Few hypertensive youth have appropriate follow-up, are ever diagnosed, or are treated. There is a lack of consensus on the significance of pediatric hypertension and conflicting society recommendations for pediatric BP screening and follow-up. Current Hypertension Canada, American Academy of Pediatrics, European Society of Hypertension, and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute guidelines recommend regular BP screening for healthy children between the ages of 3 and 18 years. However, the US Preventive Services Task Force, American Academy of Family Physicians, and the UK National Screening Committee do not recommend childhood BP screening, based on insufficient evidence. Few studies have evaluated associations between pediatric hypertension and long-term CVD because this requires a large sample size, long follow-up, and low attrition. This study, therefore, aimed to leverage long-term follow-up data from population-based health administrative databases to determine the associated risk and timing of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) among children diagnosed with hypertension compared with children without hypertension.\n\nWe conducted a population-based retrospective cohort study of all children (aged 3-18 years) living in Ontario, Canada, with Ontario Health Insurance Plan (OHIP) coverage between April 1, 1996, and March 31, 2021. Ontario is Canada's largest province, with a pediatric population of\u2009approximately\u20097 million during our study period. Ontario residents are covered by a government-funded universal health care system. This project was authorized under section 45 of Ontario's Personal Health Information Protection Act and does not require research ethics board approval or informed consent. Our study is reported in accordance with the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) guidelines and the Reporting of Studies Conducted Using Observational Routinely Collected Health Data (RECORD) guidelines (eAppendix 1 in Supplement 1).\n\nWe used multiple linked provincial health administrative databases housed at ICES. ICES is an independent, nonprofit research institute whose legal status under Ontario's health information privacy law allows it to collect and analyze deidentified health care and demographic data, without consent, for health system evaluation and improvement. Emigration from Ontario is very low (<0.5% annually) and is the sole reason for attrition other than death. The Registered Persons Database contains demographic, birth, and death information. The Canadian Institute for Health Information Discharge Abstract Database, Same Day Surgery, and National Ambulatory Care Reporting System were used to identify diagnoses, comorbidities, procedures, and outcomes recorded during inpatient, same-day surgery, and emergency department visits. The OHIP database contains physician billing records (diagnostic and procedural) for all outpatient and inpatient services. The Ontario Mother-Baby database links maternal records with all hospital-based births in Ontario. These databases were linked using unique encoded identifiers and data analysis was performed at ICES Western. Complete, uncleaned data were available to study investigators for analysis. eAppendix 2 in Supplement 1 includes descriptions of each database and administrative definitions used.\n\nFirst, we identified children aged 3 to 18 years in Ontario between April 1, 1996, and March 31, 2021. We excluded non-Ontario residents and those ineligible for OHIP coverage. We also excluded individuals with a previous hypertension diagnosis or kidney replacement therapy (dialysis or kidney transplant) between April 1, 1988 (start of data availability), and March 31, 1996. Because this was a population-based study, a formal sample size calculation was not performed. Child ethnicity, identified by a surname-based algorithm, included Chinese, South Asian, and other (which included all non-Chinese or non-South Asian individuals). Ethnicity information was gathered for this study because it is a known contributor to pediatric and adult hypertension and cardiovascular disease risk.\n\nOur main exposure, incident hypertension diagnosis, was defined using a validated algorithm (eAppendix 1 in Supplement 1) using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9; [1996-2002]), ICD-10 (2003-2021), and OHIP diagnostic codes. Hypertension was defined as an outpatient physician billing claim or hospital discharge diagnosis of hypertension (primary or secondary causes). This definition has high specificity (99%) and positive predictive value (74%) but low sensitivity (24%) for pediatric hypertension defined by office-based BP or antihypertensive treatment. The cohort entry date for children with hypertension was the date of first hypertension diagnosis during the study period. All Ontario children not diagnosed with hypertension were eligible controls. Their cohort entry date was randomly assigned based on the distribution of cohort entry dates in exposed children.\n\nStarting from April 1996, we chronologically matched each child with hypertension with 5 children without hypertension. Each matched set was removed to prevent these individuals from further matching (ie, sampling without replacement). Matching was performed using the following criteria: age at cohort entry (\u00b1365 days), index date (before/after July 1, 2000), sex, birth weight (low, normal, missing), maternal gestational hypertension, chronic kidney disease (CKD) diagnosis, diabetes diagnosis, previous cardiovascular surgery, and the logit of the propensity score for hypertension (\u00b10.2 SD). The propensity score was calculated using a multivariable logistic regression model for hypertension.\n\nThe propensity score model for hypertension included the following sociodemographic characteristics (age, sex, ethnicity [by surname-based algorithm], neighborhood income quintile [by postal code], socioeconomic marginalization [using the Ontario Marginalization Index], geographic area [by Local Health Integration Network], rural status [community <10\u202f000 persons], and cohort entry year), pregnancy and birth characteristics (gestational age, birth weight, maternal age, maternal hypertension, maternal diabetes, maternal smoking, and maternal body mass index); the child's preexisting comorbidities (obesity, CKD, diabetes, malignancy, nonkidney solid organ transplant, congenital heart disease, cardiac surgery, chronic liver disease, and sickle cell disease [from April 1988 or their date of birth until study enrollment]), the child's Pediatric Medical Complexity Algorithm (PMCA) classification during a 3-year lookback period (complex chronic, noncomplex chronic or nonchronic disease), and the child's prior health care resource utilization during a 1-year lookback period (emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and outpatient visits). These variables were included in the propensity score because they are potential confounders of the association between hypertension and MACE. Missing baseline characteristic data was handled using missing categories.\n\nThe primary outcome was MACE, a composite of cardiovascular death, stroke, hospitalization for acute MI or unstable angina, or coronary intervention, defined using validated diagnostic codes. MACE is an important, patient-centered outcome that is recommended for CVD outcome research, and its components are reliably captured in health administrative databases. Secondary outcomes included individual MACE components, congestive heart failure, other cardiovascular diagnoses (including angina, atherosclerotic and ischemic heart disease, atrial/ventricular arrythmias, and peripheral vascular disease), and cardiovascular procedures (including cardiac surgery, vascular surgery, and device insertion [pacemaker/defibrillator]). All primary and secondary outcomes were ascertained using administrative data (eAppendix 2 in Supplement 1). Outcome assessment started at the cohort entry date and continued until the date of death, loss to follow-up (90 days after the end of OHIP eligibility), or March 31, 2022 (administrative censoring).\n\nBaseline characteristics were reported using descriptive statistics, before and after propensity score matching. Standardized differences were used to identify residual baseline differences between the matched hypertension and control cohorts. A standardized difference of 0.1 or greater is considered substantial. We determined the cumulative incidence and incidence rates (events per 1000 person-years) of each primary and secondary outcome throughout follow-up. Time-to-event analysis was performed using the Kaplan-Meier method. We used Cox proportional hazards models with a robust sandwich estimator (to account for correlation within matched sets) to determine the association (hazard ratios [HR] and 95% CIs) between incident hypertension diagnosis and the primary and secondary outcomes. For the MACE analysis specifically, children were censored when they experienced their first MACE component. Multivariable adjustment was not performed because there were no substantial residual imbalances after propensity score matching. Proportional hazards assumptions were verified for each model.\n\nTo evaluate for effect heterogeneity, we performed exploratory subgroup analyses using interaction terms and stratified Cox proportional hazards models to determine the association between hypertension and MACE in prespecified subgroups: (1) age (<13 years vs \u226513 years [ie, adolescent] at cohort entry), (2) sex, (3) prior CKD, (4) prior diabetes, (5) prior cardiovascular surgery, (6) birth weight for gestational age (small for gestation [<10th percentile] vs normal/large for gestation vs missing), and (6) birth weight category. These subgroups were selected as potential effect modifiers that are reliably captured in health administrative data. All significance tests were 2-sided, using \u03b1\u2009=\u2009.05 level of significance. We did not adjust the \u03b1 for multiple hypothesis testing of subgroup analysis because these analyses were prespecified and exploratory. All analyses were performed at ICES using SAS, version 9.4 (SAS Institute).\n\nBetween April 1996 and March 2021, there were 6\u202f951\u202f975 children aged 3 to 18 years living in Ontario (eFigure 1 in Supplement 1). After exclusions, we identified 27\u202f651 eligible children diagnosed with hypertension and 4\u202f465\u202f559 eligible controls without hypertension. Before matching, substantial differences between children diagnosed with hypertension and controls existed (eTable in Supplement 1). Children diagnosed with hypertension had higher rates of obesity, CKD, malignancy, congenital heart disease, and prior health care utilization. After propensity score matching, we included a final cohort of 25\u202f605 children (median [IQR] age, 15 [11-17] years; 10\u202f862 female [42.4%]; 14\u202f743 male [57.6%]; 1055 Chinese [4.1%], 788 South Asian [3.1%], and 23\u202f755 other [92.8%]) with an incident hypertension diagnosis (92.6% of eligible children with hypertension) and 128\u202f025 controls without hypertension. Baseline characteristics were well balanced after matching (all standardized differences <0.1) (Table 1). In both cohorts, 87% of youth had an urban residence (hypertension cohort: 22\u202f278 [87.0%]; control cohort: 111\u2009[86.8%]), and there were no substantial differences in income or marginalization indices. Preexisting comorbidities were uncommon. In the hypertension vs control cohort, children had a history of obesity (3550 [13.9%] vs 18\u202f202 [14.2%]), malignancy (1451 [5.7%] vs 7908 [6.2%]), congenital heart disease (1089 [4.3%] vs 5408 [4.2%]), and diabetes (482 [1.9%] vs 2410 [1.9%]).\n\nMedian (IQR) follow-up was 13.6 (7.8-19.5) years overall in the matched cohort (13.5 years in the hypertension cohort vs 13.7 years in the control cohort). Median (IQR) age at last follow-up was 27 (21-34) years in both cohorts. Complete follow-up until March 2022 occurred in 137\u202f176 of 153\u202f630 youth (89.3%); 2349 of 153\u202f630 (1.5%) were censored for death, and 14\u202f105 of 153\u202f630 (9.2%) were censored for provincial emigration. Throughout follow-up, MACE occurred in 1557 children (6.1%) with hypertension vs 3901 controls (3.1%) (Table 2). Incidence of MACE was 4.6 events per 1000 person-years (95% CI, 4.4-4.9 events) among children with hypertension vs 2.2 events per 1000 person-years (95% CI, 2.2-2.3 events) among controls. Children with hypertension had a higher associated risk of MACE throughout follow-up, compared with controls without hypertension (HR, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.9-2.2) (Figure 1).\n\nThe cumulative incidence, incidence rates, and HR for all secondary outcomes are presented in Table 2. Children diagnosed with hypertension had a higher associated risk of stroke (HR, 2.7; 95% CI, 2.4-2.9), hospitalization for MI or unstable angina (HR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.7-2.0), and coronary intervention (HR, 4.1; 95% CI 3.2-5.3) compared with controls without hypertension. However, there was no difference in the risk of CVD death (HR, 1.0; 95% CI, 0.9-1.2). Children diagnosed with hypertension also had a higher associated risk of developing congestive heart failure (HR, 2.6; 95% CI, 2.4-2.9), other cardiovascular diagnoses (HR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.6-1.8), and undergoing cardiovascular procedures (HR, 2.6; 95% CI, 2.3-2.8) than controls.\n\nWe evaluated the association between pediatric hypertension and MACE within prespecified subgroups (Figure 2 and eFigure 2 in Supplement 1). There was a stronger association between hypertension and MACE in children who were younger than 13 years at the time of hypertension diagnosis, female children, and children who were born small for gestational age. The association between hypertension and MACE was also greater among children with preexisting CKD, although this was not statistically significant (interaction P\u2009=\u2009.06). There was no evidence of outcome modification by diabetes or cardiac surgery history. Incidence of MACE was higher among children with diabetes and prior cardiac surgery, with and without hypertension.\n\nIn this population-based cohort study of 25\u202f605 children with incident hypertension diagnosis and 128\u202f025 matched controls, we examined the association between pediatric hypertension and MACE. Over a median 14-year follow-up, we found that children diagnosed with hypertension had double the associated risk of developing MACE compared with controls without hypertension. Children with hypertension also had a higher associated risk of stroke, hospitalization for MI or unstable angina, coronary intervention, congestive heart failure, other cardiovascular diagnoses, and cardiovascular procedures but not cardiovascular death.\n\nIn adults, there is a strong and graded association between hypertension and CVD. A recent meta-analysis found that young adults (aged 18-45 years) with high BP (\u2265140/90 mm Hg) are also had a 2- to 3-times greater associated risk of CVD over a mean of 14.7 years of follow-up compared with those with normal BP. However, this association cannot be directly extended to children because key CVD risk factors (eg, diabetes, smoking, and dyslipidemia) are more common in adults. There is a lack of direct evidence linking youth hypertension to major CVD, such as MI, stroke, and cardiovascular death. As a result, current pediatric guidelines provide conflicting recommendations for BP surveillance among children.\n\nThere are strong associations between pediatric hypertension and subclinical CVD (including left ventricular hypertrophy, higher carotid intima-media thickness, higher pulse wave velocity, atherosclerotic changes, retinal microvascular disease, and albuminuria). In adults, these subclinical CVD measures are associated with major CVD and death. A recent meta-analysis found that children and adolescents with high BP (\u226590th percentile) had a 1.4- to 1.8-times greater odds of subclinical CVD. They also found that high BP was associated in a small number of studies with incident CVD and cardiovascular death (HR ranging from 1.04-1.51) but could not perform a meta-analysis due to heterogenous exposure and outcome definitions.\n\nAmong 38\u202f589 participants in the prospective International Childhood Cardiovascular Cohort study, childhood hypertension (BP \u226595th percentile) was associated with a 2.3-times greater hazard of fatal or nonfatal cardiovascular events over a longer than 30-year follow-up. Compared with these previous studies, we found that pediatric hypertension was associated with a 2.1-times greater risk of MACE but no difference in cardiovascular death compared with controls without hypertension. The higher risk for nonfatal cardiovascular events that we observed may be explained by between-study differences in hypertension definitions and follow-up duration. Previous studies screened for hypertension among asymptomatic schoolchildren and young adult military conscripts, whereas we defined hypertension using hospitalization or physician claims. Because asymptomatic hypertension is commonly undiagnosed, our administrative definition may bias toward selection of children with more severe, persistent, secondary, or symptomatic hypertension leading to physician diagnosis. Prior validation of this definition demonstrated that it has a very high specificity (99%) but low sensitivity (24%) for pediatric hypertension, suggesting that up to three-quarters of children with hypertensive BP are missed.\n\nOur study found that younger children (age <13 years) and those with CKD were at higher associated risk of experiencing MACE after hypertension diagnosis. Young age at diagnosis is associated with more severe and secondary hypertension and a greater duration of hypertension exposure, if inadequately treated. In youth with CKD, hypertension is common (50%-70%), often inadequately treated, and strongly associated with CKD progression and subclinical CVD. Our findings emphasize the stronger association between hypertension and long-term CVD in the population of children with CKD.\n\nPediatric hypertension is an epidemic, with a 5-fold increase in prevalence over the last 3 decades. Worldwide, 6% of children have hypertension, and another 8% have elevated BP. Increasing pediatric hypertension has been associated with more obesity, less physical activity, higher dietary sodium intake, and urbanization. However, most children (up to 90%) do not undergo regular BP screening, more than three-quarters with hypertension are undiagnosed, and very few with hypertension are adequately treated. The association we found between pediatric hypertension and MACE may have substantial health and financial implications. Policies and initiatives to improve the uptake of pediatric BP screening, increase clinician and family awareness of pediatric hypertension, and optimize pediatric hypertension care may help prevent future CVD.\n\nThis study has several strengths. We followed up large, population-based cohorts over a long period with low attrition, allowing us to evaluate the association between pediatric hypertension and MACE. Propensity score matching balanced these cohorts for many potential confounders. The use of diagnostic codes to define pediatric hypertension makes our findings more applicable to children who are diagnosed with hypertension by a health care practitioner. Conversely, the generalizability of these results to children with undiagnosed hypertension is uncertain.\n\nHowever, there are also limitations of this study. Health care administrative data can misclassify study exposures, outcomes, and covariates. Our study exposure and primary outcome definitions have been previously validated, with high specificity and positive predictive value but low sensitivity. We did not have access to data on additional effect modifiers or confounders, including hypertension detection method (eg, ambulatory vs office-based BP), BP values to determine hypertension stage, subclinical CVD presence, body mass index, hypertension duration, and antihypertensive treatment. Further, data were limited or missing for several baseline characteristics (eg, birth and maternal history), causing potential residual confounding. Ethnicity data were limited to a surname-based algorithm used to identify Chinese and South Asian individuals. Children in the nonhypertension control cohort could have undiagnosed hypertension. However, this is likely uncommon based on the prevalence of pediatric hypertension and would have decreased effect size and bias toward the null hypothesis. Finally, there is potential detection bias if children with hypertension have more health care visits and CVD screening. To limit this, propensity score matching included preexisting comorbidities and health care resource utilization variables. Further, all MACE components are significant health events that would require hospitalization and treatment, making them less susceptible to detection bias.\n\nIn this population-based cohort study, we found that children diagnosed with hypertension had a 2-times associated risk of MACE, compared with children without hypertension. Optimizing the care provided to youth with hypertension may help prevent long-term adult CVD, with substantial health and cost-saving benefits. Further research should confirm these findings among children with hypertension defined by standardized BP criteria and evaluate CVD prevention strategies, including dietary modification, lifestyle interventions, and antihypertensive medications.\n\nCorresponding Author: Rahul Chanchlani, MBBS, MD, MSc, Division of Pediatric Nephrology, Department of Pediatrics, McMaster Children's Hospital, McMaster University, 1280 Main St W, Hamilton, ON L8N 3Z5, Canada (chanchlr@mcmaster.ca).\n\nAuthor Contributions: Drs Robinson and Smith had full access to all of the data in the study and take responsibility for the integrity of the data and the accuracy of the data analysis.\n\nConcept and design: Robinson, Jeyakumar, Birken, Dart, Dionne, Garg, Kandasamy, Marjerrison, Thabane, Zappitelli, Chanchlani.\n\nAcquisition, analysis, or interpretation of data: Robinson, Hussain, Jeyakumar, Smith, Birken, Dart, Karam, Marjerrison, South, Thabane, Wahi, Zappitelli, Chanchlani.\n\nDrafting of the manuscript: Robinson, Hussain, Smith, Chanchlani.\n\nCritical review of the manuscript for important intellectual content: Hussain, Jeyakumar, Birken, Dart, Dionne, Garg, Kandasamy, Karam, Marjerrison, South, Thabane, Wahi, Zappitelli, Chanchlani.\n\nStatistical analysis: Robinson, Hussain, Jeyakumar, Smith, Thabane, Zappitelli, Chanchlani.\n\nObtained funding: Robinson, Birken, Wahi, Chanchlani.\n\nAdministrative, technical, or material support: Hussain, Birken, Garg, Marjerrison.\n\nSupervision: Dionne, South, Thabane, Chanchlani.\n\nConflict of Interest Disclosures: Dr Birken reported receiving grants from the Canadian Institute of Health Research, Edwin S.H Leong Center for Child Health, Wallmart Community Grant, Physician Services Inc, and Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada risk outside the submitted work.

In spite of this, it remains unknown what will ultimately happen to these kids. 25,605 youth in Ontario who were diagnosed with hypertension between 1996 and 2021 were compared to classmates who were not affected by the illness.\n\nThe study found that during average follow-up of 13 years, youth with hypertension were at two to four times higher risk of experiencing heart attack, stroke, heart failure, or cardiac surgery compared to youth without hypertension. Experts say that improved blood pressure screening and treatment during childhood may reduce the risk of serious cardiovascular disease as an adult.\n\n\"Devoting more resources to pediatric blood pressure screening and control could lower the risks of long-term heart conditions in children with hypertension,\" said Cal H.

The findings were also presented at the Pediatric Academic Societies meeting in Toronto.\n\nSpecifically, kids with hypertension compared with those without had a higher associated risk of stroke (HR 2.7, 95% CI 2.4-2.9), hospitalization for myocardial infarction or unstable angina (HR 1.8, 95% CI 1.7-2.0), and coronary intervention (HR 4.1, 95% CI 3.2-5.3).\n\nThey also had a higher associated risk of developing congestive heart failure (HR 2.6, 95% CI 2.4-2.9), other cardiovascular diagnoses (HR 1.7, 95% CI 1.6-1.8), and undergoing cardiovascular procedures (HR 2.6, 95% CI 2.3-2.8) versus controls.\n\nHowever, there was no difference in the risk of cardiovascular death between the two groups.\n\n\"Hypertension in children is not a benign condition,\" Chanchlani told MedPage Today.\n\nIn fact, there has been a five-fold increase in the prevalence of pediatric hypertension over the last 3 decades, the authors noted. Globally, 6% of kids have the condition.\n\n\"Increasing pediatric hypertension has been associated with more obesity, less physical activity, higher dietary sodium intake, and urbanization,\" they wrote. \"However, most children (up to 90%) do not undergo regular BP [blood pressure] screening, more than three-quarters with hypertension are undiagnosed, and very few with hypertension are adequately treated.\"\n\n\"The association we found between pediatric hypertension and MACE may have substantial health and financial implications,\" they continued. \"Policies and initiatives to improve the uptake of pediatric BP screening, increase clinician and family awareness of pediatric hypertension, and optimize pediatric hypertension care may help prevent future CVD [cardiovascular disease].\"\n\nThe study included all children ages 3 to 18 years who were alive in Ontario from 1996 to 2021, identified using provincial administrative health databases. Children with prior kidney replacement therapy were excluded.\n\nA total of 25,605 children (median age 15, 57.6% boys) with hypertension and 128,025 controls without hypertension were included. Each case was matched with five controls by age, sex, birth weight, maternal gestational hypertension, prior comorbidities (chronic kidney disease, diabetes, cardiovascular surgery), and a propensity score for hypertension.\n\nChanchlani and team said that baseline covariates were balanced after propensity score matching, and prior comorbidities were uncommon (hypertension vs control cohort: malignancy, 5.7% vs 6.2%; congenital heart disease, 4.3% vs 4.2%; diabetes, 1.9% vs 1.9%).\n\nThe median age of participants at last follow-up was 27 in both cohorts. Chanchlani acknowledged the relatively young ages of participants in comparison to the age range for which people typically think about events like strokes or heart attacks occurring.\n\nComplete follow-up (until March 2022) occurred in 89.3% of participants; 1.5% were censored for death, and 9.2% were censored for provincial emigration.\n\nLimitations to the study included that the researchers did not have access to data on additional effect modifiers or confounders, such as hypertension detection method, BP values to determine hypertension stage, subclinical cardiovascular disease presence, body mass index, hypertension duration, and antihypertensive treatment, Chanchlani and colleagues said.\n\nThey also noted that detection bias was possible if kids with hypertension had more healthcare visits and cardiovascular disease screening.", "source": {"uri": "medpagetoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MedPage Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The findings revealed that youth with high blood pressure, or hypertension, face significantly increased long-term risks of serious heart conditions, including stroke and heart attack.\n\nWhile guidelines recommend screening for hypertension in all kids aged 3-18, the practice remains largely absent in primary care, mainly because of a lack of evidence supporting it.\n\n\"When I talk to family doctors, they often ask about the long-term data and whether there is any potential harm with not checking kids' blood pressure\" said Chanchlani, an associate professor in the department of pediatrics and a pediatric nephrologist at McMaster Children's Hospital.\n\nChanchlani turned to big data for answers. He tracked the outcomes of over 25,000 children with hypertension and compared them to approximately 128,000 children without the condition over a 15-year period.\n\nYouth with hypertension were at twice the risk of major adverse heart events compared to their peers, he found.\n\nWhat's the solution?\n\nWhile the solution may seem straightforward -- a blood pressure check during regular visits to the family doctor -- in practice, it is more complex: Ontario family doctors often lack access to nursing staff, pediatric-specific blood pressure machines and blood pressure cuffs, and time to settle active children before taking their blood pressure.\n\nCreating awareness about high blood pressure in children is essential, Chanchlani says.\n\nEmpowering families and caregivers to raise the issue with their primary care providers, while also educating family doctors and other health-care practitioners, will be crucial.\n\n\"This study is just one of many steps needed to improve blood pressure screening in Canadian children,\" says Chanchlani.\n\n\"Now, organizations like Hypertension Canada, the Canadian Pediatric Society, and the College of Family Physicians of Canada, all need to come to the table to say, 'Hey, this is a major problem.' \"\n\nCrucial donor support\n\nChanchlani's study started with a $100,000 Collaborative Research Excellence (CoRE) grant, an annual seed funding initiative established by a donation to McMaster's department of Pediatrics.\n\nNow in its third year, the program finances high-impact research with the potential to attract more grants in the future.\n\nChanchlani successfully applied for the funding in 2022, the first year it was offered. \"Without CoRE, this research would not have been possible,\" he says.\n\nTwo years later, with multiple studies published in high-impact journals, Chanchlani is turning to the next phase of his research, which will explore whether children with hypertension are also at an increased risk of kidney conditions.\n\nThis year, the Kidney Foundation of Canada announced its support for Chanchlani's ALERT-BP study that aims to develop a tool to predict the risk of high blood pressure in young children. This partnership represents a proof-of-concept moment for CoRE and a significant achievement for pediatric researchers at McMaster.\n\nWith several CoRE projects in the pipeline and more expected to be funded this year, pediatric research is growing, says Gita Wahi, associate chair of research in McMaster's department of Pediatrics.\n\n\"Dr. Chanchlani's progress demonstrates the impact of this funding tool and that McMaster is hub of research excellence in child health. I look forward to seeing what's next.\"", "source": {"uri": "brighterworld.mcmaster.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "brighterworld.mcmaster.ca"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McMaster_University", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "McMaster University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_medicine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Family medicine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hypertension"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_pressure", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Blood pressure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pediatrics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontario", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ontario"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ontario"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JAMA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "JAMA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_failure", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Heart failure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Primary care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myocardial_infarction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Myocardial infarction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stroke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cardiovascular disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associate_professor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Associate professor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephrology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nephrology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caregiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Caregiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_data", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Big data"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nursing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nursing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_of_Family_Physicians_of_Canada", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "College of Family Physicians of Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Paediatric_Society", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canadian Paediatric Society"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kidney"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Child_Welfare", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Child Welfare", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Information_and_Advice", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Information and Advice", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Pediatric_Rehabilitation", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Pediatric Rehabilitation", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://brighterworld.mcmaster.ca/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/Rahul-Chanchlani-768x455.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543508", "eventUri": "eng-9543508", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

Studies suggest an earlier onset of cardiometabolic disease among Indians, relative to other populations13. This puts India's reproductive-age population, which is the second largest in the world after China's, at risk of catastrophic health expenditures and declining economic productivity14. Therefore, whether spousal concordance exists after accounting for socio-demographic determinants (e.g., age, education, household size), health risks (e.g., body mass index, alcohol, and tobacco use) and environmental features (e.g., urbanicity) can present opportunities to better understand modifiable mechanisms underlying shared hypertension risk among married couples. Specifically, evaluating whether the presence of hypertension in one spouse could be leveraged to identify hypertension in the other spouse in the reproductive-age population is also intriguing. We investigated spousal concordance in hypertension in India using nationally representative data from married adults surveyed in 2019-2021 (n\u2009=\u200950,023).\n\nThe National Family Health Survey-5 (NFHS-5) was a stratified, two-stage probability proportional to size sample survey of 724,115 women and 101,839 men from 636,699 households. The survey was conducted in two phases, from June 2019 to March 2020 and November 2020 to April 2021. From this sample, 57,693 heterosexual couples of reproductive age were identified, of which 54,356 were of legal age at marriage (men: 21 years, women: 18 years), defined as men aged 21-54 years (\"husbands\") and women aged 18-49 years (\"wives\") who participated in NFHS-5. We further restricted the analytic sample to the 50,023 couples who had data on key variables of interest for hypertension and in which the woman was not currently pregnant. A flowchart of the analytic sample is provided in Supplementary Fig. 1. This study was deemed exempt from review by the Institutional Review Board of Emory University because it was a secondary data analysis of de-identified data.\n\nHypertension was defined as composite of measured blood pressure above thresholds defined by the Indian Council of Medical Research and self-reported history of hypertension. Among adults without a reported history of hypertension, we averaged the three values of systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) measured using OMRON Blood Pressure monitors in the participants' homes. We then classified hypertension as having SBP greater than or equal to 140 mm Hg or greater than or DBP equal to 90 mm Hg. All adults reporting a history of diagnosed hypertension (i.e., those responding \"yes\" response to \"Do you currently have hypertension?\" or \"Before this survey, were you ever told you had high blood pressure by a doctor, nurse, or health practitioner on two or more occasions?\") were classified as having hypertension. Medication usage was not considered in the definition because it was asked only of those who self-reported a diagnosis of hypertension. We defined undiagnosed hypertension as proportions of adults with hypertension who self-reported not being diagnosed prior to the survey.\n\nIndividual and household covariates known to be associated with hypertension were included based on availability in the analytic sample. Individual-level covariates of interest were educational attainment (primary or up to 4th class, secondary or up to 10th class, post-secondary), body mass index (BMI) derived from measured height and weight (underweight: BMI\u2009<\u200918.5 kg/m, normal: BMI: 18.5\u2009\u2264\u2009BMI\u2009<\u200925.0 kg/m, overweight or obesity: BMI\u2009>\u200925.0 kg/m), alcohol consumption (yes or no) and smoking status (yes or no). These were available for men and women separately. Weight and height were measured using standardized protocols with SECA 874 U digital scale and SECA 213 Stadiometer. BMI was defined as weight (in kg) divided by height (in square meters). Household covariates of interest were number of children, size of household, rural residence (versus urban) and wealth quintile (relative wealth within each state). The number of children born to husbands and wives were separately ascertained. We used the lower of the two self-reported numbers to signify the number of children of the couple. Social caste membership, a measure of class and caste endogamy, was assessed following categories provided by the NFHS and used by the Government of India. Based on self-report, couples were classified as either both General, both Other Backward Castes (OBC), both Schedule Caste/Scheduled Tribe, and Inter-caste.\n\nAll analyses accounted for the complex multi-stage survey design and clustering at the level of primary sampling units, using survey weights provided by Demographic and Health Surveys.\n\nWe defined spousal concordance as co-occurrence of status in both partners for hypertension. Although concordance is typically defined as both partners having the same status (hypertension or no hypertension), we used this definition to be consistent with the prior literature on spousal concordance. To evaluate whether the prevalence of disease co-occurrence was beyond what is statistically expected under assumptions of independence, we also report the product of the marginal prevalence in husbands and wives. To understand whether concordant status could be used to detect hypertension, we attributed the proportion of undiagnosed hypertension in married men and women by the hypertension status (no hypertension, diagnosed, undiagnosed) of their spouse.\n\nAnalyses were carried out separately for husbands and for wives. We estimated the prevalence ratio (PR) and 95% CI describing the concordance of hypertension (exponentiating \u03b2 and \u03b2) between spouses using survey-weighted Poisson regression with robust standard errors. Models were specified as follows:\n\nWe present estimates adjusted for socio-demographic determinants (age, education, social caste background), health risks (body mass index, alcohol, and tobacco use) and environmental features (urbanicity). The models were also adjusted for state fixed effects. The first set of models were estimated for the nation. Subsequently, we evaluated associations between spouses stratified by the individual's age (<\u200940 vs\u2009\u2265\u200940), individual's attained level of education, rurality, household wealth and caste endogamy groups. Associations by socio-demographic subgroups were estimated by modifying Eqs. (1a) and (1b) to include an interaction term between the spouse's disease and an indicator for the subgroup level.\n\nWe used multiple imputation with predictive mean matching (10 datasets, 50 iterations) under a missing at random assumption and included auxiliary individual (weight, height, body mass index, blood pressure, random glucose, waist circumference, years of education, status of diagnosis and medication use for diabetes and for hypertension) and household covariates (caste and religion). We pooled all associations using Rubin's rules for imputed datasets.\n\nTo assess the robustness of our results for unmeasured shared characteristics that are correlated with the spouse's health behaviors and socio-economic position, we repeated the main analysis after adjusting for characteristics of the spouse of the index participant (Supplementary Fig. 2). To increase study power, we estimated the association using systolic blood pressure as a continuous variable. Previous studies have reported differences in spousal concordance by sex, given differences in marital experience and health behaviors. Therefore, we estimated if there were sex differences in magnitude of association between spouses using a pooled dataset and an interaction term of spouse's disease status and individual's sex (male\u2009=\u20091, female\u2009=\u20090). We used generalized estimating equations under a Poisson distribution with logarithmic link and robust standard errors to account for couple-level clustering of observations. We added binary indicator variables for husbands (yes\u2009=\u20091, no\u2009=\u20090). We assessed sex differences in spousal concordance based on the magnitude and confidence intervals of the interaction term. We did not conduct a pooled test with and without the interaction term since likelihood based methods are not applicable to generalized estimating equations. To assess robustness of results for selection bias in participation for blood pressure data collection, we imputed the hypertension status of 4333 couples using multiple imputation and repeated the main analysis.\n\nAll analysis was carried out using R v4.2.0 and statistical packages (survey 4.1.1, geepack 1.3.9).\n\nA preliminary version of the data in this article was presented at American Diabetes Association's Scientific Sessions 2023 (San Diego, CA).", "source": {"uri": "nature.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Nature"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

{"id": 243277942, "title": "Video: Dodgers' Shohei Ohtani Praises 'Hero' Bat Boy After Being Saved from Foul Ball", "text": "Los Angeles Dodgers superstar Shohei Ohtani shouted out a bat boy that saved him from potentially getting struck by a foul ball during the team's 4-0 win against the Chicago White Sox on Wednesday. Ohtani referred to the bat boy, Javier Herrera, as \"my hero\" on his Instagram story during a video of Herrera speaking to reporters on Friday. \"I don't know what happened,\" Herrera said, per Fabian Ardaya of The Athletic. \"I was just doing my job. \u2026 I saw the pitch all the way through, it hit the bat, and the ball pretty much found me. But I was able to grab it.\" Losing Ohtani for an extended period of time would have been a tough blow, as the Dodgers have dealt with several injuries throughout the 2024 season. Former American League MVP Mookie Betts is still out due to a fractured left hand, while starter Yoshinobu Yamamoto is on the 15-day injured list with a right rotator cuff strain. Ohtani himself isn't 100 percent, as he won't take the mound until 2025 as he recovers from elbow surgery that he underwent near the end of the 2023 season. Still, he's remained deadly at the plate in 2024. Through 79 appearances, Ohtani is hitting .322 to go along with a National League-best 25 home runs. He's also knocked in 61 RBIs while posting an incredible 1.045 OPS. He'll look to continue his impressive season and help the Dodgers maintain their status as the top team in the NL West after Herrera's heroics on Wednesday.", "summary": "Los Angeles Dodgers superstar Shohei Ohtani shouted out a bat boy that saved him from potentially getting struck by a foul ball during the team's 4-0 win\u2026", "url": "https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10126552-video-dodgers-shohei-ohtani-praises-hero-bat-boy-after-being-saved-from-foul-ball", "image": "https://media.bleacherreport.com/image/upload/v1719628442/irpnz9mm3djbvspiqg55.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 02:57:58", "author": "Zach Bachar", "authors": ["Zach Bachar"], "language": "en", "catgory": "sports", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.036}

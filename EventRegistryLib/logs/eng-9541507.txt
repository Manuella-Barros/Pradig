Those four people sustained minor injuries.\n\nTwo other passengers - a 16-year-old male and 14-year-old female - were also injured. The 16-year-old is being treated for critical injuries at the IWK hospital in Halifax.\n\n\"This is quite a tragedy. Three young individuals killed in a single-vehicle crash and one airlifted in critical condition to the IWK,\" said Fredericton Police Chief Martin Gaudet. \"We have some crashes in our jurisdiction. There's no doubt. But we don't have many fatalities. Thank God. We certainly keep stats. But this one is quite significant. It's a tragedy for the community. It's a parent's worst nightmare.\"\n\nGaudet said speed was the main factor, but there is an ongoing investigation to determine if any other factors were involved.\n\nHe said there is a criminal investigation ongoing, but it's been difficult to determine who the driver was.\n\nCritical incident stress management services have been deployed for first responders who were on scene.\n\n\"For those of us who've been doing this job for a while, you go to those calls, you can't unsee it,\" said Gaudet.\n\nFredericton Mayor Kate Rogers said it will take the community a while to come to terms with the loss.\n\n\"When something like this happens in your city, you're just stunned. I think we're all processing this right now, along with the community,\" she said.\n\nSome of the victims went to Fredericton's Leo Hayes High School, where there's a crisis events response team now in place.\n\n\"In visiting the school this morning, it was clear that staff and students were in good hands and getting the support they needed,\" said David McTimoney, superintendent for the Anglophone West School District. \"Supports will remain in place as long as they are needed. I am sure the community shares our collective grief following this terrible accident.\"\n\nGaudet said an officer did try and stop the vehicle when it passed them on a different street. They put their lights and sirens on, but lost them as they were turning around to follow them. The crash happened several minutes later.\n\nThat officer was placed in the area because there's been a number of complaints from residents about speeding.\n\nThe Douglas Avenue area is a neighbourhood where the speed limit is 50. It has bike lanes, tiny libraries and many young families.\n\nResidents tell CTV News speed has been an issue for some time.\n\nJamie Hunter lives across from where the crash happened. He says he's seen some vehicles going at least 80 kilometres per hour.\n\n\"It's a residential neighbourhood with kids and people walking their dogs and I know nothing seems to change,\" he said. \"We really need, I think, council and whoever oversees us to have a look at places like Douglas Avenue and other places in town, and how do we slow traffic down? How do we manage that? So we can avoid issues in the future like what just happened.\"", "source": {"uri": "atlantic.ctvnews.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "CTV Newsnet                        "}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fredericton", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fredericton"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Fredericton"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halifax,_Nova_Scotia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Halifax, Nova Scotia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Halifax, Nova Scotia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neighbourhood", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Neighbourhood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_responder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "First responder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_incident_stress_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Critical incident stress management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurisdiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jurisdiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "God"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Hunter_(snooker_player)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jamie Hunter (snooker player)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Hayes_High_School", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Leo Hayes High School"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglophone_West_School_District", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anglophone West School District"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CTV_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CTV News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superintendent_(police)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Superintendent (police)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Library"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Town", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Town"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_limit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Speed limit"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Grief,_Loss_and_Bereavement", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Grief, Loss and Bereavement", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Driving_and_Safety", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Driving and Safety", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Lifestyle_Choices/Intentional_Communities", "label": "dmoz/Society/Lifestyle Choices/Intentional Communities", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 68}], "image": "https://www.ctvnews.ca/content/dam/ctvnews/en/images/2024/5/6/douglas-avenue-1-6875575-1715025389931.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541507", "eventUri": "eng-9541507", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3960784313725491, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

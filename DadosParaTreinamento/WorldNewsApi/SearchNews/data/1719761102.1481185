Leigh-Anne, 32, met her husband in a nightclub in Marbella in 2016 and the pair eventually tied the knot in a dreamy Jamaican beach front wedding in June 2023. The couple also share twins who were born in August 2021. Despite their seemingly happy family life, the Don\u2019t Say Love singer has now admitted that even before Andre, 32, started his job as a striker for Saudi Pro League club Al-Riyadh in September 2023, the couple have rarely had a chance to see one another. Prior to the new striking gig, Andre had played for Premier League club Watford and Queen Park Rangers football club from 2017 to 2022. But all that has now changed. \u2018We have a long-distance relationship. He lives in Saudi, he plays football there. So for the last two years, we\u2019ve been apart basically, seeing each other for like maybe two days a month. It\u2019s been hell to be honest,\u2019 the music artist said in a new interview. When Table Manners podcast co-host Lennie Ware questioned if she harboured any resentment over the long-distance situation, Leigh-Anne said she tries not to. https://www.instagram.com/p/C66ua1sLy9U/?img_index=1 \u2018I really try not to. We know what he\u2019s doing it for, do you know what I mean, he\u2019s doing it for us,\u2019 she explained. And when Andre\u2019s contract ends this summer, she shared that she didn\u2019t know where he would go next. \u2018That\u2019s the thing about being with a footballer, you just don\u2019t know where you\u2019re gonna be and I can\u2019t move with him anywhere because obviously, I can\u2019t have a career wherever he\u2019s gonna go, I have to obviously be local to home,\u2019 she said. \u2018I had it good [at the start] because he played for QPR, he did Watford, and that was local so I had a couple of years of us living together. We had the babies and then he had to go,\u2019 she lamented. The happy couple could be reunited in the near future (Picture: David Fisher/REX/Shutterstock) Leigh-Anne is dropping more solo music imminently (Picture: PA) She added: \u2018I can\u2019t do it anymore, I can\u2019t do it.\u2019 Leigh-Anne is not the only Little Mix member who has had to face long-distance relationship strife in a set of very similar circumstances. Perrie Edwards and footballer fiance Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain also started dating in 2016 and share two-year-old son Axel. They got engaged in June 2022. But on The Jonathan Ross Show, the Power singer admitted that the loved-up couple had never lived together. \u2018When he was playing for Liverpool and based in Manchester, it was so easy to do the back and forth but Turkey is a little bit further and he doesn\u2019t get a lot of time off,\u2019 Perrie said; Alex currently plays for Turkish club Be\u015fikta\u015f. Bandmate Perrie Edwards is suffering through the same thing with her fiance (Picture: Instagram/Perrie Edwards) \u2018I\u2019m trying to launch a solo career whilst having a two-year-old so it is a lot to juggle but we make it work for the ones we love don\u2019t we? \u2018We\u2019ve never lived together anyway \u2013 the whole eight years we\u2019ve been in a relationship we\u2019ve never actually lived together,\u2019 she added. As both try to come to terms with their circumstances, Leigh-Anne is looking towards the release of her new single No Hard Feelings at the end of May. \u2018I\u2019ve waited so long for this moment and it\u2019s almost here,\u2019 she said in an Instagram post announcing her latest drop.

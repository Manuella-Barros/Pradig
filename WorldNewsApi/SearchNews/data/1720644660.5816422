{"id": 231283540, "title": "A Potently Sweet and Powerful Herb Remarkable for Digestion", "text": "With a sweet taste and potent properties, licorice root is a strong herbal ally for digestion. In traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), licorice root is used for balancing qi\u2014life force\u2014specifically in the spleen, which is considered to be vital for the whole body and the digestive system. It is broadly regarded in Eastern and Western medicine for its specific anti-inflammatory gastrointestinal uses in liver diseases and cancer, heartburn, ulcers, and stomach pain. Inflammation is part of the natural healing process in acute illnesses and injuries, but ongoing systemic inflammation can be the result of lifestyle factors like diet, viruses, aging, and toxins. The authors of the 2022 review note that IBD and colorectal cancer rates are growing and contribute to a large number of deaths annually, creating a need for more therapeutic solutions. IBD patients also face a higher risk of cancer. Twelve licorice flavonoids have been found to inhibit cancer growth by causing apoptosis, or cell death. The cellular-level actions of licorice root may prevent tissue damage in autoimmune diseases and other inflammatory disorders, the review explained. The review went on to highlight another licorice compound called isoliquiritigenin, which halts cancer using a combination of mechanisms including apoptosis, as well as autophagy. Autophagy is a cellular process that recycles cellular debris for cellular efficiency. Isoliquiritigenin also halts the growth of new blood vessels, called anti-angiogenesis, a common role of some cancer drugs. \u201cThe liver conducts several critical processes (metabolism, detoxification, and bile production). It protects against foreign chemical exposure by detoxifying and removing them. Because the liver is responsible for the metabolism and elimination of medicines from the body, a healthy liver is critical to general health,\u201d the review stated, noting that licorice is also a TCM remedy for liver disease. The 2022 review summarized several promising studies showing the potential for licorice to stop the growth of infection-causing microbes, though dosage and sourcing varied. The studies were conducted in vitro, meaning outside the human body. Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) responds well to licorice, as well. H. pylori overgrowth causes peptic ulcers and can lead to gastric cancer. \u201cLicorice root is really loved for ulcers and for heartburn\u2014whenever there\u2019s a burning, painful sensation\u2014because it\u2019s very cooling and soothing and very mucilaginous in nature,\u201d herbalist Rosalee de la For\u00eat told The Epoch Times. Both the licorice and bismuth treatment approaches worked effectively on pain and healing tissue, confirmed by exams. The study authors noted that research has shown licorice may be useful for killing all H.pylori strains rapidly and alleviating symptoms of ulcers\u2014without adverse effects on other healthy gastrointestinal flora. \u201cIf we take it in large doses every single day, some people are pretty susceptible to developing high blood pressure from that,\u201d Ms. de la For\u00eat said. \u201cIf somebody has a tendency to high blood pressure, and even if they don\u2019t, I\u2019d be cautious of taking more than three to five grams of licorice root every day.\u201d Dried licorice root can be found in powder, capsule, tablet, or liquid form. Some extracts do not contain glycyrrhizin\u2014removed to cut down on the side effects\u2014and those are referred to as \u201cdeglycyrrhizinated\u201d licorice. Ms. de la For\u00eat said deglycyrrhizinated teas are often the safest bet for long-term use. Another way to more safely use licorice root is to \u201charmonize it with other herbs,\u201d according to Lily Choi, an acupuncture and traditional Chinese medicine practitioner who specializes in pain management. Licorice root is highly regarded in TCM, she said because it\u2019s among the herbs that can strengthen the spleen. \u201cA lot of times when people have gut imbalances, they have weak spleens,\u201d Ms. Choi said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very powerful herb, but we always say that single herbs should be used with caution and not every day. If you want to use it every day, it would be best used every day in a formula.\u201d She suggested using it as a tincture blend or as a tea, which could be taken every two to three days. Licorice root on its own could also be mixed with goji berry, chrysanthemum, or lotus\u2014all of which have benefits for digestive health, according to Ms. Choi. Blending licorice root with other herbs can mask unpleasant flavors, too, with its potent sweetness. \u201cAn herb like licorice root is good to sprinkle into your routine,\u201d she said. \u201cIt harmonizes all herbs, and allows the herbs to go where they need to go in the body.\u201d", "summary": "Licorice root can bring relief to problems like liver disease, stomach pain, ulcers, and bacterial overgrowth when used with care.\u00a0", "url": "https://www.theepochtimes.com/health/a-potently-sweet-and-powerful-herb-remarkable-for-digestion-5663982", "image": "https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/06/07/id5664878-Shutterstock_2251398339-1-300x180.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 13:20:17", "author": "Amy Denney", "authors": ["Amy Denney"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.067}

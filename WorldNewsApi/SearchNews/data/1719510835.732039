{"id": 223906818, "title": "Meet wee warrior Georgia, who has new hope with 'rewired brain'", "text": "It is the rare and potentially fatal disease her parents had never heard of, until it struck their child. And it is one that toddler Georgia McLaughlan would have been unlikely to survive, were it not for the surgeon who \u201crewired\u201d her brain. The wee Glasgow warrior was just 18 months old when she suffered the first of three strokes in three months while on holiday in Spain last summer. After initial treatment at a Spanish hospital to stabilise her, she was flown home in a private jet with medics and her family at her side and taken to the city\u2019s Royal Hospital for Children. It was there that paediatric brain surgeon Roddy O\u2019Kane and his team, after careful assessment, carried out two delicate, complex and risky surgeries, rewiring each side of her brain to counter the potentially deadly impact of the Moyamoya disease that affects only one person in a million, most unusually children under the age of 10. Now, little more than six weeks after the last surgery on April 9, the toddler \u2013 who was rendered virtually lifeless by her third devastating stroke \u2013 is home, \u201cblossoming\u201d and \u201clearning to walk again\u201d. \u2018We didn\u2019t think a baby could have a stroke\u2019 Last week she was back at -hospital with her parents \u2013 Kirsty and Andrew McLaughlan \u2013 to thank the surgeon and the teams that support him for giving Georgia a chance at life. Cuddling up to her daughter, and with a beaming smile, Kirsty, 38, told the Post: \u201cRoddy is our absolute hero \u2013 they all are\u2026the whole neurosurgical team, and all those behind the scenes who have played their part. \u201cThey have been amazing. We owe them the world.\u201d Andrew, 39, added: \u201cWe had never heard of Moyamoya disease. We didn\u2019t think a baby could have a stroke. \u201cIf they hadn\u2019t found out what was wrong with her and found a way to fix it, it would have been a waiting game; waiting for something horrible to happen. We owe them everything.\u201d Smiling, surgeon Roddy O\u2019Kane said: \u201cGeorgia is unusual. She is the youngest patient I have treated with Moyamoya. \u201cShe has come on leaps and bounds from having multiple strokes that would probably have shortened her life drastically. Time will tell us how we are going to go in the long game. But there are certainly optimistic signs in this immediate post-operative stage.\u201d He explained: \u201cWe only see one to two cases of Moyamoya a year, and most neurosurgeons never really see it. The typical age in a child is between seven and 10, for adults it is their 30s and 40s.\u201d The condition causes the wall of the blood vessels to sequentially thicken and the lumen \u2013 or hole at the centre of the vessel \u2013 to become smaller, compromising blood supply and oxygen supply to the brain. In more than two-thirds of sufferers, left untreated, it will lead to \u201cimpaired quality of life, if not loss of life\u201d, he said. \u201cThe only medical treatment we use is aspirin to thin the blood because, as the vessels narrow, they develop emboli, or clots.\u201d Both sides of Georgia\u2019s brain were affected, and she required separate surgical procedures \u2013 known as Pial synangiosis, which would usually be carried out a year apart. O\u2019Kane explained: \u201cYou can\u2019t do them together because the operation is really high risk for any Moyamoya patient. Even a small drop in blood pressure will cause another stroke. The normal stroke rate during this procedure is one in five.\u201d In Georgia the risk was even higher \u2013 one in two. He added: \u201cShe is young, and the disease was very progressed. I didn\u2019t think she could wait a year for the second operation, so I did it at six months.\u201d A delicate procedure With anaesthetist Simon Young, he carried out the first in September and the second operation last month. Explaining the delicate seven-hour procedure \u2013 conducted with the aid of a microscope \u2013 he said: \u201cWe take the superficial temporal artery \u2013 in Georgia it was really small, one to two millimetres \u2013 and skeletonise it out of the tissues it normally supplies. Then we open the skull and suture the vessel to the brain.\u201d The effect, although not immediate, causes the oxygen-starved part of the brain to grow other oxygen-carrying blood - vessels from it. And, in a technique he said \u201chas never been used anywhere else in the world\u201d, he put a probe into the brain to measure oxygen levels during the surgery and \u201cpick up strokes before they were happening\u201d. He explained: \u201cThe device is used normally in head injuries. Nobody has ever used it in this setting.\u201d It provided ongoing -surveillance for two days after the operation. He said Georgia\u2019s progress will be checked about a year from the date of her last surgery with an angiogram (diagnostic photography). It will show the vessels that are blocked and the new vessels that are blooming and giving oxygen to the brain. Reliving their nightmare in Spain last summer, Kirsty, an IT project manager with Dell Technologies, said: \u201cBack then we could never have imagined being in this position now. We were terrified. We thought we were going to lose our wee girl. \u201cShe began to have a seizure when were at our hotel in Salou. We thought she was teething, or it was too hot. \u201cThen she gave a scream like I had never heard before. Her shoulder was twitching, and I noticed her arm had gone limp.\u201d They rushed their baby to the nearest children\u2019s hospital. Andrew, a network officer with Glasgow City Council at the Clyde Tunnel, said: \u201cThey gave her a CT scan and suspected a stroke. An ambulance was being sent from the main hospital in Barcelona. That\u2019s when we -realised how serious it was.\u201d Their daughter remained at its Vall d\u2019Hebron Hospital for 10 days for MRI scans and blood tests and was told she had -suspected Moyamoya. Kirsty said: \u201cThe hardest part was when they took her into intensive care, and we had to wait outside. \u201cWe could hear her -screaming and we couldn\u2019t get to her. No one spoke any English. \u201cWe were fortunate that, at the height of the stress, when they told us the next 48 hours would be really critical, one nurse in ITU spoke good English. Other times we were using Google translate. The Barcelona hospital gave her the best -possible care, but it was still horrific.\u201d \u2018She is blossoming\u2019 Now, with their daughter safe at home, but still being fed by tube, they could not be more grateful to those who made it possible. O\u2019Kane said: \u201cGeorgia was having big, severe strokes, and untreated she would have had more. I don\u2019t think she would have made it into adulthood. She has had developmental impairment, but we hope she will catch up again. \u201cShe is learning to walk again, and she is blooming. She is a lovely wee girl, and her parents are great people. \u201cGoing through what they are going through, I would be whingeing and complaining, but they are forever thankful and pleasant. \u201cChildren\u2019s brains are great for rewiring,\u201d he smiled. \u201cThe paediatric surgeon\u2019s secret is they recover much better than an adult and make us look really good.\u201d And, with a chuckle, he added: \u201cThe child has done all the work, but don\u2019t tell anyone.\u201d", "summary": "It is the rare and potentially fatal disease her parents had never heard of, until it struck their child.

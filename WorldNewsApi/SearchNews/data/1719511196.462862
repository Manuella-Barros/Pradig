Murray withdrew from the Charles Schwab Challenge with two holes remaining of Friday\u2019s second round and died on Saturday morning at the age of 30. \u201cWe have spent the last 24 hours trying to come to terms with the fact that our son is gone,\u201d Eric and Terry Murray said in a statement released on their behalf by the PGA Tour. \u201cIt\u2019s surreal that we not only have to admit it to ourselves, but that we also have to acknowledge it to the world. It\u2019s a nightmare. \u201cWe have so many questions that have no answers. But one. \u201cWas Grayson loved? The answer is yes. By us, his brother Cameron, his sister Erica, all of his extended family, by his friends, by his fellow players and \u2013 it seems \u2013 by many of you who are reading this. He was loved and he will be missed. \u201cWe would like to thank the PGA TOUR and the entire world of golf for the outpouring of support. Life wasn\u2019t always easy for Grayson, and although he took his own life, we know he rests peacefully now. \u201cPlease respect our privacy as we work through this incredible tragedy, and please honour Grayson by being kind to one another. If that becomes his legacy, we could ask for nothing else. Thank you.\u201d World number one Scottie Scheffler had earlier led the tributes to Murray, who won the Barbasol Championship in 2017 and the Sony Open in January. \u201cObviously, the news hasn\u2019t really sunk in quite yet, but I\u2019m thinking about his family and praying hard for all of them,\u201d Scheffler said. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine how difficult of a time this is. I got to know Grayson a bit better over the last six months or so. \u201cThere\u2019s not really a way to put into words how sad and tragic it is, but I\u2019m thinking about his family.\u201d Murray had been open about his battles with anxiety and depression and revealed in January that he had sought treatment in the past few years for alcohol abuse but had been sober for several months. Three years ago he posted on social media he felt the Tour did not do enough to assist players who dealt with illnesses such as his. \u201cWhen Grayson said that, I called him right away,\u201d PGA Tour commissioner Jay Monahan said on Saturday. \u201cOver the last several years I spent a lot of time with him because I wanted to understand what we could do, in his opinion, to help everybody else out here. \u201cI\u2019m devastated by Grayson\u2019s loss. The conversations I had with him, particularly the last year, I learned an awful lot from him. He was very open and transparent with me. \u201cWe don\u2019t know the circumstances around Grayson\u2019s passing. My conversations with Grayson in the area of mental health\u2026 we\u2019re always challenging ourselves to make certain that we\u2019re on the front edge of being able to provide the support that we can for everybody out here. \u201cThese are some of the best athletes in the world. They think they\u2019re, in many respects, invincible. \u201cOne of the things I think back about Grayson\u2019s openness is he taught us all a lesson on that front and that\u2019s something I\u2019ll never forget.\u201d", "summary": "World number one Scottie Scheffler had earlier led the tributes to Murray, who won the Barbasol Championship in 2017 and the Sony Open in January.", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/golf/cameron-grayson-pga-tour-world-scottie-scheffler-b2551815.html", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/05/26/16/14-665e51df3e6c420593cf2f5d0853b07e.jpg?width=1200", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 15:57:39", "author": "Pa Sport Staff", "authors": ["Pa Sport Staff"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.059}

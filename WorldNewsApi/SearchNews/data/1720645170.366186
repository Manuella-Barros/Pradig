An opportunity for reporters to quiz the Prime Minister did not take place as was originally planned, with the Tories citing time constraints, as he toured County Durham and Yorkshire. The planned \u201chuddle\u201d with journalists was called off as the D-Day row continued, and after his awkward exchange with broadcasters a day earlier. Labour\u2019s shadow paymaster general Jonathan Ashworth said: \u201cIf Rishi Sunak is going to come out with yet another desperate wishlist of manifesto proposals this weekend, the least he can do is face up to proper public scrutiny over how he plans to pay for them, what the impact on people\u2019s finances will be, and when he intends to deliver on the first set of pledges he made to the British people 18 months ago. \u201cBut instead, he has spent the day ducking the cameras and dodging all those legitimate questions; just another farcical episode in this calamitous Conservative campaign.\u201d Mr Sunak met volunteers away from public view at a walled garden in Bishop Auckland, before attending a village fete in Great Ayton, a North Yorkshire village in his Richmond constituency. It came after another Cabinet minister said Mr Sunak had made a \u201cmistake\u201d by skipping a major D-Day event amid Tory anger over the move. Mark Harper said he agreed \u201cwith what the Prime Minister himself said \u2013 it was a mistake for him to leave early\u201d, but did not go as far as fellow senior Conservative Penny Mordaunt in branding the decision \u201ccompletely wrong\u201d. Mr Sunak was forced to apologise for leaving France before an international ceremony attended by world leaders including US President Joe Biden to mark the 80th anniversary of the Allied landings. The move prompted a fierce backlash from political rivals and some Conservatives already nervous about their party\u2019s electoral prospects, with the outrage swelling after it emerged Mr Sunak had returned to the UK to record a General Election campaign TV interview. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said people were \u201cflabbergasted\u201d by the Prime Minister\u2019s decision, which was \u201csuch a letdown for our whole country and our history, particularly for our brave veterans\u201d. \u201cI share the concerns of veterans and people across the country who feel really let down and are upset, and indeed some very angry,\u201d he told the PA news agency during a visit to Newbury. Labour\u2019s Sir Keir Starmer stressed he felt it was his \u201cduty\u201d to thank veterans at the D-Day event the Prime Minister skipped. Mr Harper repeated the Prime Minister\u2019s suggestion it had always been his intention to leave before the international event on Omaha Beach, even before he called the election. The Transport Secretary told BBC Breakfast on Saturday: \u201cI don\u2019t know what the detail was of putting the Prime Minister\u2019s schedule together, which, as he said, was done some time ago before the election campaign was called. \u201cBut look, it was a mistake. People make mistakes. The Prime Minister has made a mistake. He\u2019s apologised for it. And he\u2019s apologised to those that would have been particularly hurt by it.\u201d Ms Mordaunt, a Navy reservist, told a seven-way BBC debate on Friday: \u201cWhat happened was completely wrong and the Prime Minister has rightly apologised for that, apologised to veterans but also to all of us, because he was representing all of us.\u201d The Commons Leader is seen as a potential successor to Mr Sunak as Tory leader, although she is projected to lose her Portsmouth North seat at the election. After she said the issue should not become \u201ca political football\u201d, Reform UK leader Nigel Farage replied: \u201cWell, it already is. It already is because the veterans themselves are speaking out saying he\u2019s let the country down.\u201d The Tories have sought to move on from the row with new policy offers, including a pledge to axe stamp duty for first-time buyers on homes up to \u00a3425,000. They also set out their \u201cBacking Drivers Bill\u201d which would ban Wales-style blanket 20mph limits and reverse the Ultra Low Emission Zone (Ulez) expansion from inner into outer London. Sir Keir detailed Labour\u2019s plans for small businesses, including an overhaul of the business rates system, at a brewery in Camden alongside Dragons\u2019 Den star Deborah Meaden. Sir Ed tried his hand at tennis in Newbury and visited an adventure golf course in Wokingham as he promoted the Lib Dems\u2019 proposal to plough \u00a350 million a year into creating three new national parks.", "summary": "A planned \u2018huddle\u2019 with reporters was called off as the Prime Minister hit the campaign trail on home turf.", "url": "https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/rishi-sunak-jonathan-ashworth-prime-minister-penny-mordaunt-cameron-b1163090.html", "image": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2024/06/08/18/14c4057bbf436f99a37584fcecf5a399Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNzE3OTUyMzk0-2.76445977.jpg?width=1200", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 17:06:29", "author": "Sophie Wingate", "authors": ["Sophie Wingate"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.224}

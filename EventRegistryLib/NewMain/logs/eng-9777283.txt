She explained the only reason it didn't get a even higher score was because they ran out when she went earlier, so deducted points for that.\n\n\"It tastes like a cupcake, it's so moist.

And in a third video, he says, \"I HEREBY DECLARE MYSELF AS THE OLYMPIC MUFFIN MAN.\"\n\nThe swimmer isn't alone in his love for the treats, which have a gooey melted chocolate center and a sprinkling of chocolate chips.

Another X user described the series of videos the \"most unexpected yet entertaining thing to have come from the olympics this year.\"\n\n\"what is the funniest thing to come out of the olympics and why is it that team norway athlete who has now dedicated his entire life to the olympic village chocolate muffin,\" one X user wrote.\n\nChristiansen, who made his Olympic debut in Rio, is scheduled to compete in the men's 10km marathon swimming event as well as the men's 1,500-meter freestyle. He already swam in 800 freestyle heats on Monday, where he ranked 25th overall.", "source": {"uri": "nbcnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henrik_Christiansen_(swimmer)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Henrik Christiansen (swimmer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muffin", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Muffin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Village", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Village"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Norway"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Norway"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bakery", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bakery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chocolate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chocolate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobby_Caldwell", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bobby Caldwell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shrek_(franchise)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shrek (franchise)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gingerbread_man", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gingerbread man"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freestyle_swimming", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Freestyle swimming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Swimming (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marathon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marathon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Pins", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Pins", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 72}], "image": "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1024-512,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-07/240730-Henrik-Christiansen-ew-447p-3ed7a7.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9777283", "eventUri": "eng-9777283", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

And in a third video, he says, \"I HEREBY DECLARE MYSELF AS THE OLYMPIC MUFFIN MAN.\"\n\n\"I literally cannot stop,\" he added in the comments.\n\nThe swimmer isn't alone in his love for the treats, which have a gooey melted chocolate center and a sprinkling of chocolate chips. PEOPLE caught up with Stephen Nedoroscik, Brody Malone and Asher Hong -- members of the bronze-medal-winning U.S. men's gymnastics team -- and they echoed Christiansen's love for the treats.\n\n\"I had my first one this morning...oh my gosh, they're really good,\" says Malone, 24. \"They're so gooey.\"\n\n\"And there's that filling of chocolate in the middle,\" added Nedoroscik, 25, a pommel horse specialist whose medal-clinching performance has also gone viral. \"It is delicious.\"\n\nFilipino-American gymnast Aleah Finnegan, competing for Team Philippines in Paris, gave her own review on TikTok.\n\n\"I understand the hype of these chocolate muffins in the village,\" Finnegan, 21, wrote over the clip, which showed her reacting after bite of a muffin. \"They are so good like ???\" she captioned the video.\n\nThe Olympic Village cafeteria has six different sections -- including French, world, halal and Asian-themed \"restaurants\" -- a boulangerie and several grab-and-go options to feed the 15,000 athletes staying in the complex.\n\nBefore the official start of the games, Finnegan posted her reaction to one of her meals in the Village cafeteria.\n\n\"It's pretty good, like it's good food, it's just...you could probably season it a little bit,\" she said in the July 22 TikTok. \"Just personal preference. That's me.\"\n\nTeam USA fencers Lee Kiefer and Gerek Meinhardt, who operate a joint TikTok account under the username @oldmarriedolympians, gave a look at the extensive breakfast food options within the \"world\" station, including fresh fruit, different yogurts and dairy products, hot food such as pancakes, waffles and eggs along with a selection of baked goods.\n\nThe food is being catered by the French company Sodexo Live!. It's intended to give athletes a wide range of international options, be as sustainable as possible (food products must be sourced from within France) and give the visiting competitors a taste of French cuisine, according to Olympic officials.\n\nWe are \"placing a special focus on the French recipes,\" Carole Galissant, a nutritionist for Sodexo Live! told The New York Times. \"Blanquette de veau, lemon tart, Paris-Brest.\"\n\nTo help elevate the cuisine, organizers for the games enlisted three esteemed French chefs: Akrame Benallal, Amandine Chaignot and Alexandre Mazzia.\n\nChaignot, who runs a handful of acclaimed Parisian restaurants, spoke about one of her recipes, based on the classic French croissant, for the athletes at a media event in April.\n\n\"I wanted the recipe I suggested to be representative of the French terroir, but I wanted athletes to enjoy it at the same time,\" she told the Associated Press. \"It was quite obvious for me to make a croissant that I could twist. So, you have a bit of artichoke puree, a poached egg, a bit of truffle and a bit of cheese. It's both vegetarian and still mouthwatering.\"\n\nTo learn more about all the Olympic and Paralympic hopefuls, come to people.com to check out ongoing coverage before, during and after the games.

Obsession With The Chocolate Muffins At The Olympics", "body": "The food at the Olympic Village in Paris has received somewhat mixed reviews from the athletes who've gathered there, but Norwegian swimmer Henrik Christiansen was more than satisfied with one offering based on a hilarious string of posts concerning his obsession with the chocolate muffins that are being served up.\n\nMore than 14,000 athletes from around the globe descended upon the Olympic Village prior to the Opening Ceremony, and it didn't take long for some issues to emerge after the cafeteria tasked with fueling them somehow found itself dealing with a shortage of chicken and eggs (arguably the two most popular sources of protein for people who require plenty of it to stay at the top of their game).\n\nPlenty of athletes have hopped on social media to review the food that's being served up at the Olympics (like LSU gymnast Aleah Finnegan, who took issue with a lack of seasoning while competing for the Philippines).\n\nThat list of critics includes Henrik Christiansen, a 27-year-old swimmer for Norway who previously represented the country in Rio and Tokyo before heading to Paris to compete in the 800m and 1500m freestyle events in addition to the 10km marathon.\n\nThe self-proclaimed Mark Zuckerberg lookalike has been chronicling his Olympics journey on TikTok, and last week, he stopped by the canteen to rate some of the food he got the chance to sample -- including an \"insane\" chocolate muffin that received an 11/10.\n\nThat marked the start of an incredibly entertaining saga involving Christiansen's obsession with the chocolate muffins that have become a staple of the videos he's posted since then, and it's safe to say he isn't having any trouble hitting his carb macros based on how many he's seemingly consumed.\n\nAn Olympics worker jokingly called him out after discovering there were no chocolate muffins to be found after stopping by the dining hall, and I honestly don't know if he was joking when he hopped into the comments to respond.", "source": {"uri": "brobible.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "BroBible"}, "authors": [{"uri": "connor_toole@brobible.com",

But, oh, that was only the beginning.\n\nSoon, Henrik's TikTok account began filling up with tons of chocolate muffin content. I mean, these muffins must have superpowers because the muffin mania has gotten so unbelievably out of hand. BUT. WE. CAN'T. LOOK. AWAY.

He gave the pesto pasta with a pork skewer a 7/10 while the shrimp dumplings got an 8/10. But, the \"insane\" chocolate muffin received a whopping 11/10.\n\nIt seems his obsession developed from there as his next TikTok video, captioned \"The single greatest thing about the Olympic Village so far\", was entirely dedicated to the muffins.\n\nThey have since made an appearance in the majority of his TikToks, and the three-time Olympian has declared himself \"the Olympic muffin man\".\n\nChristiansen will compete for Norway in the Men's 1500m freestyle on 3 August, undoubtedly fuelled by the Olympic chocolate muffins which other TikTokers agree look delicious.\n\n\"Ok but I get it. Those muffins look life-changing,\" one person commented.\n\nAnother wrote: \"I don't even know what sport you compete in, but I know you love these dang muffins.\"\n\nSomeone else added: \"As a French person I totally understand this addiction these muffins are so freaking good.\"\n\nIt seems word about the chocolate muffins has spread around the Olympic Village, with other athletes complaining they haven't been able to try one due to the cafeteria running out.\n\nIn one clip, Christiansen could be seen hilariously hoarding some in his bedside table drawer, so I think we know why.", "source": {"uri": "indy100.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "indy100.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muffin", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Muffin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chocolate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chocolate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Swimming (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Village", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Village"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Norway"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Norway"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healthy_diet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Healthy diet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skewer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Skewer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dumpling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dumpling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pesto", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pesto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cafeteria", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cafeteria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shrimp", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shrimp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pork", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pork"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasta", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pasta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "French language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Addiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Pins", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Pins", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.indy100.com/media-library/norwegian-swimmer-hilariously-obsessed-with-chocolate-muffins-at-the-olympics.png?id=53071062&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C70%2C0%2C284", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9777283", "eventUri": "eng-9777283", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-03", "textStart": 1256, "textEnd": 1264}], "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 460203431, "relevance": 2}

A member of the public found Ms Rose early on the morning of July 24 after she headed out at around 5am.\n\nShe was rushed to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge but tragically died of her injuries on Sunday, July 28. Three people have since been arrested in connection with her death.\n\nNow Suffolk Police say they have identified two locations as part of the investigation. Cordons were put up around Newmill Lane in the village as the force said they would be keeping a presence in the area.\n\nDetectives were still searching for a pink jacket Ms Rose was wearing at the time of the attack. The jacket is a zip-up, waterproof jacket and is believed to be from an outdoor clothing brand, possibly Regatta.\n\nA man in his 20s was arrested on suspicion of murder last Wednesday and bailed on Saturday until October 24. A 45-year-old man arrested on suspicion of murder, and a 37-year-old woman who was held on suspicion of handling stolen goods, have been released on police bail to return on October 25.\n\nA post-mortem examination failed to establish the cause of Ms Rose's death, after which Suffolk Police said officers were continuing to investigate the case as murder. Anita is believed to have left her home in Palfrey Heights at about 5am on Wednesday before walking around the outskirts of Brantham before turning onto Rectory Lane.\n\nAccording to a map of her last movements shared by police, Anita moved along Ipswich Road before entering Newmill Lane. She was later found near tracks close to fields and just southwest of Rectory Lane.

groups as \"dangerous misinformation\".\n\nThe posts relate to the ongoing murder investigation into the death of Anita Rose, 57, who left her home in Brantham at 5am on Wednesday, July 24, to take her dog for a walk.\n\nAt 6.25am a member of the public called 999 after finding Ms Rose lying unconscious on a track road near the railway line of Rectory Lane.\n\nShe was taken to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge in a critical condition after sustaining significant head and brain injuries but died days later.\n\nThe unfounded claims to have arisen on social media said the mum-of-six was killed by migrants originally from Somalia.\n\nAmong those posting the lie on social media about the case was former leader of the now defunct English Defence League, Tommy Robinson.\n\nHis video has now been watched six million times.\n\nA spokeswoman for Suffolk police said: \"As previously stated in response to misinformation being circulated online, Suffolk Police can confirm that the arrested and since bailed individuals in connection with the Anita Rose case are not Somali migrants.\n\n\"We typically wouldn't comment on a nationality and the only reason we have in this instance is because it's a dangerous piece of misinformation, which we will continue to dispel.\"\n\nOn Saturday, July 27 a 45-year-old man from the Ipswich area was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder and later rearrested on suspicion of murder in the wake of Ms Rose's death.\n\nA 37-year-old woman, who is also from the Ipswich area, was arrested on the same day on suspicion of handling stolen goods in connection with the incident.\n\nThe par was released on bail with conditions to return on October 25.\n\nAnother person was arrested on suspicion of murder on Wednesday, July 31 a week after the incident happened.\n\nThe suspect, a man in his 20s who is also from Brantham, was taken to Martlesham police station where police were granted extra hours for questioning.\n\nHe has since been

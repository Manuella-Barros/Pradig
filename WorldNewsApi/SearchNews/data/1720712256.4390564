The Fianna F\u00e1il councillors based in Athenry will now see her 1,118 votes distributed among the remaining candidates still vying for the still unfilled three seats. Cllr Albert Dolan, Tom\u00e1s Grealish, David Collins and James Charity have the first four seats. Former councillor Peter Feeney is 217 votes from the magic number to get over the line. All eyes at the Lawn Tennis Club count centre will be on who benefits from the Fianna F\u00e1il vote, with her colleague Cillian Keane still well in contention but still 550 votes short. Louis O\u2019Hara is in second place, looking to pick up 376 transfers to make the quota, with Eoghan Gallagher (FG) needed 401 transfers.

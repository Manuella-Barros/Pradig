These proceedings were never necessary.\n\n\"Kyle's offer should have been accepted months ago and would therefore have eliminated the need for added stress to all involved.\n\n\"In light of this judgment and the truths it makes public, my client and his family now ask that the media fully respects their rights to a private life as they navigate their next steps.\"\n\nThe two-day hearing began on July 16, a day after Mr Walker returned from Germany after England's European Championship final defeat to Spain.\n\nThe press was restricted from reporting on the case during the hearing, but Judge Hess ruled that the restrictions should be lifted on Tuesday.\n\nThe court heard that Ms Goodman began her legal claim two days after Kinara's birth, with her demands including that Mr Walker paid for the upkeep of a hydro-pool, a \u00a328-per-hour gardener, a car worth up to \u00a370,000 every three years and air conditioning costing around \u00a333,000.\n\nShe further claimed that Mr Walker should pay to fix 59 \"snagging issues\" at the property bought for her and the children by the footballer under the terms of a previous court order related to their first child, Kairo, claiming they pose a safety risk.\n\nGiving evidence, she said that the money was needed to \"secure my children's future\" and that she did not want them to be \"different\" from Mr Walker's other children.\n\nShe also justified the need for a \u00a331,200 artificial turf pitch by stating that Kinara kicked a ball from a crawling position, which could make her a future England footballer, adding: \"The Lionesses are better than the Lions.\"\n\nBut the judge dismissed the pitch demand, describing her reasoning as an \"unjustified evidential leap\", and also rejected the air conditioning claim, adding she could mitigate high temperatures in her home by \"deploying a modestly-priced electric fan\".\n\nMr Walker, who also has four sons with his wife Annie Kilner Walker, opposed some of Ms Goodman's claims or argued they should be decreased, telling the court that he was not an \"open chequebook\" despite earning between \u00a33 million and \u00a35 million per year.\n\nWhile he accepted some of the demands, Mr Walker's lawyers claimed that Ms Goodman was making a \"blatant attempt to leverage\" money for \"personal benefit\".\n\nIn his ruling, Judge Hess claimed Mr Walker \"acted with dignity and generosity\", adding he was \"not persuaded\" by many of Ms Goodman's claims.\n\nHe said: \"Plainly, he (Mr Walker) was embarrassed and remorseful as to the difficult situation in which he has placed a number of people, including all of his children, and regretted his decision-making in trying to keep his paternity of Kinara a secret.\n\n\"But he has in my view acted with dignity and generosity, and, once the secret was out, honesty, in facing up to the financial and personal consequences of what happened.\n\n\"In contrast, my assessment of the mother is that she was not reliable, often said what she thought would help her case rather than what was true, failed to make a calm and measured assessment of what she needed and often exaggerated her need to spend money.\"\n\nThe judge said that Walker had already paid more than \u00a3430,000, plus thousands more per month, to Ms Goodman for Kinara and changes to her \u00a32.4 million Sussex property, which he also purchased.\n\nThe footballer also agreed to pay \"all but a very small portion\" of Ms Goodman's \u00a3259,298 of legal costs related to the dispute, on top of his own fees of \u00a3171,440.\n\nBoth sides were encouraged sides to \"compromise\" over the \"snagging\" issues.\n\nMr Walker was ordered to pay \u00a312,500 per month in child maintenance - a figure he offered before the hearing began - and a sum of \u00a35,000 for furniture compared with Ms Goodman's initial demand of \u00a320,000.\n\nMr Walker was also ordered to pay \u00a330,000 for a car to be used by a nanny and other fees.\n\nMs Goodman has previously publicly confirmed that Mr Walker was the father of her second child, and sent a text to Mrs Walker last December stating: \"Hey it's Lauryn I just wanted to quickly tell you that Kyle is the father of our daughter.\"\n\nIn his ruling, the judge said that Mr Walker had made payments to Ms Goodman to \"keep the lid\" on the news of her second pregnancy, adding \"honesty might have been a better policy\".\n\nThe judge also added that it was not the court's role to \"make moral judgments\" or \"punish or condemn any perceived human frailties or lack of wisdom\".\n\nBut he ruled that the text sent by Ms Goodman to Mrs Walker \"intended to, and did, cause distress\".\n\nHe said: \"I do not accept the mother's explanation that this text message was sent in an attempt to create a good working relationship between the two women in the father's life.\n\n\"In my view, this text was written in the same spirit as the series of text communications with the father's next-door neighbour in Cheshire in which the mother sought to persuade the neighbour to record conversations over the garden fence with a view to gain material to undermine the father's marriage.\n\n\"When the mother texted the neighbour to say 'ready to finish them', she had in mind causing irreparable damage to the father's marriage.\"", "source": {"uri":

The Manchester City footballer, who earns between \u00a33 million and \u00a35 million per year, opposed some of these or argued they should be decreased.\n\n'Global' child maintenance\n\nA previous court battle over payments resulted in Mr Walker being ordered to pay monthly child maintenance of \u00a38,000 and more than \u00a3180,000 in lump sums.\n\nHe also later purchased a \u00a32.4 million property in Sussex for Ms Goodman and their children.\n\nThe judge said that Mr Walker had already paid more than \u00a3430,000, plus thousands more per month, to Ms Goodman for Kinara, as well as for changes to the property.\n\nReturning to court earlier this month Ms Goodman, 33, demanded that Mr Walker pay \u00a314,750 a month in \"global\" child maintenance for the pair's two children, as well as tens of thousands for cars, furnishing and property maintenance and other costs, such as nursery fees.\n\nThe court heard that Ms Goodman began her legal claim two days after Kinara's birth, with her demands including that Mr Walker paid for the upkeep of a hydro-pool, a \u00a328-per-hour gardener, a car worth up to \u00a370,000 every three years and air conditioning costing around \u00a333,000.\n\nGiving evidence, she said the money was needed to \"secure my children's future\" and that she did not want Kinara, as well as the pair's older son Kairo, to be \"different\" from Mr Walker's other children.\n\n'Not reliable'\n\nShe also justified the need for a \u00a331,200 artificial turf pitch by stating that Kinara kicked a ball from a crawling position, which could make her a future England footballer, adding: \"The Lionesses are better than the Lions.\"\n\nMr Walker was ordered to pay \u00a312,500 per month in child maintenance - a figure he offered before the hearing began - and a sum of \u00a35,000 for furniture compared with Ms Goodman's initial demand of \u00a320,000.\n\nMr Walker was also ordered to pay \u00a330,000 for a car to be used by a nanny and other fees.\n\nThe footballer also agreed to pay \"all but a very small portion\" of Ms Goodman's \u00a3259,298 of legal costs related to the dispute, on top of his own fees of \u00a3171,440.\n\nBut Judge Edward Hess dismissed many of Ms Goodman's other demands, saying that she was \"not reliable\" and \"often exaggerated her need to spend money\".\n\nIn a written judgement, Judge Hess said Ms Goodman did not have a \"good track record of telling the truth\" and was \"often difficult, unreasonable and demanding\".\n\nHe stated: \"My assessment of the mother is that she was not reliable, often said what she thought would help her case rather than what was true, failed to make a calm and measured assessment of what she needed and often exaggerated her need to spend money (I think the father was correct to observe that the mother was in many ways treating him as an open-ended chequebook).\"\n\nThe two-day hearing began on July 16, a day after Mr Walker returned from Germany after England's European Championship final defeat to Spain.\n\nMr Walker said that the dispute over child maintenance payments would \"not have got this far\" if he were a \"painter and decorator\".\n\nFollowing the ruling handed down at the Central Family Court in London a spokeswoman for the footballer said: \"This judgement speaks for itself in laying bare Lauryn Goodman's insatiable greed and relentless pursuit of money.\"\n\nJudge Hess ruled that Mr Walker should not be penalised for any child maintenance arrears, which he described as \"an error by the father\", adding that the footballer has \"acted with dignity and generosity\".\n\nMs Goodman, 33, had claimed that Mr Walker \"does not think\" about the situation of her and their two children, who were born outside of his marriage to Annie Kilner Walker, with whom he has four sons.\n\n'Open chequebook'\n\nMr Walker met his wife when she was 16 and he was 18 when he was playing for Sheffield United. They secretly married in 2021 after she forgave him for having an affair and fathering a son Kairo, now three, with Goodman.\n\nBut it later emerged he had gone on to father Kinara with the model and influencer.\n\nGiving evidence Mr Walker rejected Ms Goodman's accusations, stating: \"A pound is a pound, and let's not be flippant that because I earn the amount of money that I earn, which I have done off my own back, you can just spend money and have an open chequebook.\n\n\"I do feel that because of who I am and what I do, and the money that I have, you are taking well out of consideration what is actually needed.\n\n\"If I was a painter and decorator, I don't think we would have got this far.\"\n\nThe court heard that Mr Walker had seen his son Kairo four times and Kinara just once and that his decision to \"draw a line\" under their relationship in favour of focusing on his marriage was a \"source of disappointment, anguish and anger\" for Ms Goodman.\n\nJudge Hess said Walker \"does not currently plan to repeat\" the \"small number of fleeting encounters\" he had had with their children.\n\n'Just horrendous'\n\nIn her evidence, Ms Goodman said: \"He (Mr Walker) has formed a bond with Kairo, who is now sat there asking for his dad. The whole thing is just horrendous.\"\n\nFollowing the publication of the ruling Ms Goodman said in a statement: \"I'd like to thank the judge for his careful consideration, with my children's needs at the heart of his decision.\n\n\"These have been difficult and stressful proceedings, which I had hoped would not be necessary. This has only ever been about the children and providing for their futures.\n\nIn written submissions, Nichola Gray KC, for Ms Goodman, said: \"This case is not about affordability. The father plainly has the means, and ample means, to satisfy each and every claim which the mother has made.\"\n\nShe added Kinara's birth had \"inevitably caused a radical change in the daily childcare burden\" Ms Goodman faces as a single mother, claiming that Mr Walker \"completely underestimates\" the \"task of juggling the needs of two children single-handedly\".\n\nIn her written arguments, Nikki Saxton KC, for Mr Walker, said the previous court order \"already provides for Ms Goodman's housing and her monthly budget in the new home\", and that there was an \"obvious and unattractive theme\" in Ms Goodman's case.\n\nShe continued: \"Regrettably, it is difficult not to conclude that Ms Goodman has leveraged her position and sees this as an opportunity to try and achieve an award which goes well beyond the additional costs of a second child.\"\n\nMs Gray said that under a court order issued in January this year, Mr Walker needed to pay \u00a37,000 a month in child maintenance to Ms Goodman for Kinara.\n\nThe press was restricted from reporting on the case during the hearing, but Judge Hess ruled that the restrictions should be lifted on Tuesday.",

The Manchester City footballer, who earns between \u00a33 million and \u00a35 million per year, opposed some of these or argued they should be decreased.\n\nA previous court battle over payments resulted in Mr Walker being ordered to pay monthly child maintenance of \u00a38,000 and more than \u00a3180,000 in lump sums.\n\nHe also later purchased a \u00a32.4 million property in Sussex for Ms Goodman and their children.\n\nThe judge said that Mr Walker had already paid more than \u00a3430,000, plus thousands more per month, to Ms Goodman for Kinara, as well as for changes to the property.\n\nReturning to court earlier this month Ms Goodman, 33, demanded that Mr Walker pay \u00a314,750 a month in \"global\" child maintenance for the pair's two children, as well as tens of thousands for cars, furnishing and property maintenance and other costs, such as nursery fees.\n\nThe court heard that Ms Goodman began her legal claim two days after Kinara's birth, with her demands including that Mr Walker paid for the upkeep of a hydro-pool, a \u00a328-per-hour gardener, a car worth up to \u00a370,000 every three years and air conditioning costing around \u00a333,000.\n\nGiving evidence, she said the money was needed to \"secure my children's future\" and that she did not want Kinara, as well as the pair's older son Kairo, to be \"different\" from Mr Walker's other children.\n\nShe also justified the need for a \u00a331,200 artificial turf pitch by stating that Kinara kicked a ball from a crawling position, which could make her a future England footballer, adding: \"The Lionesses are better than the Lions.\"\n\nMr Walker was ordered to pay \u00a312,500 per month in child maintenance - a figure he offered before the hearing began - and a sum of \u00a35,000 for furniture compared with Ms Goodman's initial demand of \u00a320,000.\n\nMr Walker was also ordered to pay \u00a330,000 for a car to be used by a nanny and other fees.\n\nThe footballer also agreed to pay \"all but a very small portion\" of Ms Goodman's \u00a3259,298 of legal costs related to the dispute, on top of his own fees of \u00a3171,440.\n\nBut Judge Edward Hess dismissed many of Ms Goodman's other demands, saying that she was \"not reliable\" and \"often exaggerated her need to spend money\".\n\nIn a written judgement, Judge Hess said Ms Goodman did not have a \"good track record of telling the truth\" and was \"often difficult, unreasonable and demanding\".\n\nHe stated: \"My assessment of the mother is that she was not reliable, often said what she thought would help her case rather than what was true, failed to make a calm and measured assessment of what she needed and often exaggerated her need to spend money (I think the father was correct to observe that the mother was in many ways treating him as an open-ended chequebook).\"\n\nThe two-day hearing began on July 16, a day after Mr Walker returned from Germany after England's European Championship final defeat to Spain.\n\nMr Walker said that the dispute over child maintenance payments would \"not have got this far\" if he were a \"painter and decorator\".\n\nFollowing the ruling handed down at the Central Family Court in London a spokeswoman for the footballer said: \"This judgement speaks for itself in laying bare Lauryn Goodman's insatiable greed and relentless pursuit of money.\"\n\nJudge Hess ruled that Mr Walker should not be penalised for any child maintenance arrears, which he described as \"an error by the father\", adding that the footballer has \"acted with dignity and generosity\".\n\nMs Goodman, 33, had claimed that Mr Walker \"does not think\" about the situation of her and their two children, who were born outside of his marriage to Annie Kilner Walker, with whom he has four sons.\n\nMr Walker met his wife when she was 16 and he was 18 when he was playing for Sheffield United. They secretly married in 2021 after she forgave him for having an affair and fathering a son Kairo, now three, with Goodman.\n\nBut it later emerged he had gone on to father Kinara with the model and influencer.\n\nGiving evidence Mr Walker rejected Ms Goodman's accusations, stating: \"A pound is a pound, and let's not be flippant that because I earn the amount of money that I earn, which I have done off my own back, you can just spend money and have an open chequebook.\n\n\"I do feel that because of who I am and what I do, and the money that I have, you are taking well out of consideration what is actually needed.\n\n\"If I was a painter and decorator, I don't think we would have got this far.\"\n\nThe court heard that Mr Walker had seen his son Kairo four times and Kinara just once and that his decision to \"draw a line\" under their relationship in favour of focusing on his marriage was a \"source of disappointment, anguish and anger\" for Ms Goodman.\n\nJudge Hess said Walker \"does not currently plan to repeat\" the \"small number of fleeting encounters\" he had had with their children.\n\nIn her evidence, Ms Goodman said: \"He (Mr Walker) has formed a bond with Kairo, who is now sat there asking for his dad. The whole thing is just horrendous.\"\n\nFollowing the publication of the ruling Ms Goodman said in a statement: \"I'd like to thank the judge for his careful consideration, with my children's needs at the heart of his decision.\n\n\"These have been difficult and stressful proceedings, which I had hoped would not be necessary. This has only ever been about the children and providing for their futures.\n\nIn written submissions, Nichola Gray KC, for Ms Goodman, said: \"This case is not about affordability. The father plainly has the means, and ample means, to satisfy each and every claim which the mother has made.\"\n\nShe added Kinara's birth had \"inevitably caused a radical change in the daily childcare burden\" Ms Goodman faces as a single mother, claiming that Mr Walker \"completely underestimates\" the \"task of juggling the needs of two children single-handedly\".\n\nIn her written arguments, Nikki Saxton KC, for Mr Walker, said the previous court order \"already provides for Ms Goodman's housing and her monthly budget in the new home\", and that there was an \"obvious and unattractive theme\" in Ms Goodman's case.\n\nShe continued: \"Regrettably, it is difficult not to conclude that Ms Goodman has leveraged her position and sees this as an opportunity to try and achieve an award which goes well beyond the additional costs of a second child.\"\n\nMs Gray said that under a court order issued in January this year, Mr Walker needed to pay \u00a37,000 a month in child maintenance to Ms Goodman for Kinara.\n\nThe press was restricted from reporting on the case during the hearing, but Judge Hess ruled that the restrictions should be lifted on Tuesday.",

These proceedings were never necessary.\n\n\"Kyle's offer should have been accepted months ago and would therefore have eliminated the need for added stress to all involved.\n\n\"In light of this judgment and the truths it makes public, my client and his family now ask that the media fully respects their rights to a private life as they navigate their next steps.\"\n\nIn a statement, Ms Goodman said: \"I'd like to thank the judge for his careful consideration, with my children's needs at the heart of his decision.\n\n\"These have been difficult and stressful proceedings, which I had hoped would not be necessary. This has only ever been about the children and providing for their futures.\n\n\"I am a dedicated single mother and whilst my children will never have what their half-siblings have, I have tried my best for my children and always will, no matter what.\n\n\"Thanks to my legal team and the judge's decision, my children's childhood is secure and I will now focus on building a solid future for them so as to provide for the time when the children's home reverts back to their father.\n\n\"More than anything, I look forward to enjoying every moment with my children and the three of us being able to get on with our lives.\"\n\nThe two-day hearing began on July 16, a day after Mr Walker returned from Germany after England's European Championship final defeat to Spain.\n\nThe press was restricted from reporting on the case during the hearing, but Judge Hess ruled that the restrictions should be lifted on Tuesday.\n\nThe court heard that Ms Goodman began her legal claim two days after Kinara's birth, with her demands including that Mr Walker paid for the upkeep of a hydro-pool, a \u00a328-per-hour gardener, a car worth up to \u00a370,000 every three years and air conditioning costing around \u00a333,000.\n\nGiving evidence, she said that the money was needed to \"secure my children's future\" and that she did not want Kinara, as well as the pair's older son Kairo, to be \"different\" from Mr Walker's other children.\n\nShe also justified the need for a \u00a331,200 artificial turf pitch by stating that Kinara kicked a ball from a crawling position, which could make her a future England footballer, adding: \"The Lionesses are better than the Lions.\"\n\nBut the judge dismissed the pitch demand, describing her reasoning as an \"unjustified evidential leap\", and also rejected the air conditioning claim, adding she could mitigate high temperatures in her home by \"deploying a modestly-priced electric fan\".\n\nMr Walker, who also has four sons with his wife Annie Kilner Walker, opposed some of Ms Goodman's claims or argued they should be decreased, telling the court that he was not an \"open chequebook\" despite earning between \u00a33 million and \u00a35 million per year.\n\nWhile he accepted some of the demands, Mr Walker's lawyers claimed that Ms Goodman was making a \"blatant attempt to leverage\" money for \"personal benefit\".\n\nIn his ruling, Judge Hess claimed Mr Walker \"acted with dignity and generosity\", adding he was \"not persuaded\" by many of Ms Goodman's claims.\n\nMy assessment of the mother is that she was not reliable, often said what she thought would help her case rather than what was true, failed to make a calm and measured assessment of what she needed and often exaggerated her need to spend money Judge Hess\n\nHe said: \"Plainly, he (Mr Walker) was embarrassed and remorseful as to the difficult situation in which he has placed a number of people, including all of his children, and regretted his decision-making in trying to keep his paternity of Kinara a secret.\n\n\"But he has in my view acted with dignity and generosity, and, once the secret was out, honesty, in facing up to the financial and personal consequences of what happened.\n\n\"In contrast, my assessment of the mother is that she was not reliable, often said what she thought would help her case rather than what was true, failed to make a calm and measured assessment of what she needed and often exaggerated her need to spend money.\"\n\nThe judge said that Walker had already paid more than \u00a3430,000, plus thousands more per month, to Ms Goodman for Kinara and changes to her \u00a32.4 million Sussex property, which he also purchased.\n\nThe footballer also agreed to pay \"all but a very small portion\" of Ms Goodman's \u00a3259,298 of legal costs related to the dispute, on top of his own fees of \u00a3171,440.\n\nMr Walker was ordered to pay \u00a312,500 per month in child maintenance - a figure he offered before the hearing began - and a sum of \u00a35,000 for furniture compared with Ms Goodman's initial demand of \u00a320,000.\n\nMr Walker was also ordered to pay \u00a330,000 for a car to be used by a nanny and other fees.\n\nMs Goodman has previously publicly confirmed that Mr Walker was the father of her second child, and sent a text to Mrs Walker last December stating: \"Hey it's Lauryn I just wanted to quickly tell you that Kyle is the father of our daughter.\"\n\nIn his ruling, the judge said that Mr Walker had made payments to Ms Goodman to \"keep the lid\" on the news of her second pregnancy, adding \"honesty might have been a better policy\".\n\nThe judge also added that it was not the court's role to \"make moral judgments\" or \"punish or condemn any perceived human frailties or lack of wisdom\".\n\nBut he ruled that the text sent by Ms Goodman to Mrs Walker \"intended to, and did, cause distress\".\n\nHe said he did not accept Ms Goodman's explanation that the text was sent \"in an attempt to create a good working relationship\" between the pair, and later said that Ms Goodman \"had in mind causing irreparable damage to the father's marriage\".", "source": {"uri":

The Manchester City footballer, who earns between \u00a33 million and \u00a35 million per year, opposed some of these or argued they should be decreased.\n\n'Global' child maintenance\n\nA previous court battle over payments resulted in Mr Walker being ordered to pay monthly child maintenance of \u00a38,000 and more than \u00a3180,000 in lump sums.\n\nHe also later purchased a \u00a32.4 million property in Sussex for Ms Goodman and their children.\n\nThe judge said that Mr Walker had already paid more than \u00a3430,000, plus thousands more per month, to Ms Goodman for Kinara, as well as for changes to the property.\n\nReturning to court earlier this month Ms Goodman, 33, demanded that Mr Walker pay \u00a314,750 a month in \"global\" child maintenance for the pair's two children, as well as tens of thousands for cars, furnishing and property maintenance and other costs, such as nursery fees.\n\nThe court heard that Ms Goodman began her legal claim two days after Kinara's birth, with her demands including that Mr Walker paid for the upkeep of a hydro-pool, a \u00a328-per-hour gardener, a car worth up to \u00a370,000 every three years and air conditioning costing around \u00a333,000.\n\nGiving evidence, she said the money was needed to \"secure my children's future\" and that she did not want Kinara, as well as the pair's older son Kairo, to be \"different\" from Mr Walker's other children.\n\n'Not reliable'\n\nShe also justified the need for a \u00a331,200 artificial turf pitch by stating that Kinara kicked a ball from a crawling position, which could make her a future England footballer, adding: \"The Lionesses are better than the Lions.\"\n\nMr Walker was ordered to pay \u00a312,500 per month in child maintenance - a figure he offered before the hearing began - and a sum of \u00a35,000 for furniture compared with Ms Goodman's initial demand of \u00a320,000.\n\nMr Walker was also ordered to pay \u00a330,000 for a car to be used by a nanny and other fees.\n\nThe footballer also agreed to pay \"all but a very small portion\" of Ms Goodman's \u00a3259,298 of legal costs related to the dispute, on top of his own fees of \u00a3171,440.\n\nBut Judge Edward Hess dismissed many of Ms Goodman's other demands, saying that she was \"not reliable\" and \"often exaggerated her need to spend money\".\n\nIn a written judgement, Judge Hess said Ms Goodman did not have a \"good track record of telling the truth\" and was \"often difficult, unreasonable and demanding\".\n\nHe stated: \"My assessment of the mother is that she was not reliable, often said what she thought would help her case rather than what was true, failed to make a calm and measured assessment of what she needed and often exaggerated her need to spend money (I think the father was correct to observe that the mother was in many ways treating him as an open-ended chequebook).\"\n\nThe two-day hearing began on July 16, a day after Mr Walker returned from Germany after England's European Championship final defeat to Spain.\n\nMr Walker said that the dispute over child maintenance payments would \"not have got this far\" if he were a \"painter and decorator\".\n\nFollowing the ruling handed down at the Central Family Court in London a spokeswoman for the footballer said: \"This judgement speaks for itself in laying bare Lauryn Goodman's insatiable greed and relentless pursuit of money.\"\n\nJudge Hess ruled that Mr Walker should not be penalised for any child maintenance arrears, which he described as \"an error by the father\", adding that the footballer has \"acted with dignity and generosity\".\n\nMs Goodman, 33, had claimed that Mr Walker \"does not think\" about the situation of her and their two children, who were born outside of his marriage to Annie Kilner Walker, with whom he has four sons.\n\n'Open chequebook'\n\nMr Walker met his wife when she was 16 and he was 18 when he was playing for Sheffield United. They secretly married in 2021 after she forgave him for having an affair and fathering a son Kairo, now three, with Goodman.\n\nBut it later emerged he had gone on to father Kinara with the model and influencer.\n\nGiving evidence Mr Walker rejected Ms Goodman's accusations, stating: \"A pound is a pound, and let's not be flippant that because I earn the amount of money that I earn, which I have done off my own back, you can just spend money and have an open chequebook.\n\n\"I do feel that because of who I am and what I do, and the money that I have, you are taking well out of consideration what is actually needed.\n\n\"If I was a painter and decorator, I don't think we would have got this far.\"\n\nThe court heard that Mr Walker had seen his son Kairo four times and Kinara just once and that his decision to \"draw a line\" under their relationship in favour of focusing on his marriage was a \"source of disappointment, anguish and anger\" for Ms Goodman.\n\nJudge Hess said Walker \"does not currently plan to repeat\" the \"small number of fleeting encounters\" he had had with their children.\n\n'Just horrendous'\n\nIn her evidence, Ms Goodman said: \"He (Mr Walker) has formed a bond with Kairo, who is now sat there asking for his dad. The whole thing is just horrendous.\"\n\nFollowing the publication of the ruling Ms Goodman said in a statement: \"I'd like to thank the judge for his careful consideration, with my children's needs at the heart of his decision.\n\n\"These have been difficult and stressful proceedings, which I had hoped would not be necessary. This has only ever been about the children and providing for their futures.\n\nIn written submissions, Nichola Gray KC, for Ms Goodman, said: \"This case is not about affordability. The father plainly has the means, and ample means, to satisfy each and every claim which the mother has made.\"\n\nShe added Kinara's birth had \"inevitably caused a radical change in the daily childcare burden\" Ms Goodman faces as a single mother, claiming that Mr Walker \"completely underestimates\" the \"task of juggling the needs of two children single-handedly\".\n\nIn her written arguments, Nikki Saxton KC, for Mr Walker, said the previous court order \"already provides for Ms Goodman's housing and her monthly budget in the new home\", and that there was an \"obvious and unattractive theme\" in Ms Goodman's case.\n\nShe continued: \"Regrettably, it is difficult not to conclude that Ms Goodman has leveraged her position and sees this as an opportunity to try and achieve an award which goes well beyond the additional costs of a second child.\"\n\nMs Gray said that under a court order issued in January this year, Mr Walker needed to pay \u00a37,000 a month in child maintenance to Ms Goodman for Kinara.\n\nThe press was restricted from reporting on the case during the hearing, but Judge Hess ruled that the restrictions should be lifted on Tuesday.",

These proceedings were never necessary.\n\n\"Kyle's offer should have been accepted months ago and would therefore have eliminated the need for added stress to all involved.\n\n\"In light of this judgment and the truths it makes public, my client and his family now ask that the media fully respects their rights to a private life as they navigate their next steps.\"\n\nIn a statement, Ms Goodman said: \"I'd like to thank the judge for his careful consideration, with my children's needs at the heart of his decision.\n\n\"These have been difficult and stressful proceedings, which I had hoped would not be necessary. This has only ever been about the children and providing for their futures.\n\n\"I am a dedicated single mother and whilst my children will never have what their half-siblings have, I have tried my best for my children and always will, no matter what.\n\n\"Thanks to my legal team and the judge's decision, my children's childhood is secure and I will now focus on building a solid future for them so as to provide for the time when the children's home reverts back to their father.\n\n\"More than anything, I look forward to enjoying every moment with my children and the three of us being able to get on with our lives.\"\n\nThe two-day hearing began on July 16, a day after Mr Walker returned from Germany after England's European Championship final defeat to Spain.\n\nThe press was restricted from reporting on the case during the hearing, but Judge Hess ruled that the restrictions should be lifted on Tuesday.\n\nThe court heard that Ms Goodman began her legal claim two days after Kinara's birth, with her demands including that Mr Walker paid for the upkeep of a hydro-pool, a \u00a328-per-hour gardener, a car worth up to \u00a370,000 every three years and air conditioning costing around \u00a333,000.\n\nGiving evidence, she said that the money was needed to \"secure my children's future\" and that she did not want Kinara, as well as the pair's older son Kairo, to be \"different\" from Mr Walker's other children.\n\nShe also justified the need for a \u00a331,200 artificial turf pitch by stating that Kinara kicked a ball from a crawling position, which could make her a future England footballer, adding: \"The Lionesses are better than the Lions.\"\n\nBut the judge dismissed the pitch demand, describing her reasoning as an \"unjustified evidential leap\", and also rejected the air conditioning claim, adding she could mitigate high temperatures in her home by \"deploying a modestly-priced electric fan\".\n\nMr Walker, who also has four sons with his wife Annie Kilner Walker, opposed some of Ms Goodman's claims or argued they should be decreased, telling the court that he was not an \"open chequebook\" despite earning between \u00a33 million and \u00a35 million per year.\n\nWhile he accepted some of the demands, Mr Walker's lawyers claimed that Ms Goodman was making a \"blatant attempt to leverage\" money for \"personal benefit\".\n\nIn his ruling, Judge Hess claimed Mr Walker \"acted with dignity and generosity\", adding he was \"not persuaded\" by many of Ms Goodman's claims.\n\nMy assessment of the mother is that she was not reliable, often said what she thought would help her case rather than what was true, failed to make a calm and measured assessment of what she needed and often exaggerated her need to spend money\n\nHe said: \"Plainly, he (Mr Walker) was embarrassed and remorseful as to the difficult situation in which he has placed a number of people, including all of his children, and regretted his decision-making in trying to keep his paternity of Kinara a secret.\n\n\"But he has in my view acted with dignity and generosity, and, once the secret was out, honesty, in facing up to the financial and personal consequences of what happened.\n\n\"In contrast, my assessment of the mother is that she was not reliable, often said what she thought would help her case rather than what was true, failed to make a calm and measured assessment of what she needed and often exaggerated her need to spend money.\"\n\nThe judge said that Walker had already paid more than \u00a3430,000, plus thousands more per month, to Ms Goodman for Kinara and changes to her \u00a32.4 million Sussex property, which he also purchased.\n\nThe footballer also agreed to pay \"all but a very small portion\" of Ms Goodman's \u00a3259,298 of legal costs related to the dispute, on top of his own fees of \u00a3171,440.\n\nMr Walker was ordered to pay \u00a312,500 per month in child maintenance - a figure he offered before the hearing began - and a sum of \u00a35,000 for furniture compared with Ms Goodman's initial demand of \u00a320,000.\n\nMr Walker was also ordered to pay \u00a330,000 for a car to be used by a nanny and other fees.\n\nMs Goodman has previously publicly confirmed that Mr Walker was the father of her second child, and sent a text to Mrs Walker last December stating: \"Hey it's Lauryn I just wanted to quickly tell you that Kyle is the father of our daughter.\"\n\nIn his ruling, the judge said that Mr Walker had made payments to Ms Goodman to \"keep the lid\" on the news of her second pregnancy, adding \"honesty might have been a better policy\".\n\nThe judge also added that it was not the court's role to \"make moral judgments\" or \"punish or condemn any perceived human frailties or lack of wisdom\".\n\nBut he ruled that the text sent by Ms Goodman to Mrs Walker \"intended to, and did, cause distress\".\n\nHe said he did not accept Ms Goodman's explanation that the text was sent \"in an attempt to create a good working relationship\" between the pair, and later said that Ms Goodman \"had in mind causing irreparable damage to the father's marriage\".", "source": {"uri": "kentonline.co.uk", "dataType": "news",

If that meant that the father of my child would have a relationship with my child, I would facilitate that.\"\n\nShe said: \"You ask for things and then you get ignored, and then you get put into this situation.\n\n\"It does not matter for him (Mr Walker).\n\n\"He does not think about your situation and what you are having to deal with.\"\n\nThe court heard that Ms Goodman made several financial demands of Mr Walker running into hundreds of thousands of pounds.\n\nMr Walker opposed some of the demands or argued they should be decreased, despite earning between \u00a33 million and \u00a35 million per year.\n\nIn written submissions, Nichola Gray KC, for Ms Goodman, said: \"This is a sum which will make a very significant difference to the mother's and the children's lives, but is a sum which will make no difference at all to this father.\n\n\"This case is not about affordability. The father plainly has the means, and ample means, to satisfy each and every claim which the mother has made.\"\n\nShe added that Kinara's birth had \"inevitably caused a radical change in the daily childcare burden\" that Ms Goodman faces as a single mother, claiming that Mr Walker \"completely underestimates\" the \"task of juggling the needs of two children single-handedly\".\n\nRegrettably, it is difficult not to conclude that Ms Goodman has leveraged her position and sees this as an opportunity to try and achieve an award which goes well beyond the additional costs of a second child\n\nIn her written arguments, Nikki Saxton KC, for Mr Walker, said the previous court order \"already provides for Ms Goodman's housing and her monthly budget in the new home\", and that there was an \"obvious and unattractive theme\" in Ms Goodman's case.\n\nShe continued: \"Regrettably, it is difficult not to conclude that Ms Goodman has leveraged her position and sees this as an opportunity to try and achieve an award which goes well beyond the additional costs of a second child.\"\n\nThe previous court battle over payments related to the pair's son resulted in Mr Walker being ordered to pay several costs including monthly child maintenance of \u00a38,000 and more than \u00a3180,000 in lump sums.\n\nHe also later purchased a \u00a32.4 million property in Sussex for Ms Goodman and their children.\n\nMs Gray said that under a court order issued in January this year, Mr Walker needed to pay \u00a37,000 a month in child maintenance to Ms Goodman for Kinara.\n\nShe said that the footballer had been \"repeatedly late\" in paying nursery fees and that he \"unilaterally reduced\" maintenance payments to \u00a3839 a month, accusing him of \"arrogance\".\n\nIn response, Mr Walker apologised and admitted he \"did do that deduction\", but \"did not leave Lauryn short\" as he had overpaid in the previous two months.\n\nHe said: \"I feel that in certain things in all of this, I have been more than generous, more than generous, than what I should have been or was ordered to be.\"\n\nHe later added: \"I have paid every single bit of money that has been asked of me.\"\n\nJudge Hess ruled that Mr Walker should not be penalised for the arrears, which he described as \"an error by the father\".", "source": {"uri": "kentonline.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title":

These proceedings were never necessary.\n\n\"Kyle's offer should have been accepted months ago and would therefore have eliminated the need for added stress to all involved.\n\n\"In light of this judgment and the truths it makes public, my client and his family now ask that the media fully respects their rights to a private life as they navigate their next steps.\"\n\nIn a statement, Ms Goodman said: \"I'd like to thank the judge for his careful consideration, with my children's needs at the heart of his decision.\n\n\"These have been difficult and stressful proceedings, which I had hoped would not be necessary. This has only ever been about the children and providing for their futures.\n\n\"I am a dedicated single mother and whilst my children will never have what their half-siblings have, I have tried my best for my children and always will, no matter what.\n\n\"Thanks to my legal team and the judge's decision, my children's childhood is secure and I will now focus on building a solid future for them so as to provide for the time when the children's home reverts back to their father.\n\n\"More than anything, I look forward to enjoying every moment with my children and the three of us being able to get on with our lives.\"\n\nThe two-day hearing began on July 16, a day after Mr Walker returned from Germany after England's European Championship final defeat to Spain.\n\nThe press was restricted from reporting on the case during the hearing, but Judge Hess ruled that the restrictions should be lifted on Tuesday.\n\nThe court heard that Ms Goodman began her legal claim two days after Kinara's birth, with her demands including that Mr Walker paid for the upkeep of a hydro-pool, a \u00a328-per-hour gardener, a car worth up to \u00a370,000 every three years and air conditioning costing around \u00a333,000.\n\nGiving evidence, she said that the money was needed to \"secure my children's future\" and that she did not want Kinara, as well as the pair's older son Kairo, to be \"different\" from Mr Walker's other children.\n\nShe also justified the need for a \u00a331,200 artificial turf pitch by stating that Kinara kicked a ball from a crawling position, which could make her a future England footballer, adding: \"The Lionesses are better than the Lions.\"\n\nBut the judge dismissed the pitch demand, describing her reasoning as an \"unjustified evidential leap\", and also rejected the air conditioning claim, adding she could mitigate high temperatures in her home by \"deploying a modestly-priced electric fan\".\n\nMr Walker, who also has four sons with his wife Annie Kilner Walker, opposed some of Ms Goodman's claims or argued they should be decreased, telling the court that he was not an \"open chequebook\" despite earning between \u00a33 million and \u00a35 million per year.\n\nWhile he accepted some of the demands, Mr Walker's lawyers claimed that Ms Goodman was making a \"blatant attempt to leverage\" money for \"personal benefit\".\n\nIn his ruling, Judge Hess claimed Mr Walker \"acted with dignity and generosity\", adding he was \"not persuaded\" by many of Ms Goodman's claims.\n\nHe said: \"Plainly, he (Mr Walker) was embarrassed and remorseful as to the difficult situation in which he has placed a number of people, including all of his children, and regretted his decision-making in trying to keep his paternity of Kinara a secret.\n\n\"But he has in my view acted with dignity and generosity, and, once the secret was out, honesty, in facing up to the financial and personal consequences of what happened.\n\n\"In contrast, my assessment of the mother is that she was not reliable, often said what she thought would help her case rather than what was true, failed to make a calm and measured assessment of what she needed and often exaggerated her need to spend money.\"\n\nThe judge said that Walker had already paid more than \u00a3430,000, plus thousands more per month, to Ms Goodman for Kinara and changes to her \u00a32.4 million Sussex property, which he also purchased.\n\nThe footballer also agreed to pay \"all but a very small portion\" of Ms Goodman's \u00a3259,298 of legal costs related to the dispute, on top of his own fees of \u00a3171,440.\n\nMr Walker was ordered to pay \u00a312,500 per month in child maintenance - a figure he offered before the hearing began - and a sum of \u00a35,000 for furniture compared with Ms Goodman's initial demand of \u00a320,000.\n\nMr Walker was also ordered to pay \u00a330,000 for a car to be used by a nanny and other fees.\n\nMs Goodman has previously publicly confirmed that Mr Walker was the father of her second child, and sent a text to Mrs Walker last December stating: \"Hey it's Lauryn I just wanted to quickly tell you that Kyle is the father of our daughter.\"\n\nIn his ruling, the judge said that Mr Walker had made payments to Ms Goodman to \"keep the lid\" on the news of her second pregnancy, adding \"honesty might have been a better policy\".\n\nThe judge also added that it was not the court's role to \"make moral judgments\" or \"punish or condemn any perceived human frailties or lack of wisdom\".\n\nBut he ruled that the text sent by Ms Goodman to Mrs

'honest and reliable' in family court battle, judge rules", "body": "England footballer Kyle Walker was \"sensible, honest and reliable\" during a family court battle with model Lauryn Goodman over child maintenance payments, a judge has said.\n\nMr Walker, 34, appeared at the Central Family Court in London earlier this month in a dispute with Ms Goodman over the amount of money he should pay to support their one-year-old daughter, Kinara.\n\nMs Goodman, 33, asked the court to order that Mr Walker pay \u00a314,750 a month in \"global\" child maintenance for the pair's two children, as well as tens of thousands for cars, furnishing and property maintenance and other costs such as nursery fees.\n\nThe Manchester City defender, who also has four sons with his wife, Annie Kilner Walker, opposed some of the demands or argued they should be decreased, telling the court that he was not an \"open chequebook\" despite earning between \u00a33 million and \u00a35 million per year.\n\nIn his ruling, Judge Edward Hess dismissed many of Ms Goodman's demands, concluding that she was \"not reliable\" while claiming Mr Walker \"acted with dignity and generosity\".\n\nMy assessment of the mother is that she was not reliable, often said what she thought would help her case rather than what was true, failed to make a calm and measured assessment of what she needed and often exaggerated her need to spend money\n\nHe said: \"Plainly, he (Mr Walker) was embarrassed and remorseful as to the difficult situation in which he has placed a number of people, including all of his children, and regretted his decision-making in trying to keep his paternity of Kinara a secret.\n\n\"But he has in my view acted with dignity and generosity, and, once the secret was out, honesty, in facing up to the financial and personal consequences of what happened.\n\n\"In contrast, my assessment of the mother is that she was not reliable, often said what she thought would help her case rather than what was true, failed to make a calm and measured assessment of what she needed and often exaggerated her need to spend money.\"\n\nThe two-day hearing began on July 16, a day after Mr Walker returned from Germany after England's European Championship final defeat to Spain.\n\nThe press was restricted from reporting on the case during the hearing, but Judge Hess ruled that the restrictions should be lifted on Tuesday.\n\nThe court heard that Ms Goodman began her legal claim two days after Kinara's birth.\n\nHer demands included that Mr Walker paid for the upkeep of a hydro-pool, a \u00a328-per-hour gardener, a car worth up to \u00a370,000 every three years and air conditioning costing around \u00a333,000.\n\nIn court, Ms Goodman justified the need for a \u00a331,200 artificial turf pitch by stating that Kinara kicked a ball from a crawling position, which could make her a future England footballer, adding: \"The Lionesses are better than the Lions.\"\n\nBut the judge dismissed the demand, describing her reasoning as an \"unjustified evidential leap\".\n\nMs Goodman further claimed that Mr Walker should pay to fix 59 \"snagging issues\" at the property bought for her and the children by the footballer under the terms of a previous court order related to their first child, Kairo, claiming they pose a safety risk.\n\nGiving evidence, Ms Goodman said that the money was needed to \"secure my children's future\" and that she did not want them to be \"different\" from Mr Walker's other children.\n\nThe court heard that Mr Walker accepted some of Ms Goodman's demands, but felt others were disproportionate, with his lawyers claiming that she was making a \"blatant attempt to leverage\" money for \"personal benefit\".\n\nThe judge said that Walker had already paid more than \u00a3430,000, plus thousands more per month, to Ms Goodman for Kinara and changes to her \u00a32.4 million Sussex property, which he also purchased.\n\nThe footballer also agreed to pay \"all but a very small portion\" of Ms Goodman's \u00a3259,298 of legal costs related to the dispute, on top of his own fees of \u00a3171,440.\n\nIn his judgment, Judge Hess encouraged both sides to \"compromise\" over the \"snagging\" issues but said he was \"not persuaded\" by many of Ms Goodman's demands.\n\nDismissing Ms Goodman's claim for air conditioning, the judge said she could mitigate high temperatures in her home by \"deploying a modestly-priced electric fan\".\n\nMr Walker was ordered to pay \u00a312,500 per month in child maintenance - a figure he offered before the hearing began - and a sum of \u00a35,000 for furniture compared with Ms Goodman's initial demand of \u00a320,000.\n\nMr Walker was also ordered to pay \u00a330,000 for a car to be used by a nanny and other fees.\n\n(Ms Goodman) did not have a gun to my head but she did have a detonator and for me, it was about keeping the peace because I did not want my wife finding out\n\nMs Goodman has previously publicly confirmed that Mr Walker was the father of her second child, and sent a text to Mrs Walker last December stating: \"Hey it's Lauryn I just wanted to quickly tell you that Kyle is the father of our daughter.\"\n\nIn his ruling, the judge said that Mr Walker had made payments to Ms Goodman to \"keep the lid\" on the news of her second pregnancy, adding \"honesty might have been a better policy\".\n\nThe judge also added that it was not the court's role to \"make moral judgments\" or \"punish or condemn any perceived human frailties or lack of wisdom\".\n\nBut he ruled that the text sent by Ms Goodman to Mrs Walker \"intended to, and did, cause distress\".\n\nHe said: \"I do not accept the mother's explanation that this text message was sent in an attempt to create a good working relationship between the two women in the father's life.\n\n\"In my view, this text was written in the same spirit as the series of text communications with the father's next-door neighbour in Cheshire in which the mother sought to persuade the neighbour to record conversations over the garden fence with a view to gain material to undermine the father's marriage.\n\n\"When the mother texted the neighbour to say 'ready to finish them', she had in mind causing irreparable damage to the father's marriage.\"", "source": {"uri": "kentonline.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title":

If that meant that the father of my child would have a relationship with my child, I would facilitate that.\"\n\nShe said: \"You ask for things and then you get ignored, and then you get put into this situation.\n\n\"It does not matter for him (Mr Walker).\n\n\"He does not think about your situation and what you are having to deal with.\"\n\nThe court heard that Ms Goodman made several financial demands of Mr Walker running into hundreds of thousands of pounds.\n\nMr Walker opposed some of the demands or argued they should be decreased, despite earning between \u00a33 million and \u00a35 million per year.\n\nIn written submissions, Nichola Gray KC, for Ms Goodman, said: \"This is a sum which will make a very significant difference to the mother's and the children's lives, but is a sum which will make no difference at all to this father.\n\n\"This case is not about affordability. The father plainly has the means, and ample means, to satisfy each and every claim which the mother has made.\"\n\nShe added that Kinara's birth had \"inevitably caused a radical change in the daily childcare burden\" that Ms Goodman faces as a single mother, claiming that Mr Walker \"completely underestimates\" the \"task of juggling the needs of two children single-handedly\".\n\nIn her written arguments, Nikki Saxton KC, for Mr Walker, said the previous court order \"already provides for Ms Goodman's housing and her monthly budget in the new home\", and that there was an \"obvious and unattractive theme\" in Ms Goodman's case.\n\nShe continued: \"Regrettably, it is difficult not to conclude that Ms Goodman has leveraged her position and sees this as an opportunity to try and achieve an award which goes well beyond the additional costs of a second child.\"\n\nThe previous court battle over payments related to the pair's son resulted in Mr Walker being ordered to pay several costs including monthly child maintenance of \u00a38,000 and more than \u00a3180,000 in lump sums.\n\nHe also later purchased a \u00a32.4 million property in Sussex for Ms Goodman and their children.\n\nMs Gray said that under a court order issued in January this year, Mr Walker needed to pay \u00a37,000 a month in child maintenance to Ms Goodman for Kinara.\n\nShe said that the footballer had been \"repeatedly late\" in paying nursery fees and that he \"unilaterally reduced\" maintenance payments to \u00a3839 a month, accusing him of \"arrogance\".\n\nIn response, Mr Walker apologised and admitted he \"did do that deduction\", but \"did not leave Lauryn short\" as he had overpaid in the previous two months.\n\nHe said: \"I feel that in certain things in all of this, I have been more than generous, more than generous, than what I should have been or was ordered to be.\"\n\nHe later added: \"I have paid every single bit of money that has been asked of me.\"\n\nJudge Hess ruled that Mr Walker should not be penalised for the arrears, which he described as \"an error by the father\".", "source": {"uri": "impartialreporter.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

These proceedings were never necessary.\n\n\"Kyle's offer should have been accepted months ago and would therefore have eliminated the need for added stress to all involved.\n\n\"In light of this judgment and the truths it makes public, my client and his family now ask that the media fully respects their rights to a private life as they navigate their next steps.\"\n\nThe two-day hearing began on July 16, a day after Mr Walker returned from Germany after England's European Championship final defeat to Spain.\n\nThe press was restricted from reporting on the case during the hearing, but Judge Hess ruled that the restrictions should be lifted on Tuesday.\n\nThe court heard that Ms Goodman began her legal claim two days after Kinara's birth, with her demands including that Mr Walker paid for the upkeep of a hydro-pool, a \u00a328-per-hour gardener, a car worth up to \u00a370,000 every three years and air conditioning costing around \u00a333,000.\n\nShe further claimed that Mr Walker should pay to fix 59 \"snagging issues\" at the property bought for her and the children by the footballer under the terms of a previous court order related to their first child, Kairo, claiming they pose a safety risk.\n\nGiving evidence, she said that the money was needed to \"secure my children's future\" and that she did not want them to be \"different\" from Mr Walker's other children.\n\nShe also justified the need for a \u00a331,200 artificial turf pitch by stating that Kinara kicked a ball from a crawling position, which could make her a future England footballer, adding: \"The Lionesses are better than the Lions.\"\n\nBut the judge dismissed the pitch demand, describing her reasoning as an \"unjustified evidential leap\", and also rejected the air conditioning claim, adding she could mitigate high temperatures in her home by \"deploying a modestly-priced electric fan\".\n\nMr Walker, who also has four sons with his wife Annie Kilner Walker, opposed some of Ms Goodman's claims or argued they should be decreased, telling the court that he was not an \"open chequebook\" despite earning between \u00a33 million and \u00a35 million per year.\n\nWhile he accepted some of the demands, Mr Walker's lawyers claimed that Ms Goodman was making a \"blatant attempt to leverage\" money for \"personal benefit\".\n\nIn his ruling, Judge Hess claimed Mr Walker \"acted with dignity and generosity\", adding he was \"not persuaded\" by many of Ms Goodman's claims.\n\nHe said: \"Plainly, he (Mr Walker) was embarrassed and remorseful as to the difficult situation in which he has placed a number of people, including all of his children, and regretted his decision-making in trying to keep his paternity of Kinara a secret.\n\n\"But he has in my view acted with dignity and generosity, and, once the secret was out, honesty, in facing up to the financial and personal consequences of what happened.\n\n\"In contrast, my assessment of the mother is that she was not reliable, often said what she thought would help her case rather than what was true, failed to make a calm and measured assessment of what she needed and often exaggerated her need to spend money.\"\n\nThe judge said that Walker had already paid more than \u00a3430,000, plus thousands more per month, to Ms Goodman for Kinara and changes to her \u00a32.4 million Sussex property, which he also purchased.\n\nThe footballer also agreed to pay \"all but a very small portion\" of Ms Goodman's \u00a3259,298 of legal costs related to the dispute, on top of his own fees of \u00a3171,440.\n\nBoth sides were encouraged sides to \"compromise\" over the \"snagging\" issues.\n\nMr Walker was ordered to pay \u00a312,500 per month in child maintenance - a figure he offered before the hearing began - and a sum of \u00a35,000 for furniture compared with Ms Goodman's initial demand of \u00a320,000.\n\nMr Walker was also ordered to pay \u00a330,000 for a car to be used by a nanny and other fees.\n\nMs Goodman has previously publicly confirmed that Mr Walker was the father of her second child, and sent a text to Mrs Walker last December stating: \"Hey it's Lauryn I just wanted to quickly tell you that Kyle is the father of our daughter.\"\n\nIn his ruling, the judge said that Mr Walker had made payments to Ms Goodman to \"keep the lid\" on the news of her second pregnancy, adding \"honesty might have been a better policy\".\n\nThe judge also added that it was not the court's role to \"make moral judgments\" or \"punish or condemn any perceived human frailties or lack of wisdom\".\n\nBut he ruled that the text sent by Ms Goodman to Mrs Walker \"intended to, and did, cause distress\".\n\nHe said: \"I do not accept the mother's explanation that this text message was sent in an attempt to create a good working relationship between the two women in the father's life.\n\n\"In my view, this text was written in the same spirit as the series of text communications with the father's next-door neighbour in Cheshire in which the mother sought to persuade the neighbour to record conversations over the garden fence with a view to gain material to undermine the father's marriage.\n\n\"When the mother texted the neighbour to say 'ready to finish them', she had in mind causing irreparable damage to the father's marriage.\"", "source": {"uri":

dismissed the demand, describing her reasoning as an \"unjustified evidential leap\".\n\nMs Goodman further claimed that Mr Walker should pay to fix 59 \"snagging issues\" at the property bought for her and the children by the footballer under the terms of a previous court order related to their first child, Kairo, claiming they pose a safety risk.\n\nGiving evidence, Ms Goodman said that the money was needed to \"secure my children's future\" and that she did not want them to be \"different\" from Mr Walker's other children.\n\nThe court heard that Mr Walker accepted some of Ms Goodman's demands, but felt others were disproportionate, with his lawyers claiming that she was making a \"blatant attempt to leverage\" money for \"personal benefit\".\n\nThe judge said that Walker had already paid more than \u00a3430,000, plus thousands more per month, to Ms Goodman for Kinara and changes to her \u00a32.4 million Sussex property, which he also purchased.\n\nThe footballer also agreed to pay \"all but a very small portion\" of Ms Goodman's \u00a3259,298 of legal costs related to the dispute, on top of his own fees of \u00a3171,440.\n\nIn his judgment, Judge Hess encouraged both sides to \"compromise\" over the \"snagging\" issues but said he was \"not persuaded\" by many of Ms Goodman's demands.\n\nDismissing Ms Goodman's claim for air conditioning, the judge said she could mitigate high temperatures in her home by \"deploying a modestly-priced electric fan\".\n\nMr Walker was ordered to pay \u00a312,500 per month in child maintenance - a figure he offered before the hearing began - and a sum of \u00a35,000 for furniture compared with Ms Goodman's initial demand of \u00a320,000.\n\nMr Walker was also ordered to pay \u00a330,000 for a car to be used by a nanny and other fees.\n\nMs Goodman has previously publicly confirmed that Mr Walker was the father of her second child, and sent a text to Mrs Walker last December stating: \"Hey it's Lauryn I just wanted to quickly tell you that Kyle is the father of our daughter.\"\n\nIn his ruling, the judge said that Mr Walker had made payments to Ms Goodman to \"keep the lid\" on the news of her second pregnancy, adding \"honesty might have been a better policy\".\n\nThe judge also added that it was not the court's role to \"make moral judgments\" or \"punish or condemn any perceived human frailties or lack of

If that meant that the father of my child would have a relationship with my child, I would facilitate that.\"\n\nShe said: \"You ask for things and then you get ignored, and then you get put into this situation. It does not matter for him (Mr Walker).\n\n\"He does not think about your situation and what you are having to deal with.\"\n\nThe court heard that Ms Goodman made several financial demands of Mr Walker running into hundreds of thousands of pounds.\n\nMr Walker opposed some of the demands or argued they should be decreased, despite earning between \u00a33 million and \u00a35 million (\u20ac3.56 million and \u20ac5.94 million) per year.\n\nIn written submissions, Nichola Gray KC, for Ms Goodman, said: \"This is a sum which will make a very significant difference to the mother's and the children's lives, but is a sum which will make no difference at all to this father.\n\n\"This case is not about affordability. The father plainly has the means, and ample means, to satisfy each and every claim which the mother has made.\"\n\nShe added that Kinara's birth had \"inevitably caused a radical change in the daily childcare burden\" that Ms Goodman faces as a single mother, claiming that Mr Walker \"completely underestimates\" the \"task of juggling the needs of two children single-handedly\".\n\nIn her written arguments, Nikki Saxton KC, for Mr Walker, said the previous court order \"already provides for Ms Goodman's housing and her monthly budget in the new home\", and that there was an \"obvious and unattractive theme\" in Ms Goodman's case.\n\nShe continued: \"Regrettably, it is difficult not to conclude that Ms Goodman has leveraged her position and sees this as an opportunity to try and achieve an award which goes well beyond the additional costs of a second child.\"\n\nThe previous court battle over payments related to the pair's son resulted in Mr Walker being ordered to pay several costs including monthly child maintenance of \u00a38,000 and more than \u00a3180,000 in lump sums.\n\nHe also later purchased a \u00a32.4 million property in Sussex for Ms Goodman and their children.\n\nMs Gray said that under a court order issued in January this year, Mr Walker needed to pay \u00a37,000 a month in child maintenance to Ms Goodman for Kinara.\n\nShe said that the footballer had been \"repeatedly late\" in paying nursery fees and that he \"unilaterally reduced\" maintenance payments to \u00a3839 a month, accusing him of \"arrogance\".\n\nIn response, Mr Walker apologised and admitted he \"did do that deduction\", but \"did not leave Lauryn short\" as he had overpaid in the previous two months.\n\nHe said: \"I feel that in certain things in all of this, I have been more than generous, more than generous, than what I should have been or was ordered to be.\"\n\nHe later added: \"I have paid every single bit of money that has been asked of me.\"\n\nJudge Hess ruled that Mr Walker should not be penalised for the arrears, which he described as \"an error by the father\".\n\nRSS Syndicated Content Published: Tue 30 Jul 2024, 4:04 PM Last updated: Tue 30

More info\n\nSheffield-born footballer Kyle Walker was \"sensible, honest and reliable\" during a family court battle with model Lauryn Goodman over child maintenance payments, a judge has said.\n\nMr Walker, 34, appeared at the Central Family Court in London earlier this month in a dispute with Ms Goodman over the amount of money he should pay to support their one-year-old daughter, Kinara. Ms Goodman, 33, asked the court to order that Mr Walker pay \u00a314,750 a month in \"global\" child maintenance for the pair's two children, as well as tens of thousands for cars, furnishing, air conditioning and property maintenance, as well as nursery fees.\n\nThe Manchester City defender, who also has four sons with his wife, Annie Kilner Walker, opposed some of the demands or argued they should be decreased, telling the court that he was not an \"open chequebook\" despite earning between \u00a33 million and \u00a35 million per year.\n\nRead more: Family 'very broken' after dad named as man killed in Doncaster crash\n\nIn his ruling, Judge Edward Hess dismissed many of Ms Goodman's demands, concluding that she was \"not reliable\" while claiming Mr Walker \"acted with dignity and generosity.\" He said: \"Plainly, he (Mr Walker) was embarrassed and remorseful as to the difficult situation in which he has placed a number of people, including all of his children, and regretted his decision-making in trying to keep his paternity of Kinara a secret.\n\n\"But he has in my view acted with dignity and generosity, and, once the secret was out, honesty, in facing up to the financial and personal consequences of what happened.\n\n\"In contrast, my assessment of the mother is that she was not reliable, often said what she thought would help her case rather than what was true, failed to make a calm and measured assessment of what she needed and often exaggerated her need to spend money.\"\n\nThe two-day hearing began on July 16, a day after Mr Walker returned from Germany after England's European Championship final defeat to Spain. The press was restricted from reporting on the case during the hearing, but Judge Hess ruled that the restrictions should be lifted on Tuesday, July 30.\n\nThe court heard that Ms Goodman began her legal claim two days after Kinara's birth. Her demands included that Mr Walker paid for the upkeep of a hydro-pool, a \u00a328-per-hour gardener, a car worth up to \u00a370,000 every three years and air conditioning costing around \u00a333,000.\n\nIn court, Ms Goodman justified the need for a \u00a331,200 artificial turf pitch by stating that Kinara kicked a ball from a crawling position, which could make her a future England footballer, adding: \"The Lionesses are better than the Lions.\" But the judge dismissed the demand, describing her reasoning as an \"unjustified evidential leap\".\n\nMs Goodman further claimed that Mr Walker should pay to fix 59 \"snagging issues\" at the property bought for her and the children by the footballer under the terms of a previous court order related to their first child, Kairo, claiming they pose a safety risk.\n\nGiving evidence, Ms Goodman said that the money was needed to \"secure my children's future\" and that she did not want them to be \"different\" from Mr Walker's other children. The court heard that Mr Walker accepted some of Ms Goodman's demands, but felt others were disproportionate, with his lawyers claiming that she was making a \"blatant attempt to leverage\" money for \"personal benefit.\"\n\nThe judge said that Walker had already paid more than \u00a3430,000, plus thousands more per month, to Ms Goodman for Kinara and changes to her \u00a32.4 million Sussex property, which he also purchased. The footballer also agreed to pay \"all but a very small portion\" of Ms Goodman's \u00a3259,298 of legal costs related to the dispute, on top of his own fees of \u00a3171,440.\n\nIn his judgment, Judge Hess encouraged both sides to \"compromise\" over the \"snagging\" issues but said he was \"not persuaded\" by many of Ms Goodman's demands. Dismissing Ms Goodman's claim for air conditioning, the judge said she could mitigate high temperatures in her home by \"deploying a modestly-priced electric fan.\"\n\nMr Walker was ordered to pay \u00a312,500 per month in child maintenance - a figure he offered before the hearing began - and a sum of \u00a35,000 for furniture compared with Ms Goodman's initial demand of \u00a320,000. Mr Walker was also ordered to pay \u00a330,000 for a car to be used by a nanny and other fees.\n\nMs Goodman has previously publicly confirmed that Mr Walker was the father of her second child, and sent a text to Mrs Walker last December stating: \"Hey it's Lauryn I just wanted to quickly tell you that Kyle is the father of our daughter.\" In his ruling, the judge said that Mr Walker had made payments to Ms Goodman to \"keep the lid\" on the news of her second pregnancy, adding \"honesty might have been a better policy\".\n\nThe judge also added that it was not the court's role to \"make moral judgments\" or \"punish or condemn any perceived human frailties or lack of wisdom\".

These proceedings were never necessary.\n\n\"Kyle's offer should have been accepted months ago and would therefore have eliminated the need for added stress to all involved.\n\n\"In light of this judgment and the truths it makes public, my client and his family now ask that the media fully respects their rights to a private life as they navigate their next steps.\"\n\nThe two-day hearing began on July 16, a day after Mr Walker returned from Germany after England's European Championship final defeat to Spain.\n\nThe press was restricted from reporting on the case during the hearing, but Judge Hess ruled that the restrictions should be lifted on Tuesday.\n\nThe court heard that Ms Goodman began her legal claim two days after Kinara's birth, with her demands including that Mr Walker paid for the upkeep of a hydro-pool, a \u00a328-per-hour gardener, a car worth up to \u00a370,000 every three years and air conditioning costing around \u00a333,000.\n\nShe further claimed that Mr Walker should pay to fix 59 \"snagging issues\" at the property bought for her and the children by the footballer under the terms of a previous court order related to their first child, Kairo, claiming they pose a safety risk.\n\nGiving evidence, she said that the money was needed to \"secure my children's future\" and that she did not want them to be \"different\" from Mr Walker's other children.\n\nShe also justified the need for a \u00a331,200 artificial turf pitch by stating that Kinara kicked a ball from a crawling position, which could make her a future England footballer, adding: \"The Lionesses are better than the Lions.\"\n\nBut the judge dismissed the pitch demand, describing her reasoning as an \"unjustified evidential leap\", and also rejected the air conditioning claim, adding she could mitigate high temperatures in her home by \"deploying a modestly-priced electric fan\".\n\nMr Walker, who also has four sons with his wife Annie Kilner Walker, opposed some of Ms Goodman's claims or argued they should be decreased, telling the court that he was not an \"open chequebook\" despite earning between \u00a33 million and \u00a35 million per year.\n\nWhile he accepted some of the demands, Mr Walker's lawyers claimed that Ms Goodman was making a \"blatant attempt to leverage\" money for \"personal benefit\".\n\nIn his ruling, Judge Hess claimed Mr Walker \"acted with dignity and generosity\", adding he was \"not persuaded\" by many of Ms Goodman's claims.\n\nHe said: \"Plainly, he (Mr Walker) was embarrassed and remorseful as to the difficult situation in which he has placed a number of people, including all of his children, and regretted his decision-making in trying to keep his paternity of Kinara a secret.\n\n\"But he has in my view acted with dignity and generosity, and, once the secret was out, honesty, in facing up to the financial and personal consequences of what happened.\n\n\"In contrast, my assessment of the mother is that she was not reliable, often said what she thought would help her case rather than what was true, failed to make a calm and measured assessment of what she needed and often exaggerated her need to spend money.\"\n\nThe judge said that Walker had already paid more than \u00a3430,000, plus thousands more per month, to Ms Goodman for Kinara and changes to her \u00a32.4 million Sussex property, which he also purchased.\n\nThe footballer also agreed to pay \"all but a very small portion\" of Ms Goodman's \u00a3259,298 of legal costs related to the dispute, on top of his own fees of \u00a3171,440.\n\nBoth sides were encouraged sides to \"compromise\" over the \"snagging\" issues.\n\nMr Walker was ordered to pay \u00a312,500 per month in child maintenance - a figure he offered before the hearing began - and a sum of \u00a35,000 for furniture compared with Ms Goodman's initial demand of \u00a320,000.\n\nMr Walker was also ordered to pay \u00a330,000 for a car to be used by a nanny and other fees.\n\nMs Goodman has previously publicly confirmed that Mr Walker was the father of her second child, and sent a text to Mrs Walker last December stating: \"Hey it's Lauryn I just wanted to quickly tell you that Kyle is the father of our daughter.\"\n\nIn his ruling, the judge said that Mr Walker had made payments to Ms Goodman to \"keep the lid\" on the news of her second pregnancy, adding \"honesty might have been a better policy\".\n\nThe judge also added that it was not the court's role to \"make moral judgments\" or \"punish or condemn any perceived human frailties or lack of wisdom\".\n\nBut he ruled that the text sent by Ms Goodman to Mrs Walker \"intended to, and did, cause distress\".\n\nHe said: \"I do not accept the mother's explanation that this text message was sent in an attempt to create a good working relationship between the two women in the father's life.\n\n\"In my view, this text was written in the same spirit as the series of text communications with the father's next-door neighbour in Cheshire in which the mother sought to persuade the neighbour to record conversations over the garden fence with a view to gain material to undermine the father's marriage.\n\n\"When the mother texted the neighbour to say 'ready to finish them', she had in mind causing irreparable damage to the father's marriage.\"", "source": {"uri":

These proceedings were never necessary.\n\n'Kyle's offer should have been accepted months ago and would therefore have eliminated the need for added stress to all involved.\n\n'In light of this judgment and the truths it makes public, my client and his family now ask that the media fully respects their rights to a private life as they navigate their next steps.'\n\nThe court heard Walker had seen Kairo four times and Kinara once, with Judge Edward Hess stating in his ruling that Goodman \"wished the relationship to develop further than it has\".\n\nHe added that Walker's decision to \"draw a line\" under their relationship in favour of focusing on his marriage was a \"source of disappointment, anguish and anger\" for Goodman, and that the footballer \"does not currently plan to repeat\" the \"small number of fleeting encounters\" he has had with their children.\n\nIn her evidence, Goodman said she did not want her children to be \"different\" from Walker's children with his wife and that the money was to \"secure my children's future\".\n\nShe said: 'He (Walker) has formed a bond with Kairo, who is now sat there asking for his dad. He does not think about your situation and what you are having to deal with Lauryn Goodman The whole thing is just horrendous.'\n\nShe continued: 'I would do anything for my child. If that meant that the father of my child would have a relationship with my child, I would facilitate that.'\n\nShe said: 'You ask for things and then you get ignored, and then you get put into this situation. It does not matter for him (Walker).\n\n'He does not think about your situation and what you are having to deal with.'\n\nThe court heard that Goodman made several financial demands of Walker running into hundreds of thousands of pounds.\n\nWalker opposed some of the demands or argued they should be decreased, despite earning between \u00a33 million and \u00a35 million per year.\n\nIn written submissions, Nichola Gray KC, for Goodman, said: 'This is a sum which will make a very significant difference to the mother's and the children's lives, but is a sum which will make no difference at all to this father.\n\n'This case is not about affordability. The father plainly has the means, and ample means, to satisfy each and every claim which the mother has made.'\n\nShe added that Kinara's birth had \"inevitably caused a radical change in the daily childcare burden\" that Goodman faces as a single mother, claiming that Walker \"completely underestimates\" the \"task of juggling the needs of two children single-handedly\".\n\nShe continued: \"Regrettably, it is difficult not to conclude that Goodman has leveraged her position and sees this as an opportunity to try and achieve an award which goes well beyond the additional costs of a second child.\"\n\nThe previous court battle over payments related to the pair's son resulted in Walker being ordered to pay several costs including monthly child maintenance of \u00a38,000 and more than \u00a3180,000 in lump sums.\n\nHe also later purchased a \u00a32.4 million property in Sussex for Goodman and their children.\n\nGray said that under a court order issued in January this year, Walker needed to pay \u00a37,000 a month in child maintenance to Goodman for Kinara.\n\nShe said that the footballer had been \"repeatedly late\" in paying nursery fees and that he \"unilaterally reduced\" maintenance payments to \u00a3839 a month, accusing him of \"arrogance\".\n\nIn response, Walker apologised and admitted he \"did do that deduction\", but \"did not leave Lauryn short\" as he had overpaid in the previous two months.\n\nHe said: \"I feel that in certain things in all of this, I have been more than generous, more than generous, than what I should have been or was ordered to be.\"\n\nHe later added: \"I have paid every single bit of money that has been asked of me.\"\n\nJudge Hess ruled that Walker should not be penalised for the arrears, which he described as \"an error by the father\".", "source": {"uri": "internewscast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Internewscast Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Walker",

If I was a painter and decorator, I don't think we would have got this far.\"\n\nAnother issue Ms Goodman had was with her patio, which she said was 'unsafe' and requested a \u00a331,000 astro turf instead.\n\nShe told the court that her one-year-old daughter Kinara needed the pitch as she had managed to kick a football recently so could well become a Lioness.\n\nMs Goodman also said she needed a cleaner because the house has a huge glass staircase and giant windows.\n\nWithin 48 hours of giving birth, Ms Goodman made a 'financial remedies application' asking for maintenance, already at \u00a3110,000 per year for their son, to be increased to \u00a3177,000.\n\nIt saw the England star agree to buy her a \u00a32.4million Sussex property and spend over \u00a3120,000 on walk-in wardrobes, blinds and curtains, sofas and garden furniture.\n\nThe court heard that Mr Walker, 34, had seen Kairo four times and Kinara once, with Judge Edward Hess stating in his ruling that Ms Goodman \"wished the relationship to develop further than it has\".\n\nHe added that Mr Walker's decision to \"draw a line\" under their relationship in favour of focusing on his marriage was a \"source of disappointment, anguish and anger\" for Ms Goodman.\n\nIn her evidence, Ms Goodman said she did not want her children to be \"different\" from Mr Walker's children with his wife and that the money was to \"secure my children's future\".\n\nShe said: \"He (Mr Walker) has formed a bond with Kairo, who is now sat there asking for his dad.

These proceedings were never necessary.\n\n'Kyle's offer should have been accepted months ago and would therefore have eliminated the need for added stress to all involved.\n\n'In light of this judgment and the truths it makes public, my client and his family now ask that the media fully respects their rights to a private life as they navigate their next steps.'\n\nThe court heard Walker had seen Kairo four times and Kinara once, with Judge Edward Hess stating in his ruling that Goodman \"wished the relationship to develop further than it has\".\n\nHe added that Walker's decision to \"draw a line\" under their relationship in favour of focusing on his marriage was a \"source of disappointment, anguish and anger\" for Goodman, and that the footballer \"does not currently plan to repeat\" the \"small number of fleeting encounters\" he has had with their children.\n\nIn her evidence, Goodman said she did not want her children to be \"different\" from Walker's children with his wife and that the money was to \"secure my children's future\".\n\nShe said: 'He (Walker) has formed a bond with Kairo, who is now sat there asking for his dad. He does not think about your situation and what you are having to deal with Lauryn Goodman The whole thing is just horrendous.'\n\nShe continued: 'I would do anything for my child. If that meant that the father of my child would have a relationship with my child, I would facilitate that.'\n\nShe said: 'You ask for things and then you get ignored, and then you get put into this situation. It does not matter for him (Walker).\n\n'He does not think about your situation and what you are having to deal with.'\n\nThe court heard that Goodman made several financial demands of Walker running into hundreds of thousands of pounds.\n\nWalker opposed some of the demands or argued they should be decreased, despite earning between \u00a33 million and \u00a35 million per year.\n\nIn written submissions, Nichola Gray KC, for Goodman, said: 'This is a sum which will make a very significant difference to the mother's and the children's lives, but is a sum which will make no difference at all to this father.\n\n'This case is not about affordability. The father plainly has the means, and ample means, to satisfy each and every claim which the mother has made.'\n\nShe added that Kinara's birth had \"inevitably caused a radical change in the daily childcare burden\" that Goodman faces as a single mother, claiming that Walker \"completely underestimates\" the \"task of juggling the needs of two children single-handedly\".\n\nShe continued: \"Regrettably, it is difficult not to conclude that Goodman has leveraged her position and sees this as an opportunity to try and achieve an award which goes well beyond the additional costs of a second child.\"\n\nThe previous court battle over payments related to the pair's son resulted in Walker being ordered to pay several costs including monthly child maintenance of \u00a38,000 and more than \u00a3180,000 in lump sums.\n\nHe also later purchased a \u00a32.4 million property in Sussex for Goodman and their children.\n\nGray said that under a court order issued in January this year, Walker needed to pay \u00a37,000 a month in child maintenance to Goodman for Kinara.\n\nShe said that the footballer had been \"repeatedly late\" in paying nursery fees and that he \"unilaterally reduced\" maintenance payments to \u00a3839 a month, accusing him of \"arrogance\".\n\nIn response, Walker apologised and admitted he \"did do that deduction\", but \"did not leave Lauryn short\" as he had overpaid in the previous two months.\n\nHe said: \"I feel that in certain things in all of this, I have been more than generous, more than generous, than what I should have been or was ordered to be.\"\n\nHe later added: \"I have paid every single bit of money that has been asked of me.\"\n\nJudge Hess ruled that Walker should not be penalised for the arrears, which he described as \"an error by the father\".", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Walker", "type":

court battle reporting after Goodman...", "body": "A judge who ruled that the press could report on a court dispute between Manchester City footballer Kyle Walker and Lauryn Goodman said that she had \"actively instigated\" press coverage of their children despite her objections to the proceedings being reported.\n\nJudge Edward Hess said it \"sits ill\" that Ms Goodman argued that the hearing at the Central Family Court in London should be private, having recently taken payment from the press to attend the European Championships in Germany for \"journalistic fodder\".\n\nModel Ms Goodman, 33, was in a court dispute with 34-year-old Mr Walker earlier this month over the amount of money he should pay to support their one-year-old daughter, Kinara.\n\nReporting of the hearing had been prohibited under a court ruling, which was opposed by the media and lawyers for Mr Walker.\n\nIt sits ill for a person to come to court arguing for privacy for her children when, just a very short while earlier, she took a payment from the press to visit the European football championship with her son dressed in an England football shirt with the name 'Daddy' on the back, and to be willingly photographed doing this to provide journalistic fodder which the newspapers were only too happy to use Judge Edward Hess\n\nDespite objections from Ms Goodman, Judge Hess said any harm caused to the children by the court case \"has already happened\" and would \"largely be the result of the mother's own decisions and actions\" in public.\n\nIn his ruling, he said: \"It would be a nonsense, opening the court to ridicule, to try to redact or anonymise this judgment to prevent identification of the parties.\n\nLauryn Goodman at a premiere in London (Ian West/PA)\n\n\"Further, a perusal of the many hundreds of newspaper articles published about these matters clearly illustrates that the mother has not just co-operated with, but actively instigated, press coverage placing in the public domain her own children, the circumstances of their conceptions and what she thinks about the father.\n\n\"It sits ill for a person to come to court arguing for privacy for her children when, just a very short while earlier, she took a payment from the press to visit the European football championship with her son dressed in an England football shirt with the name 'Daddy' on the back, and to be willingly photographed doing this to provide journalistic fodder which the newspapers were only too happy to use.\n\n\"If the children suffer any harm from the publicity of these matters, it has already happened, and it will largely be the result of the mother's own decisions and actions.\n\n\"For me, on the facts of this case, the balancing exercise must come down against the mother's argument.\n\n\"For me, the right of the press to scrutinise and comment upon the court's procedures and decisions, and what the mother has requested of the father and how he has responded, is on this occasion a greater priority.\"\n\nThe ruling comes after the court was told by Mr Walker's barristers that Ms Goodman confirmed Kinara's paternity in the press earlier this year.\n\nNichola Gray KC, representing Ms Goodman, told the court that Mr Walker had previously tried to ensure Ms Goodman would \"stay silent\" about the child's paternity, and that the model had agreed to a \"gagging undertaking\".\n\nMr Walker agreed with Ms Gray that he \"did not want to acknowledge publicly\" the paternity of the child, but said he did not believe that it would remain private \"forever\".\n\nHe said: \"My wife at home did not know and I have two children with Lauryn, four children with Annie, and I wanted to protect them as best as possible.\"\n\nHe said that while he did not believe he was \"over a barrel\", he said: \"(Ms Goodman) did not have a gun to my head but she did have a detonator and for me, it was about keeping the peace because I did not want my wife finding out.\"\n\nA pilot scheme to increase transparency in the family court system, which began with three courts in 2023, was expanded earlier this year to allow accredited journalists and legal bloggers to report on cases at nearly 20 courts across England and Wales, including the Central Family Court.\n\nIt is my view preferable that anybody interested in the topic should have the opportunity to read the full independent account contained in this judgment before reaching any conclusions about what has happened Judge Edward Hess\n\nJudges can set out what details may be reported under a Transparency Order, with journalists also allowed to access some documents.\n\nFollowing an application made by members of the media, Judge Hess ruled that details of the hearing could be reported, with the exception of some personal information.\n\nHe said in his judgment that he had reached a \"clear conclusion\" that \"the normal confidentiality restrictions should be dispensed with\", adding: \"I also consider it very likely, having heard her evidence, that the mother will be tempted, one way or another and whatever any transparency order says, to seek defiantly to put in the public domain her views about the court's findings and also further views she may have about the father.\n\n\"In these circumstances, it is my view preferable that anybody interested in the topic should have the opportunity to read

Please try again later{{ /verifyErrors }}\n\nLauryn Goodman was slammed by a judge for \"exaggerating her need for money\" during a family court showdown with Manchester City footballer Kyle Walker.\n\nThe England vice-captain was embroiled in a legal battle with the 33-year-old model, which saw a number of outlandish childcare requests, including a \u00a333,000 air conditioning unit and \u00a331,000 astro turf, denied by the judge.\n\nWalker, 34, who is married with four children, was booted out of his \u00a33.5million Cheshire mansion by his wife after he fathered a daughter with Ms Goodman four years after they had a son together.\n\nIn the ruling delivered today, Ms Goodman was accused by the judge of cashing in on the betrayal of Mr Walker's wife.\n\nA 30-page document laid bare a series of shopping sprees and demands after another judge previously accused her of spending money \"like it was going out of fashion\".\n\nSpeaking about Ms Goodman's long list of expensive demands, Walker insisted payment demands would \"not have got this far\" if he was a \"painter and decorator\".\n\n\"A pound is a pound, and let's not be flippant that because I earn the amount of money that I earn, which I have done off my own back, you can just spend money and have an open chequebook,\" he told the Central Family Court in London.\n\n\"I do feel that because of who I am and what I do, and the money that I have, you are taking well out of consideration what is actually needed. If I was a painter and decorator, I don't think we would have got this far.\"\n\nAnother issue Ms Goodman had was with her patio, which she said was 'unsafe' and requested a \u00a331,000 astro turf instead.\n\nShe told the court that her one-year-old daughter Kinara needed the pitch as she had managed to kick a football recently so could well become a Lioness.\n\nMs Goodman also said she needed a cleaner because the house has a huge glass staircase and giant windows.\n\nWithin 48 hours of giving birth, Ms Goodman made a 'financial remedies application' asking for maintenance, already at \u00a3110,000 per year for their son, to be increased to \u00a3177,000.\n\nIt saw the England star agree to buy her a \u00a32.4million Sussex property and spend over \u00a3120,000 on walk-in wardrobes, blinds and curtains, sofas and garden furniture.\n\nThe court heard that Mr Walker, 34, had seen Kairo four times and Kinara once, with Judge Edward Hess stating in his ruling that Ms Goodman \"wished the relationship to develop further than it has\".\n\nHe added that Mr Walker's decision to \"draw a line\" under their relationship in favour of focusing on his marriage was a \"source of disappointment, anguish and anger\" for Ms Goodman.\n\nIn her evidence, Ms Goodman said she did not want her children to be \"different\" from Mr Walker's children with his wife and that the money was to \"secure my children's future\".\n\nShe said: \"He (Mr Walker) has formed a bond with Kairo, who is now sat there asking for his dad. The whole thing is just horrendous.\"\n\nShe added: \"I would do anything for my child. If that meant that the father of my child would have a relationship with my child, I would facilitate that.\"\n\nMr Walker was described as was \"sensible, honest and reliable\" in the court dealings, the judge said.\n\nIn his ruling, Judge Hess dismissed many of Ms Goodman's demands, concluding that she was \"not reliable\" while claiming Mr Walker \"acted with dignity and generosity\".\n\nHe said: \"Plainly, he (Mr Walker) was embarrassed and remorseful as to the difficult situation in which he has placed a number of people, including all of his children, and regretted his decision-making in trying to keep his paternity of Kinara a secret.\n\n\"But he has in my view acted with dignity and generosity, and, once the secret was out, honesty, in facing up to the financial and personal consequences of what happened.\n\n\"In contrast, my assessment of the mother is that she was not reliable, often said what she thought would help her case rather than what was true, failed to make a calm and measured assessment of what she needed and often exaggerated her need to spend money.\"", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Walker", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Walker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AstroTurf", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "AstroTurf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Family court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sterling", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pound sterling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinara", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kinara"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mansion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mansion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_conditioning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Air conditioning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Painting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Painting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheshire", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cheshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cheshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kairo_(band)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kairo (band)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_pitch", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cricket pitch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window_blind", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Window blind"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sussex", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sussex"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furniture", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Furniture"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 46}], "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/06/22/10/Split.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9776014", "eventUri": "eng-9776014", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 204, "relevance": 1}

He was wearing a number 2 England shirt with 'Daddy' on the back\n\nThe England Vice Captain, 32, and his former mistress entered a legal battle earlier this month where Goodman, 33, reeled off a list of pricey demands, amid her application for a higher child maintenance fee for their son and daughter.\n\nRead More Kyle Walker's extraordinary child maintenance battle with Lauryn Goodman laid bare\n\nSome of them included \u00a333,000 to install air condition and \u00a3500 a month for hot tub maintenance.\n\nAmongst Ms Goodman's expensive requests, which were slammed as 'insatiable greed' by her former lover, were the payments for the luxury cars for herself and her nanny, who does not even have a driving licence.\n\nResponding to a grilling by the influencer's barrister Nichola Gray Walker questioned why Goodman would need a nanny when his wife Annie Kilner, 32, and himself, who share four children, do not need help.\n\n'I have four children and I don't have a nanny,' he said before adding: 'If the nanny needs a vehicle, the nanny can use Lauren's vehicle.'\n\n'I'm sorry Miss Gray, I don't know how many people you would like me to pay for. I'm paying for Lauryn, for a nanny. Does she want a chef?' he quipped.\n\nWalker, who has a \u00a326million fortune, added: 'You keep on saying these are small amounts because of my wealth.\n\n'If you add these sums up over 18 years. If you say it's a little bit extra for this a little bit extra for that, in that grand scheme of things - a pound is a pound.\n\n'Let's not be flippant that because I earn the money that I earn which I have done off my own back playing football that you can just spend the money like an open cheque book.'\n\nLauryn Goodman leaves the Central Family Court at the end of the hearing for child maintenance case\n\nThe legal showdown was the latest in the WAG drama, after Kilner kicked Walker out of their \u00a33.5million mansion in Cheshire, after Goodman revealed he was the father to her daughter, who was born in June 2023.\n\nIt came four years after Goodman had their first child Kairo in 2020 she publicly announced that Walker was the father, leading his relationship with Kilner to go up in flames.\n\nAfter Goodman publicly revealed Kinara was also Walker's child, it led to the Manchester City defender cutting off his ex-mistress, eventually being allowed back home by his wife.\n\nYesterday, a reporting restrictions was lifted in the astonishing child maintenance case - revealing the jaw-dropping details and staggering amounts of money involved.\n\nMuch of the case focused on the glassed mansion Walker had bought Goodman, and the long list of safety features and renovations: a \u00a333,000 air conditioning system because the heat becomes 'unbearable' in summer.\n\nAnother issue Goodman had was with her patio, which she said was 'unsafe' and wanted a \u00a331,000 Astro turf instead, claiming that her one-year-old daughter will be a 'Lioness' one day.\n\nShe had wanted \u00a3500 a month to maintain the hot tub, solely for the children's use.\n\nGoodman wanted a gardener costing \u00a3500 a month and a \u00a31,440 monthly cleaner - plus a nanny costing \u00a367,000, plus \u00a330,000 for her car, which she couldn't drive yet.\n\nHe had even funded her \u00a38,000 holiday to Mexico last year.\n\nWalker, who earns a reported \u00a3160,000 a week, was described as 'grounded and reasonable' by Judge Edward Hess.\n\nBut his former lover was lambasted as a spendthrift who was 'spending money as if it was going out of fashion'.\n\nBoth parties have until August 13 to appeal.\n\nWalker v Goodman: Costs awarded in case\n\nAIR CONDITIONING\n\nGoodman asked for a \u00a333,000 air conditioning unit.\n\nWalker does not agree to this.\n\nJudge Hess ruled this demand was neither necessary nor reasonable.\n\nASTRO TURF\n\nGoodman asked for a \u00a331,200 astro turf.\n\nWalker does not agree to this.\n\nJudge Hess ruled this demand was neither necessary nor reasonable.\n\nFURNITURE\n\nGoodman asked for a \u00a320,000 furnishing fund.\n\nWalker offered \u00a32,500.\n\nJudge Hess awarded the mother \u00a35,000 specifically targeted for the daughter's bedroom.\n\nCAR\n\nGoodman asked for \u00a370,000 towards a new Mercedes GLE every three years.\n\nWalker offered to continue as per previous agreement - \u00a351,000 towards a new car every three years, rising with inflation.\n\nJudge Hess was 'not persuaded by the mother's demands'.\n\nCHILD PAYMENTS\n\nGoodman sought \u00a314,750 per month, or \u00a3177,000 a year, for both children.\n\nWalker offered \u00a312,500 per month, or \u00a3150,000 per year.\n\nJudge Hess said the father's offer is 'generous' and it should not go any higher.\n\nNANNY\n\nGoodman sought 30 hours nanny per week at \u00a330 per hour (\u00a33,900 per month) until her daughter is at primary school. From then, 20 hours a week (\u00a32,600 per month) until she is at secondary school. Given as a lump sum.\n\nWalker offered 24 hours per week at \u00a320 per hour (\u00a32,080 per month), then 12 hours a week (\u00a31,040 per month).

three years, with driving lessons and test paid for.\n\nWalker does not agree to this.\n\nJudge Hess awarded Goodman \u00a312,000 towards a car for the nanny, conditional on her providing evidence that the nanny has a full driving licence.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

He was wearing a number 2 England shirt with 'Daddy' on the back\n\nKyle Walker agree to buy Lauren Goodman a \u00a32.4million Sussex property (pictured) and spend over \u00a3120,000 on walk-in wardrobes, blinds and curtains, sofas and garden furniture\n\nLauryn Goodman hid under a coat as she arrived at Holborn Family Court in London on July 16\n\nEngland footballer Kyle Walker is pictured outside at Holborn Family Court on July 16\n\nSince then, both Walker and Goodman have given their own 'tell-all' interviews to various newspapers, but strenuous court orders have meant the central plot to this lurid drama, and the staggering amounts of money involved, have remained a secret, until today.\n\nWalker v Goodman: Costs awarded in case\n\nAIR CONDITIONING\n\nGoodman asked for a \u00a333,000 air conditioning unit.\n\nWalker does not agree to this.\n\nJudge Hess ruled this demand was neither necessary nor reasonable.\n\nASTRO TURF\n\nGoodman asked for a \u00a331,200 astro turf.\n\nWalker does not agree to this.\n\nJudge Hess ruled this demand was neither necessary nor reasonable.\n\nFURNITURE\n\nGoodman asked for a \u00a320,000 furnishing fund.\n\nWalker offered \u00a32,500.\n\nJudge Hess awarded the mother \u00a35,000 specifically targeted for the daughter's bedroom.\n\nCAR\n\nGoodman asked for \u00a370,000 towards a new Mercedes GLE every three years.\n\nWalker offered to continue as per previous agreement - \u00a351,000 towards a new car every three years, rising with inflation.\n\nJudge Hess was 'not persuaded by the mother's demands'.\n\nCHILD PAYMENTS\n\nGoodman sought \u00a314,750 per month, or \u00a3177,000 a year, for both children.\n\nWalker offered \u00a312,500 per month, or \u00a3150,000 per year.\n\nJudge Hess said the father's offer is 'generous' and it should not go any higher.\n\nNANNY\n\nGoodman sought 30 hours nanny per week at \u00a330 per hour (\u00a33,900 per month) until her daughter is at primary school. From then, 20 hours a week (\u00a32,600 per month) until she is at secondary school. Given as a lump sum.\n\nWalker offered 24 hours per week at \u00a320 per hour (\u00a32,080 per month), then 12 hours a week (\u00a31,040 per month). Paid monthly.\n\nJudge Hess said the father's offer is 'fair and reasonable' but should rise in line with inflation.\n\nNANNY'S CAR\n\nGoodman sought a \u00a330,000 car for the nanny, replaced every three years, with driving lessons and test paid for.\n\nWalker does not agree to this.\n\nJudge Hess awarded Goodman \u00a312,000 towards a car for the nanny, conditional on her providing evidence that the nanny has a full driving licence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA highly unusual ruling this week, following legal submissions - including those made by the Mail - saw reporting restrictions lifted, meaning we can lay bare the eye-popping details of most vitriolic legal spat since Rebekah Vardy unsuccessfully sued Coleen Rooney for naming her as a social media 'mole' who'd been leaking private information about her to newspapers.\n\nIn the searing judgment, Walker, who earns a reported \u00a3160,000 a week, and is known - off the pitch - as a bit of a rogue with a roving eye, emerged with his character reupholstered as he was described as 'grounded and reasonable' by Judge Edward Hess.\n\nHis former lover, meanwhile - who, it was revealed in court, was once prosecuted for benefit fraud and who has only \u00a310,000 assets to her name - was lambasted as a spendthrift who was 'spending money as if it was going out of fashion' and treated Walker like 'an open-ended cheque book'.\n\nIt was Walker himself who summed up the situation: 'If I was a painter and decorator I know this wouldn't have gone this far,' he said.\n\nOver two days of drama, the High Court heard how Goodman:\n\nStrong-armed Walker into buying her a \u00a32.4million mansion, before demanding maintenance payments worth the equivalent of a \u00a3350,000 salary.Tried to force him to face her in court within 12 hours of the final whistle blowing at the Euros final in Berlin, meaning he wouldn't have been able to celebrate or commiserate with team mates.Argued she needed a \u00a331,000 astro turf lawn laying because she believes her one-year-old daughter - who is still crawling - is going to become a 'Lioness', an England women's football star.Asked Walker's neighbour to spy on him and Annie over her garden fence, to gather information about their marriage, saying she was 'ready to finish them'.Demanded a \u00a370,000 Mercedes and another \u00a330,000 car for her nanny - who couldn't even drive.Argued she needed \u00a3500 a month to maintain a hot tub solely for the children's use, another \u00a3500 a month for a gardener a \u00a31,440 a month for a cleaner.\n\nThe final two-day court showdown, just 48 hours after England's devastating Euro's defeat to Spain, saw the Manchester City defender going back on the attack.\n\nDressed in sharp black suit and, notably, still wearing his wedding ring, he refused to make eye contact with his former mistress as she stared at him from the witness box.\n\nShe'd arrived at court somewhat chaotically, covering her face with coats and shouting at photographers not to take her picture.\n\nAs for Walker's long-suffering wife Annie, she was nowhere to be seen. Those who know her say she'd welcomed the court day of reckoning, but transporting four children back from Germany the day before made it impossible to attend.\n\nThere were moments of comedy during the case. In his still broad Sheffield accent, Walker 34, referenced Goodman wanting to spend \u00a316,000, meant for furniture for the children's rooms, on two bespoke white leather sofas.\n\n'I don't think that's child friendly,' he quipped.\n\nHe also ripped into her spending habits, at one point bluntly asking her barrister, Nichola Gray KC: 'Ms Gray, how many people would you like me to pay for? Does she want a chef?'\n\nAnnie Kilner at the Olympiastadion in Berlin for England v Spain Euro 2024 final on July 14\n\nLauryn Goodman posted a picture of her children cheering on Kyle Walker in the Euro 2024 quarter-final between England and Switzerland on July 6, with shirts saying 'Daddy'\n\nGoodman said the glass staircase also meant she needed a 'bespoke glass and wood babygate' (such as the one pictured above) because 'the standard gates don't fit'\n\nGoodman asked for \u00a370,000 towards a new Mercedes GLE (such as the one pictured) every three years\n\nBut there were tears too, as Goodman took to the witness box to describe her pain on reading Walker's interview with The Sun earlier this year, in which he described their affair as a mistake.\n\nWalker's steely demeanour did not crack, as he shook his head dismissively and refused to meet her gaze.\n\nGoodman fought to keep details of the court hearing secret, with her lawyers arguing their children deserved privacy.\n\nBut Judge Hess said she has 'actively instigated press coverage' of her own son and daughter - travelling to the Euros with their son in an England shirt with 'Daddy' on the back, as well as publicly detailing her feud with their father - so could not now plead privacy for her children.\n\n'If the children suffer any harm from the publicity of these matters, it has already happened, and it will largely be the result of the mother's own decisions and actions,' he ruled.\n\nWith the details now out in the open, Walker must hope this draws to a close the scandal that has loomed over the twilight years of his career - and cost him millions.\n\nWalker had been with his childhood sweetheart Kilner since they were teenagers at school\n\nIt began in 2020 when Goodman had her first child, Kairo, and publicly named Walker as the father.\n\nHis childhood sweetheart Annie, who he's been with since they were teenagers at school, furiously threw him out of the family home.\n\nA financial application for Kairo 'painfully and expensively' went through court over two years. Walker was ordered to buy Goodman a \u00a31.85million home, though within a 60-mile radius of a Sussex town to prevent her being near his family, and to pay \u00a38,000 per month child support.\n\nThe footballer also paid over \u00a3600,000 picking up both sides' legal costs, cleared \u00a340,000 of her debts and put over \u00a3100,000 in total towards a nanny, furniture and a car.\n\nWalker cut contact with his ex-mistress and moved back in with Annie, with whom he has four sons: Roman, 11, Riaan, seven, and Reign, five, and Rezon, three months.\n\nThis was a 'source of disappointment, anguish and anger' for Goodman, who threatened to move near his family's Cheshire pile - which would breach the order - and made enquiries with nearby estate agents.\n\nKyle Walker with wife Annie Kilner and family after England v Denmark in Frankfurt on June 20\n\nIn August 2022, she also made contact with the footballer's neighbour and asked her to covertly record Walker and his wife in the garden.\n\n'Wait until they argue,' Goodman messaged, adding: 'Ready to finish them.'\n\nThat same month, the influencer saw Walker at his solicitor's office and, remarkably, contact between the two was resumed.\n\nThen, after travelling to London for groin surgery that October, they met once again and nine months later their second child, a girl, was born.\n\nWithin 48 hours of giving birth, Goodman made a 'financial remedies application' asking for maintenance, already at \u00a3110,000 per year for their son, to be increased to \u00a3177,000.\n\nKnowing Walker wanted to keep their daughter's birth secret, she made demands while 'hinting that she would go public'.\n\nWalker's wife Kilner booted the footballer out of their \u00a33.5million marital mansion in Cheshire\n\nIt saw the England Vice Captain agree to buy her a \u00a32.4million Sussex property and spend over \u00a3120,000 on walk-in wardrobes, blinds and curtains, sofas and garden furniture.\n\nThis, however, was seemingly not enough to buy Goodman's silence who, the judge said, 'plainly had no intention of keeping the matter secret'.\n\nIn the days leading up to Christmas last year she all but outed Walker in a series of posts, including a picture of the daughter on Instagram with the caption: 'I'm a lion'.\n\nThen, knowing Annie - then pregnant with her fourth child - was home alone while her husband was playing football on December 27, messaged revealing the secret.\n\n'Hey it's Lauryn I just wanted to quickly tell you that Kyle is the father of our daughter,' she wrote.\n\nGoodman claimed in court that she texted Ms Kilner 'to sort things out so all the boys could have a relationship' and 'to calm things down'.\n\nKyle Walker with his wife Annie Kilner and children after his Manchester City team won the FIFA Club World Cup final against Brazil's Fluminense in Jeddah on December 22, 2023\n\nBut Judge Hess said he did not accept this was 'an attempt to create a good working relationship between the two women'.\n\n'This was intended to, and did, cause distress to the father's wife,' he said.\n\nAfter that message, all hell broke loose. Walker was booted from the family home once more.\n\nHe responded with a mea culpa interview weeks later, while his ex-mistress repeatedly raged online and uploaded photos of their two children.\n\nUnknown to fans, their last court showdown on the financial remedy for their daughter was scheduled for 10am on the Monday morning after the Berlin final.\n\nWalker's legal team had asked to adjourn the case by one day. Goodman's lawyers objected.\n\n'He cannot now ask for what is essentially permission to celebrate or commiserate with his teammates,' they wrote. 'That is no reason to adjourn a hearing.'\n\nLauryn Goodman (pictured) publicly named Walker as the father of her first child, Kairo\n\nJudge Hess did not agree. He put the two-day hearing back by 24 hours.\n\nOn the second day Goodman turned up sporting a necklace with her children's initials, 'KW'.\n\nHer long list of financial demands read like those of a fully-fledged, footballer's wife - something she never was, and probably never will be, a point not lost on Judge Hess.\n\n'The evidence suggests that the mother wished the relationship to develop further than it has and the father's decision not to allow the relationship develop at all and instead to commit himself to his wife has been a source of disappointment, anguish and anger for the mother,' the judge said in his ruling.\n\nShe'd wanted \u00a3500 a month to maintain the hot tub, solely for the children's use. A \u00a370,000 Mercedes GLE - the only car she feels 'safe' in - replaced with a new model every three years. A gardener costing \u00a3500 a month and a \u00a31,440 monthly cleaner. A nanny costing \u00a367,000, plus \u00a330,000 for her car, which she couldn't drive yet.\n\nHe'd even funded her \u00a38,000 holiday to Mexico last year.\n\n'I want a lot of things in life, but sometimes I just don't get them,' said Walker from the witness box, perhaps with his Euro's loss in Berlin still on his mind.\n\nOn the matter of the nanny - plus her driving lessons - Walker was asked what Goodman was expected to do, should she need to transport the children around, as part of her duties.\n\nAnnie Kilner at the Olympiastadion in Berlin for England v Spain Euro 2024 final on July 14\n\n'I would probably employ one who can drive,' he answered.\n\nMuch of the case focused on the glassed mansion Walker had bought Goodman, and the long list of safety features and renovations: a \u00a333,000 air conditioning system because the heat becomes 'unbearable' in summer.\n\nWalker said there are 'other solutions' suggesting his ex mistress 'can go and get Dyson fans' instead as he does at his home.\n\nAnother issue Goodman had was with her patio, which she said was 'unsafe' and wanted a \u00a331,000 astro turf instead. She told the court that her one-year-old daughter needed the pitch as she had managed to kick a football recently so could well become a Lioness.\n\nJudge Hess cut in: 'For a one-year-old child to kick with her left foot to being a Lioness, that's quite a leap?'\n\nGoodman, seemingly taking a dig at her ex-lover's defeat two days previous, responded: 'Never say never. The Lionesses are better than the Lions anyway.'\n\nWalker's wife Annie Kilner (pictured) was not present at the court proceedings\n\nGoodman also said she needed a cleaner because the house has a huge glass staircase and giant windows. Nicola Saxton KC, for Walker, reminded her: 'You chose this house with all its glass.'\n\nThe barrister accused her of choosing a 'designer home' in an 'address you coveted' over a 'perfectly suitable family home'.\n\nGoodman said the glass staircase also meant she needed a 'bespoke glass and wood babygate' because 'the standard gates don't fit' - insisting she had 'really tried'.\n\nJudge Hess said he didn't understand the need for bespoke gates.\n\nKyle Walker with wife Annie Kilner and family after England v Denmark in Frankfurt on June 20\n\n'I have had a few children in my time,' he said. 'You get the standard baby gates and they extend out.'\n\nJudge Hess sided with the footballer on nearly every point of contention saying he found him 'sensible, honest and reliable'.\n\nAfter the two day court fight came to a close, Goodman made a hasty getaway as Walker addressed journalists gathered outside: 'I hope you enjoyed yourselves - I won't be back here again.'\n\nHe must hope so - for his marriage's sake, and for his bank balance.\n\nFollowing the case, a spokeswoman for Walker said today: 'This judgment speaks for itself in laying bare Lauryn Goodman's insatiable greed and relentless pursuit of money.\n\nAnnie Kilner in the crowd at the 2018 World Cup in Russia, watching England v Panama\n\n'The judge made it clear: she used Kyle as an open ended cheque book and repeatedly threatened him in order to get what she wanted.\n\n'She then orchestrated a media campaign to feed intolerable and wrongful intrusion into the private lives of Kyle, Annie and their young family.\n\n'Throughout each court proceeding the judge stated that Kyle adopted a fair and generous stance.\n\n'These proceedings were never necessary. Kyle's offer should have been accepted months ago and would therefore have eliminated the need for added stress to all involved.\n\n'In light of this judgment and the truths it makes public, my client and his family now ask that the media fully respects their rights to a private life as they navigate their next steps.'\n\nBoth parties have until August 13 to appeal.", "source": {"uri":

Walker court battle reporting after Goodman 'instigated' coverage", "body": "Judge Edward Hess said that press reporting should be permitted despite objections from Lauryn Goodman that those involved should not be identified.\n\nA judge who ruled that the press could report on a court dispute between Manchester City footballer Kyle Walker and Lauryn Goodman said that she had \"actively instigated\" press coverage of their children despite her objections to the proceedings being reported.\n\nJudge Edward Hess said it \"sits ill\" that Ms Goodman argued that the hearing at the Central Family Court in London should be private, having recently taken payment from the press to attend the European Championships in Germany for \"journalistic fodder\".\n\nModel Ms Goodman, 33, was in a court dispute with 34-year-old Mr Walker earlier this month over the amount of money he should pay to support their one-year-old daughter, Kinara.\n\nReporting of the hearing had been prohibited under a court ruling, which was opposed by the media and lawyers for Mr Walker.\n\nDespite objections from Ms Goodman, Judge Hess said any harm caused to the children by the court case \"has already happened\" and would \"largely be the result of the mother's own decisions and actions\" in public.\n\nIn his ruling, he said: \"It would be a nonsense, opening the court to ridicule, to try to redact or anonymise this judgment to prevent identification of the parties.\n\n\"Further, a perusal of the many hundreds of newspaper articles published about these matters clearly illustrates that the mother has not just co-operated with, but actively instigated, press coverage placing in the public domain her own children, the circumstances of their conceptions and what she thinks about the father.\n\n\"It sits ill for a person to come to court arguing for privacy for her children when, just a very short while earlier, she took a payment from the press to visit the European football championship with her son dressed in an England football shirt with the name 'Daddy' on the back, and to be willingly photographed doing this to provide journalistic fodder which the newspapers were only too happy to use.\n\n\"If the children suffer any harm from the publicity of these matters, it has already happened, and it will largely be the result of the mother's own decisions and actions.\n\n\"For me, on the facts of this case, the balancing exercise must come down against the mother's argument.\n\n\"For me, the right of the press to scrutinise and comment upon the court's procedures and decisions, and what the mother has requested of the father and how he has responded, is on this occasion a greater priority.\"\n\nThe ruling comes after the court was told by Mr Walker's barristers that Ms Goodman confirmed Kinara's paternity in the press earlier this year.\n\nNichola Gray KC, representing Ms Goodman, told the court that Mr Walker had previously tried to ensure Ms Goodman would \"stay silent\" about the child's paternity, and that the model had agreed to a \"gagging undertaking\".\n\nMr Walker agreed with Ms Gray that he \"did not want to acknowledge publicly\" the paternity of the child, but said he did not believe that it would remain private \"forever\".\n\nHe said: \"My wife at home did not know and I have two children with Lauryn, four children with Annie, and I wanted to protect them as best as possible.\"\n\nHe said that while he did not believe he was \"over a barrel\", he said: \"(Ms Goodman) did not have a gun to my head but she did have a detonator and for me, it was about keeping the peace because I did not want my wife finding out.\"\n\nA pilot scheme to increase transparency in the family court system, which began with three courts in 2023, was expanded earlier this year to allow accredited journalists and legal bloggers to report on cases at nearly 20 courts across England and Wales, including the Central Family Court.\n\nJudges can set out what details may be reported under a Transparency Order, with journalists also allowed to access some documents.\n\nFollowing an application made by members of the media, Judge Hess ruled that details of the hearing could be reported, with the exception of some personal information.\n\nHe said in his judgment that he had reached a \"clear conclusion\" that \"the normal confidentiality restrictions should be dispensed with\", adding: \"I also consider it very likely, having heard her evidence, that the mother will be tempted, one way or another and whatever any transparency order says, to seek defiantly to put in the public domain her views about the court's findings and also further views she may have about the father.\n\n\"In these circumstances, it is my view preferable that anybody interested in the topic should have the opportunity to read the full independent account contained in this judgment before reaching any conclusions about what has happened.\"", "source": {"uri": "irishnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Irish News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Walker", "type": "person",

Walker court battle reporting after Goodman 'instigated' coverage", "body": "Judge Edward Hess said it \"sits ill\" that Ms Goodman argued that the hearing at the Central Family Court in London should be private, having recently taken payment from the press to attend the European Championships in Germany for \"journalistic fodder\".\n\nModel Ms Goodman, 33, was in a court dispute with 34-year-old Mr Walker earlier this month over the amount of money he should pay to support their one-year-old daughter, Kinara.\n\nReporting of the hearing had been prohibited under a court ruling, which was opposed by the media and lawyers for Mr Walker.\n\nDespite objections from Ms Goodman, Judge Hess said any harm caused to the children by the court case \"has already happened\" and would \"largely be the result of the mother's own decisions and actions\" in public.\n\nIn his ruling, he said: \"It would be a nonsense, opening the court to ridicule, to try to redact or anonymise this judgment to prevent identification of the parties.\n\n\"Further, a perusal of the many hundreds of newspaper articles published about these matters clearly illustrates that the mother has not just co-operated with, but actively instigated, press coverage placing in the public domain her own children, the circumstances of their conceptions and what she thinks about the father.\n\n\"It sits ill for a person to come to court arguing for privacy for her children when, just a very short while earlier, she took a payment from the press to visit the European football championship with her son dressed in an England football shirt with the name 'Daddy' on the back, and to be willingly photographed doing this to provide journalistic fodder which the newspapers were only too happy to use.\n\n\"If the children suffer any harm from the publicity of these matters, it has already happened, and it will largely be the result of the mother's own decisions and actions.\n\n\"For me, on the facts of this case, the balancing exercise must come down against the mother's argument.\n\n\"For me, the right of the press to scrutinise and comment upon the court's procedures and decisions, and what the mother has requested of the father and how he has responded, is on this occasion a greater priority.\"\n\nThe ruling comes after the court was told by Mr Walker's barristers that Ms Goodman confirmed Kinara's paternity in the press earlier this year.\n\nNichola Gray KC, representing Ms Goodman, told the court that Mr Walker had previously tried to ensure Ms Goodman would \"stay silent\" about the child's paternity, and that the model had agreed to a \"gagging undertaking\".\n\nMr Walker agreed with Ms Gray that he \"did not want to acknowledge publicly\" the paternity of the child, but said he did not believe that it would remain private \"forever\".\n\nHe said: \"My wife at home did not know and I have two children with Lauryn, four children with Annie, and I wanted to protect them as best as possible.\"\n\nHe said that while he did not believe he was \"over a barrel\", he said: \"(Ms Goodman) did not have a gun to my head but she did have a detonator and for me, it was about keeping the peace because I did not want my wife finding out.\"\n\nA pilot scheme to increase transparency in the family court system, which began with three courts in 2023, was expanded earlier this year to allow accredited journalists and legal bloggers to report on cases at nearly 20 courts across England and Wales, including the Central Family Court.\n\nJudges can set out what details may be reported under a Transparency Order, with journalists also allowed to access some documents.\n\nFollowing an application made by members of the media, Judge Hess ruled that details of the hearing could be reported, with the exception of some personal information.\n\nHe said in his judgment that he had reached a \"clear conclusion\" that \"the normal confidentiality restrictions should be dispensed with\", adding: \"I also consider it very likely, having heard her evidence, that the mother will be tempted, one way or another and whatever any transparency order says, to seek defiantly to put in the public domain her views about the court's findings and also further views she may have about the father.\n\n\"In these circumstances, it is my view preferable that anybody interested in the topic should have the opportunity to read the full independent account contained in this judgment before reaching any conclusions about what has happened.\"", "source": {"uri": "belfasttelegraph.co.uk",

matters clearly illustrates that the mother has not just co-operated with, but actively instigated, press coverage placing in the public domain her own children, the circumstances of their conceptions and what she thinks about the father.\n\n\"It sits ill for a person to come to court arguing for privacy for her children when, just a very short while earlier, she took a payment from the press to visit the European football championship with her son dressed in an England football shirt with the name 'Daddy' on the back, and to be willingly photographed doing this to provide journalistic fodder which the newspapers were only too happy to use.\n\n\"If the children suffer any harm from the publicity of these matters, it has already happened, and it will largely be the result of the mother's own decisions and actions.\n\n\"For me, on the facts of this case, the balancing exercise must come down against the mother's argument.\n\n\"For me, the right of the press to scrutinise and comment upon the court's procedures and decisions, and what the mother has requested of the father and how he has responded, is on this occasion a greater priority.\"\n\nThe ruling comes after the court was told by Mr Walker's barristers that Ms Goodman confirmed Kinara's paternity in the press earlier this year.\n\nNichola Gray KC, representing Ms Goodman, told the court that Mr Walker had previously tried to ensure Ms Goodman would \"stay silent\" about the child's paternity, and that the model had agreed to a \"gagging undertaking\".\n\nMr Walker agreed with Ms Gray that he \"did not want to acknowledge publicly\" the paternity of the child, but said he did not believe that it would remain private \"forever\".\n\nHe said: \"My wife at home did not know and I have two children with Lauryn, four children with Annie, and I wanted to protect them as best as possible.\"\n\nHe said that while he did not believe he was \"over a barrel\", he said: \"(Ms Goodman) did not have a gun to my head but she did have a detonator and for me, it was about keeping the peace because I did not want my wife finding out.\"\n\nA pilot scheme to increase transparency in the family court system, which began with three courts in 2023, was expanded earlier this year to allow accredited journalists and legal bloggers to report on cases at nearly 20 courts across England and Wales, including the Central Family Court.\n\nIt is my view preferable that anybody interested in the topic should have the opportunity to read the full independent account contained in this judgment before reaching any conclusions about what has happened\n\nJudges can set out what details may be reported under a Transparency Order, with journalists also allowed to access some documents.\n\nFollowing an application made by members of the media, Judge Hess ruled that details of the hearing could be reported, with the exception of some personal information.\n\nHe said in his judgment that he had reached a \"clear conclusion\" that \"the normal confidentiality restrictions should be dispensed with\", adding: \"I also consider it very likely, having heard her evidence, that the mother will be tempted, one way or another and whatever any transparency order says, to seek defiantly to put in the public domain her views about the court's findings and also further views she may have about the father.\n\n\"In these circumstances, it is my view preferable that anybody interested in the topic should have the opportunity to read the full independent account contained in this judgment before reaching any conclusions about what has happened.\"", "source": {"uri": "kentonline.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Kent Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Walker", "type":

He and Annie are now back together\n\nKyle Walker faced Lauren at the High Court this month (both pictured outside) in a child maintenance case\n\nKyle Walker and his wife Annie Kilner (pictured together in March 2023) have been together since their teens in Sheffield\n\nLauryn Goodman pictured with her two children in Brighton today\n\nBut Judge Edward Hess, who today ruled in the extraordinary legal fight over maintenance support to the children Walker fathered with influencer Goodman, rejected her explanation for the text.\n\nHe said he did not accept this was 'an attempt to create a good working relationship between the two women', concluding instead that it it was part of a longer campaign to 'undermine' Walker's marriage.\n\nIn the days leading up to Christmas last year Lauryn all but outed Walker in a series of social media posts, including a picture of the daughter on Instagram with the caption: 'I'm a lion'.\n\nThen, knowing Annie - then pregnant with her fourth child - was home alone while her husband was playing football on December 27, messaged revealing the secret.\n\nGoodman claimed that her 'friend', Walker's neighbour Jasmine, had already told Annie but Walker 'made it so she didn't believe it'.\n\nLauryn had been contact with Jasmine for at least 16 months - and had asked her to spy on the couple and even record them, the judge was told.\n\nNicola Saxton KC, who represented Kyle Walker at the High Court, asked Lauryn: 'You sent a text to Annie on 27 December when she was six months pregnant to say you had two children with Kyle.\n\nMs Goodman replied: 'My friend sent her a text to say [the child] was Kyle's. The message was from me through a friend.'\n\nLauryn claimed that Annie already 'had an inkling' and 'had asked [Walker] several times'. But on December 27 she sent the text message through Jasmine.\n\nLauren and Kyle's two children watch their father play ay Euro 2024 at home in England kits with 'daddy' on the back\n\nKyle Walker, his wife and their sons at Euro 2024\n\nShe claimed she was 'losing weight' and 'wasn't eating' as Walker had been 'lying' to her and did not confess that Annie was pregnant again.\n\nAsked if she 'acted in anger' when she sent the text, Goodman said: 'I wanted to sort things out so all the boys could have a relationship. If we could sort it out maybe we could move forward. We had a normal conversation. That's how it felt.'\n\nMiss Saxton KC said: 'You knew Annie was on her own with her three children, six months pregnant, and you sent that text, when Kyle was away at football.'\n\nJudge Hess ruled: 'This was intended to, and did, cause distress to the father's wife.\n\n'I do not accept the mother's explanation that this text message was sent in an attempt to create a good working relationship between the two women in the father's life.\n\n'In my view this text was written in the same spirit as the series of text communications with the father's next door neighbour in Cheshire in which the mother sought to persuade the neighbour to record conversations over the garden fence with a view to gain material to undermine the father's marriage.\n\n'When the mother texted the neighbour to say \"Ready to finish them\", she had in mind causing irreparable damage to the father's marriage.'\n\nThe love triangle began in 2020 when Goodman had her first child, Kairo, and publicly named Walker as the father.\n\nHis childhood sweetheart Annie, who he's been with since they were teenagers at school, furiously threw him out of the family home.\n\nA financial application for Kairo 'painfully and expensively' went through court over two years.\n\nWalker was ordered to buy Goodman a \u00a31.85million home, though within a 60-mile radius of a Sussex town to prevent her being near his family, and to pay \u00a38,000 per month child support.\n\nLauryn Goodman wore a necklace with Kyle Walker's initials\n\nReality star Lauryn Goodman tried to smuggle herself into the High Court under a coat for the first day of the hearing in July. When she left when the case ended she told journalists: 'I won't be back here again.'\n\nKyle went straight from the Euros to the High Court\n\nThe footballer also paid over \u00a3600,000 picking up both sides legal costs, cleared \u00a340,000 of her debts and put over \u00a3100,000 in total towards a nanny, furniture and a car.\n\nWalker cut contact with his ex-mistress and moved back in with Annie, with whom he has four sons: Roman, 11, Riaan, seven, and Reign, five, and Rezon, three months.\n\nThis was a 'source of disappointment, anguish and anger' for Goodman, who threatened to move near his family's Cheshire pile - which would be in breach of the order - and made enquiries with nearby estate agents.\n\nIn August 2022 the influencer saw Walker at his solicitor's office and, remarkably, contact between the two was resumed.\n\nThen, after travelling to London for groin surgery that October, they met once again and nine months later their second child, a girl, was born.\n\nWithin 48 hours of giving birth, Goodman made a 'financial remedies application' asking for maintenance, already at \u00a3110,000 per year for their son, to be increased to \u00a3177,000.\n\nKnowing Walker wanted to keep their daughter's birth secret, she made demands while 'hinting that she would go public'.\n\nIt saw the England Vice Captain agree to buy her a \u00a32.4million Sussex property and spend over \u00a3120,000 on walk-in wardrobes, blinds and curtains, sofas and garden furniture.\n\nThis, however, was seemingly not enough to buy Goodman's silence who, the judge said, 'plainly had no intention of keeping the matter secret'.\n\nKyle and Annie have been together for more than 13 years, through his glittering football career. Although they have only been married for around three years\n\nToday Judge Hess sided with the footballer on nearly every point of contention saying he found him 'sensible, honest and reliable'.\n\nAfter the two-day court fight came to a close, Goodman made a hasty getaway as Walker addressed journalists gathered outside: 'I hope you enjoyed yourselves - I won't be back here again.'\n\nFollowing the case, a spokeswoman for Walker said today: 'This judgment speaks for itself in laying bare Lauryn Goodman's insatiable greed and relentless pursuit of money.\n\n'The judge made it clear: she used Kyle as an open ended cheque book and repeatedly threatened him in order to get what she wanted.\n\n'She then orchestrated a media campaign to feed intolerable and wrongful intrusion into the private lives of Kyle, Annie and their young family.\n\n'Throughout each court proceeding the judge stated that Kyle adopted a fair and generous stance.\n\n'These proceedings were never necessary. Kyle's offer should have been accepted months ago and would therefore have eliminated the need for added stress to all involved.\n\n'In light of this judgment and the truths it makes public, my client and his family now ask that the media fully respects their rights to a private life as they navigate their next steps.'", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail

These proceedings were never necessary. Kyle's offer should have been accepted months ago and would therefore have eliminated the need for added stress to all involved.\n\n\"In light of this judgement and the truths it makes public, my client and his family now ask that the media fully respects their rights to a private life as they navigate their next steps.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Ms Goodman said: \"I am a dedicated single mother and whilst my children will never have what their half siblings have, I have tried my best for my children and always will, no matter what.\n\n\"Thanks to my legal team and the judge's decision, my children's childhood is secure and I will now focus on building a solid future for them so as to provide for the time when the children's home reverts back to their father.\n\n\"More than anything, I look forward to enjoying every moment with my children and the three of us being able get on with our lives.\"\n\nDuring the case, Mr Walker agreed that he \"did not want to acknowledge publicly\" the paternity of the child but accepted the truth would come out eventually.\n\nHe said: \"My wife at home did not know and I have two children with Lauryn, four children with Annie, and I wanted to protect them as best as possible.\"\n\nHe added: \"(Ms Goodman) did not have a gun to my head but she did have a detonator and for me, it was about keeping the peace because I did not want my wife

His wife, Annie Kilner, 32, booted him out of their \u00a33.5million mansion in Cheshire.\n\nLauryn Goodman, pictured at a Tempus magazine party in London on December 7, 2017\n\nKyle Walker with his wife Annie Kilner and children after his Manchester City team won the FIFA Club World Cup final against Brazil's Fluminense in Jeddah on December 22, 2023\n\nLauryn Goodman posted a picture of her children cheering on Kyle Walker in the Euro 2024 quarter-final between England and Switzerland on July 6, with shirts saying 'Daddy'\n\nNow, reporting restrictions have now been lifted in the astonishing case -

Walker court battle reporting after Goodman 'instigated' coverage", "body": "A judge who ruled that the press could report on a court dispute between Manchester City footballer Kyle Walker and Lauryn Goodman said that she had \"actively instigated\" press coverage of their children despite her objections to the proceedings being reported.\n\nJudge Edward Hess said it \"sits ill\" that Ms Goodman argued that the hearing at the Central Family Court in London should be private, having recently taken payment from the press to attend the European Championships in Germany for \"journalistic fodder\".\n\nModel Ms Goodman, 33, was in a court dispute with 34-year-old Mr Walker earlier this month over the amount of money he should pay to support their one-year-old daughter, Kinara.\n\nReporting of the hearing had been prohibited under a court ruling, which was opposed by the media and lawyers for Mr Walker.\n\nIn his ruling, he said: \"It would be a nonsense, opening the court to ridicule, to try to redact or anonymise this judgment to prevent identification of the parties.\n\n\"Further, a perusal of the many hundreds of newspaper articles published about these matters clearly illustrates that the mother has not just co-operated with, but actively instigated, press coverage placing in the public domain her own children, the circumstances of their conceptions and what she thinks about the father.\n\n\"It sits ill for a person to come to court arguing for privacy for her children when, just a very short while earlier, she took a payment from the press to visit the European football championship with her son dressed in an England football shirt with the name 'Daddy' on the back, and to be willingly photographed doing this to provide journalistic fodder which the newspapers were only too happy to use.\n\n\"If the children suffer any harm from the publicity of these matters, it has already happened, and it will largely be the result of the mother's own decisions and actions.\n\n\"For me, on the facts of this case, the balancing exercise must come down against the mother's argument.\n\n\"For me, the right of the press to scrutinise and comment upon the court's procedures and decisions, and what the mother has requested of the father and how he has responded, is on this occasion a greater priority.\"\n\nThe ruling comes after the court was told by Mr Walker's barristers that Ms Goodman confirmed Kinara's paternity in the press earlier this year.\n\nNichola Gray KC, representing Ms Goodman, told the court that Mr Walker had previously tried to ensure Ms Goodman would \"stay silent\" about the child's paternity, and that the model had agreed to a \"gagging undertaking\".\n\nMr Walker agreed with Ms Gray that he \"did not want to acknowledge publicly\" the paternity of the child, but said he did not believe that it would remain private \"forever\".\n\nHe said: \"My wife at home did not know and I have two children with Lauryn, four children with Annie, and I wanted to protect them as best as possible.\"\n\nHe said that while he did not believe he was \"over a barrel\", he said: \"(Ms Goodman) did not have a gun to my head but she did have a detonator and for me, it was about keeping the peace because I did not want my wife finding out.\"\n\nA pilot scheme to increase transparency in the family court system, which began with three courts in 2023, was expanded earlier this year to allow accredited journalists and legal bloggers to report on cases at nearly 20 courts across England and Wales, including the Central Family Court.\n\nFollowing an application made by members of the media, Judge Hess ruled that details of the hearing could be reported, with the exception of some personal information.\n\nHe said in his judgment that he had reached a \"clear conclusion\" that \"the normal confidentiality restrictions should be dispensed with\", adding: \"I also consider it very likely, having heard her evidence, that the mother will be tempted, one way or another and whatever any transparency order says, to seek defiantly to put in the public domain her views about the court's findings and also further views she may have about the father.\n\n\"In these circumstances, it is my view preferable that anybody interested in the topic should have the opportunity to read the full independent account contained in this judgment before reaching any conclusions about what has happened.\"", "source": {"uri": "jerseyeveningpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jersey Evening Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

The 33-year-old footballer has admitted that a potential divorce from his wife, Annie Kilner, could result in him losing half of his \u00a326 million fortune.\n\nWalker has been embroiled in several scandals over recent years. In April 2020, Manchester City took disciplinary action against him for breaching COVID-19 lockdown protocols by inviting two prostitutes to his home. His latest controversy involves a courtroom showdown with his former mistress, Lauryn Goodman, with whom he fathered two children.\n\nDespite these issues, Walker remains married to his childhood sweetheart, Annie Kilner, with whom he has four children. Their relationship has been tumultuous, marked by infidelity and public scandals.\n\nUnrelenting Affairs\n\nIn 2020, Lauryn Goodman announced the birth of her son, Kairo, revealing Walker as the father. This revelation led to Kilner temporarily kicking Walker out of their family home. Despite the turmoil, Walker continued to support Goodman and their son financially. He later cut off contact with Goodman to reconcile with Kilner, and the pair eventually married in 2022.\n\nHowever, Walker reconnected with Goodman in 2023 after a meeting at his solicitor's office. During a football tournament in late December, Goodman sent a message to Kilner saying, \"Hey, it's Lauryn; I just wanted to quickly tell you that Kyle is the father of our daughter.\" This message prompted Kilner to once again kick Walker out of their home. Despite this, Kilner and their children were cheering Walker on at the Euros in Germany, suggesting a potential reconciliation.\n\nMaking it a Legal Matter\n\nIn a recent two-day court battle, Walker hinted that his reconciliation with Kilner might not be as solid as it appears. He stated that he \"could be going through a divorce,\" meaning losing \"financially half my pie\" in a settlement. This implies half of his \u00a326 million net worth could be allocated to his wife and children.\n\nDuring the hearing, Walker highlighted Goodman's focus on his wealth, accusing her of being \"very interested in money.\" Despite having already provided a \u00a32.4 million mansion in Sussex for Goodman and their children, Goodman demanded \u00a3350,000 in \"child maintenance\" and \u00a331,200 for AstroTurf for her daughter to train as a football player.\n\nThe Mistress' Demands\n\nGoodman leveraged her demands with the threat of going public with the information that Walker had fathered their daughter. True to her word, she went public, leading to a scandal and subsequent court battle.\n\nSeveral bombshell revelations came to light in court, including Goodman contacting Kilner directly and requesting Walker's next-door neighbour to spy on him and Kilner to undermine their marriage. Goodman also attempted to move closer to Walker's family home and made a series of significant financial demands.\n\nThe judge criticised Goodman's character and intentions, stating, \"My assessment of the mother is that she was not reliable, often said what she thought would help her case rather than what was true, failed to make a calm and measured assessment of what she needed, and often exaggerated her need to spend money.\"\n\nFuture Uncertainties\n\nThe future remains uncertain for Walker and Kilner. If they proceed with a divorce, Walker's net worth could be reduced to \u00a313 million, with his wife and children receiving a fair share of his fortune. This ongoing drama adds another layer of complexity to Walker's career and personal life.\n\nWhile the football star continues to shine on the field, his off-field troubles underscore the challenges of balancing a high-profile career with personal responsibilities and the consequences of past actions. The situation is a stark reminder of the potential financial and emotional costs of personal indiscretions.", "source": {"uri": "ibtimes.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "International Business Times UK"}, "authors": [{"uri": "zoe_lodge@ibtimes.co.uk", "name": "Zoe Lodge", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [], "categories": [], "image": "https://d.ibtimes.co.uk/en/full/1726949/kyle-walker.png?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=a6a86fa181e451dac1bade183c279d52", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9776014", "eventUri": "eng-9776014", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2020-04-", "textStart": 461, "textEnd": 471}], "sentiment": -0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

Kyle's offer should have been accepted months ago and would therefore have eliminated the need for added stress to all involved.\n\n'In light of this judgment and the truths it makes public, my client and his family now ask that the media fully respects their rights to a private life as they navigate their next steps.'\n\nIn a statement to The Mirror, Goodman said of the proceedings: 'These have been difficult and stressful proceedings, which I had hoped would not be necessary. This has only ever been about the children and providing for their futures.\n\n'I am a dedicated single mother and whilst my children will never have what their half siblings have, I have tried my best for my children and always will, no matter what.\n\n'Thanks to my legal team and the judge's decision, my children's childhood is secure and I will now focus on building a solid future for them so as to provide for the time when the children's home reverts back to their father.

The influencer, 33, was dealt another blow, this time from inside her own family.\n\nA judge said Goodman saw the Manchester City star as an \"open-ended cheque book\". Her sister Chloe uploaded a gallery of snaps with her bridesmaids after she uninvited Lauryn from her own wedding, reports MirrorOnline.\n\nShe published the pictures moments after it was revealed Goodnman had been dragged back in court. Chloe wrote to her followers: \"The getting ready\ufe0f to become Mrs Hall 08/06/24.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Wolverhampton bus pervert who touched himself while filming women is jailed\n\nGet breaking news on BirminghamLive WhatsApp, click the link to join\n\nThe post sparked comments from fans asking \"where is she?\" with Goodman nowhere to be seen in the photos. One user responded by saying: \"Read the news, judge has basically summed her up as calculating and greedy, I'm guessing her behaviour has caused a family rift as it must be hard to stand by someone who's doing wrong so often.\"\n\nIt was recently suggested by Chloe that her decision to uninvite her sister stemmed from Goodman going public with her paternity news months prior to the wedding. It's thought she wanted to avoid it overshadowing her big day. \"The least Lauryn could have done is kept it quiet that Kyle was the dad of her second-born until after the wedding,\" she told MailOnline.\n\nThe former Celebrity Big Brother housemate said \"things were so messy\" when it was disclosed that her nephew Kairo had been fathered by Walker and she \"feared\" it would be the same again following the subsequent news. Chloe shared: \"So I said: 'Look I get married in June and I just don't want a whole frenzy at my wedding'.\"\n\nIn court, Judge Edward Hess criticised Goodman for lacking a \"good track record of telling the truth\" and described her as \"often difficult, unreasonable and demanding.\" He dismissed most of her financial claims following the birth of their second child Kinara, one, who was conceived without the knowledge of Walker's wife Annie Kilner.\n\nThe judge removed anonymity that typically shields family court cases. Goodman had hoped to keep the outcome under wraps. However, the judge pointed out that she couldn't plead for her children's privacy after attending the Euros with \"her son dressed in an England football shirt with the name 'Daddy' on the back, and to be willingly photographed.\"\n\nThe pair ended up in court as Walker resisted Goodman's financial demands following the birth of their daughter. These demands included a lump sum for air conditioning installation in her Sussex home costing \u00a333,000, a new \u00a370,000 car every four years, and the creation of an Astroturf football playing area in her Sussex home's garden at a cost of \u00a331,200. Demands the judge refused, saying she saw Walker as \"an open-ended cheque book\".\n\nIn response to the decision, Goodman said: \"This has only ever been about the children and providing for their futures. I am a dedicated single mother and while my children will never have what their half-siblings have, I have tried my best for my children and always will, no matter what.\n\n\"Thanks to my legal team and the judge's decision, my children's childhood is secure and I will now focus on building a solid future for them so as to provide for the time when the children's home reverts back to their father.

Their son Kairo, was born in 2021, and their daughter Kinara, was born in August 2023.\n\nIn a strongly worded ruling, Judge Hess accused Lauryn of dishonesty and described her behaviour as often difficult, unreasonable, and demanding. He rejected most of her financial requests, which she made after the birth of their second child, who was born while he was married to Annie Kilner.\n\nKilner ended the relationship with Walker and forced him to leave the family home after discovering he had fathered a second child with Goodman. The judge made the unusual decision to lift the confidentiality typically granted in family court cases.\n\nWhile Lauryn had sought to keep the matter private, the judge ruled that her public behaviour contradicted her desire for secrecy. The judge ruled that she had forfeited the right to privacy for her children after visiting the Euros with \"her son dressed in an England football shirt with the name ''Daddy'' on the back, and to be willingly photographed.\"\n\nThe 34-year-old Manchester City defender initially agreed to most of the woman's financial demands, including a \u00a32.4million home in Sussex, while attempting to conceal the child's paternity from his wife.\n\nThe Judge's Verdict: A Scathing Assessment\n\n\"It is clear from the evidence that he was understandably embarrassed about this fact and anxious about how his wife would react when she found out....honesty might have been a better policy,\" the judge said.\n\nThe judge added: \"When the mother texted the neighbour to say \"Ready to finish them\", she had in mind causing irreparable damage to the father's marriage.\" Lauryn, also mother to the footballer's four-year-old son Kairo, expressed feelings of \"disappointment, anguish, and anger\" after he prioritised his wife over her.\n\nTheir dispute over financial arrangements for their daughter led to a court battle, with the footballer resisting her demands. Her financial demands included a one-time payment of \u00a333,000 for air conditioning in her Sussex home, a new \u00a370,000 car every four years, and a \u00a331,200 astroturf football pitch in her Sussex garden.\n\nShe claimed that the \u00a331,200 artificial turf pitch was necessary because Kinara already showed interest in football by kicking a ball while crawling, suggesting she could become a future England footballer. She added that the women's national team, the Lionesses, was superior to the men's, the Lions.\n\nThe judge rejected the request for the artificial turf pitch, criticising the argument as unfounded, and denied the air conditioning request, suggesting using a less expensive electric fan to manage high temperatures.\n\nThe judge noted Lauryn's previous conviction for misappropriating \u00a321,000 in benefits fraud, contrasting her with Kyle, whom he described as a straightforward and thoughtful witness. The judge concluded that the mother was unreliable, often prioritising her desired outcome over truthfulness, and struggled to assess her actual needs, frequently exaggerating financial requirements.\n\nWalker, father to four sons with his wife Annie Kilner Walker, contested several of Goodman's financial claims or argued for reduced amounts, asserting that despite his annual income ranging from \u00a33 million to \u00a35 million, he was not an \"open chequebook.\"\n\nThe judge noted that Walker's perception of her treating him as an unlimited source of funds was accurate. Suppose Walker's wife believes he can effortlessly fulfil her extravagant demands, and even the judge agrees she views him as an unlimited financial resource. In that case, it raises the question: just how wealthy is Kyle Walker, and what is his total net worth?\n\nKyle Walker's Net Worth\n\nEngland defender Kyle Walker, a key player for Manchester City, undoubtedly enjoys a lavish lifestyle thanks to his lucrative football career. His substantial \u00a327 million net worth is a testament to his success on the pitch. This wealth is largely attributed to his hefty salary as a Premier League star.\n\nWalker's career trajectory skyrocketed when he transferred from Tottenham to Manchester City in 2017 for a substantial \u00a350 million fee. This high-profile move significantly boosted his earnings. In addition to his club salary, Walker has lucrative endorsement deals. Since 2012, he has maintained a partnership with Nike, promoting their football boots.\n\nInterestingly, another high-profile athlete, Wayne Rooney, also endorsed Nike's T90 Laser IV boots. However, Rooney faced significant financial challenges due to a tax evasion scandal involving a complex investment scheme.\n\nWalker's lavish lifestyle extends beyond his impressive net worth. He owns a stunning \u00a33.5 million, six-bedroom mansion in Cheshire with an indoor swimming pool.\n\nKyle Walker's Hefty Paycheck\n\nKyle Walker is one of the highest-paid full-backs in the world, earning a staggering \u00a3160,000 per week. This astronomical figure translates to a yearly income of \u00a38.32 million. To put this into perspective, the average Premier League footballer earns just over \u00a360,000 a week, significantly less than Walker's substantial salary.\n\nHowever, footballers who move to a lower division experience a significant pay cut. Championship wages average just over \u00a34K per week, totalling approximately \u00a3200K annually. Players in the bottom division earn around \u00a3750 per week.\n\nAs a footballer's star rises, so does their earning potential. Exceptional talent drives increased demand, allowing top players to command astronomical salaries. David de Gea of Manchester United exemplifies this trend, raking in approximately \u00a3350,000 per week.\n\nAccording to a report by The Sun, football salaries have increased by over 200 percent since 2000. This dramatic growth is a testament to the sport's global popularity and the immense wealth generated by the industry.", "source": {"uri": "ibtimes.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "International

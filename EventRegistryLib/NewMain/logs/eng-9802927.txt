Jerry Brown\n\nZo\u00eb Richards and Rebecca Shabad and Alex Seitz-Wald and Liz Kreutz\n\nAugust 9, 2024 at 5:27 AM\n\nFormer President Donald Trump on Thursday appeared to confuse former San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown with former California Gov. Jerry Brown in recounting what he characterized as a near-death experience.\n\nDuring a news conference from his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida, Trump said he once flew with Willie Brown in a helicopter that \"went down\" when he was asked about Vice President Kamala Harris' past relationship with the former mayor and whether he thought the relationship had played a role in her career path.\n\n\"In fact, I went down in a helicopter with him. We thought maybe this is the end. We were in a helicopter going to a certain location together, and there was an emergency landing. This was not a pleasant landing, and Willie was, he was a little concerned,\" Trump said. \"So I know him. I know him pretty well.\"\n\nIn an interview with the San Francisco Chronicle after the news conference, Willie Brown, who dated Harris years ago in San Francisco, denied multiple aspects of Trump's account.\n\n\"You would have known if I had gone down on a helicopter with Trump,\" he said, according to the newspaper. \"I've never been on a helicopter with Trump.\"\n\nIn 2018, Trump was in a helicopter with Jerry Brown and his successor, then Gov.-elect Gavin Newsom, on the day they toured Paradise, California, a town that had been ravaged by wildfires.\n\nA representative for Jerry Brown didn't immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday night. A spokesperson for Newsom confirmed to NBC News that Newsom was aboard the helicopter but said that there was no emergency landing and that they had not been endangered. The governor first denied Trump's account in comments to The New York Times.\n\nDuring Thursday's news conference, Trump also claimed that Willie Brown told him \"terrible things about\" Harris and that Brown was \"not a fan of hers very much at that point.\"\n\nBrown disputed having spoken poorly about Harris in remarks to the Chronicle.\n\n\"No, not accurate at all,\" he told the newspaper.\n\nWillie Brown didn't respond to requests for comment from NBC News.\n\nReached for comment by NBC News, Steven Cheung, a Trump campaign spokesperson, didn't address questions about whether Trump had confused the two California Democrats, responding, \"Slick Willie has told some interesting stories about Kamala Harris.\"", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Gavin Newsom, who also toured the wildfires in 2018 as governor-elect, said of Trump's account, \"I call complete B.S.,\" according to the Times.\n\n\"I was on a helicopter with Jerry Brown and Trump, and it didn't go down,\" Newsom told the Times, saying that Trump repeatedly brought up the possibility of crashing.\n\nRight-wing media figures have before denigrated Harris as a \"mistress\" for her previous relationship with Brown - despite it having occurred after Brown was separated from his wife and was not a secret - among other attacks.\n\nTrump during Thursday's news conference claimed Willie Brown was \"not a fan\" of Harris and that he had told him \"terrible things\" about her.\n\nAsked about those claims, Brown told CNN: \"No. Why would I?

His tale also included the convenient detail that Brown, former speaker of the California State Assembly, trash-talked his ex-girlfriend, Harris, some three decades after they stopped dating.\n\nNothing Trump said is true, according to an investigation by The New York Times.\n\nThe first problem: It was Jerry Brown, the former governor of California, and not Willie Brown on the helicopter.\n\nJerry Brown, who left office in 2019 looks nothing like Willie Brown, who served as mayor of San Francisco from 1996 to 2004; the former is white while the latter is Black.\n\nSpeaking to the Times, Willie Brown said there was no chance Trump was telling the truth: \"You know me well enough to know that if I almost went down in a helicopter with anybody, you would have heard about it!\"\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom said Trump appeared to mix up his politicians, while also lying about what happened on the helicopter.\n\n\"I call complete B.S.,\" Newsom said. \"I was on a helicopter with Jerry Brown and Trump, and it didn't go down.\"\n\nNewsom said he rode with Trump in a helicopter when the former president came to California to look at damage from the 2018 Camp Fire. He confirmed, contra Trump, that there was never an emergency landing nor any risk of a crash.\n\nHe also confirmed that there was never an emergency landing although, the former president did repeatedly bring up the possibility of crashing.\n\nJerry Brown also denied the story through a spokesperson: \"There was no emergency landing and no discussion of Kamala Harris.\"\n\nTrump told the false story during a rambling and at times incoherent press conference.

Please try again later{{ /verifyErrors }}\n\nDonald Trump has claimed that Willie Brown, the former San Francisco mayor and ex-partner of Kamala Harris, told him some \"terrible things\" about her during a near-death experience on a helicopter ride.\n\nNow, the former has spoken out to reveal that every part of the story is \"fiction\".\n\nAccording to Brown, there were no critical comments about Harris, no near-fatal crash - and, in fact, no helicopter ride whatsover.\n\nDuring his lie-filled press conference at Mar-a-Lago on Thursday afternoon - his first public briefing since Harris picked Tim Walz to join her on the Democratic ticket - the former president recounted what now appears to be a tall tale about a helicopter ride he claims he once took with Brown.\n\nIn the rambling story, Trump claimed that he and 90-year-old Brown - who briefly dated Harris in the mid-1990s - thought the helicopter was going to crash and were forced to make an emergency landing.\n\n\"Well, I know Willie Brown very well. In fact, I went down in a helicopter with him. We thought, maybe this is the end,\" Trump said.\n\n\"We were in a helicopter going to a certain location together, and there was an emergency landing.\"\n\nDespite fearing they were near death, the Republican presidential nominee claimed that Brown took that moment to slander his former lover.\n\n\"This was not a pleasant landing, and Willie, he was - he was a little concerned. So I know him pretty well. I mean, I haven't seen him in years. But he told me terrible things about [Kamala Harris],\" Trump continued.\n\nNot long after Trump had finished speaking, Brown rubbished every single aspect of his story from the helicopter ride together to him criticizing Harris.\n\n\"I've never done business with Donald Trump, let's start with that,\" Brown told KRON4.\n\n\"And secondly, I don't think I'd want to ride on the same helicopter with him,\" he added.\n\n\"I could not envision thinking of Kamala Harris in any negative way.

Didn't happen, Willie Brown says", "body": "WASHINGTON (AP) -- Former President Donald Trump mixed up two prominent politicians from California when he told a harrowing tale of almost crashing in a helicopter.\n\nDuring a meandering press conference Thursday riddled with false and misleading statements, Trump recalled riding as a passenger in the chopper with former San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown when it was forced to make an emergency landing. The comments were in response to a question about a relationship between Brown and Vice President Kamala Harris three decades ago.\n\nBut Brown has never shared a helicopter with Trump, the former mayor said. Instead, it was former California Gov. Jerry Brown who rode with Trump in a helicopter in 2018 to survey wildfire damage, and no emergency landing was reported.\n\n\"I know Willie Brown very well,\" Mr. Trump said about the alleged incident. \"In fact, I went down in a helicopter with him. We thought maybe this was the end.\"\n\nHe went on: \"We were in a helicopter, going to a certain location together, and there was an emergency landing. This was not a pleasant landing.\"\n\nTrump said Brown also told him \"terrible things\" about Harris. \"He was not a fan of hers very much, at that point.\"\n\nBut Brown told the San Francisco Chronicle that he's never been in a helicopter with Trump.\n\n\"You would have known if I had gone down on a helicopter with Trump,\" Brown told the paper.\n\nThe longtime Democratic politician said he has never disparaged Harris to Trump, either.\n\n\"Hell, no,\" Brown said. \"I wouldn't say anything bad about any woman to him.\"\n\nFormer California Gov. Jerry Brown, a Democrat, and Trump did ride in a helicopter to survey wildfire damage in 2018. But no problems with the flight were reported.\n\nCurrent Gov. Gavin Newsom was also on the aircraft. A spokesperson for the Democrat, Izzy Gardon, said Friday there was no problem with the flight, no emergency landing, and no conversation about Harris.\n\nThe two Browns each have public-sector careers spanning decades in California. Willie Brown, 90, is Black. Jerry Brown, 86, is white.\n\nWillie Brown's long-ago relationship with Harris has resurfaced since she became the Democratic nominee for the White House. Now that Trump faces her in his bid for a second term, he and other Republicans have used the relationship to lob attacks suggesting Harris didn't earn her political positions legitimately.\n\nBrown was serving as speaker of the California State Assembly in the 1990s when he and Harris were in a relationship. Brown had separated from his wife in 1982.\n\nHarris, 59, spent years as a prosecutor in the Bay Area before her elevation as the state's attorney general in 2010 and then election as U.S. senator in 2016. She has been married to Doug Emhoff since 2014.\n\nTrump campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt declined to explain the discrepancies in Trump's story when asked about it Friday on Newsmax.\n\n\"I would just refer you to President Trump's statement and what he said yesterday,\" Leavitt said. \"The president has a lot of amazing stories from his life.\"", "source": {"uri": "ktar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KTAR News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@ktar.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willie_Brown_(politician)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Willie Brown (politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jerry Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicopter", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Helicopter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor_of_San_Francisco", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mayor of San Francisco"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildfire", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wildfire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Chronicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco Chronicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politician", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_Emhoff", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Doug Emhoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavin_Newsom", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gavin Newsom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_State_Assembly", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "California State Assembly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Bay_Area", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco Bay Area"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "District attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Anomalies_and_Alternative_Science/Earth_Lights", "label": "dmoz/Science/Anomalies and Alternative Science/Earth Lights", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Biography", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Biography", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cycling/Tandem", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cycling/Tandem", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://ktar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2019.12-KTAR-Listen-Live-Twitter_Facebook-Image.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9802927", "eventUri": "eng-9802927", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1686274509803921, "wgt": 218, "relevance": 1}

Didn't happen. - The Boston Globe", "body": "It wasn't the famous former San Francisco mayor on the helicopter flight at all. It was Gov. Jerry Brown, the former governor of California, who bears little resemblance to Willie Brown.\n\nThere was also no emergency landing, and the helicopter's passengers were never in any danger at all, according to Gov. Gavin Newsom, who was also on the flight.\n\nJerry Brown, who left office in January 2019, said through a spokesperson, \"There was no emergency landing and no discussion of Kamala Harris.\"\n\n\"I call complete BS,\" Newsom said, laughing out loud.\n\nTrump's errant account, delivered during a news conference at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida, came in response to a reporter who asked a leading question about Harris' past relationship with Willie Brown, and whether Trump thought it might have had something to do with her career trajectory.\n\nHarris and Brown dated in 1994 and 1995, while she was a prosecutor in Alameda County, which includes Oakland, and he was the speaker of the California State Assembly, and he appointed her to two state boards. He was -- and still is -- married to Blanche Brown, but they have long lived separate lives.\n\n\"Well, I know Willie Brown very well,\" Trump responded. \"In fact, I went down in a helicopter with him.\"\n\nHe went on to tell a cinematic tale of a close call with death -- and of politically advantageous gossip on death's door.\n\n\"We thought maybe this was the end,\" Trump said. \"We were in a helicopter, going to a certain location together, and there was an emergency landing.

But he -- he, I don't know, maybe he's changed his tune. But he -- he was not a fan of hers very much, at that point.\"\n\nReached on his cellphone just after Trump's news conference -- at his regular lunch spot at Sam's Grill in downtown San Francisco -- Willie Brown, 90, said the whole story was false. He had never ridden in a helicopter with Trump, he said. He had never nearly perished in any helicopter ride. And he remained an avid supporter of Harris'.\n\nBrown, who loves regaling anybody who will listen with stories and who penned a weekly column in the San Francisco Chronicle until 2021, added, laughing: \"You know me well enough to know that if I almost went down in a helicopter with anybody, you would have heard about it!\"\n\nHarris ended their relationship nearly three decades ago, but Brown said he had always been a big fan and supporter of hers. \"No hard feelings,\" he said.\n\nThe helicopter ride that Trump took in 2018 with Gov. Jerry Brown and with Newsom, then the governor-elect of California, was to survey damage wrought by the deadly Camp fire in the town of Paradise, in the Sierra Nevada foothills north of Sacramento.\n\nNewsom's recollection of the occasion was vivid.\n\n\"I was on a helicopter with Jerry Brown and Trump, and it didn't go down,\" Newsom said in an interview. He said Trump had, however, repeatedly brought up the possibility of crashing.\n\nThe subject of Harris, with whom Newsom had enjoyed a friendly rivalry, did not come up on the plane ride, he added. \"We talked about everyone else, but not Kamala,\" he said with a laugh.\n\nNewsom called Trump's news conference \"an act of desperation\" prompted by what he called Harris' momentum.\n\nTrump's visit to the burned forest with Brown and Newsom did generate headlines, but not because of anything that occurred on their helicopter ride. Rather, it was because, during a news conference after landing at the scene, Trump attributed the wildfire to too many fallen, dead tree branches and said the answer to solving California's wildfire crisis was to rake the forest floors.", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willie_Brown_(politician)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Willie Brown (politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavin_Newsom", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gavin Newsom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jerry Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicopter", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Helicopter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar-a-Lago", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mar-a-Lago"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor_of_San_Francisco", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mayor of San Francisco"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor_of_Science", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bachelor of Science"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_California", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor of California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oakland,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oakland, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oakland, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alameda_County,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alameda County, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alameda County, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_State_Assembly", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "California State Assembly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_District,_San_Francisco", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Financial District, San Francisco"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Financial District, San Francisco"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_Nevada", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sierra Nevada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Chronicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco Chronicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildfire", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wildfire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacramento,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sacramento, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sacramento, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://bostonglobe-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/BYjzKbUQFEI7Kk7IFPmKNGWcJ2E=/506x0/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bostonglobe/TYKRTZHKUYI6RN56IRA3KB564U.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9802927", "eventUri": "eng-9802927", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2019-01-", "textStart": 383, "textEnd": 395}], "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 213, "relevance": 1}

It contained such highlights as Trump claiming he had a larger crowd at his inauguration than Martin Luther King, Jr. had at his famed 1963 \"I have a dream\" speech in Washington, DC.\n\nBut Trump also invoked former S.F.

Didn't happen. - Times of India", "body": "Former President Donald Trump told a jaw-dropping story Thursday about nearly dying in a helicopter ride with Willie Brown, the former California politician and ex-boyfriend of his rival, Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nThere was only one problem with the story. Or maybe two. Or maybe three.\n\nIt wasn't the famous former San Francisco mayor on the helicopter flight at all.It was Gov. Jerry Brown, the former governor of California, who bears little resemblance to Willie Brown.\n\nThere was also no emergency landing, and the helicopter's passengers were never in any danger at all, according to Gov. Gavin Newsom, who was also on the flight.\n\nJerry Brown, who left office in January 2019, said through a spokesperson, \"There was no emergency landing and no discussion of Kamala Harris.\"\n\n\"I call complete BS,\" Newsom said, laughing out loud.\n\nTrump's errant account, delivered during a news conference at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida, came in response to a reporter who asked a leading question about Harris' past relationship with Willie Brown, and whether Trump thought it might have had something to do with her career trajectory.\n\nHarris and Brown dated in 1994 and 1995, while she was a prosecutor in Alameda County, which includes Oakland, and he was the speaker of the California State Assembly, and he appointed her to two state boards. He was -- and still is -- married to Blanche Brown, but they have long lived separate lives.\n\n\"Well, I know Willie Brown very well,\" Trump responded. \"In fact, I went down in a helicopter with him.\"\n\nHe went on to tell a cinematic tale of a close call with death -- and of politically advantageous gossip on death's door.\n\n\"We thought maybe this was the end,\" Trump said. \"We were in a helicopter, going to a certain location together, and there was an emergency landing. This was not a pleasant landing.\n\n\"And Willie was -- he was a little concerned. So I know him, but I know him pretty well. I mean, I haven't seen him in years. But he told me terrible things about her. But this is what you're telling me, anyway, I guess. But he had a big part in what happened with Kamala. But he -- he, I don't know, maybe he's changed his tune. But he -- he was not a fan of hers very much, at that point.\"\n\nReached on his cellphone just after Trump's news conference -- at his regular lunch spot at Sam's Grill in downtown San Francisco -- Willie Brown, 90, said the whole story was false. He had never ridden in a helicopter with Trump, he said. He had never nearly perished in any helicopter ride. And he remained an avid supporter of Harris'.\n\nBrown, who loves regaling anybody who will listen with stories and who penned a weekly column in the San Francisco Chronicle until 2021, added, laughing: \"You know me well enough to know that if I almost went down in a helicopter with anybody, you would have heard about it!\"\n\nHarris ended their relationship nearly three decades ago, but Brown said he had always been a big fan and supporter of hers. \"No hard feelings,\" he said.\n\nThe helicopter ride that Trump took in 2018 with Gov. Jerry Brown and with Newsom, then the governor-elect of California, was to survey damage wrought by the deadly Camp fire in the town of Paradise, in the Sierra Nevada foothills north of Sacramento.\n\nNewsom's recollection of the occasion was vivid.\n\n\"I was on a helicopter with Jerry Brown and Trump, and it didn't go down,\" Newsom said in an interview. He said Trump had, however, repeatedly brought up the possibility of crashing.\n\nThe subject of Harris, with whom Newsom had enjoyed a friendly rivalry, did not come up on the plane ride, he added. \"We talked about everyone else, but not Kamala,\" he said with a laugh.\n\nNewsom called Trump's news conference \"an act of desperation\" prompted by what he called Harris' momentum.\n\nTrump's visit to the burned forest with Brown and Newsom did generate headlines, but not because of anything that occurred on their helicopter ride. Rather, it was because, during a news conference after landing at the scene, Trump attributed the wildfire to too many fallen, dead tree branches and said the answer to solving California's wildfire crisis was to rake the forest floors.\n\n\"It was back when we were making raking the forest great again,\" Newsom said.", "source": {"uri": "timesofindia.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Helicopter Crash With Kamala Harris' Ex-Boyfriend", "body": "Donald Trump is coping with last month's assassination attempt by fabricating other near-death experiences to reflect on. The failed airline mogul and Republican presidential nominee told the press on Thursday that he was nearly killed in a helicopter crash alongside Willie Brown, former San Francisco mayor and ex-boyfriend of Trump's opponent Kamala Harris. However, Trump has never even flown on a helicopter with Willie Brown.\n\nDuring a press conference at Mar-a-Lago, Trump was asked a leading question on whether Harris' two-year relationship with Brown in the mid-1990s helped her career. It would be understandable to assume he'd simply answer yes, but he decided to swerve into a \"woe-is-me\" anecdote where he thought he was going to die. The New York Times reported:\n\n\"Well, I know Willie Brown very well,\" Mr. Trump responded. \"In fact, I went down in a helicopter with him.\"\n\nHe went on to tell a cinematic tale of a close call with death -- and of politically advantageous gossip on death's door:\n\n\"We thought maybe this was the end,\" Mr. Trump said. \"We were in a helicopter, going to a certain location together, and there was an emergency landing. This was not a pleasant landing.\n\n\"And Willie was -- he was a little concerned,\" Mr. Trump continued. \"So I know him, but I know him pretty well. I mean, I haven't seen him in years. But he told me terrible things about her. But this is what you're telling me, anyway, I guess. But he had a big part in what happened with Kamala. But he -- he, I don't know, maybe he's changed his tune. But he -- he was not a fan of hers very much, at that point.\"\n\nThe former president seemingly conflated Willie Brown with former California governor Jerry Brown as if he had the current president's cognitive ability. In 2018, Trump rode on a helicopter with Governor Brown to survey the Camp Fire's damage.

Because during a press conference Thursday, Trump told a story about having nearly died in a helicopter ride with Brown.\n\nThe story itself matters because it also included the claim that Brown had dished out a bunch of dirt about his former lover, current Vice President Kamala Harris, during the helicopter ride.\n\nListen to Trump below:\n\n\"I know Willie Brown very well -- in fact, I went down in a helicopter with him,\" Trump said Thursday. \"We thought maybe this was the end. We were in a helicopter, going to a certain location together, and there was an emergency landing. This was not a pleasant landing.\"\n\n'\"And Willie was -- he was a little concerned. So I know him, but I know him pretty well. I mean, I haven't seen him in years. But he told me terrible things about [Kamala]. But this is what you're telling me, anyway, I guess. But he had a big part in what happened with Kamala. But he -- he, I don't know, maybe he's changed his tune. But he -- he was not a fan of hers very much, at that point.\"\n\nBut speaking with Bay Area station KRON after Trump's press conference, Brown claimed it was all fiction.\n\n\"I've never done business with Donald Trump, let's start with that,\" he said. \"And secondly, I don't think I'd want to ride on the same helicopter with him. There's too many people that have an agenda with reference to him, including the people who service helicopters!\"\n\n\"He was doing what Donald does best, his creative fiction,\" Brown added.\n\nBrown also disputed the claim that he'd trash-talked Harris.\n\n\"I could not envision thinking of Kamala Harris in any negative way,\" he said. \"She's a good friend a long time ago, absolutely beautiful woman, smart as all hell, very successful, electorally speaking.\"\n\n\"I was a part of every campaign that she's ever been involved in, supported her religiously and will still do so, and I am just looking forward for the next 89 days. I just can't wait to get in as president,\" he added.\n\nSo who's to be believed? The corporate propaganda press has already decided that Brown's the truth-teller here.\n\nThe New York Times: \"That Time Trump Nearly Died in a Helicopter Crash? Didn't Happen.\"\n\nCNN: \"Trump said he 'went down' in helicopter 'emergency landing' with former San Francisco mayor, who says it never happened\"\n\nThe Independent: \"Trump claims Willie Brown told him 'terrible things' about Harris on a near-fatal helicopter ride.

Former S.F. mayor says it never happened\"\n\nCritics meanwhile have uncovered evidence that seems to contradict Brown's claim of having \"never done business with\" Trump.\n\nCase in point:\n\nAs previously reported, Brown and Harris had an affair back in the 1990s. During the affair, Brown, who was 30 years her senior, reportedly rewarded her with two lucrative appointments within the city government.\n\nThis bombshell first came up after Harris announced her candidacy for president in 2019. A week after the announcement, Brown published an op-ed to the San Francisco Chronicle revealing the affair.\n\n\"Yes, we dated. It was more than 20 years ago. Yes, I may have influenced her career by appointing her to two state commissions when I was Assembly speaker. And I certainly helped with her first race for district attorney in San Francisco,\" he admitted.\n\nBrown then accused Harris of having threatened him with indictment after she rose to the top and became the city's district attorney:\n\nWe have no tolerance for comments containing violence, racism, profanity, vulgarity, doxing, or discourteous behavior.

He was - and still is - married to Blanche Brown, but they have long lived separate lives.\n\n\"Well, I know Willie Brown very well,\" Trump responded. \"In fact, I went down in a helicopter with him.\"\n\nHe went on to tell a cinematic tale of a close call with death - and of politically advantageous gossip on death's door.\n\n\"We thought maybe this was the end,\" Trump said. \"We were in a helicopter, going to a certain location together, and there was an emergency landing.

But he -- he was not a fan of hers very much, at that point.\"\n\nReached on his cellphone just after Trump's news conference -- at his regular lunch spot at Sam's Grill in downtown San Francisco -- Willie Brown, 90, said the whole story was false. He had never ridden in a helicopter with Trump, he said. He had never nearly perished in any helicopter ride. And he remained an avid supporter of Harris'.\n\nBrown, who loves regaling anybody who will listen with stories and who penned a weekly column in the San Francisco Chronicle until 2021, added, laughing: \"You know me well enough to know that if I almost went down in a helicopter with anybody, you would have heard about it!\"\n\nHarris ended their relationship nearly three decades ago, but Brown said he had always been a big fan and supporter of hers. \"No hard feelings,\" he said.\n\nThe helicopter ride that Trump took in 2018 with Governor Jerry Brown and with Newsom, then the governor-elect of California, was to survey damage wrought by the deadly Camp fire in the town of Paradise, in the Sierra Nevada foothills north of Sacramento.\n\nNewsom's recollection of the occasion was vivid.\n\n\"I was on a helicopter with Jerry Brown and Trump, and it didn't go down,\" Newsom said in an interview. He said Trump had, however, repeatedly brought up the possibility of crashing.\n\nThe subject of Harris, with whom Newsom had enjoyed a friendly rivalry, did not come up on the plane ride, he added. \"We talked about everyone else, but not Kamala,\" he said with a laugh.\n\nNewsom called Trump's news conference \"an act of desperation\" prompted by what he called Harris' momentum.\n\nTrump's visit to the burned forest with Brown and Newsom did generate headlines, but not because of anything that occurred on their helicopter ride. Rather, it was because, during a news conference after landing at the scene, Trump attributed the wildfire to too many fallen, dead tree branches and said the answer to solving California's wildfire crisis was to rake the forest floors.\n\n\"It was back when we were making raking the forest great again,\" Newsom said.", "source": {"uri": "nzherald.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "NZ

While she was in Boston with Brown, the speaker received a call from Trump, then a billionaire real estate developer, who wanted to discuss a potential hotel in Los Angeles.\n\nTrump sent his jet to Boston, and with Harris in tow, Brown flew to New York City aboard the jet, which had \"notes left for Trump by his then-wife, Marla Maples\" inside, according to the book. Brown wrote in 2013 that the plane included a \"bedroom filled with paintings you would usually find in a museum.\"\n\nBrown told Politico in a recent interview that Harris did not join his meeting with Trump, but that Brown and Harris took a photo on Trump's plane.\n\n\"I have the picture,\" Brown told the outlet. Trump would later donate $5,000 to Harris' 2011 campaign for California Attorney General.\n\nRepresentatives for Trump, Harris, and Brown did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment.\n\nThe story came to light again after Trump claimed at a press conference Thursday that Brown told him \"terrible things about her\" and that he was once caught in an emergency landing on board a helicopter with Brown.\n\nBrown denied both of those claims in an interview with the San Francisco Chronicle Thursday, saying he \"wouldn't say anything bad about any woman\" to Trump and that he never flew in a helicopter with the former president.\n\nTrump may have confused Willie Brown for former Gov.

Harris and Brown dated more than 25 years ago, which has been highlighted by opponents suggesting she improperly benefited from his influence on her career (he appointed her to two state boards) -- a claim Brown has rejected and that has been criticized as sexist.\n\nWhen asked about the vice president, Brown told KRON4 he \"could not envision thinking of Kamala Harris in any negative way\" and that she was a good friend.\"\n\nWell, I guess tha clears that up, Willie wouldn't be caught alive or dead with Trump in a chopper and would not bad mouth an ex-squeeze - gentleman that he is.\n\nSan Francisco bureau chief for the New York Times Heather Knight fills in the rest of this fabulous flight of farcical fantasy...

At a press conference held at his Mar-a-Lago residence in Palm Beach, Florida, Trump addressed the question of Harris' previous relationship with Brown by mentioning an incident involving a chopper that 'went down'.\n\nAs reported by RawStory, the former president revealed, \"I went down in a helicopter with him. We thought maybe this was the end. We were in a helicopter going to a certain location together, and there was an emergency landing. This was not a pleasant landing. And Willie was -- he was a little concerned. So I know him, but I know him pretty well. I mean, I haven't seen him in years. But he told me terrible things about her.

In a phone call with CNN, he mentioned, \"He is trying his best to get some way to degrade Kamala. There is no reason why her name ought to be mentioned anywhere near his lies, period.\" Later on Thursday, the New York Times article also claimed that the former president reportedly mixed up Willie Brown with Jerry Brown, the former governor of California, with whom he toured the devastation from wildfires in November 2018 by helicopter.\n\nHarris and Brown's relationship history began in the 90s and they reportedly dated from 1994 to 1995. Furthermore, People magazine stated in 1996 that Brown had been 'estranged from his wife' Blanche Brown since 1981, therefore Brown was married when he dated Harris, and their connection was public knowledge. In 2019 Brown went so far as to write to the San Francisco Chronicle, acknowledging that he had appointed Harris to positions that benefited her career, and addressing their previous connection. He told the outlet, \"Yes, we dated. It was more than 20 years ago.\" He revealed at the time that he had been bombarded with calls from national media outlets on his 'relationship' with Kamala Harris, especially when it became clear that she would be running for the office.\n\nAccording to another 1994 article in the Los Angeles Times, Harris was portrayed as Brown's frequent companion and by others as Brown's girlfriend. In addition, Herb Caen's editorial for the SFGate was mentioned in that piece, referring to Harris as 'the Speaker's new steady.' Harris at the time was only 29 years old and Brown was 60. Caen claimed that the pair broke up in 1995, which 'flabbergasted' those who thought Harris was the ideal complement to the mayor-elect's vivacious personality.", "source": {"uri": "inquisitr.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Inquisitr"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willie_Brown_(politician)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Willie Brown (politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jerry Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicopter", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Helicopter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar-a-Lago", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mar-a-Lago"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_Beach,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palm Beach, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Palm Beach, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_California", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Governor of California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herb_Caen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Herb Caen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Chronicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco Chronicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Times"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cycling/Tandem", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cycling/Tandem", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://dab57h0r8ahff.cloudfront.net/709829/uploads/693eefa0-561c-11ef-9770-85d32df5f2db_1200_630.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9802927", "eventUri": "eng-9802927", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2018-11-", "textStart": 1662, "textEnd": 1675}], "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

Tim Walz's campaign rally in Wisconsin's High Country\n\n\"Well, well, you're going to have to ask her that question, because she's the one who said it. I didn't say it,\" Trump began. \"So you're going to have to ask her. And I appreciate the question very much. But you're going to have to ask her.\"\n\nHe then continued to press the issue, recounting the $6,000 he had personally donated to her when she was California's attorney general.\n\n\"But I've known her for a long time. I actually contributed to her campaign a long time ago, because I was a developer.\n\n\"I've worked on many Democratic and Republican campaigns, some liberal and some conservative,\" Trump said, before ramping up his criticism of his opponent.", "source": {"uri": "nybreaking.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NY Breaking News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jerry Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicopter", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Helicopter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Press conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar-a-Lago", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mar-a-Lago"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor_of_San_Francisco", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mayor of San Francisco"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willie_Brown_(politician)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Willie Brown (politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attorney_General_of_California", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Attorney General of California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Howard University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historically_black_colleges_and_universities", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Historically black colleges and universities"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_liberalism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Modern liberalism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://nybreaking.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Ex-San-Francisco-mayor-Willie-Brown-responds-to-Trumps-claim-they.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9802927", "eventUri": "eng-9802927", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

Story Explained", "body": "Many are intrigued by Donald Trump's recent helicopter crash account, which has stirred significant attention and curiosity. The tale, involving a near-death experience with former San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown, Kamala Harris' ex-boyfriend, has sparked widespread speculation. People are eager to understand the details and the truth behind this dramatic account.\n\nSo, what exactly happened in Trump's helicopter crash story, and how does it connect to other events? Here's everything you need to know.\n\nDonald Trump helicopter crash story explained\n\nDuring a recent press conference at Mar-a-Lago, former President Donald Trump recounted a dramatic near-death experience. He claimed it occurred during a helicopter ride with Willie Brown, the former San Francisco Mayor and Kamala Harris' ex-boyfriend.\n\nTrump described the event as a tense moment where they both feared for their lives, believing they might not survive as the helicopter made an emergency landing. He shared this story while discussing Brown's relationship with Harris and its potential influence on her career. While recalling his closeness with Brown at the time, Trump revealed the former San Francisco Mayor was \"not a fan of hers\" then.\n\nHowever, Trump's recollection seems to blend elements from different events. The helicopter ride he mentioned could be based on a 2018 flight he took with former California Governor Jerry Brown and Governor Gavin Newsom. (via New York Times)\n\nDuring that flight, they surveyed areas devastated by the Camp Fire. However, that flight was uneventful, with no emergency landing or danger involved, Brown's spokesperson revealed. This supposed blending of memories creates a vivid narrative.\n\nTrump's retelling also recalls the tragic helicopter crash from October 1989, as reported by the LA Times on October 11. That crash killed three of his top casino executives: Stephen Hyde, Mark Grossinger Etess, and Jonathan Benanav.\n\nThe executives were returning from a promotional event in New York. Their helicopter crashed in New Jersey, killing everyone on board. Donald Trump, deeply affected by the loss, expressed his sorrow for the young men.\n\nTrump described the executives as \"three fabulous young men in the prime of their lives.\" He also claimed in a 1990 interview that he \"almost went down with them\" but wasn't on the helicopter due to being too busy. (via Newsweek)\n\nHowever, Bernie Dillon, vice president of Trump Sports and Entertainment, and Barbara Res, a former Trump Organization employee, have disputed this, calling Trump's claims a \"total, total lie.\"\n\nIs the Donald Trump helicopter story true?\n\nThe truth behind Donald Trump's helicopter crash account is challenging to verify. It seems to mix elements from various events. Trump described a near-death experience with Willie Brown, Kamala Harris' ex-boyfriend. However, it appears no concrete evidence supports this version. Other accounts involve different people and circumstances. Various accounts offer differing details, leaving the actual events uncertain.\n\nThis mix of past experiences, both personal and professional, weaves a complex tapestry in Trump's storytelling, seemingly putting the veracity of this story in question.", "source": {"uri": "comingsoon.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "ComingSoon.net"}, "authors": [{"uri": "anubhav_chaudhry@comingsoon.net", "name": "Anubhav Chaudhry", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor_of_San_Francisco", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mayor of San Francisco"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicopter", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Helicopter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willie_Brown_(politician)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Willie Brown (politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar-a-Lago", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mar-a-Lago"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jerry Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavin_Newsom", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gavin Newsom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_California", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Governor of California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Trump_Organization", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Trump Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newsweek", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Newsweek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casino", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Casino"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Fiction", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Fiction", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Accounting/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Accounting/Associations", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Stories", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Stories", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Near_Death_Experiences", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Near Death Experiences", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://www.comingsoon.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/08/Donald-Trump-Helicopter-Crash.jpg?resize=1200,630", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9802927", "eventUri": "eng-9802927", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-11", "textStart": 1813, "textEnd": 1823}], "sentiment": -0.1686274509803921, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

Please try again later.\n\nDonald Trump received effusive praise from allies and sympathizers alike for his willingness to hold an off-the-cuff news conference Thursday in a different part of his house. Here's a guy who can simply invite in reporters and answer questions for an hour without preparation; why can't Vice President Kamala Harris do the same?\n\nOne reason, of course, is that Trump is not now and has not ever been terribly worried about the product of his riffing. Sure, he almost invariably gets himself into trouble by disgorging false claims or toxic disparagements, but it's easy enough to bury those with more disgorgement. It is the way; it has always been the way.\n\nSkip to end of carousel\n\nSign up for the How to Read This Chart newsletter\n\nSubscribe to How to Read This Chart, a weekly dive into the data behind the news. Each Saturday, national columnist Philip Bump makes and breaks down charts explaining the latest in economics, pop culture, politics and more.\n\nEnd of carousel\n\nBut this habit now unfolds in an environment where, thanks in part to Trump's own energetic efforts, Americans are attuned to signs of mental decline or confusion. A story about, say, a near-deadly helicopter ride with a famous California politician -- as Trump presented on Thursday -- isn't as easily dismissed as it might have been. Is this Trump making stuff up? Or is this Trump confusing different parts of different stories? Trump has a cover that President Joe Biden never did: that history of bizarre disgorgements.\n\nThe helicopter story was certainly bizarre. This is what Trump said, verbatim:\n\n\"I know Willie Brown very well. In fact, I went down in a helicopter with him. We thought maybe this is the end. We were in a helicopter, going to a certain location together and there was an emergency landing. This was not a pleasant landing. And Willie was -- he was a little concerned. So I know -- I know him pretty well. I mean, I haven't seen him in years. But he told me terrible things about her.\"\n\nThe \"her\" being referenced is Harris, with whom Brown, the former speaker of California's state assembly, was once romantically involved. We'll come back to that.\n\nThis story has many of the trademarks of a Trump invention. The \"know him well\" after a brief encounter, just as he once said that he got to know Russian President Vladimir Putin very well because ... they were both featured in segments on the same episode of \"60 Minutes.\" Then there's the emotional exaggeration. No burly men crying on Trump's shoulder here but, instead, a brush with death, the sort of thing that might engender a strong sympathetic response from the listener.\n\nExcept that there's no evidence it's true. Multiple news outlets have tried to figure out what Trump was talking about, since no one had ever heard this story before. Brown told the San Francisco Chronicle he'd never been on a helicopter with Trump and told a local television station that the story was \"fictional.\" This tracks -- an almost-crash of a helicopter carrying both Brown and Trump would have made the news. When Brown was in a helicopter that had a rough landing in 2004, sans Trump, it earned media coverage.\n\nMaybe Trump was thinking of former California governor Jerry Brown, the New York Times speculated, though the two Browns share some striking dissimilarities in appearance. Trump did ride in a helicopter with the former governor, though it didn't almost crash. Or maybe Trump was thinking of a time Brown rode on his plane, as Politico reported? Or maybe he was simply adding exotic new details to an old story he once told about how he almost boarded a helicopter that did crash, killing several Trump Organization executives. (He didn't almost board it.)\n\nOne element of this story that's worth noting is how, in broad strokes, it mirrors the story that led to the demotion of former NBC anchor Brian Williams -- a demotion that Trump energetically celebrated.\n\nAs you may recall, Williams had claimed that while in Iraq during the war he was riding in a helicopter that had been forced to land after being struck by a rocket-propelled grenade. That didn't happen, though the helicopter may have come under fire from small arms and was forced to land due to a incoming sandstorm. NBC pulled him from its flagship nightly news broadcast in early 2015 and suspended him for six months.\n\nWhen word of the suspension came down, Trump confidently predicted first that NBC host Chuck Todd would replace Williams and, 15 minutes later, that Rosie O'Donnell would. A few months later, Trump announced his presidential candidacy. NBC, which had partnered with Trump on \"The Apprentice,\" severed its relationship following the comments he made about immigrants during his campaign launch.\n\nWilliams eventually returned to the air, hosting a late-night news show on MSNBC. The program was often critical of Trump during his presidency, prompting the then-president to repeatedly target Williams -- and to highlight the story about the Iraq War helicopter.\n\n\"Lyin' Brian Williams of MSDNC, a Concast Scam Company, wouldn't know the truth if it was nailed to his wooden forehead,\" Trump wrote on social media in early 2020. \"Remember when he lied about his bravery in a helicopter? Totally made up story. He's a true dummy who was thrown off Network News like a dog.\"\n\nThat same day, he posted a video of news coverage of the Williams scandal.\n\nIt has long been the case that Trump is immune to hypocrisy. But the similarity here is striking: Williams lied about a brush with death in a helicopter? He made up a story for effect? Heaven forfend.\n\nBut now we circle back to the reason Trump told the story: to imply that he was close with Willie Brown and, therefore, that Trump could be trusted when he says that Brown offered disparaging comments about Harris. The two survived a brush with death! No wonder they opened up about their past relationships.\n\nWilliams was demoted by NBC News because his story eroded the audience's confidence in his presentations. His was a position of influence and authority, and his exaggeration put that authority and the network's authority at risk. Trump understood and amplified this.\n\nSo what about his helicopter story?", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The only time he's not lying is when he's babbling nonsensically with non sequiturs after he's asked a direct question. At this point, we're convinced that even if someone asked him how old he is, he would still find a way to lie. It's so bad that when asked at restaurants if he has any allergies, he should reply \"the truth\".\n\nAccording to LA Times, former San Francisco mayor Willie Brown is calling the orange man out on his lies. The nearly-assassinated Trump held an hour-long pillow soft press conference at Mar-a-Lago yesterday where he mentioned that he and Brown almost crashed in a helicopter and that Brown had slandered Vice President Kamala Harris during their personal conversations.\n\n\"We were in a helicopter going to a certain location together, and there was an emergency landing,\" he said. \"This was not a pleasant landing, and Willie, he was -- he was a little concerned. So I know him pretty well. I mean, I haven't seen him in years. But he told me terrible things about [Kamala Harris].\"\n\nWhen asked about Trump's tall tale, Brown told KRON4 the following:\n\n\"I've never done business with Donald Trump, let's start with that,\" Brown told KRON4. \"And secondly, I don't think I'd want to ride on the same helicopter with him. There's too many people that have an agenda with reference to him, including the people who service helicopters!\"\n\nIn regards to his alleged comments about VP Harris, Brown called Trump's story \"creative fiction\".\n\n\"He's creative, real creative. That's so far-fetched, it's unbelievable,\" Brown said. \"I could not envision thinking of Kamala Harris in any negative way. She's a good friend a long time ago, absolutely beautiful woman, smart as all hell, very successful, electorally speaking.\"\n\nTrump's lies and the media's inability or unwillingness to challenge, fact check, or call out those lies set MSNBC's Lawrence O'Donnell off during last night's program. He was so angry that he even called out his own network.\n\nNovember 5 is approaching very fast. 88 more days until one of the most consequential elections in American history.

(Joe Raedle/Getty Images)\n\nHis campaign has completely lost its bearings with the withdrawal of Joe Biden and the ecstatic reception of the Kamala Harris-Tim Walz ticket among the Democratic faithful. He is so upset about losing Biden as his opponent that he's even taken to posting freaky fan-fic on his Truth Social Platform, hopefully suggesting that Biden is going to storm the convention and take back the nomination:\n\nSome of that is a classic \"I know you are but what am I\" Trump set up to rationalize a loss in November. He's going to say the Democrats staged a coup and usurped the Constitution by replacing Joe Biden on the ballot. It's laughably absurd but it will soothe him to say it and give his followers something to hang on to. But it's also obvious that he just can't wrap his mind around the fact that he has to run against Kamala Harris and Tim Walz. It's so confusing to him that he can't even leave Mar-a-Lago anymore. While the Democratic nominees are barnstorming the country with Trump's VP choice JD Vance trailing behind them with pathetic, cringe-inducing stunts, Trump himself is doing just one rally this week -- in an irrelevant deep red state that he will certainly win.\n\nPhilip Bump of the Washington Post has the numbers showing how much he has slowed down:\n\nTrump is holding far fewer rallies than he did in 2016 and has held far fewer public appearances than he did in 2020, the two previous times he sought the presidency.\n\nA review of Trump's activities in July and August of those previous years shows the difference. From July 1 to Aug. 10, 2016, Trump held 22 rallies, including six days on which he held multiple rallies. Over the rest of August, he added 15 more rallies. This year, he's held seven rallies with another scheduled for Friday in Montana.\n\nOne might guess that he is still spooked from the assassination attempt and fears being back out there but he wasn't campaigning much even before that. He just doesn't seem to think he needs to do it because, as he tells his people, he believes that the votes are already there and the main job of the campaign is \"election integrity\" which translates to suppressing the Democratic vote and contesting the results if he loses.\n\nNonetheless, he's obviously agitated over Harris's massive small donor fundraising haul over the past couple of weeks which he knows very well is indicative of tremendous enthusiasm for their ticket. (He's drained his own small donors dry over the past eight years.) And polls showing her taking the lead are driving him to distraction.\n\nAccording to his former communications director, Stephanie Grisham, he's decided to take matters into his own hands:\n\nRe: Trump's self-announced press conference today at 2 pm: He's panicking. I've seen this play many times. He thinks his team is failing him & no one can speak better/\"save\" his campaign/defend him but him. He hates the coverage Harris is getting & thinks only he can fix it.\n\nThe questions at the presser couldn't be heard because of the poor production at Mar-a-Lago, but from what we could tell the reporters were extremely polite and demanded no follow-ups which was nice for him. Some of the questions sounded like they might have even been asked by members of his own staff. For instance, when an unidentified reporter threw him a red meat question about whether former San Francisco mayor Willie Brown dating Harris back in the 1990s had helped her career, Trump told a wild tale about almost dying in a helicopter with him and that Brown had told him \"terrible things\" about Harris and was \"not a fan.\" (This is not the first time Trump has made these crude suggestions about her.)\n\nWillie Brown told the New York Times, however, that he's never been in a helicopter with Trump and that he never disparaged Harris to him. It seems that Trump had mistaken Willie Brown with former California Gov. Jerry Brown who did take a helicopter flight with him and Gov. Gavin Newsom to inspect fire damage a few years back. They didn't speak of Kamala Harris and the helicopter was never in any danger but Newsom recalls Trump incessantly wondering if it might crash.\n\nOddly, no members of the media are angrily demanding to see Trump's medical records despite the fact that he appears to be having major memory problems and possibly even delusions.\n\nAfter declaring that reproductive rights are no longer an issue because he'd \"sent it back to the states\" which he insists was the desire of liberals and conservatives for 50 years (total nonsense) there was this straightforward question about whether Trump planned to have the FDA ban mifepristone. He answered with a bizarre mishmash of words about \"supplementing\" with something \"open and humane\" and people voting on it that made no sense whatsoever.\n\nWant a daily wrap-up of all the news and commentary Salon has to offer? Subscribe to our morning newsletter, Crash Course.\n\nRecall that he told Time Magazine he has \"pretty strong views\" about abortion medication Mifepristone and would be making an announcement \"probably over the next week.\" That was on April 30. There's been no announcement since. This latest gibberish is all we have to go on.\n\nAnd then there were the crowds. Trump simply could not stop talking about the size of his crowds, complaining that the press was undercounting them and even declaring that his January 6 crowd was bigger than Martin Luther King's famed March on Washington. Over and over again he kept bringing it up, apropos of nothing, as if on a loop. It is a long-standing obsession of his that seems to be getting worse.\n\nHe did make some news by saying that he had agreed to debate Harris on ABC, a matchup which he had earlier backed out of. He also announced a debate on NBC and on Fox News but he got the dates all mixed up and according to the Harris campaign they've only agreed to the original debate on ABC on September 10. Perhaps others will happen as well but despite Trump's apparent desperation to have them, nothing has been set.\n\nAll in all, it was another Trump trainwreck, perhaps one of his worst but certainly not unprecedented. However, this time, the opposition is taking no prisoners. The Harris campaign put out a very sharp (and hilarious) response:\n\nHe was dour and angry and frankly is starting to look a whole lot older, just in the past few months. He's not enjoying himself and it shows and compared to the excited crowds greeting Harris and Walz this week this sad, pathetic appearance seemed almost funereal. Donald Trump isn't fun anymore.\n\nI think he's considering for the first time that he might lose again and he is not psychologically equipped to deal with that reality. Sure, he'll fight it and tell his supporters that it was stolen and perhaps even incite more violence. But deep down he knows he might actually lose just as he knows deep down that he lost in 2020. There's a look of panic in his eyes right now. If he fails this time he might just break apart at the seams.", "source": {"uri": "salon.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Salon.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar-a-Lago", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mar-a-Lago"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicopter", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Helicopter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_Social", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Truth Social"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Constitution of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willie_Brown_(politician)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Willie Brown (politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_states_and_blue_states", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Red states and blue states"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Doctor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Juris Doctor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jerry Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Washington Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coup_d'\u00e9tat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coup d'\u00e9tat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_Beach,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palm Beach, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Palm Beach, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephanie_Grisham", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stephanie Grisham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House_Communications_Director", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House Communications Director"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mifepristone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mifepristone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assassination of John F.

Drone strikes were conducted today into Russia's Lipetsk region with electrical infrastructure and buildings hit. A building at a military airfield that was loaded with ammunition was hit, creating a massive explosion. Russia said that it ordered the evacuation of hundreds of nearby residents. Russia said that more than 75 drones were intercepted and destroyed.\n\nNixon's resignation: Today marks the 50th anniversary of Richard Nixon resigning the presidency. Nixon had announced in a televised speech on the night of August 8 that he would be resigning in the wake of the Watergate scandal. It was at noon 50 years ago that Vice President Gerald Ford moved up to the presidency and Nixon boarded a Marine helicopter at the White House to go to Andrews Air Force Base for a flight on a government plane back home to California. Nixon's fate had been sealed when the Supreme Court ordered him to turn over to the government tape recordings secretly made in the White House that showed him to have been involved in crimes and a cover-up.\n\nHelicopter: It was unclear today whether Donald Trump was lying during his news conference yesterday at Mar-a-Lago about nearly being killed in a helicopter mishap or was confused about what he was saying. Trump said when he was president and went to Paradise, California, to see wildfire damage he was nearly killed when the helicopter on which he was riding made an emergency landing. But, there never was an emergency landing. Trump also said former San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown had been on the helicopter, but it was former California Gov. Jerry Brown, not Willie Brown.\n\nOther claims: Donald Trump made numerous statements during his news conference yesterday that were untrue. He claimed that Vice President Harris and Tim Walz had only 1,500 or 2,000 people at their campaign rallies this week, while they actually had from 20,000 to 50,000 people at each rally. Trump claimed that he spoke to more people at his speech before the Jan. 6 assault on the Capitol than did Dr. Martin Luther King at his 1963 civil rights event in Washington. Trump's crowd was estimated at less than 10,000, while King spoke to 250,000. Trump claimed that the U.S. Department of Justice was responsible the New York trials that convicted him, when those trials were not under the jurisdiction of the federal government.\n\nStorm Debby: Weather forecasters said tornadoes were possible today with winds of about 50 miles per hour as the remnants of Tropical Storm Debby, now downgraded to a Tropical Depression, move close to the New York Metro area. Flooding is expected in various places with the ground saturated from heavy rains earlier this week. The center of the storm was forecast to track through western New York state and along the border with Canada to Nova Scotia and the North Atlantic.\n\nTaylor Swift: A third person has been arrested by authorities in Austria in the plot to attack Taylor Swift concerts. He was identified as a citizen of Iraq. Authorities have said that one of the suspects in custody is a supporter of ISIS who was radicalized online. It's reported the Austrian authorities are seeking additional suspects. Three Taylor Swift concerts in Austria were canceled but she is set to appear in five concerts in London's Wembley Stadium beginning August 15.", "source": {"uri": "westfaironline.com", "dataType":

Trump's story came after he was asked about the decades-ago relationship between the pair, which Harris' various political opponents have pointed to over the years as being inappropriate.\n\n\"Willie was -- he was a little concerned [about Harris],\" Trump said while relating his tale of going \"down in a helicopter with him.\"\n\n\"So I know him, but I know him pretty well. I mean, I haven't seen him in years. But he told me terrible things about her.\"\n\nTrump concluded, \"He was not a fan of hers very much, at that point.\"\n\nHowever, the alleged helicopter ride with Willie Brown never happened -- it was rather then-Calif. Gov. Jerry Brown who accompanied Trump during a trip to survey damage caused by the deadly 2018 California wildfires, the Times reported Thursday, indicating the former president either confused the two Browns or fabricated the story.\n\nMeanwhile, current Calif.

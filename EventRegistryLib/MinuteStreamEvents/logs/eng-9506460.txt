With so much at stake, teams cannot afford to be lukewarm at the risk of being left out of the tournament. However, Scalabrine went a step further by claiming that Spoelstra ordered his players to intentionally injure the Celtics.\n\nIn a post-match analysis, the commentator stated: \"I'm not trying to start anything here, but Erik Spoelstra called a timeout with 1:30 down by 16, 30 seconds later that play happens.\"\n\n\"Why is he calling a timeout, and then why is that play happening 30 seconds later?\" Scalabrine questioned and went further by calling the play a \"Code Red. Like in A Few Good Men... I'm just saying. Why would you see that play? I didn't like that.\"\n\n\"To me, it's a dirty play. I think Martin should get suspended for that,\" said the commentator. He also asserted, \"The idea of winning a championship is your star players have to stay healthy. And a guy goes up, and you just ram into him? That ain't basketball.\"\n\nFormer Heat forward Udonis Hasleem was among the first to respond to Scalabrine. \"Shut yo sucka *ss up. He got pushed. Brian Weak *ss,\" Hasleem wrote on his social media feed.\n\nMost specialists consider that it was an unintended move.

As superstar Jayson Tatum leapt up to rebound a missed shot, Miami's Caleb Martin undercut him causing him to fall hard on the floor.\n\nIt looked bad, and some would go as far as to call it unnecessary as it didn't appear Martin was making a direct play at the basketball.\n\n\"I'm not trying to start nothing here,\" Scalabrine said before indeed starting something. \"Erik Spoelstra called a timeout with 1:30 left, down 16. Thirty seconds later, that play happens.\n\n\"Why is he calling a timeout, and then why is that play happening 30 seconds later?... [We call that] Code Red. Like in A Few Good Men... I'm just saying. Why would you see that play? I didn't like that.\"\n\nBrian Scalabrine, who played NBA ball for a decade, believes the foul was not only intentional, but it was a direct order from the Heat bench!\n\nMany argued against that opinion, providing some pretty strong circumstantial evidence to disprove the allegation.\n\nFirstly, that timeout Scalabrine alluded to was, in fact, not a timeout at all. Rather, it was a coach's challenge from the Miami staff, who was questioning a foul call against its defense.\n\nThis came after the Heat pulled to within 14 points.\n\nNow, some would argue that the game was out of reach, but it's worth noting that Miami was attempting to make one final push after starting the fourth quarter down by 32.\n\nSecondly, replays showed that Caleb Martin was potentially pushed by a Celtics player, causing his momentum to carry him into Jayson Tatum just as he left his feet.\n\nHe appeared on the Dan Le Batard Show Monday to talk about the accusation against Erik Spoelstra. In doing so, he attempted to peddle the narrative to listeners while looking extremely foolish as he continuously moved the goalposts.\n\nScalabrine started by saying the Heat planted a seed before the start of the series, then double down on his implication that Erik Spoelstra ordered the takeout.\n\nAfter receiving some pushback from hosts, he bizarrely brought Draymond Green into the equation in an attempt to compare Caleb Martin to the most controversial player in the NBA. And even then, that goalpost moved from the coach demanding the \"Code Red\" to a player doing something extracurricular on his own.\n\nThe entire conversation made Brian Scalabrine sound very silly, but it's probably too late for him to change tune now!", "source": {"uri": "brobible.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "BroBible"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jacob_elsey@brobible.com", "name": "Jacob Elsey", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Scalabrine", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brian Scalabrine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_Spoelstra", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Erik Spoelstra"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caleb_Martin_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Caleb Martin (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draymond_Green", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Draymond Green"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://brobible.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Brian-Scalabrine.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9506460", "eventUri": "eng-9506460", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

With Jimmy Butler and Terry Rozier sidelined, a lot has to come right offensively for Miami to keep pace with Boston's firepower. The Heat also know they need to rely on their defensive intensity to try to slow the Celtics down by any means necessary, something Bam Adebayo acknowledged before the series even began.\n\n\"It's going to be a dogfight,\" Adebayo told reporters Friday. \"It's going to be a battle. It's going to be in the mud. It's not going to be pretty basketball. That's usually how it is when we play that team.\"\n\nThat type of play is Miami's only chance but Erik Spoelstra has a little bit of a problem. In the wake of Caleb Martin's hard foul on Jayson Tatum in the closing minute of Game 1, accusations are already flying Miami's way about their style of play. There has been a split nationally about how Martin's play has been viewed and Spoelstra did his best to downplay the episode while speaking to reporters after Tuesday's practice.\n\n\"I don't think it's worth addressing,\" Spoelstra said of Martin's foul. \"I get it. Everybody gets emotional. You ask fans on one side how they view the play, you ask fans on our side, you are going to get two totally different viewpoints on that. That's the playoffs, that's the fun part for fanbases.\n\n\"It was an irrational assessment on our view on what actually happened. The players are fine. All the outside noise or anything like that isn't going to decide the series or the game.\"\n\nWhile it's quite evident now nothing more is going to happen to Martin after the controversial play, there's little doubt that all eyes will be on the Celtics and Heat in Game 2 to see whether tension boil over for either side. That realization is not good for Spoelstra and the Heat since their path towards victory involves them being super physical with Boston defensively. If the officials are calling a tight game, it will be tougher for Miami to pull that off in Game 2.

The Heat may have earned the respect of everyone following their spirited run to the NBA Finals from the eight-seed last year, but for this iteration of the playoffs, they have so far been without Jimmy Butler and Terry Rozier, two of the team's most important players, which is going to make life difficult for them.\n\nHowever, there is simply no taking the Heat lightly. For as long as Erik Spoelstra is at the helm and the roster is filled with players full of grit, there is no counting out the team from South Beach. In Game 2, the Heat shot the lights out against the Celtics en route to a 111-101 victory to steal homecourt advantage.\n\nFor Spoelstra, the key to being a team that always rises to the occasion in the playoffs is to take it one game at time. After all, a lot can change from game to game, which is exactly what happened for the Heat.\n\n\"Sometimes that's the playoffs, right? When you have some younger players, you have to constantly remind them that one game is one game. Just like this win, it's just one win. Series are potentially long and are tough,\" Spoelstra said in his postgame presser, per Zachary Weinberger, Heat beat reporter for ClutchPoints.\n\nThe last thing the Heat can fret about is the things they cannot control. And for Erik Spoelstra, winning the emotional battle is key to winning what is shaping up to be yet another war against the Celtics.\n\n\"You have to stay emotionally and mentally stable throughout all that. You have to focus on competing at high level together, doing things that lead to winning, keep your emotions in check. All of that is easier said than done. But it was a very good response,\" Spoelstra added.\n\nFor a team missing two of its best shot-creators in Jimmy Butler and Tyler Herro, the last thing the Heat need is to lose the mathematical battle against the Celtics. In Game 1, the Celtics made 10 more threes than the Heat did en route to a dominant 114-94 victory. The three-point shot is the great equalizer, and Miami cannot afford to slip in that department if they were to seriously challenge for an upset series victory.\n\nThus, it became a point of emphasis for the Heat in Game 2 to continue shooting from beyond the arc and rectifying what the team called a \"discrepancy\" in terms of output from beyond the arc. They deserve plenty of credit for staying true to their word, as the Heat exploded for a total of 23 three-pointers on the night -- a franchise-high in the playoffs -- compared to just 12 for the Celtics.\n\n\"We also made some shots. That always works better when we make some shots but also the ones that were available and if we don't take them, it's potentially gonna look like Game 1,\" Spoelstra said. \"We're dealing with a very good basketball team. So are we.\"\n\nTyler Herro was on point on the night. He made six threes to pace the Heat's marksmen, while Caleb Martin, the Celtics' archnemesis, once again put Boston's defense to the sword with five three-pointers of his own. Four other players made two or more threes, culminating in yet another impressive win over the Celtics.\n\nThe key now for the Heat is to get wins at home even with the expected fall-off from their output from beyond the arc. They are not always going to shoot 53.5 percent from three on 43 attempts. But given the coaching knowhow of Erik Spoelstra, expect the Heat to be prepared to fight for a win in the mud.\n\nThere are many factors that go into what makes a coach great. Does the coach maximize the talent he has on hand? Does he play a huge part in developing the players on the roster and putting them in a position to succeed? Are they adept at making adjustments, from game to game or from series to series, and are they able to manage their rotation optimally?\n\nErik Spoelstra checks all the boxes for the Heat; no matter the roster churn, Spoelstra seems to maximize the talent he has on the roster, and the team always seems to play better than the sum of its parts under his tutelage. There's a long way to go for the 2023-24 Heat to get to the heights they reached last year, but Spoelstra's presence has earned them the benefit of the doubt.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jedd_pagaduan@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Jedd Pagaduan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_Spoelstra", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Erik Spoelstra"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Butler", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jimmy Butler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Rozier", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Terry Rozier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_advantage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Home advantage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Heat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami Heat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Herro", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tyler Herro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Heating_and_Cooling", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Heating and Cooling", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Erik-Spoelstras-simple-response-to-how-Heat-pulled-shocking-Game-2-upset-of-Celtics.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9506460", "eventUri": "eng-9506460", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

Steven Senne/Associated Press\n\nThe Miami Heat are facing long odds in their first-round series against the Boston Celtics.\n\nGAME 2\n\nWHO: Miami Heat at Boston Celtics\n\nWHEN: 7 p.m. Wednesday\n\nTELEVISION: TNT, NBCSB\n\nWith Jimmy Butler and Terry Rozier sidelined, a lot has to go right offensively for Miami to keep pace with Boston, which took a 1-0 series lead with a 114-94 win Sunday. The Heat also need to rely on their defensive intensity to try to slow the Celtics down, something Heat center Bam Adebayo acknowledged before the series began.\n\n\"It's going to be a dogfight,\" Adebayo told reporters Friday. \"It's going to be a battle. It's going to be in the mud. It's not going to be pretty basketball. That's usually how it is when we play that team.\"\n\nThat type of play is Miami's only chance but Coach Erik Spoelstra has a bit of a problem. In the wake of Caleb Martin's hard foul on Jayson Tatum in the closing minute of Game 1, accusations are flying about Miami's style of play. There is a split nationally about Martin's play and Spoelstra did his best to downplay the episode while speaking to reporters after Tuesday's practice.\n\n\"I don't think it's worth addressing,\" Spoelstra said of Martin's foul. \"I get it. Everybody gets emotional. You ask fans on one side how they view the play, you ask fans on our side, you are going to get two totally different viewpoints on that. That's the playoffs, that's the fun part for fanbases.\n\n\"It was an irrational assessment on our view on what actually happened. The players are fine. All the outside noise or anything like that isn't going to decide the series or the game.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile it appears nothing is going to happen to Martin after the controversial play, there's little doubt all eyes will be on Game 2 to see if tension boil over. That is not good for Spoelstra and the Heat since their path towards victory involves them being super physical. If the officials are calling a tight game, it will be tougher for Miami to pull that off. That left Spoelstra trying to wave off any extra attention the play could bring to Wednesday night.\n\n\"This is good, clean, tough, physical playoff basketball and it always has been with Boston and us,\" Spoelstra said. \"It's not going over the top, the league doesn't need to look into anything more on either side to put extra eyes on it.\"\n\nThe extra eyes he's referring to here are officials paying close attention to any extracurriculars. If Miami's isn't allowing to be physical, that's bad news for their chances and it led to Spoelstra essentially making a plea to league officials.\n\n\"This is tough competition basketball,\" Spoelstra said. \"This is what everyone wants, this is what the fans want, players want, teams want and even the league. They want this level of competition.\"\n\nWhether or not Spoelstra gets his wish remains to be seen but this will be on more subplot to monitor entering a pivotal Game 2 contest.\n\nTHE CELTICS were not directly involved in any ties that the NBA broke at the end-of-season random drawing to establish the order for the 2024 NBA Draft. Yet, they did receive some minor bad news for their 2024 second-round selection.\n\nBoston had the best record in the NBA by seven games with a 64-18 record so they will hold the 30th pick in the first round in June. President of Basketball Operations Brad Stevens has yet to make a first-round selection three years in charge, so it will be interesting to see whether that trend will continue.\n\nThe one pick that was impacted during Monday's tiebreaker was a second-round selection that Boston acquired from the Dallas Mavericks (through Sacramento). Boston picked up the extra pick on draft night in 2023 for trading down in the second round. The Knicks and Mavericks finished with the same record in the regular season and the Mavericks won the tiebreaker to finish ahead of New York in the first round at No. 24.\n\nThe NBA flips-flops the draft order of ties in the second round so Boston's draft pick (via Dallas) in the second round will drop one slot lower. However, the team does get bumped up to No. 54 overall since the Philadelphia 76ers (No. 48) had to forfeit their second-round pick as a penalty for free agency tampering.\n\nInvalid username/password.\n\nPlease check your email to confirm and complete your registration.\n\nCreate a commenting profile by providing an email address, password and display name.

Jovic had been on the injury report earlier in the day due to back spasms.\n\n- Haywood Highsmith and Duncan Robinson entered together as the Heat's first reserves.\n\n- Delon Wright and Kevin Love later entered together, making it nine deep.\n\n- Before the game, Spoelstra brushed off a media question about heightened intensity.\n\n- \"You guys always ask me about how I feel about the team,\" he said. \"It really comes down to your habits. And you just continue to work your habits. We have a bunch of competitors.\"\n\n- As the series transitions to Miami, Adebayo said it still is a series.\n\n- \"It's first one to four,\" he said. \"You've got to have that mentality.\"\n\n- Spoelstra was asked pregame about how the playoffs could help in the development of Jovic and Jaquez.\n\n- He said it was not the moment for that.\n\n- \"It's a matter of contributing to winning right now,\" he said. \"They've put in the time, they've earned these opportunities. Now it's about impacting winning against a very good team.\"\n\n- Both played well in this one.\n\n- Of getting Herro going, Spoelstra said going in, \"We need to get a little bit more intentional in our actions to try to shake him free. They're a very good defense, so there is a balance.\"\n\n- They did just that.\n\n- Spoelstra continues to stress that the Heat's zone is not viewed internally as a panacea.\n\n- \"It's not going to save us,\" he said. \"The offensive shooting ability they have and the guys that can bring two defenders in certain instances is always going to be there. So we have to scramble. We have to make those multiple efforts.\"\n\n- He added, \"\"Schemes can't save you.\"\n\n- Spoelstra also took time ahead of Game 2 to praise Celtics guard Derrick White.\n\n- \"He's one of the most underrated players in the league, because he does it at both ends,\" Spoelstra said. \"He eats defensively, and offensively, very solid, efficient decision-maker. When the ball's in his hands, he makes a lot of the right plays. But when he's off the ball, he'll make you pay if you're not aware where he is.\"\n\n- As for Celtics center Kristaps Porzingis, Spoelstra had similar praise.\n\n- \"He really does it at both ends, because of the size, also at the rim defensively,\" he said. \"Offensively, he helps them spread the floor, and even if you're there, he's big enough to get his threes off, can post mismatches. Look, that's the deal. You have to find a way to conquer these challenges within the game.\"\n\n- Wright said there is a certain reality to the series, \"They're a good team. Our room for error is not as high as theirs.\"\n\n- Robinson, on playing through his back issue, \"At this point, it's just all about trying to find solutions and put your best foot forward to try to compete and ultimately win.\"\n\n- Spoelstra addressed the Celtics' 3-pointers after Boston's shooting exhibition in Game 1.\n\n- \"We have to do a better job,\" he said. \"I mean, we've never been only-protect-the-paint-rim at all costs. This is more dynamic than you typically see, because of the number of guys that can hurt you from beyond the 3-point line.\"\n\n- Of his candidacy for Defensive Player of the Year, as one of the three finalists, Adebayo said, \"You can put your center on anybody on the court, star player, role players, big men, whatever the case may be, I feel like that's a luxury to have.\"\n\n- Herro extended his streak of games with at least one 3-pointer to 36, dating to the regular season. Herro's longest such streak is 53 combined regular-season and playoff games, a run that ended March 2, 2021.", "source": {"uri": "sun-sentinel.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SunSentinel"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ira_winderman@sun-sentinel.com", "name": "Ira Winderman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_Spoelstra", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Erik Spoelstra"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Herro", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tyler Herro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caleb_Martin_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Caleb Martin (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Butler", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jimmy Butler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Rozier", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Terry Rozier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Kapono", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jason Kapono"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daequan_Cook", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Daequan Cook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glen_Rice", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Glen Rice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TD_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TD Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Allen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ray Allen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bam_Adebayo", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bam Adebayo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haywood_Highsmith", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Haywood Highsmith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delon_Wright", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Delon Wright"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Love", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Love"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duncan_Robinson_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Duncan Robinson (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristaps_Porzi\u0146\u0123is", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_White_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Derrick White (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball_positions", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basketball positions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Craps", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Craps", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://www.sun-sentinel.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Heat-Celtics-Basketball-6.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9506460", "eventUri": "eng-9506460", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 168, "relevance": 1}

After Wednesday morning's shoot-around, Heat head coach Erik Spoelstra along with stars Bam Adebayo and Kevin Love spoke about how the team looks heading into Wednesday night and what the focus has been on in terms of preparation.\n\nThere are a lot of aspects coaches and players can poke at as being a goal to correct during the Game 1 defeat, but it's also important to not over-complicate and focus on playing to the Heat's strengths. Spoelstra emphasized that point Wednesday morning, saying that a team will have \"no chance\" during the postseason \"if you're trying to cram for the test.\"\n\n\"We are who we are. So again, that's the old deal, if you're trying to cram for the test and make up for a lot of lost time, you have no chance in the playoffs,\" Spoelstra said. \"We have a bunch of great habits. And yes, they have a very potent offense, but we have habits to be able to be disruptive against anybody in any building. And then offensively, we also have habits to be more intentional. We'll need both of those things tonight.\"\n\nBam Adebayo, Erik Spoelstra talk Heat's mindset heading into Game 2\n\nStar Bam Adebayo was really good in Game 1 as he led the team with 24 points, six rebounds and being the captain of the Heat, he gave an assessment on what he's been seeing from the team in the two days they've had to prepare. He said to ClutchPoints that besides having a heightened intensity being down 0-1 series, he has the mindset that \"it's the first one to four.\"\n\n\"There's a general understanding of what we gotta do,\" Adebayo said. \"It's the first one to four, you gotta have that mentality. They won the first one, how we do we bounce back and respond?\"\n\nAdebayo will be crucial to the success of Miami on both ends of the floor, especially his defense where he has been recognized this season as a finalist for Defensive Player of the Year. Himself along with stars like Tyler Herro and rookie Jaime Jaquez Jr. will take the Heat as far as they can go as they continue to deal with the absences of Jimmy Butler and Terry Rozier.\n\nAs the Heat's star center questioned, after an ugly loss in the first game, it will be interesting to see how they adapt and respond in Game 2. For Spoelstra, it all starts with Miami's habits as he said to ClutchPoints when asked what he's been seeing from the team during the break.\n\n\"You guys always ask me how I feel about the team. It really comes down to your habits and just continuing to work your habits,\" Spoelstra said. \"We have a bunch of competitors, our guys will be ready, they'll be ready. Then it's a matter of also making an impact on the game and playing well. That has nothing to do with how I feel after a shoot-around. It's the competition that brings it out.\"\n\nKevin Love focuses on \"correctable moments\" for Miami\n\nThe Heat's veteran leadership will no doubt be huge as Kevin Love is going to be significant for the team as he looks to get more playing time rather than the 13 minutes he got in Game 1. He emphasized on the \"correctable moments\" Miami can take away from the game like how Boston ruled the three-point line, making 22 from that range which ties a playoff record for them.\n\n\"We went over a lot of film. So we feel like there's a lot of correctable moments that we can take advantage of, obviously they beat us on the three-point line by a large margin,\" Love said. \"Felt like there was some times where we either over-helped or they got an offensive rebound, where they kicked it back out, swing swing plays and those are just backbreaking devastating plays for us. So I think if we limit some of our mistakes, some of our glitches, I give ourselves a better shot to steal this one.\"\n\nWednesday night will be the opportune time for Miami to steal a game and possibly make this a competitive series. However, with how well the Celtics have been this season, the cards will be stacked against them, even though the Heat have prevailed before under those circumstances.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "zachary_weinberger@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Zachary Weinberger", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_Spoelstra", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Erik Spoelstra"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bam_Adebayo", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bam Adebayo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Love", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Love"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Heat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami Heat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Herro", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tyler Herro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Butler", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jimmy Butler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Rozier", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Terry Rozier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/North_America", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/North America", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/Europe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/Europe", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Erik-Spoelstra-sends-cram-for-the-test-warning-to-Miami-ahead-of-Game-2-vs.-Celtics.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9506460", "eventUri": "eng-9506460", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

This year, he just happened to be noticed for it, which I think is great.\n\n\"But I've noticed the improvement year after year. And, also, the work has been years in the making before he unveils something that our team needs. And this year it was a little bit more off the dribble, off the move, cutting, those kind of things.\"\n\nRobinson said after the morning shootaround, ahead of Wednesday night's Game 2 against the Boston Celtics in this best-of-seven opening-round Eastern Conference playoff series, that he was unaware of the voting tabulation.\n\n\"Yeah, I hope I get more votes next year. That's the goal,\" the sixth-year 3-point specialist said. \"That's kind of been the ethos of my whole career, is just trying to continually improve and become a better version of myself. And I still think there's more to get done in that department.\n\n\"I mean, I think this organization does an amazing job of maximizing the day to day and making sure people put their best foot forward to become the best version of themselves.\"\n\nSpoelstra said he could have envisioned Bam Adebayo on ballots, with the Heat center not among the 14 players receiving votes from 99 media members with ballots.\n\n\"I always feel that Bam could be included in that list of most improved,\" Spoelstra said, \"because his game dramatically changes for the better for our team every year.\"\n\nWith the Heat essentially otherwise out of leading options at point guard, with Gabe Vincent having moved on from last season's playoff roster, Kyle Lowry traded at midseason and Terry Rozier sidelined with a neck injury, Spoelstra reflected Wednesday on Tyler Herro stepping up this postseason at point guard.\n\n\"It's one of the most underrated parts of his game that he's improved,\" Spoelstra said. \"And he's taken it to heart that it loosens up things for him. It's also really beneficial for us, because he's so skilled.\n\n\"You add the playmaking and the passing to it, it makes the game easier for other guys on our team. That's some of the things that he's starting to understand as he grows as an offensive player, to translate it to impact winning.\"\n\nEven with two days off before Wednesday night's Game 2, and another two before Saturday's Game 3 at Kaseya Center, Spoelstra said it cannot be a time for cramming.\n\n\"We are who we are,\" he said at the morning shootaround. \"So, again, that's the deal. If you're trying to cram for the test and make up for a lot of lost time, you have no chance in the playoffs.\n\n\"We have a bunch of great habits. And, yes, they have a very potent offense. But we have habits to be able to be disruptive against anybody in any building. And then offensively, we also have habits to be more intentional.\"\n\nThe NBA has updated a pair of schedule scenarios for the series.\n\nThe league announced that Monday's Game 4 between Heat and Celtics at Kaseya Center will be 7:30 p.m. if there is a need for a Game 5 of the Western Conference series between the Los Angeles Lakers and Denver Nuggets, a series Denver leads 2-0. Otherwise Game 4 of Heat-Celtics on Monday would be at 7 p.m.\n\nIn addition, if a Game 5 is necessary in Heat-Celtics, it would be at 7:30 p.m. on Wednesday May 1 at TD Garden.", "source": {"uri": "sun-sentinel.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SunSentinel"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ira_winderman@sun-sentinel.com", "name": "Ira Winderman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_Spoelstra", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Erik Spoelstra"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Maxey", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Maxey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shai_Gilgeous-Alexander", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shai Gilgeous-Alexander"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Improved_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Improved Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_76ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia 76ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Heat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami Heat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_City_Thunder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma City Thunder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duncan_Robinson_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Duncan Robinson (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bam_Adebayo", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bam Adebayo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaseya_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kaseya Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Herro", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tyler Herro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Rozier", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Terry Rozier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TD_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TD Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Western Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Lowry", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Lowry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Adventure", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Adventure", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://www.sun-sentinel.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/tfl-l-heat-nuggets-wed-20.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9506460", "eventUri": "eng-9506460", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-01", "textStart": 4028, "textEnd": 4033}], "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

Erik Spoelstra will undoubtedly look for ways to improve his team's defensive performance and stifle Boston's electric perimeter-based offense. However, Miami's chances of success will continue to be slim due to Jimmy Butler's absence.\n\nIn the latest episode of the 'Green With Envy' podcast, the hosts discussed the potential ways Miami will look to adjust its game plan to limit Boston's effectiveness on both sides of the floor. Most of the discussion focused on how the Celtics must continue to nullify Tyler Herro as an on-ball creator.\n\nWithout Terry Rozier and Josh Richardson, who are both injured, the Heat are short on ball-handlers and playmakers. If the Celtics can shut Herro down for significant stretches of the game, it's hard to see how the Heat could overcome that throughout the course of a series.\n\nYou can watch the full episode by clicking on the embedded link below.\n\nListen to the \"Green With Envy\" podcast on:\n\nApple Podcasts: https://apple.co/3DoLhYK\n\nSpotify: https://spoti.fi/3Oj4dhD\n\nYouTube: https://bit.ly/3K8Mbv\n\nThe Boston Celtics are ready to match the Miami Heat's physicality in Game 2 Are the Miami Heat playing dirty vs. the Boston Celtics?

But if you can imagine, for a moment, all your MAGA brother-in-law\u2019s forwarded emails packaged together in one place among a smattering of ads touting horse paste and gently used House speakers\u2019 lecterns, you\u2019ve pretty much got the gist. It\u2019s essentially the Weekly World News, but with Donald Trump shrieking his guts out on the cover instead of the far less flappable Bat Boy (who is, as of this writing anyway, still a non-felon). In a shocker of shockers, Bill Guan, the outlet\u2019s chief financial officer, was recently charged with laundering millions in ill-gotten funds, becoming the latest MAGA luminary to lean into criminality\u2014before falling in face-first. As The Associated Press reports: Federal prosecutors in New York charged Weidong \u201cBill\u201d Guan of Secaucus, N.J., chief financial officer of The Epoch Times, of steering at least $67 million in criminal proceeds, much from fraudulently obtained unemployment insurance benefits, to the company, its affiliates and himself. Guan pleaded not guilty but was suspended by The Epoch Times, which agreed to cooperate with prosecutors. The case calls into question the future of a company that was a key online supporter of Trump and spreader of conspiracy theories. Oh no! A pro-Trump outlet could go under? That\u2019s a lot of extra slack for The New York Times to pick up! Of course, suspending one guy may not remove suspicion from the paper itself, given the details of the case. The AP notes that, in the past, The Epoch Times was \u201cparticularly aggressive\u201d with its Facebook advertising, eventually leading the social media platform, in 2019, to ban the newspaper\u2019s pro-Trump ads over violations of its policies. And it\u2019s still unclear where all that advertising money was coming from. The indictment doesn\u2019t specifically say that these pro-Trump efforts were funded through the alleged criminal scheme. But it was around this time that money was pouring in. The Epoch Times reported nearly $128 million in revenue for 2021, a stunning increase from $4 million in 2016, according to a federal financial disclosure. The turnaround caught the eye of banks, regulators and, eventually, federal prosecutors. In other words, something about these Trump-pushers doesn\u2019t smell quite right. Why does that seem so familiar? Well, because the world\u2019s gone mad, hasn\u2019t it? And that\u2019s been made abundantly clear through the paper\u2019s own coverage. In an October expos\u00e9 titled \u201cHow the conspiracy-fueled Epoch Times went mainstream and made millions,\u201d NBC News explained how the \u201caggressive online and real-world marketing campaigns and big-money conservative donors\u201d allowed the media company to prosper, \u201cgrowing its revenue by a staggering 685% in two years, to $122 million in 2021.\u201d This was before federal regulators discovered the alleged money-laundering hijinks, but there\u2019s no disputing that that money\u2014regardless of how it was obtained\u2014was being used to promote pro-MAGA nonsense. Its editorial vision \u2014 fueled by a right-wing slant and conspiracy theories \u2014 is on display in recent reports on how \u201cJan. 6 Capitol Hill Security Footage Challenges Key Narratives\u201d and \u201cMeteorologists, Scientists Explain Why There Is \u2018No Climate Emergency.\u2019\u201d Its video series include a documentary-style film alleging widespread vaccine injury and death and an expos\u00e9 of an alleged world government agenda to harm farmers, cull the population and force survivors to eat bugs. While The Epoch Times\u2019 suspended CFO is in hot water now, he could soon be taking bubble baths with convicted felon Trump if the latter wins his bid for a second term in the White House. Because in case you hadn\u2019t noticed, sucking up to the ocher abomination is now widely seen as a viable business strategy. So what do you suppose happens if Trump wins in November? Will all these scofflaws find new respect for the American justice system, or will we sink further into a swamp of lawlessness and cronyism, where one\u2019s legal and financial fates are decided by one\u2019s demonstrated loyalty to Trump? Well, we don\u2019t have to speculate all that much, because Trump has already tipped his hand. Despite whining (and lying) about President Joe Biden\u2019s supposed involvement in a state case prosecuted by a New York district attorney and decided by 12 ordinary Americans, Trump himself has hardly been shy about going after his political foes. In fact, not only did Trump suggest locking up his 2016 opponent Hillary Clinton numerous times, but he also took tentative steps toward making that happen. As The New York Times reported in 2019, Trump demanded that then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions pursue Clinton\u2019s prosecution. That didn\u2019t happen, of course, because Sessions refused. Think Trump would stay his hand during a second term while besotted with revenge fantasies and unencumbered by adult supervision? Of course, if Richard Nixon came back and saw what Trump is currently doing to our republic, he\u2019d vomit his small intestines. Then again, Nixon came from a simpler time, when people thought vaccines were still marginally useful and voting for felons was a bridge too far. But if being anti-Trump is enough to get you fired or prosecuted, it stands to reason that being a loyal Trump soldier will likely redound to your benefit. Trump is already planning to pardon the violent thugs who stormed our Capitol on his behalf in January 2021, and he\u2019s regularly protected his loyal capos with pardons and commutations. For instance, in July 2020, Trump commuted crony Roger Stone\u2019s sentence after Stone was convicted of witness tampering, obstructing justice, and lying to Congress\u2014on Trump\u2019s behalf. The move was so outrageous, in fact, Sen. Mitt Romney called it \u201cunprecedented, historic corruption.\u201d Shortly before leaving office, Trump also pardoned his former campaign manager Paul Manafort, who had refused to rat out his ex-boss during Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia election interference investigation. The pardon drew a rebuke from several lawmakers, including GOP Sen. Ben Sasse, who called it \u201crotten to the core,\u201d and Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff, who tweeted, \u201cDuring the Mueller investigation, Trump\u2019s lawyer floated a pardon to Manafort. Manafort withdrew his cooperation with prosecutors, lied, was convicted, and then Trump praised him for not \u2018ratting.\u2019 Trump\u2019s pardon now completes the corrupt scheme. Lawless until the bitter end.\u201d So, as with Putin and the doofuses holding Trump Media stock, perhaps Guan\u2019s best strategy is simply to wait in the hope that Trump returns to the White House. Because if he does, perhaps his little pro-Trump conspiracy rag may very well become one of Trump\u2019s favorite news outlets. After all, if there\u2019s one thing Trump likes almost as much as himself, it\u2019s unsupported conspiracies\u2014the wilder, the better. And maybe Guan would even get a pardon if he ingratiated himself enough, and kept the fire hose of pro-Trump misinformation flowing. Luckily for grifters, liars, and lawbreakers everywhere, another Trump term would be a veritable Shangri-La\u2014so long as they all toe the Trumpian line, and their genuflecting knees last just a wee bit longer than their rapidly corroding souls. So while The Epoch Times may be in big trouble now, like Putin and the J6 rioters, they can certainly hope for relief from Trump if he wins. Hell, they may even become a protected, de facto state media outlet as we slide further and further into corruption and lawlessness. And if that happens, there will be no limit to the amount of sketchy money they can rake in to promote their pro-Trump agenda.

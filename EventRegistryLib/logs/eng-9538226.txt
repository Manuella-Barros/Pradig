Now, the Lakers will be conducting a thorough search for the next voice that would lead the team, and a few names have already come up as potential candidates to fill the void Ham's firing left.\n\nAccording to Shams Charania of The Athletic, on FanDuel TV's Run It Back, the Lakers are looking into five options to potentially fill the position of head coach. The names are as follows: former Milwaukee Bucks head coach Mike Budenholzer, JJ Redick, Golden State Warriors assistant Kenny Atkinson, and Boston Celtics assistant Charles Lee, while Tyronn Lue's name was still mentioned as a potential option even though the Los Angeles Clippers are reportedly looking into signing him to an extension.\n\n\"The top candidates, Mike Budenholzer, former championship head coach of the Bucks -- Kenny Atkinson, JJ Redick, Charles Lee, and Ty Lue is really the big name if he's available,\" Charania said. \"Whoever the Lakers hire for this job, the task will be competing for a championship. ... This is one of the most high power jobs in the league. A lot of expectations will be on whoever that next head coach is.\"\n\nIf there's anything the Lakers are looking for in a replacement for Darvin Ham, it's the ability to display the skills Ham rarely showed, much to the detriment of the team over the past two seasons.\n\n\"A lot of the things that the Lakers felt Darvin Ham just did not do at the highest of levels -- rotations, adjustments, game plans -- I think they're gonna look for someone that can really command that locker room,\" Charania added.\n\nWith that said, who among the options Charania listed above is the best fit for LeBron James and the Lakers?\n\nA championship-winning coach to lead the Lakers to the promised land?\n\nTyronn Lue is the easy fit based on all the factors Charania listed above; Lue may not have gotten a fair chance to compete for a championship with the Clippers given their injury problems, but he proved in 2021 that he could make adjustments and rotation decisions with the best of them when he helped the team overcome two separate 0-2 deficits in the playoffs. Moreover, his playcalling in ATO situations is near-unparalleled. He also commands respect from LeBron James -- a must if you're going to be the coach of the Lakers.\n\nBut Lue appears to be content with the Clippers, and this sentiment appears to be mutual. Thus, the Lakers are better off turning their attention towards other candidates. Kenny Atkinson, who was a member of Lue's staff with the Clippers in 2021, and has since been a member of Steve Kerr's coaching staff with the Warriors, could be an option.\n\nAtkinson manages to get the best out of the rosters of teams he coaches; during his stint as the Brooklyn Nets' head coach, he seemed to have his team play well above expectations. However, Atkinson was not able to command the locker room as the main voice of the Nets when Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving came in nearly five years ago.\n\nSo as good of a tactician as Atkinson may be, he may not be the most enticing target for a team that's looking to get a buy-in from all of their players, LeBron James included.\n\nMeanwhile, Mike Budenholzer, despite being a championship-winning coach, may be too similar to Darvin Ham for the Lakers' liking. Budenholzer can be stubborn with his rotations, and he's not exactly widely-acclaimed for his ability to make playoff adjustments.\n\nHam, of course, spent the majority of his years as an assistant coach under Budenholzer. So it's likely that Ham applied much of what he learned from Budenholzer during his stint with the Lakers, and that did not exactly go according to plan.\n\nThus, the Lakers could, perhaps, put their faith in a fresh voice on the sidelines.\n\nWill the Purple and Gold take a chance at an unproven coach?\n\nJJ Redick and Charles Lee have no experience being the head coach of an NBA team. But sometimes, experience doesn't equate to excellence. Teams have to take a chance here and there. A recent prime example of this was when the Warriors put their faith in Steve Kerr even though he had no prior head coaching experience, or even assistant coaching experience for that matter. That worked out quite well.\n\nFor the Lakers, Redick, at the very least, would garner respect from his podcast partner LeBron James. And with James' respect comes everyone else's. Redick and James could then engage in more of a collaborative effort on the sidelines.\n\nMeanwhile, Lee, who is a well-regarded assistant with the Celtics, could be a good option as well. The Celtics players have showered him with effusive praise in the past. Alas, it's unclear how well he could command a locker room and if he could receive full buy-ins from James and Anthony Davis.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jedd_pagaduan@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Jedd Pagaduan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenny_Atkinson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kenny Atkinson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darvin_Ham", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Darvin Ham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Budenholzer", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mike Budenholzer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyronn_Lue", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tyronn Lue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JJ_Redick", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "JJ Redick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Bucks", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Bucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Clippers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Clippers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Davis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Davis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Kerr", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steve Kerr"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn_Nets", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn Nets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Durant", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Durant"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cheerleading/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cheerleading/Organizations", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Coaching", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/NBA-rumors-Mike-Budenholzer-Ty-Lue-among-Lakers-top-5-in-coaching-search.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538226", "eventUri": "eng-9538226", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 202, "relevance": 1}

He is also a candidate for the Charlotte Hornets' vacant head coach job, according to ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski.\n\nLee has been a key part of the Celtics' dominant 2023-24 season, and head coach Joe Mazzulla has praised the assistant since hiring him a year ago.\n\n\"He's worked for one of the best coaches in the last 20 years in the NBA,\" Mazzulla said in October. \"He's been an NBA champion. He's had NBA interviews.

While Jason Kidd is not available after signing an extension with the Dallas Mavericks, the Lakers have been linked to some other coaches that are familiar with LeBron and they appear to be firmly in the mix.\n\nAmong the top candidates currently are JJ Redick, Tyronn Lue, Mike Budenholzer, Kenny Atkinson and Charles Lee, as Shams Charania of The Athletic reported on FanDuel TV's 'Run It Back' on Monday morning:\n\n\"An extensive coaching search is beginning most likely this week. The top candidates are Mike Budenholzer, former championship head coach of the Bucks, Kenny Atkinson, JJ Redick, Charles Lee and Ty Lue is really the big name if he's available. Obviously the Clippers want to keep him, want to extend him. He has one year left on his deal with the Clippers but whoever the Lakers hire for this job, the task will be competing for a championship. Not the playoffs, not the Conference Finals, but a championship around LeBron James and Anthony Davis. This is one of the most high-power jobs in the league. A lot of expectations will be on whoever that next head coach is and really a lot of the things that the Lakers felt Darvin Ham just did not do at the highest of levels - rotations, adjustments, game plans. I think they're gonna look for someone that can really command that locker room. So those are the names, the process begins likely this week.\"\n\nLue and Redick are the two names that make sense when it comes to James. The former may not be obtainable due to his contract with the Clippers though, while the latter has no coaching experience of any kind.\n\nSo with that being the case, Budenholzer is the most experienced coach on the market. Atkinson also has a ton of experience both as an assistant and head coach with the Brooklyn Nets, while Lee is a long-time assistant that comes from Budenholzer's coaching tree, similar to Ham.\n\nIt may be a while before the Lakers land on their next head coach, but it appears they are not wasting any time getting the search underway with top candidates already emerging.\n\nAnthony Davis' opinion to be valued in Lakers' head coaching search\n\nWhile LeBron James' opinion will be taken into consideration in the Lakers' coaching search, his isn't the only one as it was recently reported that they will speak with Anthony Davis as well.

Here are several candidates the team could target", "body": "A rundown of all the potential candidates that could be on the Lakers' radar as they search for their next head coach.\n\nFor the third time in five years, the Los Angeles Lakers are once again on the hunt for a new head coach.\n\nThe 17-time NBA champions parted ways with Darvin Ham last Friday, igniting a search that promises to be both challenging and critical for the storied franchise.\n\nWith the coaching landscape offering limited options this time around, the Lakers must navigate carefully to find the right leader to steer the team back to championship contention before their window closes.\n\nFive years ago, after the team fired former head coach Luke Walton, the Lakers were on the precipice of hiring former NBA championship-winning head coach Ty Lue. Lue's championship pedigree, familiarity with LeBron James, and the Lakers organization as a player made him an ideal candidate for the job.\n\nHowever, current general manager Rob Pelinka only offered Lue a three-year contract, and forced assistant coach Jason Kidd upon him. Lue turned down the job after the two sides were unable to come to an agreement. Lue moved on to the Clippers and the Lakers hired Frank Vogel.\n\nIronically, both Lue and Kidd are rumored as names the Lakers are interested in, but both are currently under contract with their current teams, the Clippers and Dallas Mavericks, respectively.\n\nAfter news broke that the Clippers would be interested in Lue again, should he be fired by the Clippers following their first-round playoff exit against Kidd's Mavericks, reports came out that the Clippers would like to sign Lue to an extension keeping him in Los Angeles. The Mavericks, meanwhile, announced a contract extension for Kidd on Monday.\n\nVogel earned the Lakers a title inside the bubble at Disney World in Orlando, Florida. But injuries and a disgruntled Russell Westbrook marred his following two seasons. That dysfunctional dynamic between Westbrook and Vogel ultimately led to the team dismissing their head coach in the summer of 2022.\n\nAt that time, veteran names with championship pedigrees like Nick Nurse and Doc Rivers were possibilities. Instead, the Lakers opted for a first-time head coach in Darvin Ham, and the Lakers had to escape the NBA's Play-In Tournament as the seven-seed, only to eventually lose to the Denver Nuggets in back-to-back postseasons.\n\nHaving gone from a first-time head coach to a veteran head coach, and back to a first-time head coach, the Lakers must now consider a more creative approach in their search. Toeing the line between experience and potential when it comes to their next hire.\n\nLeBron James can opt out of his contract and become a free agent. At that point, he could sign with any team he wants in the NBA. The rumors are, that he is interested in a return to the Lakers, especially if they draft his son Bronny James in the upcoming 2024 NBA Draft.\n\nEven if James does re-sign with the Lakers, he will be 40 years old this December and will be playing in his 22 NBA season come October. He was already the oldest player in the NBA this year, and likely only has a few seasons left before he ultimately decides to call it a career.\n\nThat means if James does return, the Lakers' window to win another championship with arguably the greatest basketball player of all time is small. It puts even more impetus on this next head coaching hire. In fact, both James and Davis are expected to be consulted and have input on who the next head coach of the Lakers will be.\n\nWithout further ado, here are some names that either currently are, or should be on the Lakers' radar for their next head coach:\n\nBudenholzer brings a decorated resume, including a championship with the Bucks. However, questions linger about his playoff adjustments and defensive strategies, which were mirrored by Ham during his tenure. The connection between Budenholzer and Ham raises eyebrows, posing a challenge for the Lakers' decision-makers.\n\nStotts was the former head coach for the Portland Trail Blazers and was a finalist for the Lakers' head coaching job in 2022. He briefly served as an assistant for the Bucks before stepping down prior to the start of the 2023-24 season.\n\nAtkinson was considered to be the runner-up to Ham in 2022, and was the former head coach for the Brooklyn Nets. Since then, he's been an assistant for both the Clippers and Golden State Warriors, including during their last title run in 2022. Atkinson might not be the splashiest choice, but he does have familiarity with the Lakers organization and will be a hot candidate for many openings this summer.\n\nAs a respected figure within the Lakers' organization, Handy has garnered admiration from players and insiders alike. His desire to step into a head coaching role has been evident, although the Lakers' previous coaching search overlooked him. Nonetheless, Handy's potential impact on player development and locker room cohesion cannot be overlooked.\n\nWhile unconventional, Redick's emergence as a coaching candidate stems from his deep understanding of the game and his rapport with LeBron James. Redick's transition from player to analyst has showcased his basketball acumen, making him an intriguing dark horse in the coaching race.\n\nAfter a lengthy career as a point guard in the NBA, including winning two NBA titles with the Houston Rockets in the mid-1990s, Cassell's second career has been as a longtime NBA assistant. He's been an assistant coach with the Washington Wizards, Clippers, Philadelphia 76ers, and for this season with the Boston Celtics. The Celtics are the current favorites to win the NBA championship. If they do, Cassell could become a hot commodity in head-coaching circles, not just for the Lakers but several other teams as well.\n\nQuinn is a former player with the Miami Heat, Nets, and San Antonio Spurs. After playing for Greg Popovich, Quinn has been an assistant under Heat head coach Erik Spoelstra since 2014. Over the past few seasons, Quinn's name has garnered interest around the league and most believe it's not a matter of if, but when he becomes a head coach in the NBA.\n\nThe former Villanova head coach is a two-time national champion, winning the NCAA Tournament in both 2016 and 2018. Wright retired after the 2022 season, but many expect he could return to coaching if given an NBA opportunity. Success at the collegiate level doesn't always transfer to the NBA, so it might be unlikely the Lakers would give Wright a shot with LeBron James and Anthony Davis on their roster.\n\nAdelman is the son of former NBA coach Rick Adelman, so needless to say, coaching runs in his blood. After starting with the Minnesota Timberwolves as a player development coach, Adelman has worked with the Orlando Magic and the Nuggets as an assistant coach. Adelman's name is not the splashiest among these candidates, and he's also never been a head coach before. However, if the Nuggets defend their title this season, then there's one man with the blueprint to beat them should he join the Lakers, and that's Adelman.\n\nThe Lakers' search for a new head coach marks a pivotal moment in their journey back to contention. While the pool of candidates may not boast championship-level names, the right fit could emerge from a blend of experience, innovation, and chemistry with the team's star players.\n\nAs the search unfolds in the coming weeks, the Lakers face the challenge of balancing immediate needs with long-term vision, all while navigating the intricate dynamics of the NBA coaching carousel. The decision they make will not only shape the team's future but also define the next chapter in Lakers' lore.", "source": {"uri": "nbcdfw.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC 5 Dallas-Fort

Charles Lee is a candidate for the Lakers opening, per The Athletic, as he's been linked to another job this summer. Lee was also rumored to be in the mix for the Hornets job opening. The Athletic reported other names who are in the mix are Mike Budenholzer, Kenny Atkinson and JJ Redick, among others.\n\nIt's no surprise seeing Lee, 39, discussed as part of job openings. He's interviewed for numerous head-coaching jobs before he joined the Celtics last summer. He's considered one of the up-and-coming coaches in the league as it's seemingly a matter of time before a team gives him his first shot as a head coach.\n\nLee joined Joe Mazzulla's last summer after spending five seasons in Milwaukee. Before his time with the Bucks, Lee was also with the Hawks from 2014-18. He's been an assistant for a lengthy time as he spent years under Budenholzer in Milwaukee and Atlanta. But he shook things up when he joined Mazzulla's staff as a top assistant.\n\nCurrently, the Lakers, Hornets and Wizards jobs are open.

Here are several candidates the team could target", "body": "A rundown of all the potential candidates that could be on the Lakers' radar as they search for their next head coach.\n\nFor the third time in five years, the Los Angeles Lakers are once again on the hunt for a new head coach.\n\nThe 17-time NBA champions parted ways with Darvin Ham last Friday, igniting a search that promises to be both challenging and critical for the storied franchise.\n\nWith the coaching landscape offering limited options this time around, the Lakers must navigate carefully to find the right leader to steer the team back to championship contention before their window closes.\n\nFive years ago, after the team fired former head coach Luke Walton, the Lakers were on the precipice of hiring former NBA Championship-winning head coach Ty Lue. Lue's championship pedigree, familiarity with LeBron James, and the Lakers organization as a player made him an ideal candidate for the job.\n\nHowever, current general manager Rob Pelinka only offered Lue a three-year contract, and forced assistant coach Jason Kidd upon him. Lue turned the job after the two sides were unable to come to an agreement. Lue moved on to the Clippers and the Lakers hired Frank Vogel.\n\nIronically, both Lue and Kidd are rumored as names the Lakers are interested in, but both are currently under contract with their current teams, the Clippers and Dallas Mavericks, respectively.\n\nAfter news broke that the Clippers would be interested in Lue again, should he be fired by the Clippers following their first-round playoff exit against Kidd's Mavericks, reports came out that the Clippers would like to sign Lue to an extension keeping him in Los Angeles.\n\nVogel earned the Lakers a title inside the Bubble at Disney World in Orlando, Florida. But injuries and a disgruntled Russell Westbrook marred his following two seasons. That dysfunctional dynamic between Westbrook and Vogel ultimately led to the team dismissing their head coach in the summer of 2022.\n\nAt that time, veteran names with championship pedigrees like Nick Nurse and Doc Rivers were possibilities. Instead, the Lakers opted for a first-time head coach in Darvin Ham, and the Lakers had to escape the NBA's Play-In Tournament as the seven-seed, only to eventually lose to the Denver Nuggets in back-to-back postseasons.\n\nHaving gone from a first-time head coach to a veteran head coach, and back to a first-time head coach, the Lakers must now consider a more creative approach in their search. Toeing the line between experience and potential when it comes to their next hire.\n\nLeBron James can opt out of his contract and become a free agent. At that point, he could sign with any team he wants in the NBA. The rumors are, that he is interested in a return to the Lakers, especially if they draft his son Bronny James in the upcoming 2024 NBA Draft.\n\nEven if James does re-sign with the Lakers, he will be 40 years old this December and will be playing in his 22 NBA season come October. He was already the oldest player in the NBA this year, and likely only has a few seasons left before he ultimately decides to call it a career.\n\nThat means if James does return, the Lakers window to win another championship with arguably the greatest basketball player of all-time is small. It puts even more impetus on this next head coaching hire. In fact, both James and Davis are expected to be consulted and have input on who the next head coach of the Lakers will be.\n\nWithout further ado, here are some names that either currently are, or should be on the Lakers' radar for their next head coach:\n\nBudenholzer brings a decorated resume, including a championship with the Bucks. However, questions linger about his playoff adjustments and defensive strategies, which were mirrored by Ham during his tenure. The connection between Budenholzer and Ham raises eyebrows, posing a challenge for the Lakers' decision-makers.\n\nStotts was the former head coach for the Portland Trail Blazers and was a finalist for the Lakers' head coaching job in 2022. Since 2023, Totts has been an assistant coach with the Milwaukee Bucks.\n\nAtkinson was considered to be the runner-up to Ham in 2022, and was the former head coach for the Brooklyn Nets. Since then, he's been an assistant for both the Clippers and Golden State Warriors, including during their last title run in 2022. Atkinson might not be the splashiest choice, but he does have familiarity with the Lakers organization and will be a hot candidate for many openings this summer.\n\nAs a respected figure within the Lakers' organization, Handy has garnered admiration from players and insiders alike. His desire to step into a head coaching role has been evident, although the Lakers' previous coaching search overlooked him. Nonetheless, Handy's potential impact on player development and locker room cohesion cannot be overlooked.\n\nWhile unconventional, Redick's emergence as a coaching candidate stems from his deep understanding of the game and his rapport with LeBron James. Redick's transition from player to analyst has showcased his basketball acumen, making him an intriguing dark horse in the coaching race.\n\nAfter a lengthy career as a point guard in the NBA, including winning two NBA titles with the Houston Rockets in the mid-1990s, Cassell's second career has been as a longtime NBA assistant. He's been an assistant coach with the Washington Wizards, LA Clippers, Philadelphia 76ers, and for this season with the Boston Celtics. The Celtics are the current favorites to win the NBA Championship. If they do, Cassell could become a hot commodity in head-coaching circles, not just for the Lakers but several other teams as well.\n\nQuinn is a former player with the Miami Heat, Nets, and San Antonio Spurs. After playing for Greg Popovich, Quinn has been an assistant under Heat' head coach Erik Spoelstra since 2014. Over the past few seasons, Quinn's name has garnered interest around the league and most believe it's not a matter of if, but when he becomes a head coach in the NBA.\n\nThe former Villanova head coach is a two-time National Champion, winning the NCAA Tournament in both 2016 and 2018. Wright retired after the 2022 season, but many expect he could return to coaching if given an NBA opportunity. Success at the collegiate level doesn't always transfer to the NBA, so it might be unlikely the Lakers would give Wright a shot with LeBron James and Anthony Davis on their roster.\n\nAdelman is the son of former NBA coach Rick Adelman, so needless to say, coaching runs in his blood. After starting with the Minnesota Timberwolves as a player development coach, Adelman has worked with the Orlando Magic and the Denver Nuggets as an assistant coach. Adelman's name is not the splashiest among these candidates, and he's also never been a head coach before, however, if the Nuggets defend their title this season, then there's one man with the blueprint to beat them should he join the Lakers, and that's Adelman.\n\nThe Lakers' search for a new head coach marks a pivotal moment in their journey back to contention. While the pool of candidates may not boast championship-level names, the right fit could emerge from a blend of experience, innovation, and chemistry with the team's star players.\n\nAs the search unfolds in the coming weeks, the Lakers face the challenge of balancing immediate needs with long-term vision, all while navigating the intricate dynamics of the NBA coaching carousel. The decision they make will not only shape the team's future but also define the next chapter in Lakers' lore.", "source": {"uri": "nbclosangeles.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC Southern

The search will be extensive as the Lakers want to avoid looking for another head coach two or three years from now. It's still being determined what direction the front office wants to take, but they'll check on everybody, including long-time assistant and current Boston Celtics assistant Charles Lee.\n\nThe Athletic's Jovan Buha and Shams Charania have reported that Lee could be added as a potential candidate for the Purple and Gold.\n\nLee has an extensive background as an assistant coach, which makes him a strong candidate for the Lakers' head coach position. He started at Bucknell University from 2012-14 and then joined the NBA with the Atlanta Hawks as an assistant from 2014-18. He continued his journey with the Milwaukee Bucks from 2018-23, following his mentor Mike Budenholzer, who is also reportedly angling for this Lakers gig. In June 2023, Lee was hired as the top assistant coach for the Boston Celtics under head coach Joe Mazzulla.\n\nThe 39-year-old assistant is also a former player.

Obviously getting either better players and/or more rotation players is a must, adding experience to a coaching staff is also part of that equation. Enter Darvin Ham.\n\nESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski reported via his X account that the Lakers have parted ways with Darvin Ham shortly after the Denver Nuggets eliminated them from the first round. However, Wojnarowski added more intriguing details surrounding Ham's future, including that he will be in the running for head coaching gigs.\n\nHowever, given how recent the firing has been, Ham hasn't been linked to any jobs yet. Out of pure speculation, who knows how long it will be before he gets another head coaching gig? If he needs a place to prove himself, the Kings could add him in a \"You scratch my back, I'll scratch yours\" situation.\n\nDespite the turmoil that went on for the Lakers - which goes beyond Ham's influence - Ham still helped them make a surprise run to the Western Conference Finals in 2023. That's not bad for someone who was a first-timer as a head coach. Especially knowing that the Lakers missed the postseason the previous year.\n\nHowever, Ham also thrived as an assistant in the past. The former NBA player was an assistant coach when the Bucks rose to become the contenders they hadn't come close to for decades. He helped Mike Budenholzer and co win their first title since 1971. While he may not have been the main reason why the Bucks went all the way, he played a part.\n\nIf that's not enough, Ham has been part of Mike Brown's coaching staff in the past. Ham was an assistant coach for Brown back when the latter coaches the Lakers himself. The two are clearly familiar with each other, which could prove to be a beneficiary partnership for the Kings.\n\nSo Ham has proven himself to be of use as an assistant coach in the past, and he has experience playing under Brown. However, the biggest appal to him would be that the Kings could help Ham in his hopes of becoming a head coach again. While he wouldn't replace Brown, bringing his expertise to a playoff hopeful like the Kings could restore his credibility as a coach.\n\nAssistant coaches, whether they have experience as a head coach or not, do this in the hopes of getting up to that level. They help teams reach their goals. Charles Lee and Sam Cassell both have extensive experience with coaching and have been interviewed for head coaching jobs. They joined Joe Mazzulla's staff in Boston to help the Celtics' hopes of winning a title, but there's more to it than that.\n\nThey also joined the staff because if they can help the Celtics win a championship, that makes their resume look much better when other head coaching gigs open up. Mike Brown did this too when he was an assistant for Steve Kerr on the Warriors before the Kings hired him.\n\nIt's very possible Ham might get another head coaching job in the coming months. However, it's also possible he may have to be relegated to an assistant for the time being. If he's looking for an assistant head coaching job that would help his chances of calling the shots again, the Kings could very well provide that for him.", "source": {"uri": "aroyalpain.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "A Royal Pain"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darvin_Ham", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Darvin Ham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Brown_(basketball,_born_1970)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mike Brown (basketball, born 1970)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Wojnarowski", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Adrian Wojnarowski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Bucks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Bucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacramento_Kings", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sacramento Kings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Budenholzer", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mike Budenholzer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Cassell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sam Cassell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Kerr", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steve Kerr"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cheerleading/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cheerleading/Organizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_5213,h_2932,x_0,y_74/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/GettyImages/mmsport/88/01hwzxw19sm5ykbsz257.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538226", "eventUri": "eng-9538226", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

While many fans have been optimistic about a fresh face like Redick coaching the team, a vocal section of the fanbase doesn't want the deal to happen because Redick didn't vote for Anthony Davis for an All-Defensive team.\n\nSome fans think the similarly inexperienced Rajon Rondo might be a better fit.\n\nOne fan defended Redick leaving Davis off his ballot because of the Lakers record.\n\nFans trashed some of Redick's other takes to explain why he shouldn't be a head coach.\n\nOne fan believes hiring Redick is another move to appease LeBron, just like the possible drafting of Bronny James this summer.\n\nOne fan expressed massive frustration at the Lakers evaluating someone like Redick and wants to see the team hire a coach they intend on keeping.\n\nMore fans don't want Redick in the running for the job.\n\nThere are many reasons to be upset at the Lakers wanting to hire Redick. The fanbase just saw how an inexperienced head coach can falter in the face of personalities like LeBron James and Anthony Davis with the Darvin Ham example, as the Lakers were his first head coaching job in the NBA.\n\nRedick has not coached at any level professionally, so hiring him is a gamble akin to what the Brooklyn Nets took with hiring Steve Nash in 2020. Nash still had pedigree having been around the coaching staff of the Warriors and as a former MVP. Redick is inarguably one of the smartest voices in basketball right now, but jumping into coaching on a team like the Lakers might not be the best idea.\n\nWhat Coaches Can The Lakers Evaluate?\n\nWith Jason Kidd's contract extension with the Mavericks being confirmed, he's out of the race after being linked over the weekend. It doesn't look like Tyronn Lue will be losing his job on the Clippers, so the pipe dream of hiring him could be quickly fading. Outside these two existing NBA head coaches, who could the Lakers target?\n\nThe most experienced and accomplished name on the sidelines is Mike Budenholzer, who has led multiple No. 1 seeds in the NBA and won the 2021 title with the Milwaukee Bucks. The Lakers hired Ham after he worked under Budenholzer for years, so they could possibly bring in the sensei but he'll carry on some of the habits the players didn't like about Ham, especially regarding in-game adjustments.\n\nNBA assistants such as Micah Nori on the Wolves and Charles Lee on the Celtics would be interesting options. Nori has done an excellent job with Chris Finch in Minnesota this season, though it doesn't seem like he'll be in serious consideration. Every NBA team that's done a coaching search in recent years has knocked at the door of Charles Lee, but nobody has made him a head coach yet.\n\nKenny Atkinson in Golden State could be a target as well, as the former Nets head coach has spent the last three seasons as an assistant under Steve Kerr. Former Lakers assistant Phil Handy, who was fired as part of Ham's staff, could also be in the running as a popular choice among players.\n\nAfter these candidates, you have the likes of Redick and Rondo who are former players with no coaching experience. Rondo being one of the smartest minds in league history makes a case for him more compelling than Redick, but it seems that Redick will be able to bring balance to an often moody locker room.\n\nThis is the most coveted coaching job in the NBA, so it'll be interesting to see who earns it this summer.", "source": {"uri": "fadeawayworld.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fadeaway World"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ishaan_bhattacharya@fadeawayworld.net", "name": "Ishaan Bhattacharya", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JJ_Redick", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "JJ Redick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Davis", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Davis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darvin_Ham", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Darvin Ham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronny_James", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bronny James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Defensive_Team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Defensive Team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Nash", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Steve Nash"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Budenholzer", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mike Budenholzer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyronn_Lue", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tyronn Lue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajon_Rondo", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rajon Rondo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn_Nets", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn Nets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Kidd", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jason Kidd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenny_Atkinson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kenny Atkinson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Finch_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chris Finch (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Kerr", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steve Kerr"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Bucks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Bucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 33}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 38}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cheerleading/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cheerleading/Organizations", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Coaching", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://fadeawayworld.net/.image/ar_1.91%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MjA2MjQzNjMxMDg0ODczMTE1/437718883_793058856088943_2452136704710878465_n.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538226", "eventUri": "eng-9538226", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

Among the names being tossed around is JJ Redick, former NBA sharpshooter turned media personality. However, noted sports commentator Bill Simmons has offered a stark warning about the potential pitfalls of such a move. During a discussion about the Lakers' coaching situation, Simmons remarked, \"JJ would have to be a lunatic to take the Lakers' job, I can't imagine why he would do that.\"\n\nSimmons' comments came during an episode of his podcast, where the topic of who would next helm the troubled Lakers was a hot point of debate. Co-host Van Latham suggested that Redick might jump at the chance, leading Simmons to question the sanity of such a decision, especially considering the high-pressure environment of the Lakers organization and the complex dynamics involving the team's star, LeBron James.\n\nThe debate between Simmons and Latham delved into the potential motivations and deterrents for Redick in taking up the Lakers' coaching mantle. Latham humorously suggested that the job's perks might include discussions over wine and basketball strategy, particularly focusing on technical aspects like ram screens. However, Simmons countered by pointing out the inherent challenges of the role, particularly Redick's pre-existing relationship with LeBron James. The two currently co-host \"The Mind The Game Podcast,\" where they discuss intricate basketball strategies, which complicates the traditional player-coach dynamic.\n\nSimmons further elaborated on the difficulties of coaching a team led by LeBron, especially given LeBron's history with past coaches. LeBron's tenure in the NBA has been marked by rocky relationships with several coaches, from David Blatt, who was controversially fired from the Cleveland Cavaliers, to Frank Vogel, whose departure from the Lakers was also shrouded in rumors of discontent from LeBron. These incidents highlight the challenges any new coach would face, especially someone like Redick, who already shares a personal and professional relationship with LeBron.\n\nFurthermore, the firing of Darvin Ham has split the NBA community, with debates raging over whether he deserved to be let go or was simply a scapegoat in a challenging situation. Under Ham's brief tenure, the Lakers showed flashes of potential but ultimately failed to meet the high expectations set for a franchise with such a storied history. His dismissal has led to questions about the stability of the coaching position within the Lakers organization and whether any coach can succeed under the current structure and leadership.\n\nRedick's connection to Bill Simmons, having previously hosted a podcast on Simmons' Ringer Network, adds another layer to the discussion. Simmons' perspective is not just of an observer but also of someone who has had a working relationship with Redick. This background gives Simmons a unique insight into Redick's capabilities and potential fit for the high-stakes job of coaching the Lakers.\n\nWho Will Fill Darvin Ham's Shoes and Become the Next Lakers HC?\n\nAs the Lakers continue their search, the debate highlights the broader implications of selecting a coach who is deeply entrenched in the current NBA culture and personal relationships with players. It raises the question of whether LeBron would prefer a familiar face like Redick, which could allow him more influence in coaching decisions, or if the organization should look for a more traditional, perhaps more distanced candidate.\n\nThe situation is a complex puzzle involving team dynamics, personal relationships, and the intense pressure of delivering success to one of the most iconic sports franchises in the world. As the Lakers weigh their options, the NBA community watches closely, understanding that the decision could have far-reaching implications for the team's direction in the coming years. Redick, whether he is seriously considering the role or not, finds himself in the middle of a speculative storm that is as much about the future of the Lakers as it is about the evolving role of former players who transition into media and potential coaching roles.\n\nIn summary, while the proposition of Redick taking up the Lakers' coaching job offers intriguing possibilities, the reality, as Simmons suggests, is fraught with potential pitfalls and challenges. The next few weeks will be crucial as the Lakers make a decision that will not only shape their immediate future but also reflect their approach to managing the complex interplay of star power and strategic leadership within the high-pressure cauldron of the NBA.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nayan_brahmbhatt@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Nayan Brahmbhatt", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JJ_Redick", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "JJ Redick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Simmons", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bill Simmons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darvin_Ham", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Darvin Ham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_commentator", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sports commentator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Blatt", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "David Blatt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Vogel", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Frank Vogel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Player-coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Player-coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cheerleading/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cheerleading/Organizations", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Coaching", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/JJ-Redick-gets-lunatic-warning-from-Bill-Simmons-amid-coaching-rumors.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538226", "eventUri": "eng-9538226", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.192156862745098, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

Terry Stotts, the former Portland Trail Blazers head coach, is another name that has come up.

He has been an assistant coach for eight seasons, one of which was spent serving under Frank Vogel, who later went on to coach the Lakers to the NBA championship.\n\nBefore that, he was a player development coach under his father about a decade ago.\n\nLike his father, the younger Adelman is considered a sharp offensive mind. According to a Sports Illustrated Fan Nation article, he has had a hand in maximizing Nikola Joki\u0107's triple-threat skills in Denver's offense.\n\nNori was an assistant in Denver under Michael Malone several years ago, and it was there where he forged a relationship with Chris Finch, Minnesota's head coach. With Finch crippled due to a freak knee injury he suffered days ago during a playoff game versus the Phoenix Suns, Nori has taken on a more prominent role on the sideline as his team takes on the Nuggets in the Western Conference semifinals.\n\nHis team scored a 106-99 win on Saturday in Game 1 versus the defending world champs. He is considered very smart when it comes to basketball, but he is also smart when it comes to making players, reporters and fans laugh.\n\nNot only could the Lakers use a fresh voice and some sincere resourcefulness on the sideline, but perhaps they could also use a little humor from time to time, especially when they hear what they need to hear.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Adelman", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rick Adelman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JJ_Redick", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "JJ Redick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darvin_Ham", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Darvin Ham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Budenholzer", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mike Budenholzer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Stotts", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Terry Stotts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyronn_Lue", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tyronn Lue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portland_Trail_Blazers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Portland Trail Blazers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Vogel", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Frank Vogel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacramento_Kings", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sacramento Kings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Joki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nikola Joki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Malone_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Malone (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_Suns", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix Suns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_Illustrated", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sports Illustrated"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Western Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cheerleading/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cheerleading/Organizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/en5VIODnjwZsNDKvCOgILw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD03MTY7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/lebron_wire_usa_today_sports_articles_234/4388057da6212f667ab336149fbb7306", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538226", "eventUri": "eng-9538226", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

Here are the pros and cons", "body": "There aren't many people that have shot up the sports media ranks as quickly as JJ Redick.\n\nThe ESPN broadcaster was named to the network's lead NBA broadcast team earlier this year. Along with Hall of Famers in Mike Breen and Doris Burke, the trio will be calling the NBA Finals.\n\nOn top of this work with ESPN, the 15-year NBA veteran has also created several successful podcasts, most recently one called \"Mind The Game\" which he hosts alongside NBA superstar LeBron James.\n\nRedick has become a fixture in NBA sports media as he's mixed his veteran savvy with an analytical approach to sports that's often associated with pundits who have never played professional basketball. His credibility as an NBA veteran and former college star with Duke has allowed him to create relationships with tons of NBA players and also blend in with the media.\n\nHe's done it all in his post-playing career, despite only retiring from the NBA in 2021.\n\nThe 39-year-old's star has risen so quickly that former ESPN host Dan Le Batard has even said that he believes Redick will make more money throughout his career in sports media than the over $115 million he made over 15 years in the NBA.\n\nHowever, there is something that could pull Redick away from the media very soon -- and that's the chance to return to the NBA as a coach.\n\nRedick has been reported to be a candidate for head coaching roles for the Los Angeles Lakers and the Charlotte Hornets -- despite the fact that he's never been a head coach outside of his 9-year-old son's team.\n\nHe's also admitted that he's been approached by several teams in the past, both as an assistant and head coach, including last year when he was interviewed for the lead coaching gig with the Toronto Raptors.\n\nBut why would Redick pass up a high-paying job in media that he's continuing to grow in order to move over to the stress of the NBA sidelines? Here are the cases for both sides.\n\nRelated: JJ Redick reveals his biggest issue with basketball media\n\nGoing to the NBA\n\nThe first case for becoming a coach in the NBA would be the money.\n\nGolden State Warriors head coach Steve Kerr has an annual salary of $17.5 million, the highest in terms of yearly salary. Earlier this year, the Miami Heat's Erik Spoelstra reportedly agreed to the largest contract for an NBA coach ever worth $120 million over eight years.\n\nThe head coaching market has shot up drastically over the past several seasons as multiple coaches have received annual salaries in the tens of millions, though most of them have multiple championships under their belt. Redick would not have that resume, but he would come as a high profile hire -- and probably would drive a hard bargain given he's likely already making nine-figures as a broadcaster.\n\nThe competitiveness and will to win in the league may also be a driver for Redick. The veteran did not finish his career with an NBA championship, and made the Finals only one time during his rookie season.\n\nSince his retirement, Redick has constantly talked about his obsessiveness with the sport from when he was a player and how difficult it was for him to walk away from the game. His podcast with James has also given fans and team officials a public glimpse at Redick's knowledge for the X's and O's of the game -- all while talking to the star of the Lakers.\n\nIt's unclear whether Redick will be able to still have some sort of media presence while coaching -- that may be a lot harder than when he was a player in terms of time and acceptance from team management -- but this option at least gives him the chance to juggle both.\n\nRelated: Stephen A. Smith thinks LeBron James is pulling a 'slick' move by starting his new podcast\n\nStaying in the Media\n\nBroadcasting and media is not an easy job by any means. The likes of Stephen A. Smith stay up into the wee hours of the night to hop on meetings just to prepare for the early morning show. There are also a ton of late nights and weekends calling games, which will certainly be on Redick's schedule. That's all on top of his other endeavors, like running \"ThreeFourTwo Productions,\" his company that hosts several of his podcasts.\n\nBut many would argue that it's no where near as stressful as coaching. The managing of players and the game is only a part of the job, which includes speaking to the media and taking criticism. NBA coaches are constantly fired -- which explains the openings that are available -- and the lack of job security could be an issue.\n\nRedick's coaching performance could also significantly change the brand he's built which has made him so successful in the media space.\n\nThere's also the case that Redick could eventually make the same money -- if not more -- in the media. ESPN is reportedly paying Pat McAfee around $17 million per year, while Stephen A. Smith is at $12 million. The latter's number is also expected to skyrocket if he re-signs.\n\nWhile those two are more studio hosts, there's also Troy Aikman, who calls \"Monday Night Football,\" who is reportedly receiving $18 million a year. Redick could work for a contract similar to his NBA coaching salary while still having the flexibility to work on his other endeavors that could have unlimited earning potential.\n\nThe media role has also allowed him to live in New York with his family. Redick has stressed the importance of this as toward the tail end of his career, he was searching for East Coast teams to play for so he could be near his wife and sons.\n\nRedick has shot his podcast and some ESPN segments from New York, while traveling out for games and returning home afterwards. But a head coaching job will surely mean time away from his family or needing them to uproot to his new team's location.\n\nMore Sports Media:\n\nConclusion\n\nUltimately, this is a great problem for Redick to have, as either job will pay him well and keep him around the game he loves. He's already showcased his abilities with a headset, so trying his hand at coaching and returning to media eventually will be on the table.\n\nThis will likely just come down to whether Redick has that fire to become a coach and see how he can lead an NBA franchise to the promised land.\n\nRelated: Veteran fund manager picks favorite stocks for 2024", "source": {"uri": "sunherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sun Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "colin_salao@sunherald.com", "name": "Colin Salao", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JJ_Redick", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "JJ Redick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Breen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mike Breen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doris_Burke", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Doris Burke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_Blue_Devils_men's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Duke Blue Devils men's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naismith_Memorial_Basketball_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte_Hornets", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charlotte Hornets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_Spoelstra", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Erik Spoelstra"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_A._Smith", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stephen A.

Ham led the franchise to the conference finals in year one, but things were far from perfect. His game management was questionable and his rotations were head-scratching. The Lakers parted ways with Ham, and are expected to cast a wide net for his replacement.\n\nLA wants to win immediately. LeBron James turns 40 in December, and there is pressure to build a title-contending roster around him. It starts with their head coach. The Lakers need someone who can bring the team to together and get the most out of this group.\n\nBefore hiring Ham, the Lakers' other finalists were Kenny Atkinson and Terry Stotts. Both could factor into this year's choice with J.J. Redick as a fresh name. Rob Pelinka likely has interest in his former college teammate as he did in 2022, but he just agreed to a gig elsewhere.\n\nJuwan Howard just accepted an assistant coaching job with the Nets\n\nThe former University of Michigan head coach played with Pelinka in college and LeBron James in the NBA. Howard was not interested in 2022 because he was coaching his sons in college. He interviewed with the Lakers in 2019 but declined a chance last time. Things have changed, but the result likely stays the same.\n\nThe 51-year-old played 19 years in the NBA and spent six as a Heat assistant coach, including one coaching LeBron James, before coaching his alma mater. Howard went 87-72 during his five seasons at Michigan. The Wolverines made the Elite Eight in 2021 but failed to qualify for the tournament in each of the last two years, which led to his firing. His head coaching track record does little to inspire confidence for the Lakers.\n\nHoward agreed to join the Nets as an assistant under new head coach Jordi Fernandez on April 26. His stock has dropped considerably since 2022, and Howard will try to rebuild it in Brooklyn.\n\nJuwan Howard signing with Nets saves Lakers\n\nHis fresh deal with the Nets saves the Lakers from a disaster scenario. Rob Pelinka wanted Juwan Howard to coach his team in 2022. That likely has not changed over the last two years. LA should not go for a first-time NBA head coach. They have championship aspirations and a talented roster. They need experience or at least not a head coach who just went 8-24 in the NCAA last season.\n\nHiring Howard as the Lakers head coach would end in total disaster. The NBA veteran is with the Nets and should stay for a few years in hopes of rebuilding his stock. Howard has a high basketball IQ, but things did not end well at Michigan.\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers got fortunate that Howard won't be available, but they still need to make the right head coaching hire. They have had a quit trigger on coaches in recent years but would love to find a long-term replacement. Who gets the gig?

One former player recently gave his take on why Redick isn't a good fit for the LA Lakers, the most recent vacancy in the Western Conference.\n\nAfter being knocked out by the Denver Nuggets in the first round, the Lakers parted ways with Darvin Ham. Among the candidates to surface in reports is Redick. Since retiring, the longtime sharpshooter has explored a career as a TV analyst and podcaster.\n\nOn the \"Run It Back\" show, Lou Williams said that he feels JJ Redick isn't the best fit for the Lakers as coach.\n\n\"There's no chance that JJ Redick is going to be able to command that locker room,\" Williams said. \"Him and LeBron can sit there and drink wine together and break down plays, but it's a little different when you got 20,000 people screaming at you.\"\n\nWilliams is referncing how Redick and LeBron James have teamed up to start their own podcast. A few weeks back, the two put out their first episode of \"Mind the Game.\"\n\nFormer NBA player tosses out crazy JJ Redick-LA Lakers coaching theory\n\nAll the reporting on the LA Lakers' coaching job has named JJ Redick as a name to watch. That led to a former NBA player throwing out a crazy conspiracy theory regarding the longtime 3-point specialist and his recent venture.\n\nOn Gilbert Arena's podcast, Rashad McCants gave his thoughts on Redick and LeBron's show. He feels thata the two came together in an attempt to groom him as the next coach of the Lakers. McCants feels that's why \"Mind the Game\" is so heavily focused on the X's and O's of today's NBA.\n\nIt's worth noting that Redick has an interest in coaching. A few weeks ago, he interviewed for the Charlotte Hornets' vacancy. On \"The Pivot,\" Redick touched on the what if of his eventually breaking into coaching.\n\n\"I've been very open about this. I have a desire to coach in the NBA,\" Redick said. \"I can't say a when and I can't say a definite it's going to happen.\"\n\nWhile Redick might not have any coaching experience, he's more than qualified to make this kind of jump. For starters, he played in the league for 15 years. Since retiring in 2021, he has still been close to the game. Between his podcast and TV appearance, Redick is quite tapped in to the NBA.\n\nAll these factors considering, coaching a team like the Lakers first would be an extremely tough gig.

Here are the pros and cons", "body": "The ESPN broadcaster could be a head coaching option for multiple NBA teams, including the Los Angeles Lakers.\n\nThere aren't many people that have shot up the sports media ranks as quickly as JJ Redick.\n\nThe ESPN broadcaster was named to the network's lead NBA broadcast team earlier this year. Along with Hall of Famers in Mike Breen and Doris Burke, the trio will be calling the NBA Finals.\n\nOn top of this work with ESPN, the 15-year NBA veteran has also created several successful podcasts, most recently one called \"Mind The Game\" which he hosts alongside NBA superstar LeBron James.\n\nRedick has become a fixture in NBA sports media as he's mixed his veteran savvy with an analytical approach to sports that's often associated with pundits who have never played professional basketball. His credibility as an NBA veteran and former college star with Duke has allowed him to create relationships with tons of NBA players and also blend in with the media.\n\nHe's done it all in his post-playing career, despite only retiring from the NBA in 2021.\n\nThe 39-year-old's star has risen so quickly that former ESPN host Dan Le Batard has even said that he believes Redick will make more money throughout his career in sports media than the over $115 million he made over 15 years in the NBA.\n\nHowever, there is something that could pull Redick away from the media very soon -- and that's the chance to return to the NBA as a coach.\n\nRedick has been reported to be a candidate for head coaching roles for the Los Angeles Lakers and the Charlotte Hornets -- despite the fact that he's never been a head coach outside of his 9-year-old son's team.\n\nHe's also admitted that he's been approached by several teams in the past, both as an assistant and head coach, including last year when he was interviewed for the lead coaching gig with the Toronto Raptors.\n\nBut why would Redick pass up a high-paying job in media that he's continuing to grow in order to move over to the stress of the NBA sidelines? Here are the cases for both sides.\n\nGoing to the NBA\n\nThe first case for becoming a coach in the NBA would be the money.\n\nGolden State Warriors head coach Steve Kerr has an annual salary of $17.5 million, the highest in terms of yearly salary. Earlier this year, the Miami Heat's Erik Spoelstra reportedly agreed to the largest contract for an NBA coach ever worth $120 million over eight years.\n\nThe head coaching market has shot up drastically over the past several seasons as multiple coaches have received annual salaries in the tens of millions, though most of them have multiple championships under their belt. Redick would not have that resume, but he would come as a high profile hire -- and probably would drive a hard bargain given he's likely already making nine-figures as a broadcaster.\n\nThe competitiveness and will to win in the league may also be a driver for Redick. The veteran did not finish his career with an NBA championship, and made the Finals only one time during his rookie season.\n\nSince his retirement, Redick has constantly talked about his obsessiveness with the sport from when he was a player and how difficult it was for him to walk away from the game. His podcast with James has also given fans and team officials a public glimpse at Redick's knowledge for the X's and O's of the game -- all while talking to the star of the Lakers.\n\nIt's unclear whether Redick will be able to still have some sort of media presence while coaching -- that may be a lot harder than when he was a player in terms of time and acceptance from team management -- but this option at least gives him the chance to juggle both.\n\nStaying in the Media\n\nBroadcasting and media is not an easy job by any means. The likes of Stephen A. Smith stay up into the wee hours of the night to hop on meetings just to prepare for the early morning show. There are also a ton of late nights and weekends calling games, which will certainly be on Redick's schedule. That's all on top of his other endeavors, like running \"ThreeFourTwo Productions,\" his company that hosts several of his podcasts.\n\nBut many would argue that it's no where near as stressful as coaching. The managing of players and the game is only a part of the job, which includes speaking to the media and taking criticism. NBA coaches are constantly fired -- which explains the openings that are available -- and the lack of job security could be an issue.\n\nRedick's coaching performance could also significantly change the brand he's built which has made him so successful in the media space.\n\nThere's also the case that Redick could eventually make the same money -- if not more -- in the media. ESPN is reportedly paying Pat McAfee around $17 million per year, while Stephen A. Smith is at $12 million. The latter's number is also expected to skyrocket if he re-signs.\n\nWhile those two are more studio hosts, there's also Troy Aikman, who calls \"Monday Night Football,\" who is reportedly receiving $18 million a year. Redick could work for a contract similar to his NBA coaching salary while still having the flexibility to work on his other endeavors that could have unlimited earning potential.\n\nThe media role has also allowed him to live in New York with his family. Redick has stressed the importance of this as toward the tail end of his career, he was searching for East Coast teams to play for so he could be near his wife and sons.\n\nRedick has shot his podcast and some ESPN segments from New York, while traveling out for games and returning home afterwards. But a head coaching job will surely mean time away from his family or needing them to uproot to his new team's location.\n\nMore Sports Media:\n\nConclusion\n\nUltimately, this is a great problem for Redick to have, as either job will pay him well and keep him around the game he loves. He's already showcased his abilities with a headset, so trying his hand at coaching and returning to media eventually will be on the table.\n\nThis will likely just come down to whether Redick has that fire to become a coach and see how he can lead an NBA franchise to the promised land.", "source": {"uri": "thestreet.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TheStreet"}, "authors": [{"uri": "colin_salao@thestreet.com", "name": "Colin Salao", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JJ_Redick", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "JJ Redick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Breen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mike Breen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doris_Burke", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Doris Burke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_Blue_Devils_men's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Duke Blue Devils men's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naismith_Memorial_Basketball_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_Spoelstra", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Erik Spoelstra"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_A._Smith", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stephen A.

That would mean it will continue to be in win-now mode, which means it will need a coach who has the right stuff now, as opposed to someone who could grow into a good coach in a few years.\n\nLos Angeles' top candidates right now seem to be (in no particular order) Tyronn Lue, Kenny Atkinson, Mike Budenholzer and JJ Redick. Terry Stotts, the former Portland Trail Blazers head coach, is another name that has come up. But some want L.A. to think outside the box and go with a more innovative choice, even if it means hiring another first-timer.\n\nAccording to Dan Woike, David Adelman and Micah Nori, both of whom are currently assistant coaches, could be candidates to become the Lakers' next head coach.\n\nVia Los Angeles Times:\n\n\"In addition to Atkinson and Stotts, Denver [Nuggets] assistant coach David Adelman and Minnesota [Timberwolves] assistant coach Micah Nori are both highly regarded inside the Lakers' organization, according to people with knowledge of the situation not authorized to speak publicly.\"\n\nAdelman is the son of Rick Adelman, who Lakers fans will remember as the head coach of the Sacramento Kings teams of the early 2000s that couldn't get past the Purple and Gold in the playoffs. He has been an assistant coach for eight seasons, one of which was spent serving under Frank Vogel, who later went on to coach the Lakers to the NBA championship.\n\nBefore that, he was a player development coach under his father about a decade ago.\n\nLike his father, the younger Adelman is considered a sharp offensive mind. According to a Sports Illustrated Fan Nation article, he has had a hand in maximizing Nikola Joki\u0107's triple-threat skills in Denver's offense.\n\nNori was an assistant in Denver under Michael Malone several years ago, and it was there where he forged a relationship with Chris Finch, Minnesota's head coach. With Finch crippled due to a freak knee injury he suffered days ago during a playoff game versus the Phoenix Suns, Nori has taken on a more prominent role on the sideline as his team takes on the Nuggets in the Western Conference semifinals.\n\nHis team scored a 106-99 win on Saturday in Game 1 versus the defending world champs. He is considered very smart when it comes to basketball, but he is also smart when it comes to making players, reporters and fans laugh.\n\nNot only could the Lakers use a fresh voice and some sincere resourcefulness on the sideline, but perhaps they could also use a little humor from time to time, especially when they hear what they need to hear.", "source": {"uri": "lebronwire.usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "LeBron Wire"}, "authors": [{"uri": "robert_marvi@lebronwire.usatoday.com", "name": "Robert Marvi", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Stotts", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Terry Stotts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Adelman_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "David Adelman (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JJ_Redick", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "JJ Redick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darvin_Ham", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Darvin Ham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Adelman", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rick Adelman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Budenholzer", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mike Budenholzer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyronn_Lue", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tyronn Lue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portland_Trail_Blazers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Portland Trail Blazers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacramento_Kings", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sacramento Kings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Joki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nikola Joki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Malone_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Malone (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Vogel", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Frank Vogel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_Suns", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix Suns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_Illustrated", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sports Illustrated"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Western Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cheerleading/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cheerleading/Organizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://lebronwire.usatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/37/2024/05/USATSI_22730412-e1714992195722.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538226", "eventUri": "eng-9538226", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 139, "relevance": 1}

While analysts and fans have begun articulating the next choice for the position, JJ Redick's name has sprung up continuously. Owing to his association with LeBron James via the 'Mind the Game' podcast, many consider it a deal-clincher. However, 3x Sixth Man of the Year Lou Williams doesn't agree with the popular opinion.\n\nHe doesn't believe that the 39-year-old has the experience to deal with the locker room situation. The former Clippers star claimed that Redick is still not well-equipped to deal with the locker room situations, and the high pressure that comes with coaching a high-market team like the Lakers. On the 'Run It Back' pod, Williams expressed that Redick may not be ready to coach the Lakers,\n\n\"There's no chance that JJ Redick is going to be able to command that locker room. Yeah, him and LeBron, sitting and drinking wine together, breaking down plays but it is different when 20,000 people screaming at you and you gotta 11 other players you gotta manage as well.\"\n\nAs per Sweet Lou, Tyronn Lue is the perfect fit for the job since he is known for his high-quality communication with players. He also prefers Lue over any other coaching candidate because he led LeBron James to the NBA Finals for three straight years and has extensive experience in handling the King,\n\n\"He's been there already with LeBron. He has already had the experience, he has already shared the locker room with him and been able to manage him and win a championship with him.\"\n\nWhile Williams isn't sold on the idea of Redick being the helmsman for the Lakers, Skip Bayless viewed the situation differently. He likened JJ Redick's appearance to Pat Riley and found him a perfect fit for the Los Angeles Hollywood culture.\n\nOn 'Undisputed', Bayless likened Redick to Pat Riley. Since Riley coached the ShowTime Lakers to five champions, Redick's facial resemblance does bring in the vibes of the 3x COTY.\n\nMeanwhile, he also pointed out the chemistry between Redick and LeBron James during the Mind the Game podcast. Despite these two factors, he considers Redick a \"high risk, high reward\" pick because he lacks the experience to command a team,\n\n\"His connection with LeBron James seems pretty strong because they are vibing on this podcast.

After two years of mixed results, the Lakers' front office has decided to steer the team in a new direction.\n\nTime will only tell whether it was the right or wrong decision. Nonetheless, Los Angeles will look for the 29th head coach in franchise history, and the candidates are already flying through. The Lakers have a list of veteran, experienced coaches as well as young, soon-to-be first-time head coaches. The purple and gold have their options, but none may not be more attractive than former NBA sharpshooter and current ESPN broadcaster JJ Redick.\n\nAlthough Redick has zero coaching experience, there is no questioning his basketball IQ. Whether you're hearing him on the broadcast or listening to him on his podcasts, \"The Old Man and The Three,\" or his other podcast with Lakers superstar LeBron James, \"Mind The Game.\"\n\nIt is very tricky and a significant risk to go with someone with zero coaching experience at the end of the day. Still, it could be worth something, especially with James' insight on Reddick. Some could see it happen, like Bleacher Report's Eric Pincus. In his latest column, Pincus tries to make sense of the Lakers bringing aboard Reddick.\n\n\"His [Reddick] connection to James is undeniable. Assuming the team chooses to stay the course with the 39-year-old legend, at roughly $162 million for three more years, that connection matters.\"\n\n\"It's presumptive to say James wants Redick, but the two share a common view of the game and a natural trust. Unless the Los Angeles Clippers scapegoat Tyronn Lue for yet another Kawhi Leonard-less postseason, Redick seems the most logical choice.\"\n\nJames could put in a word for the 39-year-old former player. The two have spent a ton of time already, and maybe this was already in the making with starting this podcast together. Who knows, but if you watch or listen to the podcast, James and Redick see the game in a similar way and share the same point of view. Whether that can work out in a player-coach setting is an entirely different ball game.\n\nEven before the 2023-2024 season, Redick was a hot commodity to join a coaching staff as an assistant. Redick turned down multiple tenures, most notably the Boston Celtics. The 39-year-old told sportswriter Pablo Torres he'd rather coach his nine-year-old's son's team than Celtics superstar Jayson Tatum.\n\n\"I could be helping [Jayson] Tatum win a championship. Instead, I'm trying to figure out how a nine-year-old can beat a 2-3 zone,\"\n\nThe coaching bug is apparent, as he told Dan Patrick last May that he misses basketball and could seize a coaching opportunity if he sees fit.\n\n\"You certainly miss the competitive side of professional basketball when you retire, and that's probably the biggest itch,\" Redick told the last May. \"... I'm in a fortunate situation that I can kind of wait and see if there's anything that materializes that's sort of a perfect fit.\"\n\nThe Lakers will do their due diligence. It will be a long road ahead, and they must get it right.

The firing was then officially announced on Friday.\n\nNow that Ham has been let go, how much time will elapse until we start seeing our favorite NBA head coach free agent carousel names?\n\nAnd though the above names will certainly make the rounds and maybe even land an interview, it is time to inject some youth into this list.\n\nNo one doubts that JJ Reddick has a fantastic basketball mind and would probably make for a great NBA head coach one day. However, no one expected his name to be front and center for the Lakers head coach position for as soon as the 2024-2025 season.\n\nThe fact that he is chummy with LeBron James (they have a podcast together) both helps and hurts him. Gone are the days of LeBron dictating to ownership what moves to make - LeBron's decision to trade for Rusell Westbrook may have actually cost him a fifth championship. If LeBron asks Rob Pelinka to bring in a first time head coach in JJ - it will be treated as an opinion - and not a demand.\n\nHowever, JJ may indeed be a serious head coach talent; his Charlotte interview last week seemed to catch many by surprise. We all thought JJ was going full throttle with his NBA media career, and now he's dipping his toes into the cruel world of the NBA head coaching carousel. He's currently the odds on favorite for the job according to the best NBA sportsbooks.\n\nThe biggest knock on Rondo as a head coach candidate may be his off-court issues, and he may need a few years of good behavior to truly be considered. As for on the court, Rondo would certainly maximize the talent of any NBA roster and has long been thought of as a serious, future NBA head coach.\n\nHis familiarity with this roster, namely LeBron & AD is important. Rondo was probably the 3rd best player on the Lakers 2020 championship team. If there is anyone in the league who knows how to maximize what is left of the LeBron/AD duo it is absolutely Rajon Rondo: he did it with his bare hands on the floor. Of course he can do it with a clipboard in a suit on the sidelines.\n\nHowever, Rondo is indeed a mercurial NBA character, and seems to carry more risk than squeaky clean JJ Reddick.\n\nMike Budenholzer's firing by the Bucks last summer was litigated to no end. A championship, a first round exit, and an anxious superstar. Sound familiar?\n\nWhether or not it was fair for coach Bud to be fired is irrelevant. What matters is that he lost a power struggle with a superstar. That fact alone would automatically disqualify anyone for a head coaching gig in Tinseltown.\n\nHis head coach qualifications are undeniable (despite his inability to call timeout during critical NBA playoff games) but he may be better suited to a quieter franchise and with more patience and control.\n\nI and most writers would be lying if we said we are familiar with Phil Handy's coaching style, X's and O's knowledge, and any other NBA head coach candidate traits.\n\nBut we do know one important thing: rumors abound this past season that Lakers players all wanted Handy to replace Ham as head coach. That may be Handy's strongest qualification - player support - which gets him this gig.\n\nAdditionally, and perhaps just as importantly, is Handy's relationship with Austin Reaves. Reaves' ascension to 3rd member of the Lakers Big 3 didn't quite come to fruition this past season, and it may be the final piece of the puzzle for the Lakers to get one more crack at a Finals appearance. Reaves is on record with crediting Phil Handy for helping him to develop his game. Imagine if Handy can help AR-15 step into a bigger role: All Star production from a $13 million per year player is the type of roster trait that separates generic playoff teams from championship contenders.\n\nIs it premature for Chris Paul to be an NBA head coach? CP3's quest for an NBA ring is long documented. And he may very well join this Lakers' roster as a minimum contract backup point guard who can close a few games. But why stop there? Don't we trust Paul to determine his own minutes? To decide if he or Gabe Vincent should take on certain defensive assignments? To put the ball in Austin Reaves hands rather than his own?\n\nCP3 has already been linked to San Antonio in the form of a player coach - Greg Popovich has recently publicly praised CP3 and likely wants him to come in and help mold future superstar Victor Wembanyama.\n\nBut San Antonio is at least 2 years away from contention. CP3 likely sees Los Angeles as a legitimate championship opportunity, and would instantly command respect from each player. A player coach situation / or perhaps a Phil Handy + CP3 playing and coaching situation seems like a possibility.\n\nAs mentioned above, no NBA head coach candidate listicle is complete without mentioning Mark Jackson, Mike D'Antoni, Jeff Van Gundy, and newcomer Kenny Atkinson. Terry Stotts was on this list for a while but recently fell off. Sam Cassell has the distinct honor of being on this list without having yet served as a head coach. Each of the above is technically a candidate, but there seems to be a reason why none have been hired by a franchise for quite some time, or at all.\n\nAnd finally, it would be malpractice to write an article about the next Lakers head coach without at least mentioning Phil Jackson. No, not as a head coach, but perhaps as an advisor. We know that Jackson still talks with Lakers decider-in-chief Jeanie Buss. And perhaps more curiously, Phil's name has been popping up in recent player quotes from around the league, including Kristaps Porzingis, Coby White, Derek Fisher, among others. However, with LeBron possessing outsized leverage this summer and a noted frosty relationship with Phil; don't expect the Zenmaster to be involved this time around.\n\nOur final Lakers head coach

The Athletic's Shams Charania and Jovan Buha have reported that the team's candidates for their next HC include Mike Budenholzer, J.J. Reddick, Kenny Atkinson, and Ty Lue at the moment.\n\nThe writer of Showtime: Magic, Kareem, Riley, and the Los Angeles Lakers Dynasty of the 1980s, Jeff Pearlman, thinks the Lakers would be smart to consider another option -- South Carolina women's basketball coach Dawn Staley.\n\nPearlman said after the Ham firing, \"the Lakers should be reaching out to Dawn Staley ASAP.\"\n\nStaley has become one of the most successful basketball coaches at the NCAA level. She has led the Gamecocks to three national championship titles, including one this year as the team went undefeated throughout the entire season. South Carolina has become a dynasty under Staley, with the team losing a total of three games over the last three seasons. She has an incredible .806 win percentage as South Carolina's coach and has won the Naismith Coach of the Year award four different times.\n\nThere has been no report yet on if the Lakers are considering Staley as a candidate, or if Staley is even interested in leaving South Carolina to coach in the NBA.\n\nIn the unlikely scenario that the Lakers were to end up hiring Staley, she would make history as the first woman to become a full-time NBA head coach.

Smith has butted heads with Shannon Sharpe over LeBron James' role in the downfalls of some of the NBA great's former head coaches.\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers recently fired Darvin Ham, meaning the 20-time All-Star will likely soon work with a 10th different head coach during his pro career.\n\nThe discussion came in reaction to ESPN analyst Michael Wilbon's recent criticism of James, 39, for dodging accountability in Ham's failed tenure as the Lakers head coach.\n\nSharpe, 55, and Smith, 56, debated whether having 10 different head coaches on his resume could hurt the 6-foot-9 forward's NBA GOAT case.\n\nThe NFL Hall-of-Famer said the number would actually help his legacy considering how much he's won despite having little stability on the coaching front.\n\nHe agreed that James should take on a greater degree of responsibility for the shortcomings of his teams -- the same way he's received praise for their successes.\n\nBut looking at the situation \"through LeBron's prism,\" Sharpe said that James' basketball IQ allows him to assess whether or not the person in charge is good enough to lead the team to success.\n\nStephen A. joked he would call into Sharpe's Nightcap podcast to disagree with his colleague's take.\n\n\"I don't know what the hell is coming out of your mouth.\n\n\"Oh, no, no, no, no. He doesn't get away with this.\"\n\nSmith agreed that James is a \"basketball savant\" -- but pointed out that \"with greatness comes great responsibility.\"\n\nHe then suggested that while the four-time MVP is capable of determining whether a head coach is right for the job, he should be able to recognize the candidate's fit before the hire is made.\n\nStephen A. then said James should have pressed the Cleveland Cavaliers to put Tyronn Lue in charge instead of David Blatt on his reunion with the Cavs in 2014.\n\nOn the other hand, the First Take star reminded, the 6-foot-9 forward played a role in bringing Russell Westbrook to the Lakers in 2021 despite the 2017 MVP's questionable fit.\n\nLos Angeles dismantled a roster that won the championship a season earlier to trade for Westbrook, contributing to a down season and head coach Frank Vogel's firing a year later.\n\n\"We can't sit up here and say it's a star's league, and watch this man literally not accepting accountability for any kind of decision that's made,\" Smith said.\n\nHe then mocked James and his camp for suggesting he has nothing to do with who's hired as head coach on his team -- or with the firing of any of his head coaches.\n\n\"This brother is so innocent he puts Gandhi to shame,\" Stephen A. quipped.\n\nHam left the Lakers with a 90-74 record in two seasons, during which he led the team to a 2023 Western Conference Finals appearance and a victory in the inaugural in-season tournament.\n\nESPN analyst and James' podcast partner JJ Redick is said to be among the candidates for the job alongside Mike Budenholzer and Kenny Atkinson.", "source": {"uri": "the-sun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The US Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "damian_burchardt@the-sun.com", "name": "Damian Burchardt", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shannon_Sharpe", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shannon Sharpe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_A._Smith", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stephen A.

JJ Redick is a high-profile figure among players and the media landscape, but he lacks crucial coaching experience. Those rumors could be linked to a number of different things, but Redick shouldn't be the choice as the Lakers' next head coach.\n\nApproximately two decades ago, the State of California made the unconventional choice of electing Arnold Schwarzenegger, an Austrian-American bodybuilder and well-known Hollywood actor, as its Governor.\n\nLacking any political background in governance, Schwarzy instead capitalized on his high-profile celebrity status and populist appeal to voters.\n\nSo, yes, Californians do embrace outsiders with fresh perspectives and bold leadership.\n\nFollowing the Lakers' decision to part ways with Darvin Ham after their underwhelming first-round exit against the Denver Nuggets, Rob Pelinka and the Lakers front office now face the monumental task of picking the team's next head coach. The candidacy of JJ Redick, a 15-year NBA player and growing superstar in the media landscape, has floated around.\n\nJJ Redick Debate: The Good JJ Redick's career and basketball mind have earned him the respect of all his peers\n\nOver the past three years, JJ Redick's podcast, \"The Old Man and the Three\", has featured interviews with over 190 professionals from the basketball world. These include active players, retired legends, college coaches and dynasty-building general managers.\n\nWith a 15-year NBA career spanning across six teams, Duke's all-time leading scorer has earned a stellar reputation and valuable connections throughout the league, both among players and executives.\n\nThrough his presence on social media, engaging podcasts, and blunt expertise as an analyst on ESPN, JJ Redick has emerged as one of the most respected figures in the NBA media landscape. And rightfully so; the sharpshooter holds genuine affection for the sport and promotes healthy discussions focused on the on-court product.\n\nThis desire for better-educated basketball discourse strikes particularly in his newest podcast, where he and co-host LeBron James delve into the X's and O's of the NBA - an intricate aspect of the sport often overlooked despite its significance. The reasoning behind the podcast is quite neat; enlighten fans with the insights of two brilliant basketball minds and foster deeper discussion about tactical battles.\n\nAnd the initial results have been astonishing. In the clip above, James draws a sideline-out-of-bounds set called \"Winner\" or \"Victory\", which aims to free up a movement shooter and was democratized by Brad Stevens' Boston Celtics around nine years ago.\n\nAlongside his strong player relations and keen eye for finely crafted playbooks, Redick's rumored coaching aspirations align with a broader trend of younger figures earning the trust of entire organizations as head coaches. The former Blue Devil would join the ranks of Mark Daigneault, Will Hardy and Joe Mazzula in this surging wave of youthful coaching talent.\n\nAnd... that's probably it in regards to the benefits of hiring Redick as the head coach of your NBA team.\n\nJJ Redick Debate: The Bad Redick's lack of experience and growing online influence remain significant pushbacks\n\nJJ Redick's main argument revolves around his extensive NBA career and youthful perspective, which shines in his keen insight into the requisites of the modern basketball era and, perhaps more importantly, the credibility his persona commands. But players also had tremendous respect for Ham both personally and professionally - yet a noticeable rift between Ham and his team developed throughout the season.\n\nCrafting a lasting synergy and cohesive identity within a group is paramount for a head coach and Darvin Ham failed to do just that. Amid the inconsistency in Ham's lineup decisions and his reluctance to adjust defensive coverages mid-game, the team strayed from the continuity they had diligently worked on during the offseason.\n\nMore than merely inherent to his coaching style, this ever-changing reactivity could be interpreted as a sign of a novice head coach grappling with the challenges of leading a team that, despite evident structural flaws, was presumably built for championship contention. He stepped into a role where he wouldn't be allowed to fail.\n\nHeading the coaching staff of arguably the greatest basketball player ever, within the most scrutinized franchise in the universe as we know it, Ham's position was precarious the very moment he arrived in Los Angeles. He had minimal margin for error - even as a first-time head coach - and it ended how it was supposed to.\n\nNow, why would the Lakers want to try that route again with someone whose sole coaching experience lies with his 10-year-old son's travel team, especially given their pressing timeline concerns despite LeBron's ongoing defiance against fathertime?\n\nRedick is so glaringly under-qualified that an appointment to such a prestigious position would be unprecedented in NBA history. Moreover, Redick's burgeoning influence in the media scene suggests a completely different career trajectory for now.\n\nRisking his revered reputation and media presence for the most-intensively scrutinized job in the league - as tempting as it may seem - doesn't make much sense from a rational standpoint. And JJ has proven to be a rational man.\n\nJJ Redick Debate: The Ugly Behind those rumors lies a much simpler scheme\n\nFor all those aforementioned reasons, the rumors surrounding JJ Redick as a potential NBA head coach seem highly unrealistic and borderline foolish. They either prompt questions about their purpose, or cause concerns about the direction the Lakers are heading in.\n\nThe truth is, JJ Redick shouldn't, and likely won't, land the Lakers' head coaching job, and neither will he take the reins of the Charlotte Hornets despite previous rumors. He won't, and neither should he want to - because if he really did, he would've pursued an assistant coach role long ago instead of opting for the TV talking head route.\n\nThat doesn't mean Redick will never coach at the NBA level. Heck, he's got some highly redeeming qualities, and you can only admire his ability to limpidly articulate intricate concepts.\n\nThe league has a history of bilaterally blurring lines between analysts and decision-makers, so it wouldn't be shocking to see JJ on a coaching staff or in an executive role eventually. But for now, those rumors are probably part of a much simpler scheme.\n\nThis has the feeling of a favor from the league, aimed at elevating JJ's influential voice even further. Dubbed as \"the spiritual representative of well-educated NBA fans\", Redick's name is gaining steam within fanbases because he possesses a platform to showcase his gifted mind and communication skills, while other candidates are busy yelling at NBA and college players alike.\n\nAs a prominent figure in the emerging landscape of informed NBA content and basketball discourse, Redick's involvement in those rumors only bolsters his credibility in the eyes of the entire NBA fandom. It serves both him and the league, while crediting teams for thinking \"outside the box\" in their head coaching searches.\n\nWhile acknowledging each of the 1,950 threes he nailed in his career and his reputation as the voice of nuance and intellect on ESPN's First Take, Redick may be better suited to teach players about public relations strategies, than uniting a group through the highs-and-lows of an NBA season and its ensuing playoffs dramas.\n\nBecause coaching in the NBA requires craft and experience, and because he, himself, and the NBA have other plans for his beloved status, Redick shouldn't be coaching from the Lakers' bench anytime soon.\n\nRelated Lakers' Possible Replacements for Darvin Ham Named After the Los Angeles Lakers dismissed Darvin Ham on Friday, possible replacements were reported.", "source": {"uri": "givemesport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GiveMeSport"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JJ_Redick", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "JJ Redick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darvin_Ham", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Darvin Ham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Pelinka", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rob Pelinka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold_Schwarzenegger", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arnold Schwarzenegger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_New_York", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor of New York"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Stevens", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brad Stevens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_Blue_Devils", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Duke Blue Devils"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Take_(talk_show)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "First Take (talk show)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte_Hornets", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charlotte Hornets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_relations", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Public relations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://static0.givemesportimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/mixcollage-04-may-2024-11-34-pm-2759.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538226", "eventUri": "eng-9538226", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 127, "relevance": 1}

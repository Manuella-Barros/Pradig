Source: Reuters\n\nThe Centre has taken permission from the Election Commission to lift the ban on exports of onion in view of the ongoing implementation of the Model Code of Conduct due to the Lok Sabha elections, sources said.\n\nAccording to government sources, the Department of Revenue under the finance ministry took the permission from the Election Commission to lift the ban on onion exports, subject to conditions of 40 per cent export duty, and also a minimum export price (MEP) of USD 550 per tonne.\n\nThe government on Saturday lifted the ban on onion exports, a decision that can help boost income of a large section of farmers and comes ahead of the Lok Sabha polls in key producing regions including Maharashtra.\n\nThe government has imposed a minimum export price (MEP) of USD 550 per tonne (around Rs 46 per kg) as well as 40 per cent export duty. Taking duty into account, the shipments will not be allowed below USD 770 per tonne (around Rs 64 per kg).\n\nThe decision to lift the ban on exports of onion was on the recommendation of the Department of Consumer Affairs, which monitors the availability and price situation of onion in the country.\n\nOn December 8 last year, the Centre had banned onion exports in early December to control retail prices amid concerns over likely fall in production. During the last 4-5 years, the country annually exported between 17 lakh and 25 lakh tonnes of onions.\n\nConsumer Affairs Secretary Nidhi Khare on Saturday said the lifting of the ban would not lead to any price rise in retail markets.\n\n\"Prices will remain stable. If at all there is any increase, it should be very marginal,\" she said on Saturday, while asserting that the government is committed to protect the interests of both consumers and farmers.\n\nThe directorate general of foreign trade (DGFT) in a notification on May 4, said that \"the export policy of onions is amended from prohibited to free subject to MEP of USD 550 per metric tonne with immediate effect and until further orders.\" On May 3, the finance ministry imposed a 40 per cent export duty.\n\nThe decision assumes importance as it comes before the crucial Lok Sabha polls in key onion belts like Nashik, Ahmednagar and Solapur in Maharashtra. Farmers of this region have been demanding a lifting of the ban so that they can get a better price for their produce.\n\nExplaining the rationale behind the decision, Khare said the \"ban on onion exports has been removed from today (Saturday) because the supply situation is comfortable and prices are stable in both mandies as well as retail markets.\" The modal price at Lasalgaon mandi in Nashik was Rs 15 per kg in April.\n\nShe said the decision has been taken after considering the latest estimates of onion production in rabi season at 191 lakh tonnes, which is comfortable. Availability and prices of onion in global markets were also factored in while taking this decision.\n\nThe secretary said the monthly domestic demand of onion is around 17 lakh tonnes.\n\n\"Lifting of the ban would also encourage the farmers to put more area under onions. The monsoon forecast is above normal,\" Khare said.\n\nThe secretary noted that the decision has been taken after wider discussions with stakeholders. A high-level team also visited key onion producing belts in Maharashtra to assess the ground situation.\n\nKhare also pointed out that the shelf life of onions is less and therefore a need was felt to export onions.\n\nThe secretary said that the government is procuring 5 lakh tonnes of onions as buffer stock, so that it can intervene in the market in case of price rise.\n\n\"We are continuously monitoring the prices of all essential food items. We will continue to keep a watch on the availability and price situation,\" she said.\n\nA senior government official explained that there is an inter-ministerial committee (IMC) which reviews the prices, production, availability and exports of essential food items including onions.\n\n\"So do not think of this as an isolated instance of decision making by IMC,\" the official said, when asked whether the decision has been made in view of general elections.\n\nThe official said the IMC has been taking a series of steps in various commodities including wheat and rice to boost domestic supply and keep prices under check.\n\nIn March, the Union Agriculture Ministry released the data for onion production.\n\nAs per the data, onion production in 2023-24 (First Advance Estimates) is expected to be around 254.73 lakh tonnes compared to around 302.08 lakh tonnes last year. This is due to a decrease of 34.31 lakh tonnes output in Maharashtra, 9.95 lakh tonnes in Karnataka, 3.54 lakh tonnes in Andhra Pradesh and 3.12 lakh tonnes in Rajasthan, the data showed.\n\nLast month, in an official statement, the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution said the government has allowed export of 99,150 tonnes of onion to six neighbouring countries of Bangladesh, UAE, Bhutan, Bahrain, Mauritius and Sri Lanka.\n\nThe Congress last month accused the Narendra Modi government of \"callously neglecting\" Maharashtra's onion farmers affected due to the ban on onion exports and said that its manifesto promises a predictable import-export policy to prevent such catastrophic last-minute policies being imposed on farmers.\n\nCatch the latest stock market updates here.

Taking duty into account, the shipments will not be allowed below $770 per tonne (around Rs 64 per kg).\n\nThe decision to lift the ban on exports of onion was on the recommendation of the Department of Consumer Affairs, which monitors the availability and price situation of onion in the country.\n\nAccording to government sources, the Department of Revenue under the Finance Ministry took permission from the ECI to lift the ban on onion exports.\n\nThe decision assumes importance as it comes before the crucial Lok Sabha polls in key onion belts like Nashik, Ahmednagar and Solapur in Maharashtra. Farmers of this region have been demanding a lifting of the ban so that they can get a better price for their produce.\n\nImpact on prices\n\nOn December 8 last year, the Centre had banned onion exports in early December to control retail prices amid concerns over likely fall in production. During the last 4-5 years, the country annually exported between 17 lakh and 25 lakh tonnes of onions.\n\nConsumer Affairs Secretary Nidhi Khare on May 4 said the lifting of the ban would not lead to any price rise in retail markets. \"Prices will remain stable. If at all there is any increase, it should be very marginal,\" she said, while asserting that the government is committed to protect the interests of both consumers and farmers.\n\nThe Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) in a notification on May 4, said that \"the export policy of onions is amended from prohibited to free subject to MEP of USD 550 per metric tonne with immediate effect and until further orders.\" On May 3, the Finance Ministry imposed a 40 per cent export duty.\n\nExplaining the rationale behind the decision, Ms. Khare said the \"ban on onion exports has been removed from today (Saturday) because the supply situation is comfortable and prices are stable in both mandies as well as retail markets.\" The modal price at Lasalgaon mandi in Nashik was Rs 15 per kg in April.\n\nShe said the decision has been taken after considering the latest estimates of onion production in rabi season at 191 lakh tonnes, which is comfortable. Availability and prices of onion in global markets were also factored in while taking this decision.\n\nThe Secretary said the monthly domestic demand for onion is around 17 lakh tonnes. \"Lifting the ban would also encourage the farmers to put more area under onions. The monsoon forecast is above normal,\" she said.\n\nShe noted that the decision was taken after wider discussions with stakeholders. A high-level team also visited key onion-producing belts in Maharashtra to assess the ground situation.\n\nMs. Khare also pointed out that the shelf life of onions is less and therefore a need was felt to export onions. She said that the government is procuring 5 lakh tonnes of onions as buffer stock, and it can intervene in the market in case of price rise.\n\n\"We are continuously monitoring the prices of all essential food items. We will continue to keep a watch on the availability and price situation,\" she said.\n\nA senior government official explained that there is an inter-ministerial committee (IMC) which reviews the prices, production, availability and exports of essential food items, including onions. \"So do not think of this as an isolated instance of decision making by IMC,\" the official said, when asked whether the decision has been made in view of general elections.\n\nThe official said the IMC has been taking a series of steps in various commodities including wheat and rice to boost domestic supply and keep prices under check.\n\nIn March, the Union Agriculture Ministry released the data for onion production. As per the data, onion production in 2023-24 (First Advance Estimates) is expected to be around 254.73 lakh tonnes compared to around 302.08 lakh tonnes last year. This is due to a decrease of 34.31 lakh tonnes output in Maharashtra, 9.95 lakh tonnes in Karnataka, 3.54 lakh tonnes in Andhra Pradesh and 3.12 lakh tonnes in Rajasthan, the data showed.\n\nLast month, in an official statement, the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution said the government has allowed export of 99,150 tonnes of onion to six neighbouring countries of Bangladesh, UAE, Bhutan, Bahrain, Mauritius and Sri Lanka.\n\nThe Congress last month accused the Narendra Modi government of \"callously neglecting\" Maharashtra's onion farmers affected because of the ban on onion exports. In its manifesto, the party promised a predictable import-export policy to prevent such catastrophic last-minute policies being imposed on farmers.\n\nRead Comments", "source": {"uri": "thehindu.com",

Taking duty into account, the shipments will not be allowed below USD 770 per tonne (around Rs 64 per kg).\n\nThe decision to lift the ban on exports of onion was on the recommendation of the Department of Consumer Affairs, which monitors the availability and price situation of onion in the country.\n\nOn December 8 last year, the Centre had banned onion exports in early December to control retail prices amid concerns over likely fall in production. During the last 4-5 years, the country annually exported between 17 lakh and 25 lakh tonnes of onions.\n\nConsumer Affairs Secretary Nidhi Khare on Saturday said the lifting of the ban would not lead to any price rise in retail markets.\n\n\"Prices will remain stable. If at all there is any increase, it should be very marginal,\" she said on Saturday, while asserting that the government is committed to protect the interests of both consumers and farmers.\n\nThe directorate general of foreign trade (DGFT) in a notification on May 4, said that \"the export policy of onions is amended from prohibited to free subject to MEP of USD 550 per metric tonne with immediate effect and until further orders.\" On May 3, the finance ministry imposed a 40 per cent export duty.\n\nThe decision assumes importance as it comes before the crucial Lok Sabha polls in key onion belts like Nashik, Ahmednagar and Solapur in Maharashtra. Farmers of this region have been demanding a lifting of the ban so that they can get a better price for their produce.\n\nExplaining the rationale behind the decision, Khare said the \"ban on onion exports has been removed from today (Saturday) because the supply situation is comfortable and prices are stable in both mandies as well as retail markets.\" The modal price at Lasalgaon mandi in Nashik was Rs 15 per kg in April.\n\nShe said the decision has been taken after considering the latest estimates of onion production in rabi season at 191 lakh tonnes, which is comfortable. Availability and prices of onion in global markets were also factored in while taking this decision.\n\nThe secretary said the monthly domestic demand of onion is around 17 lakh tonnes.\n\n\"Lifting of the ban would also encourage the farmers to put more area under onions. The monsoon forecast is above normal,\" Khare said.\n\nThe secretary noted that the decision has been taken after wider discussions with stakeholders. A high-level team also visited key onion producing belts in Maharashtra to assess the ground situation.\n\nKhare also pointed out that the shelf life of onions is less and therefore a need was felt to export onions.\n\nThe secretary said that the government is procuring 5 lakh tonnes of onions as buffer stock, so that it can intervene in the market in case of price rise.\n\n\"We are continuously monitoring the prices of all essential food items. We will continue to keep a watch on the availability and price situation,\" she said.\n\nA senior government official explained that there is an inter-ministerial committee (IMC) which reviews the prices, production, availability and exports of essential food items including onions.\n\n\"So do not think of this as an isolated instance of decision making by IMC,\" the official said, when asked whether the decision has been made in view of general elections.\n\nThe official said the IMC has been taking a series of steps in various commodities including wheat and rice to boost domestic supply and keep prices under check.\n\nIn March, the Union Agriculture Ministry released the data for onion production.\n\nAs per the data, onion production in 2023-24 (First Advance Estimates) is expected to be around 254.73 lakh tonnes compared to around 302.08 lakh tonnes last year. This is due to a decrease of 34.31 lakh tonnes output in Maharashtra, 9.95 lakh tonnes in Karnataka, 3.54 lakh tonnes in Andhra Pradesh and 3.12 lakh tonnes in Rajasthan, the data showed.\n\nLast month, in an official statement, the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution said the government has allowed export of 99,150 tonnes of onion to six neighbouring countries of Bangladesh, UAE, Bhutan, Bahrain, Mauritius and Sri Lanka.\n\nThe Congress last month accused the Narendra Modi government of \"callously neglecting\" Maharashtra's onion farmers affected due to the ban on onion exports and said that its manifesto promises a predictable import-export policy to prevent such catastrophic last-minute policies being imposed on farmers.

Taking duty into account, the shipments will not be allowed below $770 per tonne (around Rs 64 per kg).\n\nThe decision to lift the ban on exports of onion was on the recommendation of the Department of Consumer Affairs, which monitors the availability and price situation of onion in the country.\n\nDecember 8 last year, the Centre had banned onion exports in early December to control retail prices amid concerns over a likely fall in production. During the last 4-5 years, the country annually exported between 17 lakh and 25 lakh tonnes of onions.\n\nConsumer Affairs Secretary Nidhi Khare Saturday said the lifting of the ban would not lead to any price rise in retail markets.\n\n\"Prices will remain stable. If at all there is any increase, it should be very marginal,\" she said Saturday while asserting that the government is committed to protect the interests of both consumers and farmers.\n\nThe Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) in a notification May 4, said that \"the export policy of onions is amended from prohibited to free subject to MEP of $550 per metric tonne with immediate effect and until further orders.\"\n\nMay 3, the finance ministry imposed a 40 per cent export duty.\n\nThe decision assumes importance as it comes before the crucial Lok Sabha polls in key onion belts like Nashik, Ahmednagar and Solapur in Maharashtra. Farmers of this region have been demanding a lifting of the ban so that they can get a better price for their produce.\n\nExplaining the rationale behind the decision, Khare said the \"ban on onion exports has been removed from today (Saturday) because the supply situation is comfortable and prices are stable in both mandis as well as retail markets.\" The modal price at Lasalgaon mandi in Nashik was Rs 15 per kg in April.\n\nShe said the decision has been taken after considering the latest estimates of onion production in rabi season at 191 lakh tonnes, which is comfortable. Availability and prices of onion in global markets were also factored in while making this decision.\n\nThe secretary said the monthly domestic demand for onion is around 17 lakh tonnes.\n\n\"Lifting of the ban would also encourage the farmers to put more area under onions. The monsoon forecast is above normal,\" Khare said.\n\nThe secretary noted that the decision has been taken after wider discussions with stakeholders. A high-level team also visited key onion-producing belts in Maharashtra to assess the ground situation.\n\nKhare also pointed out that the shelf life of onions is less and therefore a need was felt to export onions.\n\nThe secretary said that the government is procuring 5 lakh tonnes of onions as buffer stock so that it can intervene in the market in case of a price rise.\n\n\"We are continuously monitoring the prices of all essential food items. We will continue to keep a watch on the availability and price situation,\" she said.\n\nA senior government official explained that there is an inter-ministerial committee (IMC) which reviews the prices, production, availability and exports of essential food items including onions.\n\n\"So do not think of this as an isolated instance of decision making by IMC,\" the official said, when asked whether the decision has been made in view of general elections.\n\nThe official said the IMC has been taking a series of steps in various commodities including wheat and rice to boost domestic supply and keep prices under check.\n\nIn March, the Union Agriculture Ministry released the data for onion production.\n\nAs per the data, onion production in 2023-24 (First Advance Estimates) is expected to be around 254.73 lakh tonnes compared to around 302.08 lakh tonnes last year. This is due to a decrease of 34.31 lakh tonnes output in Maharashtra, 9.95 lakh tonnes in Karnataka, 3.54 lakh tonnes in Andhra Pradesh and 3.12 lakh tonnes in Rajasthan, the data showed.\n\nLast month, in an official statement, the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution said the government has allowed export of 99,150 tonnes of onion to six neighbouring countries of Bangladesh, UAE, Bhutan, Bahrain, Mauritius and Sri Lanka.\n\nThe Congress last month accused the Narendra Modi government of \"callously neglecting\" Maharashtra's onion farmers affected due to the

The monsoon forecast is above normal,\" Khare said.\n\nThe secretary noted that the decision has been taken after wider discussions with stakeholders. A high-level team also visited key onion producing belts in Maharashtra to assess the ground situation.\n\nKhare also pointed out that the shelf life of onions is less and therefore a need was felt to export onions.\n\nThe secretary said that the government is procuring 5 lakh tonnes of onions as buffer stock, so that it can intervene in the market in case of price rise.\n\n\"We are continuously monitoring the prices of all essential food items. We will continue to keep a watch on the availability and price situation,\" she said.\n\nA senior government official explained that there is an inter-ministerial committee (IMC) which reviews the prices, production, availability and exports of essential food items including onions.\n\n\"So do not think of this as an isolated instance of decision making by IMC,\" the official said, when asked whether the decision has been made in view of general elections.\n\nThe official said the IMC has been taking a series of steps in various commodities including wheat and rice to boost domestic supply and keep prices under check.\n\nIn March, the Union Agriculture Ministry released the data for onion production.\n\nAs per the data, onion production in 2023-24 (First Advance Estimates) is expected to be around 254.73 lakh tonnes compared to around 302.08 lakh tonnes last year. This is due to a decrease of 34.31 lakh tonnes output in Maharashtra, 9.95 lakh tonnes in Karnataka, 3.54 lakh tonnes in Andhra Pradesh and 3.12 lakh tonnes in Rajasthan, the data showed.\n\nLast month, in an official statement, the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution said the government has allowed export of 99,150 tonnes of onion to six neighbouring countries of Bangladesh, UAE, Bhutan, Bahrain, Mauritius and Sri Lanka.\n\nThe Congress last month accused the Narendra Modi government of \"callously neglecting\" Maharashtra's onion farmers affected due to the ban on onion exports and said that its manifesto promises a predictable import-export policy to prevent such catastrophic last-minute policies being imposed on farmers.", "source": {"uri":

Taking duty into account, the shipments will not be allowed below USD 770 per tonne (around Rs 64 per kg).\n\nThe decision to lift the ban on exports of onion was on the recommendation of the Department of Consumer Affairs, which monitors the availability and price situation of onion in the country.\n\nOn December 8 last year, the Centre had banned onion exports in early December to control retail prices amid concerns over likely fall in production. During the last 4-5 years, the country annually exported between 17 lakh and 25 lakh tonnes of onions.\n\nConsumer Affairs Secretary Nidhi Khare on Saturday said the lifting of the ban would not lead to any price rise in retail markets.\n\n\"Prices will remain stable. If at all there is any increase, it should be very marginal,\" she said on Saturday, while asserting that the government is committed to protect the interests of both consumers and farmers.\n\nThe directorate general of foreign trade (DGFT) in a notification on May 4, said that \"the export policy of onions is amended from prohibited to free subject to MEP of USD 550 per metric tonne with immediate effect and until further orders.\" On May 3, the finance ministry imposed a 40 per cent export duty.\n\nThe decision assumes importance as it comes before the crucial Lok Sabha polls in key onion belts like Nashik, Ahmednagar and Solapur in Maharashtra. Farmers of this region have been demanding a lifting of the ban so that they can get a better price for their produce.\n\nExplaining the rationale behind the decision, Khare said the \"ban on onion exports has been removed from today (Saturday) because the supply situation is comfortable and prices are stable in both mandies as well as retail markets.\" The modal price at Lasalgaon mandi in Nashik was Rs 15 per kg in April.\n\nShe said the decision has been taken after considering the latest estimates of onion production in rabi season at 191 lakh tonnes, which is comfortable.

The modal price at Lasalgaon mandi in Nashik was Rs 15 per kg in April.She said the decision has been taken after considering the latest estimates of onion production in rabi season at 191 lakh tonnes, which is comfortable.\n\nThe Centre has taken permission from the Election Commission to lift the ban on exports of onion in view of the ongoing implementation of the Model Code of Conduct due to the Lok Sabha elections, sources said.\n\nAccording to government sources, the Department of Revenue under the finance ministry took the permission from the Election Commission to lift the ban on onion exports, subject to conditions of 40 per cent export duty, and also a minimum export price (MEP) of USD 550 per tonne.\n\nThe government on Saturday lifted the ban on onion exports, a decision that can help boost income of a large section of farmers and comes ahead of the Lok Sabha polls in key producing regions including Maharashtra.\n\nThe government has imposed a minimum export price (MEP) of USD 550 per tonne (around Rs 46 per kg) as well as 40 per cent export duty. Taking duty into account, the shipments will not be allowed below USD 770 per tonne (around Rs 64 per kg).\n\nThe decision to lift the ban on exports of onion was on the recommendation of the Department of Consumer Affairs, which monitors the availability and price situation of onion in the country.\n\nOn December 8 last year, the Centre had banned onion exports in early December to control retail prices amid concerns over likely fall in production. During the last 4-5 years, the country annually exported between 17 lakh and 25 lakh tonnes of onions.\n\nConsumer Affairs Secretary Nidhi Khare on Saturday said the lifting of the ban would not lead to any price rise in retail markets.\n\n''Prices will remain stable. If at all there is any increase, it should be very marginal,'' she said on Saturday, while asserting that the government is committed to protect the interests of both consumers and farmers.\n\nThe directorate general of foreign trade (DGFT) in a notification on May 4, said that ''the export policy of onions is amended from prohibited to free subject to MEP of USD 550 per metric tonne with immediate effect and until further orders.'' On May 3, the finance ministry imposed a 40 per cent export duty.\n\nThe decision assumes importance as it comes before the crucial Lok Sabha polls in key onion belts like Nashik, Ahmednagar and Solapur in Maharashtra. Farmers of this region have been demanding a lifting of the ban so that they can get a better price for their produce.\n\nExplaining the rationale behind the decision, Khare said the ''ban on onion exports has been removed from today (Saturday) because the supply situation is comfortable and prices are stable in both mandies as well as retail markets.'' The modal price at Lasalgaon mandi in Nashik was Rs 15 per kg in April.\n\nShe said the decision has been taken after considering the latest estimates of onion production in rabi season at 191 lakh tonnes, which is comfortable. Availability and prices of onion in global markets were also factored in while taking this decision.\n\nThe secretary said the monthly domestic demand of onion is around 17 lakh tonnes.\n\n''Lifting of the ban would also encourage the farmers to put more area under onions. The monsoon forecast is above normal,'' Khare said.\n\nThe secretary noted that the decision has been taken after wider discussions with stakeholders. A high-level team also visited key onion producing belts in Maharashtra to assess the ground situation.\n\nKhare also pointed out that the shelf life of onions is less and therefore a need was felt to export onions.\n\nThe secretary said that the government is procuring 5 lakh tonnes of onions as buffer stock, so that it can intervene in the market in case of price rise.\n\n''We are continuously monitoring the prices of all essential food items. We will continue to keep a watch on the availability and price situation,'' she said.\n\nA senior government official explained that there is an inter-ministerial committee (IMC) which reviews the prices, production, availability and exports of essential food items including onions.\n\n''So do not think of this as an isolated instance of decision making by IMC,'' the official said, when asked whether the decision has been made in view of general elections.\n\nThe official said the IMC has been taking a series of steps in various commodities including wheat and rice to boost domestic supply and keep prices under check.\n\nIn March, the Union Agriculture Ministry released the data for onion production.\n\nAs per the data, onion production in 2023-24 (First Advance Estimates) is expected to be around 254.73 lakh tonnes compared to around 302.08 lakh tonnes last year. This is due to a decrease of 34.31 lakh tonnes output in Maharashtra, 9.95 lakh tonnes in Karnataka, 3.54 lakh tonnes in Andhra Pradesh and 3.12 lakh tonnes in Rajasthan, the data showed.\n\nLast month, in an official statement, the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution said the government has allowed export of 99,150 tonnes of onion to six neighbouring countries of Bangladesh, UAE, Bhutan, Bahrain, Mauritius and Sri Lanka.\n\nThe Congress last month accused the Narendra Modi government of ''callously neglecting'' Maharashtra's onion farmers affected due to the ban on onion exports and said that its manifesto promises a predictable import-export policy to prevent such catastrophic last-minute policies being imposed on farmers.\n\n(This story has not been

Taking duty into account, the shipments will not be allowed below USD 770 per tonne (around Rs 64 per kg).\n\nOn December 8 last year, the Centre had banned onion exports in early December to control retail prices amid concerns over likely fall in production. During the last 4-5 years, the country annually exported between 17 lakh and 25 lakh tonnes of onions.\n\nConsumer Affairs Secretary Nidhi Khare said the lifting of the ban would not lead to any price rise in retail markets.\n\n\"Prices will remain stable. If at all there is any increase, it should be very marginal,\" she said, while asserting that the government is committed to protect the interests of both consumers and farmers.\n\nEarlier in the day, the directorate general of foreign trade (DGFT) said in a notification that \"the export policy of onions is amended from prohibited to free subject to MEP of USD 550 per metric tonne with immediate effect and until further orders.\" Last night, the finance ministry imposed a 40 per cent export duty.\n\nThe decision assumes importance as it comes before the crucial Lok Sabha polls in key onion belts like Nashik, Ahmednagar and Solapur in Maharashtra. Farmers of this region have been demanding a lifting of the ban so that they can get a better price for their produce.\n\nExplaining the rationale behind the decision, Khare said the \"ban on onion exports has been removed from today (Saturday) because the supply situation is comfortable and prices are stable in both mandies as well as retail markets.\" The modal price at Lasalgaon mandi in Nashik was Rs 15 per kg in April.\n\nShe said the decision has been taken after considering the latest estimates of onion production in rabi season at 191 lakh tonnes, which is comfortable. Availability and prices of onion in global markets were also factored in while taking this decision.\n\nThe secretary said the monthly domestic demand of onion is around 17 lakh tonnes.\n\n\"Lifting of the ban would also encourage the farmers to put more area under onions. The monsoon forecast is above normal,\" Khare said.\n\nThe secretary noted that the decision has been taken after wider discussions with stakeholders. A high-level team also visited key onion producing belts in Maharashtra to assess the ground situation.\n\nKhare also pointed out that the shelf life of onions is less and therefore a need was felt to export onions.\n\nThe secretary said that the government is procuring 5 lakh tonnes of onions as buffer stock, so that it can intervene in the market in case of price rise.\n\n\"We are continuously monitoring the prices of all essential food items. We will continue to keep a watch on the availability and price situation,\" she said.\n\nA senior government official explained that there is an inter-ministerial committee (IMC) which reviews the prices, production, availability and exports of essential food items including onions.\n\n\"So do not think of this as an isolated instance of decision making by IMC,\" the official said, when asked whether the decision has been made in view of general elections.\n\nThe official said the IMC has been taking a series of steps in various commodities including wheat and rice to boost domestic supply and keep prices under check.\n\nIn March, the Union Agriculture Ministry released the data for onion production.\n\nAs per the data, onion production in 2023-24 (First Advance Estimates) is expected to be around 254.73 lakh tonnes compared to around 302.08 lakh tonnes last year. This is due to a decrease of 34.31 lakh tonnes output in Maharashtra, 9.95 lakh tonnes in Karnataka, 3.54 lakh tonnes in Andhra Pradesh and 3.12 lakh tonnes in Rajasthan, the data showed.\n\nLast month, in an official statement, the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution said the government has allowed export of 99,150 tonnes of onion to six neighbouring countries of Bangladesh, UAE, Bhutan, Bahrain, Mauritius and Sri Lanka.\n\nThe Congress last month accused the Narendra Modi government of \"callously neglecting\" Maharashtra's onion farmers affected due to the ban on onion exports and said that its manifesto promises a predictable import-export policy to prevent such catastrophic last-minute policies being imposed on farmers.", "source": {"uri":

Experts said that since there is an export ban, this duty will apply to shipments allowed on diplomatic grounds.\n\nOn August 19 last year, the government slapped a 40 per cent export duty, which was brought down to zero on October 28, 2023, after the government imposed a minimum export price of $800/tonne. However, as shipments of onion could not be prohibited as desired amid an increase in domestic prices, the government had slapped a complete prohibition with effect from December 8, 2023, subject to quantities allowed on request of foreign countries on a case-to-case basis.\n\nAs the export ban was to expire on March 31, the commerce ministry issued a notification on March 22, extending the prohibition \"until further orders\".\n\nLast week, the government announced export permits worth 99,150 tonnes of onion to six countries -- Bangladesh, Bhutan, Sri Lanka, UAE, Bahrain and Mauritius, close after allowing 2,000 tonnes of white onion from Gujarat.\n\nNational Cooperative Exports Limited (NCEL) has been appointed the nodal agency for export of all prohibited agri produce including onion, sugar and rice.\n\nIn separate orders last month, the government allowed the export of up to 2,000 tonnes of white onion to the Middle East and some European countries via three specified ports on the west coast after being certified by the Gujarat government. It also had allowed 20,000 tonnes to the UAE and 10,000 tonnes to Sri Lanka. The total quantity of onion permitted for export, so far in the 2024-25 fiscal year exceeds 1.30 lakh tonnes (lt).\n\nThe Consumer Affairs Ministry, in a statement on April 27, said that NCEL has been sourcing the domestic onions to be exported through the e-platform at L1 prices and supplied to the agency or agencies nominated by the government of the destination country at the negotiated rate on a 100 per cent advance payment basis.\n\nThe ministry also said that the procurement target for the onion buffer out of the Rabi 2024 season under the Price Stabilisation Fund (PSF) of the Department of Consumer Affairs has been fixed at 5 lt this year. Central agencies such as NCCF and NAFED are tying up local agencies such as FPOs/FPCs/PACs to support the procurement, storage, and farmer registration to begin the procurement of any store-worthy onion, the government said.\n\nThe Rabi onion production is set to dip to 193 lt in 2023-24 (July-June) as against 236 lt year-ago, a fall of 18 per cent. Rabi onion is critical for the country's onion availability as it contributes 72 -75 per cent of annual production. The Rabi crop is also crucial for ensuring year-round availability of onion as it has a better shelf life compared to Kharif onion and can be stored for supplies till November- December.\n\nSHARE Copy linkEmailFacebookTwitterTelegramLinkedInWhatsAppRedditPublished on May 3, 2024", "source": {"uri": "thehindubusinessline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "@businessline"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Onion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tonne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Customs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prohibition", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Prohibition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_onion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White onion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Finance_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Finance (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gujarat", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gujarat"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gujarat"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lanka", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sri Lanka"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sri Lanka"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Arab_Emirates", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procurement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Procurement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rice", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sugar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sugar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mauritius", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mauritius"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mauritius"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhutan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bhutan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bhutan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bahrain", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bahrain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bahrain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabi_crop", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rabi crop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shelf_life", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shelf life"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakh", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lakh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_year", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fiscal year"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture_and_Forestry/Marketplaces", "label": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture and Forestry/Marketplaces", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Homemaking/Frugality", "label": "dmoz/Home/Homemaking/Frugality", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://bl-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/pu2ie8/article68137236.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/onion%20exports.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538611", "eventUri": "eng-9538611", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-01", "textStart": 59, "textEnd": 66}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-04", "textStart": 142, "textEnd": 147}, {"amb": false, "date": "-08-19", "textStart": 371, "textEnd": 380}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-03-31", "textStart": 872, "textEnd": 880}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-03-22", "textStart": 929, "textEnd": 937}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-27", "textStart": 1853, "textEnd": 1861}], "sentiment": -0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 208, "relevance": 1}

(Representational)\n\nThe government on Saturday lifted the ban on onion exports subject to a minimum export price of USD 550 per tonne, a decision that can help boost income of a large section of farmers and comes ahead of the Lok Sabha polls in key producing regions including Maharashtra.\n\nThe government has imposed a minimum export price (MEP) of USD 550 per tonne (around Rs 46 per kg) as well as 40 per cent export duty. Taking duty into account, the shipments will not be allowed below USD 770 per tonne (around Rs 64 per kg).\n\nOn December 8 last year, the Centre had banned onion exports in early December to control retail prices amid concerns over likely fall in production. During the last 4-5 years, the country annually exported between 17 lakh and 25 lakh tonnes of onions.\n\nConsumer Affairs Secretary Nidhi Khare said the lifting of the ban would not lead to any price rise in retail markets.\n\n\"Prices will remain stable. If at all there is any increase, it should be very marginal,\" she said, while asserting that the government is committed to protect the interests of both consumers and farmers.\n\nEarlier in the day, the directorate general of foreign trade (DGFT) said in a notification that \"the export policy of onions is amended from prohibited to free subject to MEP of USD 550 per metric tonne with immediate effect and until further orders.\" Last night, the finance ministry imposed a 40 per cent export duty.\n\nThe decision assumes importance as it comes before the crucial Lok Sabha polls in key onion belts like Nashik, Ahmednagar and Solapur in Maharashtra. Farmers of this region have been demanding a lifting of the ban so that they can get a better price for their produce.\n\nExplaining the rationale behind the decision, Khare said the \"ban on onion exports has been removed from today (Saturday) because the supply situation is comfortable and prices are stable in both mandies as well as retail markets.\" The modal price at Lasalgaon mandi in Nashik was Rs 15 per kg in April.\n\nShe said the decision has been taken after considering the latest estimates of onion production in rabi season at 191 lakh tonnes, which is comfortable. Availability and prices of onion in global markets were also factored in while taking this decision.\n\nThe secretary said the monthly domestic demand of onion is around 17 lakh tonnes.\n\n\"Lifting of the ban would also encourage the farmers to put more area under onions. The monsoon forecast is above normal,\" Khare said.\n\nThe secretary noted that the decision has been taken after wider discussions with stakeholders. A high-level team also visited key onion producing belts in Maharashtra to assess the ground situation.\n\nKhare also pointed out that the shelf life of onions is less and therefore a need was felt to export onions.\n\nThe secretary said that the government is procuring 5 lakh tonnes of onions as buffer stock, so that it can intervene in the market in case of price rise.\n\n\"We are continuously monitoring the prices of all essential food items. We will continue to keep a watch on the availability and price situation,\" she said.\n\nA senior government official explained that there is an inter-ministerial committee (IMC) which reviews the prices, production, availability and exports of essential food items including onions.\n\n\"So do not think of this as an isolated instance of decision making by IMC,\" the official said, when asked whether the decision has been made in view of general elections.\n\nThe official said the IMC has been taking a series of steps in various commodities including wheat and rice to boost domestic supply and keep prices under check.\n\nIn March, the Union Agriculture Ministry released the data for onion production.\n\nAs per the data, onion production in 2023-24 (First Advance Estimates) is expected to be around 254.73 lakh tonnes compared to around 302.08 lakh tonnes last year. This is due to a decrease of 34.31 lakh tonnes output in Maharashtra, 9.95 lakh tonnes in Karnataka, 3.54 lakh tonnes in Andhra Pradesh and 3.12 lakh tonnes in Rajasthan, the data showed.\n\nLast month, in an official statement, the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution said the government has allowed export of 99,150 tonnes of onion to six neighbouring countries of Bangladesh, UAE, Bhutan, Bahrain, Mauritius and Sri Lanka.\n\nPromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com\n\nThe Congress last month accused the Narendra Modi government of \"callously

If at all there is any increase, it should be very marginal,'' she said, while asserting that the government is committed to protect the interests of both consumers and farmers.\n\nEarlier in the day, the directorate general of foreign trade (DGFT) said in a notification that ''the export policy of onions is amended from prohibited to free subject to MEP of USD 550 per metric tonne with immediate effect and until further orders.'' Last night, the finance ministry imposed a 40 per cent export duty.\n\nThe decision assumes importance as it comes before the crucial Lok Sabha polls in key onion belts like Nashik, Ahmednagar and Solapur in Maharashtra. Farmers of this region have been demanding a lifting of the ban so that they can get a better price for their produce.\n\nExplaining the rationale behind the decision, Khare said the ''ban on onion exports has been removed from today (Saturday) because the supply situation is comfortable and prices are stable in both mandies as well as retail markets.'' The modal price at Lasalgaon mandi in Nashik was Rs 15 per kg in April.\n\nShe said the decision has been taken after considering the latest estimates of onion production in rabi season at 191 lakh tonnes, which is comfortable. Availability and prices of onion in global markets were also factored in while taking this decision.\n\nThe secretary said the monthly domestic demand of onion is around 17 lakh tonnes.\n\n''Lifting of the ban would also encourage the farmers to put more area under onions. The monsoon forecast is above normal,'' Khare said.\n\nThe secretary noted that the decision has been taken after wider discussions with stakeholders. A high-level team also visited key onion producing belts in Maharashtra to assess the ground situation.\n\nKhare also pointed out that the shelf life of onions is less and therefore a need was felt to export onions.\n\nThe secretary said that the government is procuring 5 lakh tonnes of onions as buffer stock, so that it can intervene in the market in case of price rise.\n\n''We are continuously monitoring the prices of all essential food items. We will continue to keep a watch on the availability and price situation,'' she said.\n\nA senior government official explained that there is an inter-ministerial committee (IMC) which reviews the prices, production, availability and exports of essential food items including onions.\n\n''So do not think of this as an isolated instance of decision making by IMC,'' the official said, when asked whether the decision has been made in view of general elections.\n\nThe official said the IMC has been taking a series of steps in various commodities including wheat and rice to boost domestic supply and keep prices under check.\n\nIn March, the Union Agriculture Ministry released the data for onion production.\n\nAs per the data, onion production in 2023-24 (First Advance Estimates) is expected to be around 254.73 lakh tonnes compared to around 302.08 lakh tonnes last year. This is due to a decrease of 34.31 lakh tonnes output in Maharashtra, 9.95 lakh tonnes in Karnataka, 3.54 lakh tonnes in Andhra Pradesh and 3.12 lakh tonnes in Rajasthan, the data showed.\n\nLast month, in an official statement, the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution said the government has allowed export of 99,150 tonnes of onion to six neighbouring countries of Bangladesh, UAE, Bhutan, Bahrain, Mauritius and Sri Lanka.\n\nThe Congress last month accused the Narendra Modi government of ''callously neglecting'' Maharashtra's onion farmers affected due to the ban on onion exports and said that its manifesto promises a predictable import-export policy to prevent such catastrophic last-minute policies being imposed on farmers.\n\n(This story has not been

Parts of India's onion producing belt in the western state of Maharashtra are yet to vote.\n\nWhile lifting the ban, the government also announced a minimum export price of $550 per metric tonne for exports.\n\n\"The export policy of onions is amended from prohibited to free subject to MEP of $550 per metric tonne with immediate effect and until further orders,\" the directorate general of foreign trade (DGFT) said in a notification.\n\n\"This is after taking into account estimated rabi production 2024 and good kharif (summer-sown) prospect because of above normal monsoon.\"\n\nOnions, which are a major ingredient in Indian food and a politically sensitive commodity, are cultivated three times a year - in monsoon, winter and summer.\n\nIndia's onion production in the rabi season in 2024 is estimated to be 19.1 million tonnes, which is a \"comfortable\" level to allow overseas sales given local monthly consumption is about 1.7 million tonnes, a government official said.\n\nTraders estimate that India, which has shorter shipment times than rivals such as China or Egypt for many markets, accounts for more than half of all onion imports by Asian countries.\n\nIndia exported a record 2.5 million metric tonnes of onions in the year-ending March 31, 2023.\n\nLast month, in an official statement, the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution said the government has allowed export of 99,150 tonnes of onion to six neighbouring countries of Bangladesh, UAE, Bhutan, Bahrain, Mauritius and Sri Lanka.\n\nCountries such as Bangladesh, Malaysia, Nepal and the United Arab Emirates rely on imports from India to fill domestic gaps in onion supply and many of those nations have struggled with high prices after the ban.\n\nWhile putting onion export under 'prohibited' category, the Indian government had been allowing limited exports after getting requests from some countries, including Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and UAE.\n\nOnion traders and farmers, particularly from Maharashtra, had been demanding to lift ban arguing this would help farmers get better price.

The floor price, below which traders can't export, is designed to discourage cheap exports.\n\n\"The export policy of onion is amended from prohibited to free subject to MEP of $550 per metric tonne with immediate effect and until further orders,\" the directorate general of foreign trade said in a notification on Saturday.\n\nIndia, the world's biggest exporter of onion, banned overseas sales in December to boost local supplies after patchy rains in key states led to a 20% fall in output, worsening seasonal shortages and leading to a price spike.\n\nThe country's ban had driven up prices of the vegetable for global buyers, from the Middle East to Bangladesh, who were left scrambling for cheaper alternatives. Prior to the ban, the government had slapped a 40% duty on exports, a measure that failed to ease prices of the essential item, leading to a full prohibition on exports.\n\nALSO READ | Onion farmers pick holes in govt statement allowing export\n\n\"The ban has been lifted basically taking into account reasonably comfortable rabi 2024 production of 19.1 million tonnes, good kharif prospects with above-normal monsoon forecast, international availability and current market situation,\" consumer affairs secretary Nidhi Khare said. The country's monthly consumption requirement is around 1.7 million tonnes.\n\n\"We will continue to monitor prices as usual. Prices have been stable at mandis (wholesale markets) and also at the retail level since April,\" Khare said. The modal price (a type of average) of onions is \u20b915 a kg (wholesale) at Lasalgoan in Maharashtra, Asia's largest onion market, she added.\n\nThe government did not expect domestic prices to rebound as a result of the removal of the export restriction, she said. Domestic consumers are highly sensitive to prices of onion since it is the base ingredient of most Indian dishes. In 1998, the Bharatiya Janata Party is said to have lost the Delhi assembly elections due to an onion price spiral.\n\nALSO READ | Cheap onion export causing losses, say farmers\n\nThe decision to the lift the ban, which helped cool local prices, will benefit traders and farmers in key onion belts of Maharashtra, such as Dindori, Nashik, Dhule, Sirdi and south Ahmednagar, regions where Lok Sabha elections are due in subsequent phases. The five-month-long export ban had angered farmers and traders, who had been intermittently protesting since February, demanding that the trade restrictions be lifted.\n\nAsked about the timing of the decision to lift the ban, especially in view of the upcoming phases of Lok Sabha polls, Khare said: \"We are not concerned with all that in any way. The decision was taken based on ground reports that show a very comfortable situation.\"\n\nBefore taking a decision, a high-level team was deputed to tour onion-growing regions to assess stocks and states were extensively consulted several times followed by interministerial consultations, she added. \"That's why we got the confidence. Also, since harvest is good and onions have a shelf life of 4-6 months, not lifting the ban would have led to storage loss. Farmers would have hesitated to grow onion during the upcoming kharif season.\"\n\nA majority (about 80%) of the onion crop is grown in the winter season and sown during the two months of December and January. This crop is ready for harvest during April and May, which is the main harvest that meets most of India's annual demand. A chunk of it is also exported.\n\nA 40% export duty, which works out to $220 per tonne, along with a floor price of $550 per tonne means that Indian onions will be available for foreign buyers only at a minimum price of $770 per tonne.\n\nAsked if the tariffs were too high and may result in too few exports, India's director general of foreign trade Santosh Sarangi said: \"We have benchmarked the MEP and export duty on freight-on-board and global prices. If we feel it's on the higher side, we can always review the MEP.\"\n\nTraders appeared sceptical about the 40% duty, which could make Indian onion expensive for importers, said Narayan Wadhwane, secretary of Lasalgaon agricultural produce market committee in Maharashtra.\n\n\"The ban should have been lifted earlier. Traders are still confused about why there's a duty over and above the MEP of $550 per tonne. We will get to know the export market demand only after about 15 days,\" Wadhwane said.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Onion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tonne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_the_European_Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Member of the European Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetable", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vegetable"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maharashtra", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Maharashtra"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Maharashtra"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tariff", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tariff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_trade", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International trade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dindori_district", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dindori district"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabi_crop", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rabi crop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kharif_crop", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kharif crop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_cuisine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indian cuisine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi_Legislative_Assembly", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Delhi Legislative Assembly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvest", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Harvest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lok_Sabha", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lok Sabha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prohibition", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prohibition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monsoon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Monsoon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_rupee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indian rupee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmednagar", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ahmednagar"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ahmednagar"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhule", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dhule"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dhule"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nashik", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nashik"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nashik"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merchant", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Merchant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Customs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Agriculture"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture_and_Forestry/Marketplaces", "label": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture and Forestry/Marketplaces", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Derivatives", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Derivatives", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 71}], "image": "https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2024/05/04/1600x900/India-imposed-a-minimum-export-price--MEP--of--550_1714847587538.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538611", "eventUri": "eng-9538611", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0980392156862745, "wgt": 195, "relevance": 1}

But the move comes with conditions. Traders can ship out onion at a minimum export price (MEP) of $550/tonne and pay another 40% export duty on this price, which translates to Rs 64,000 per tonne or Rs 64 per kg.\n\nThe decision comes just before the next phases of polls, particularly in Maharashtra's onion belts including Nasik, Ahmednagar and Shirdi. Onion growers in many parts of Maharashtra have been protesting against the export ban alleging it has hit their earnings as mandi prices at Lasalgaon are ruling around Rs 15/kg, which barely covers the cost of production.\n\nMarket players, however, said lifting the ban may not bring much benefit to traders. \"The condition of 40% export duty on MEP will make it difficult to export onions,\" said Jaydutt Holkar, director, Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC), Lasalgaon.\n\nGovt officials said the decision was taken after assessing crop volume, arrival of onions at mandis, prevailing market conditions, and to avoid storage loss. Consumer affairs secretary Nidhi Khare said estimated Rabi crop (2024-25), which has a share of around 60% of total annual onion output, is around 191 lakh tonnes. She said this is \"reasonably comfortable\" considering that monthly domestic onion consumption is around 17 lakh tonne.\n\n\"With a good Kharif prospect with 'above-normal' monsoon forecast, availability of onion is comfortable till arrivals of Kharif output. Since onion is a perishable crop, it has to be consumed either domestically or through export within 5-6 months of harvesting and holding on to Rabi stock beyond shelf life will only result in more storage loss,\" she said. The secretary added that storage loss increases significantly after three months.\n\nDGFT director general Santosh Kumar Sarangi said, \"effectively\" onion shipments are being allowed at a minimum price of $770 per tonne and added that MEP and export duty have been arrived at considering recent price trend of govt-to-govt supply and prevailing international price of kitchen staple.\n\nSources said availability of onion is expected to increase in international markets with removal of export ban by Egypt following a 300% rise in production and Pakistan too removing its export restrictions.", "source": {"uri": "timesofindia.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Times of India"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dipak_k_dash@timesofindia.indiatimes.com", "name": "Dipak K Dash", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Onion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tonne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_rupee", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indian rupee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maharashtra", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Maharashtra"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Maharashtra"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_the_European_Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Member of the European Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customs", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Customs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lok_Sabha", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lok Sabha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmednagar", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ahmednagar"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ahmednagar"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lasalgaon", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lasalgaon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lasalgaon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nashik", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nashik"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nashik"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shirdi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shirdi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Shirdi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holkar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Holkar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabi_crop", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rabi crop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakh", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lakh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monsoon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Monsoon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture_and_Forestry/Marketplaces", "label": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture and Forestry/Marketplaces", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109846527,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-91076,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538611", "eventUri": "eng-9538611", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1450980392156863, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1}

This change comes amidst concerns over maintaining sufficient domestic onion availability, particularly in light of lower estimated Kharif and Rabi crops for the year 2023-24 compared to previous years, coupled with increased demand in the international market.\n\nIt is noteworthy that although the export of onions is generally prohibited, the government has allowed a specific quantity of 99,150 MT of onions to be exported to six neighboring countries considered as India's friendly nations.

Notably, last year in August, India imposed a 40 per cent export duty on onions until December 31, 2023, indicating a consistent effort by the government to balance domestic supply with international demand.\n\nThe specified allowances for onion exports to UAE and Bangladesh further emphasize the government's strategic approach to managing onion trade amidst changing agricultural dynamics and global market demands.\n\nThis move by the government reflects a strategy to strike a balance between domestic market stability and international trade commitments, particularly in the context of agricultural production forecasts and global market trends.", "source": {"uri": "krishijagran.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "krishijagran.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Onion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_India", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Government of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabi_crop", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rabi crop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mauritius", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mauritius"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mauritius"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhutan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bhutan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bhutan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bahrain", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bahrain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bahrain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Arab_Emirates", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_trade", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International trade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Customs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Agriculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lanka", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sri Lanka"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sri Lanka"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities_and_Futures", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities and Futures", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture_and_Forestry/Marketplaces", "label": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture and Forestry/Marketplaces", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://kj1bcdn.b-cdn.net/media/97393/onion.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538611", "eventUri": "eng-9538611", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-04", "textStart": 95, "textEnd": 100}], "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

Consumer Affairs Department Secretary Nidhi Khare told reporters that lifting the ban would not lead to any price rises in retail markets.\n\n\"Prices will remain stable. If there is any increase, it should be very marginal,\" she said, adding that the government is committed to protecting the interests of both consumers and farmers.\n\nOnion prices at Lasalgaon market in Nashik district of Maharashtra went up by an average of \u20b9200 per quintal after the Union Government yesterday lifted the ban on exports. Lasalgaon is the biggest wholesale onion market.\n\nAverage prices of onions have increased by around \u20b9200 per quintal, and farmers will benefit from the decision, said Balasaheb Kshirsagar, chairman of the Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC).\n\nPolitical sources said the main reason for removing the ban is the coming Lok Sabha polls in onion-growing areas of Maharashtra, which is electorally crucial because it has the second-highest number of seats (49) after Uttar Pradesh (80).\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi is seeking a rare third consecutive term in office since assuming the top post in May 2014. His party's performance in the ongoing elections holds the key to his objective.\n\nOnion traders and farmers, especially from Maharashtra, have been demanding the lifting of the ban, contending it would assist farmers in getting better prices. However, the government had remained hesitant, fearing that the export of this crucial kitchen staple could lead to a surge in domestic prices.\n\nLast month, the main opposition Congress attacked the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi for neglecting Maharashtra's onion farmers affected by the export ban.\n\nThey mentioned that their manifesto pledges a predictable import-export policy to avoid sudden and harmful policies being enforced on farmers.\n\nIn December last year, India clamped the ban on the export of onions till March 31 of this year and allowed their shipments based on permission granted by the central government at the request of other countries.

In August last year, India imposed a 40 percent duty on the export of onions to improve supplies of the staple vegetable in the domestic market until December 31, 2023. On May 3, the government again imposed a 40 percent duty on onion export.\n\nIndia's onion production for 2023-24 (as per the official data of the First Advance Estimates of the Agriculture Ministry) is projected at about 254.73 lakh tonnes, down from about 302.08 lakh tonnes the previous year.\n\nThis decline is mainly attributed to a fall in production in key onion-growing states like Maharashtra, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, and Rajasthan.\n\nMeanwhile, the price of the local variety of onions has seen a rise to Tk 65-75 a kg from last week's Tk 58-60, according to the Trading Corporation of Bangladesh.\n\nSeveral onion traders blamed the price hike on their suppliers, alleging that they were stockpiling onions ahead of Eid-ul-Azha.\n\nThe ban's lifting had no immediate impact on the Bangladeshi market, said Md Abdul Mazed, general secretary of the Shyambazar Onion Wholesalers' Association.\n\n\"On Friday, onions were sold at Tk 60-62 per kg, which was the same on

The Department of Revenue, under the finance ministry, was granted permission to resume onion exports, albeit with specific conditions including a 40% export duty and a minimum export price (MEP) of USD 550 per tonne.\n\nThis regulatory adjustment was announced on May 4, as the government lifted the ban on onion exports -- a move that could significantly benefit a vast number of farmers, particularly in key onion-producing regions like Maharashtra, which are gearing up for the upcoming Lok Sabha polls.\n\nThe government has set the MEP at USD 550 per tonne, which translates to approximately \u20b946 per kg. Considering the export duty, the effective minimum price for shipments will be around USD 770 per tonne, or about \u20b964 per kg.\n\n\"The export policy of onions is amended from prohibited to free subject to MEP of USD 550 per metric tonne with immediate effect and until further orders,\" stated the directorate general of foreign trade (DGFT) in a notification on May 4. This followed the imposition of a 40% export duty by the finance ministry on May 3.\n\nThe decision to lift the export ban was based on recommendations from the Department of Consumer Affairs, which monitors the availability and price situation of onions in the country. Consumer Affairs Secretary Nidhi Khare on Saturday assured that the lifting of the ban would not lead to any price rise in retail markets.\n\n\"Prices will remain stable. If at all there is any increase, it should be very marginal,\" Khare explained, underscoring the government's commitment to balancing the interests of both consumers and farmers.\n\nThe move to reinstate onion exports comes after the ban was initially imposed on December 8 last year to control soaring retail prices amidst fears of a possible decline in production. Over the past few years, India has consistently exported between 17 lakh and 25 lakh tonnes of onions annually.\n\nKhare also highlighted the comprehensive discussions and ground assessments that informed this decision, \"The ban on onion exports has been removed from today (Saturday) because the supply situation is comfortable and prices are stable in both mandies as well as retail markets.\" She cited that the modal price at Lasalgaon mandi in Nashik was \u20b915 per kg in April.\n\nReflecting on the broader agricultural strategy, Khare mentioned that \"Lifting of the ban would also encourage the farmers to put more area under onions. The monsoon forecast is above normal,\" indicating a proactive approach to agricultural planning and market readiness.\n\nThis policy shift is crucial as it comes ahead of significant electoral engagements in major onion belts, aligning economic incentives with electoral strategies, thus showcasing the government's responsive governance framework aimed at supporting the agricultural sector while ensuring market stability.\n\nUnlock a world of Benefits!

The ban was imposed to ensure adequate domestic availability and keep prices in check as the outputs of both the Kharif and Rabi crops in 2023-24 are estimated to be lower as compared to the previous year and demand has increased in the international market.\n\nThe National Cooperative Exports Limited (NCEL), the agency for export of onion to these countries, sourced the domestic onions to be exported through e-platform at L1 prices and supplied to the agencies nominated by the government of the destination country at the negotiated rate on 100 per cent advance payment basis, according to the Food Ministry.\n\nThe offer rate of NCEL to the buyers takes into account the prevailing prices in the destination market and also international and domestic markets. The quotas allocated for export to the six countries are being supplied as per requisition made by these destination countries.\n\nAs the largest producer of onion in the country, Maharashtra is the major supplier of onions sourced by NCEL for export.\n\nThe Government had also allowed the export of 2000 metric tonnes (MT) of white onion cultivated especially for export markets in the Middle East and some European countries. Being purely export-oriented, the production cost of the white onion is higher than other onions due to higher seed cost, adoption of good agricultural practice (GAP) and compliance with strict maximum residue limits (MRL) requirements.\n\nThe procurement target for onion buffer out of Rabi-2024 under the Price Stabilisation Fund (PSF) of the Department of Consumer Affairs has been fixed at 5 lakh tons this year. Central agencies NCCF and NAFED are tying up local agencies such as FPOs/FPCs/PACs to support the procurement, storage and farmers' registration to begin the procurement of any store-worthy onion. A high-level team of the Department of Consumer Affairs, NCCF and NAFED visited Nashik and Ahmednagar districts of Maharashtra from April 11-13, 2024 to create awareness among the farmers, FPOs/FPCs and PACs about the procurement of 5 LMT of onion for PSF buffer.\n\nIn order to reduce the storage loss of onions, the Department of Consumer Affairs decided to enhance the quantum of stocks to be irradiated and cold stored from 1200 MT last year to over 5000 MT this year, with technical support from BARC, Mumbai. The pilot of onion irradiation and cold storage taken up last year has been found to have resulted in the reduction of storage loss to less than 10 per cent.", "source": {"uri": "weeklyvoice.com",

These two regions alone produce 40% of the overall onion production of the country.\n\nAs ET travelled through parts of Western Maharashtra, farmers were unhappy over the export ban decision and in some parts there were protests by farmers since January this year.\n\nThe anger was much more after the relaxation given by the government on April 25 to export 2,000 tonnes of white onion, produced in Gujarat. Gujarat is the large producer of white onions which is in great demand overseas. Bhavnagar and Amreli are the top onion producing districts of Gujarat and polling is also scheduled on these two Lok Sabha seats in the third phase.\n\nMaharashtra produces red onions and farmers were protesting to give similar relaxation for them as was given for Gujarat.\"It is a welcome step but it has come too late in the day.

Also if an export ban has to be lifted then it should be for all states not just one state,\" Abhishek Salunkhe an onion farmer from Pimpri Sayyad village in Nashik, told ET.Nashik is the hub of onion farmers in Maharashtra.

With the region affected by Maratha reservations agitations, a protest by onion farmers could impact the electoral performance of the NDA.\n\nBy lifting the export ban, the government has tried to give relief to the farmers.

(Bloomberg)\n\nLifting the ban on onion exports imposed in December last year, the government on Saturday imposed a minimum export price (MEP) of $550 per tonne, as per a directorate general of foreign trade (DGFT) notification. A 40% export duty on staple vegetables has also been introduced from Friday.\n\nSantosh Kumar Sarangi, director general, DGFT, said onion shipments are being allowed at a minimum price of $770/tonne or around Rs 64/kg, which, traders say, is on a higher side for boosting exports. \"Keeping into consideration the current market supply and global availability and prices, it has been decided to lift the ban on onion exports,\" Sarangi said.\n\nThe move comes just before the onion growing regions of Maharashtra vote for the Lok Sabha elections. Farmers there have been demanding lifting the ban on exports, as modal mandi prices at Lasalgaon in Nashik -- the hub of the country's wholesale trade -- are around Rs 15/kg, which are close to cost of production.\n\n\"At such a high price band, it would be difficult to export onions, as Rs 64/kg is steep for intended markets,\" Jaydutt Holkar, director, agricultural produce market committee (APMC), Lasalgaon, told FE.\n\nNidhi Khare, secretary, department of consumer affairs, said the estimated rabi crop (2024-25), which has a share of around 60% total annual output, is projected at around 19.1 million tonne (MT), which is 'reasonably comfortable', considering monthly domestic consumption is around 1.7 MT. \"With a good kharif prospect due to 'above-normal' monsoon forecast, the availability of onion is at a comfortable level till arrival of kharif output,\" Khare said. She said as a perishable crop, onion has to be consumed either domestically or through export within five-six months of harvesting and holding on to the rabi stock beyond shelf life would only increase storage losses.\n\nIn March, while extending the onion export prohibition indefinitely, an official note stated that the move was necessitated by the overall domestic availability against prevailing international prices and global availability concerns. Officials said the decision to ban onion exports last year was aimed at increasing domestic supply against an estimated 20% decline in kharif and late kharif production. \"The policy had helped in maintaining stable prices till arrival of rabi-2024 crop last month,\" said an official.\n\nWhile the government had earlier put onion export under 'prohibited' category, it approved exports of close to 0.1 million tonne (MT) of onion to six countries -- Bangladesh, United Arab Emirate (UAE), Sri Lanka, Bahrain, Mauritius and Bhutan.\n\nIn FY24, India exported around 1.8 MT of onion, mostly to Bangladesh, Malaysia, UAE, Sri Lanka and Nepal. The modal retail prices are currently ruling at Rs 30/kg against Rs 20/kg reported a year back. Retail inflation in onions was 36.88% in March.\n\nThe export ban in December last year was the first intervention in onion exports since January 2021. The government has not imposed a ban on onion exports since 2021, which was the norm a few years back.\n\nMeanwhile, under the price stabilisation fund (PSF), the government directed National Cooperative Consumers Federation and farmers' cooperative Nafed to initiate procurement of 0.5 MT of onion at market price as buffer from the farmers as rabi harvest has started to arrive in the market. During the last financial year (2023-24), 0.64 MT of onion had been procured under PSF. Onion purchased this way is used as buffer stocking as well as intervention by way of simultaneous procurement and disposal to curb the possibility of spike in prices.\n\nThe agriculture ministry recently estimated that onion production is likely to fall by 16% to 25.47 MT in the current crop year (July-June) compared to 2022-23 due to a decrease of 3.43 MT in Maharashtra, the biggest producer of the staple vegetable.", "source": {"uri": "financialexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Financial Express"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sandip_das@financialexpress.com", "name": "Sandip Das",

The move, however, may increase the price sharply in the Nepali market.\n\nIn its notification issued on Saturday, the Directorate General of Foreign Trade of India said that the export policy for onions is amended from \"prohibited\" to \"free\", subject to the set minimum export price with immediate effect and until further orders.\n\nWith the floor price, Nepali traders say onion may cost more than Rs100 per kg, adding the transport costs and the value-added tax (VAT), the additional levy the Nepal government charges on imported vegetables, said Mohan Baniya, president of the Potato-Onion Import-Export and Wholesaler Association.\n\nCurrently, onions are available for Rs60 per kg in the wholesale market and cost Rs90 per kg in retail.\n\nThe red bulb, the vital kitchen ingredient, has been restricted by India since December last year. Despite the ban, onion supply is abundant in the Nepali market, according to the traders.\n\nBaniya said traders haven't imported onions in the last five months. \"However, there is no dearth of onions in the market, thanks to illegal imports.\"\n\nIndia decided to lift the ban, after taking into account estimated rabi production in 2024 and good kharif (summer-sown) prospects because of above-normal monsoon, Reuters said quoting an Indian government official.\n\n\"Onion supply was normal despite the Indian ban in the past months. But now, the minimum export price may send the price higher,\" said Binay Shrestha, information officer at the Kalimati Fruits and Vegetable Market Development Board, Nepal's largest vegetable trading centre.\n\n\"During India's ban on onion, its smuggling thrived in Nepal mainly due to the price difference between the two neighbours.\"\n\nOnions, which are a major ingredient in Indian food and a politically sensitive commodity, are cultivated three times a year -- in monsoon, winter and summer.\n\nAs there is no commercial cultivation of the crop in Nepal, the country is dependent on the spice from India.\n\nNepal gets almost all of its onion requirement from the southern neighbour, and any ripple there is amplified when it reaches the Nepali bazaar.\n\nIn Nepal, Chinese onions, which are available in bigger sizes and are relatively cheaper, are not preferred due to their taste.\n\nThe ban was enforced by the world's biggest exporter of the vegetable last December and then extended in March. The price nearly doubled to Rs200 a kg in retail in the Nepali market, from Rs120 per kg, following India's export ban.\n\nPrices, however, started to cool down, after smuggling soared.\n\nNepal police seized thousands of tonnes of onion being smuggled through the southern border, according to reports.\n\nDespite the Nepali customs office in the boarding area conducting regular inspections, onions continued to be smuggled, particularly, on motorbikes.\n\nThe policy changes come in the middle of staggered voting in India's national election in which Prime Minister Narendra Modi is seeking a rare third term.\n\nOnions have historically influenced India's political landscape during elections.\n\nLast month, according to Indian media reports, the Congress criticised the Modi government for neglecting Maharashtra's onion farmers affected by the export ban. They mentioned that their manifesto pledges a predictable import-export policy to avoid sudden and harmful policies being enforced on farmers.\n\nThe Indian onion traders and farmers, especially from Maharashtra, have been urging the government to lift the banlifted, saying that it would help farmers get better prices.\n\nHowever, the government did not lift the ban fearing that the export of this crucial kitchen staple could lead to a surge in onion prices in India.\n\nOn November 4 last year, the Indian government imposed a minimum export price of $800 per tonne till December 31, 2023, to maintain sufficient availability of onion to its consumers at affordable prices.\n\nAfter the minimum export price was slapped, the wholesale price of onion jumped to Rs125 per kg in Nepal from Rs75 per kg previously.\n\nIn mid-November, the price reached Rs150 per kg. Before the minimum export price in November, India had imposed a 40 percent export duty on onions.\n\nIn November 2019, the price of onion hit a new high of Rs250 per kg in Kathmandu Valley after India slapped a ban on onion export in September that year to maintain domestic availability.\n\nThe ban caused severe shortages of onions all over Asia including Nepal. The embargo was lifted in March 2020. India again stopped onion exports from September 2020 to January 2021.\n\nOn Saturday, onion was priced Rs60 per kg on average in the wholesale market, down from Rs68 per kg. On Friday, according to the Kalimati vegetable market, 50 tonnes of onion were imported, compared to 71 tonnes a week ago.\n\nNepal imported 18,019 tonnes of onion worth Rs6.75 billion in the last fiscal year ended in mid-July 2023.", "source": {"uri": "kathmandupost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "kathmandupost.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Onion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepal", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nepal"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nepal"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetable", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vegetable"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value-added_tax", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Value-added tax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smuggling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Smuggling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tonne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monsoon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monsoon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bazaar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bazaar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_cuisine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indian cuisine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Narendra Modi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_India", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Government of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Customs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spice", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Commodity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maharashtra", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Maharashtra"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Maharashtra"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathmandu_Valley", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kathmandu Valley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_sanctions", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economic sanctions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifesto", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manifesto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_trade", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International trade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_year", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fiscal year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture_and_Forestry/Marketplaces", "label": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture and Forestry/Marketplaces", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Consumer_Goods_and_Services/Marketplaces", "label": "dmoz/Business/Consumer Goods and Services/Marketplaces", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Strength_Sports/Olympic_Lifting", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Strength Sports/Olympic Lifting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2024/money/thumb16-1714959122.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538611", "eventUri": "eng-9538611", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-11-04", "textStart": 3807, "textEnd": 3817}, {"amb": false, "date": "2019-11-", "textStart": 4296, "textEnd": 4309}, {"amb": false, "date": "2020-03-", "textStart": 4581, "textEnd": 4591}, {"amb": false, "date": "2020-09-", "textStart": 4632, "textEnd": 4646}], "sentiment": -0.1607843137254902, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

This decision comes after the ban was introduced in December last year to manage domestic onion prices.\n\nOn Saturday, the Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) announced that onions could now be exported with a Minimum Export Price (MEP) of $550 per tonne, along with a 40% export duty.\n\nFarmers in Maharashtra, particularly from the Western and Marathwada regions, were not happy with the export ban. These areas contribute to about 40% of India's onion production. Reports suggest that farmers have been protesting against this ban since January.\n\nThe situation escalated when, on April 25, the government allowed Gujarat to export 2,000 tonnes of white onions, a decision that did not sit well with Maharashtra's farmers.\n\nGujarat, known for its white onion production, received permission for exports ahead of elections in Bhavnagar and Amreli districts. This move caused further dissatisfaction among onion farmers in Maharashtra, who felt neglected as they primarily grow red onions. For instance, Abhishek Salunkhe from Nashik expressed that lifting the ban was a positive step but criticized its delayed timing and selective application.\n\nIn Maharashtra's onion belt, the NDA alliance has shown strong performance in past elections. Nashik, a key area for onion farmers and home to India's largest onion market in Lasalgaon, has seen Hemant Godse of Shiv Sena winning Lok Sabha elections consecutively. In the Marathwada region, BJP and Shiv Sena secured most Lok Sabha seats in the last election, with only Aurangabad slipping away by a narrow margin.\n\nThe government's decision to lift the onion export ban before the final three phases of elections in Maharashtra aims to provide relief to farmers. However, it remains uncertain how this move will impact the Mahagatbandhan alliance's electoral prospects or if it will address the broader concerns of the region affected by the Maratha reservation movement and other issues.", "source": {"uri": "oneindia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Oneindia"}, "authors": [{"uri": "anjan_kumar_chaudhary@oneindia.com", "name": "Anjan Kumar Chaudhary", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Onion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maharashtra", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Maharashtra"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Maharashtra"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tonne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_India", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Government of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gujarat", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gujarat"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gujarat"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marathwada", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marathwada"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Marathwada"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "District"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amreli", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amreli"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Amreli"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhavnagar", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bhavnagar"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bhavnagar"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nashik", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nashik"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nashik"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Democratic_Alliance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Democratic Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemant_Godse", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hemant Godse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maratha_Empire", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Maratha Empire"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservation_in_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reservation in India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurangabad", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aurangabad"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lok_Sabha", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lok Sabha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiv_Sena", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shiv Sena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lasalgaon", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lasalgaon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lasalgaon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Food_and_Related_Products/Import_and_Export", "label": "dmoz/Business/Food and Related Products/Import and Export", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/International_Business_and_Trade", "label": "dmoz/Business/International Business and Trade", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/International_Business_and_Trade/Import_and_Export", "label": "dmoz/Business/International Business and Trade/Import and Export", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Import_and_Export", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Import and Export", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Import_and_Export", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Import and Export", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://www.oneindia.com/img/2024/05/onion-01-1714906126.jpg?05052024162250", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538611", "eventUri": "eng-9538611", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-25", "textStart": 784, "textEnd": 792}], "sentiment": -0.3411764705882353, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

While the price of this kitchen essential in Bangladesh has dropped, reports suggest that the same will double in Nepal. On April 27, the Indian government allowed the export of 99,150 MT of onions to Bangladesh, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Bhutan, Bahrain, Mauritius and Sri Lanka. Following this, on May 4, it was announced that India has lifted the restrictions on onion exports from Friday because of robust Kharif crop production in 2024 and favourable monsoon forecasts, coupled with stable market conditions both at the wholesale market and retail levels.\n\n\"All restrictions on onion export have been removed with effect from today,\" Nidhi Khare, Secretary, Department of Consumer Affairs, said at a press conference in Delhi. \"This is taking into account the Rabi 2024 production and approved Kharif prospect because of above normal monsoon.\" She further added that \"the current market situation, which was stable both at Mandi (wholesale market) and retail and also the international availability and prices situation\". According to the official estimate, the Rabi 2024 onion production is about 191 lakh tonnes, which is reasonably comfortable considering monthly domestic consumption of about 17 lakh tonnes.\n\nWhy is India an important source of onions?\n\nIndia is the second-largest producer of onions in the world after China, accounting for around 20 per cent of global production. The country's favourable climate, vast agricultural land, and well-established irrigation systems make it an ideal location for onion cultivation.\n\nIndia has diverse agro-climatic conditions that are conducive to growing different varieties of onions throughout the year. The major onion-producing states include Maharashtra, Karnataka, Gujarat, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, and Rajasthan, which have suitable soil and temperature conditions for onion cultivation.\n\nWith its massive production, India has a consistent supply of onions available for domestic consumption and export. The abundant supply and relatively low production costs make Indian onions affordable for many countries, especially in South Asia and West Asia.\n\nIndia is one of the leading exporters of onions in the world. It exports onions to countries in Southeast Asia, West Asia, Europe, and North America. India has also entered into trade agreements with various countries, facilitating the smooth flow of onion exports.\n\nThe global demand for onions has been steadily increasing due to population growth, changing dietary patterns, and the popularity of cuisines that heavily rely on onions. India's ability to meet this growing demand has made it a reliable source for many countries.\n\nIndia has developed an extensive network of cold storage facilities and efficient transportation systems, which allow for the preservation and timely distribution of onions to domestic and international markets.\n\nWhy did India temporarily ban the export of onions?\n\nOnion export prohibition has been imposed to ensure adequate domestic availability against the backdrop of estimated lower kharif and rabi crops in 2023-24 as compared to the previous year and increased demand in the international market. The export of onion had been prohibited with effect from December 8, 2023, to increase domestic supply against an estimated 20 per cent decline in the kharif and late kharif production. The restriction on export helped the government maintain stable prices till the arrival of the rabi 2024 crop.\n\nOnions can be grown as both kharif and rabi crops in India, depending on the region and climate.\n\nKharif onion crop is sown during the monsoon season (around June-July) and harvested in the autumn (around October-November). These onions generally have a shorter shelf life and are typically consumed or processed soon after harvest.\n\nRabi onion crop is sown during the winter (around October-November) and harvested in the spring (around March-April). Rabi onions are usually preferred for storage because they have a longer shelf life compared to kharif onions.\n\nIndia's onion production is a mix of both kharif and rabi seasons, with some regions focusing more on one type based on climate, soil conditions, and market demand. Thus, while onions can indeed be a Kharif crop, they are not exclusively grown during this season and can be cultivated year-round with varying outcomes depending on when they are planted.\n\nWhich is India's biggest onion-producing region?\n\nMaharashtra is India's leading onion-producing state, known for playing a significant role in the country's total onion output. It accounts for a substantial portion of national production, with districts such as Nashik, Pune, Ahmednagar, and Satara serving as major hubs for onion farming.\n\nMaharashtra's leadership in onion production is driven by its favourable climate, extensive farmlands devoted to onion cultivation, and established farming methods. The state grows onions during both the kharif and rabi seasons, ensuring a steady supply throughout the year. This continuous production enables Maharashtra to serve as a key supplier of onions to other regions in India as well as for export.\n\nHow has Bangladesh gained from India lifting the ban on onion exports?\n\nAccording to a report in the Dhaka Tribune, prices of onions dropped significantly ever since India lifted the ban on the kitchen staple. Hili Bazar is a market located in the Dinajpur district of Bangladesh, near the India-Bangladesh border. It serves as a significant trade point between the two countries, particularly through the Hili Land Port, which facilitates cross-border trade and the movement of goods.\n\n\"The price (of onions) dropped by Tk10 per kg on Sunday following news of imports (from India) resuming on Saturday,\" Ashraful Islam, a resident of Hili Bazar was quoted as saying by the Dhaka Tribune. \"Traders had hiked prices due to limited supply. Suddenly, there's an abundance of onions in all shops on Sunday. Yet, Indian onions have not yet arrived, suggesting market manipulation by traders. We urge the government to intervene and regulate the onion market.\"\n\nAccording to Abul Hasmat, an onion vendor in Hili Bazar, stockpile holders have now been forced to release their reserves following India's decision. \"Onion prices have remained high since Eid (celebrated last month), soaring from Tk50 to Tk70-75,\" Sabuj Hossain, a shopper at Hili Bazar was quoted as saying by the Dhaka Tribune. \"The inflated prices have made it challenging to manage household expenses, compelling me to reduce my purchase. Today (Sunday), I could buy at Tk60 per kg.\"\n\nBut, why is onion price expected to be going up in Nepal?\n\nThough India has lifted the onion export ban, it has imposed a minimum export price of $550 per tonne. Though onions are available at NR60 per kg in Nepal as of now, the new Indian condition may raise the price of the red bulb to over NR100 per kg.\n\n\"Onion supply was normal despite the Indian ban in the past months,\" the Kathmandu Post quoted Binay Shrestha, information officer at the Kalimati Fruits and Vegetable Market Development Board, Nepal's largest vegetable trading centre, as saying. \"But now, the minimum export price may send the price higher.\"\n\nShrestha said that though India imposed a ban on onion exports, its smuggling thrived in Nepal mainly due to the price difference between the two South Asian nations. India's lifting of the ban on onion exports has brought tears of joy among some and sorrow among others.", "source": {"uri": "etvbharat.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ETV Bharat News"},

In a notification issued by the Union Government, the export policy for onions has been revised from 'prohibited' to 'free,' contingent upon a minimum export price of $550 per Metric Ton (MT), effective immediately and until further directives.\n\nThis decision follows a notification issued on Friday by the government, which lifted the export ban, albeit with a 40% export duty in place. The move has been met with relief by Nashik traders, who perceive it as a significant alleviation.\n\nThe history of export regulations on onions in India dates back to August 2023, when the Union government imposed a 40% export duty until December 31, 2023, to stabilise domestic market prices. However, this decision sparked vehement opposition from traders and farmers in Nashik, resulting in protests and the temporary closure of crucial Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) markets such as Lasalgaon and Pimpalgaon.\n\nDespite the protests, the policy remained unchanged. Subsequently, in December 2023, a complete ban on onion exports was enforced until March 2024, causing significant distress among onion traders.\n\nIn late April, the government allowed the export of 99,150 metric tons of onions to six neighboring nations, including Bangladesh, UAE, Bhutan, Bahrain, Mauritius, and Sri Lanka, as per the Ministry of Consumer Affairs. Additionally, 2000 metric tons of white onions have been permitted for export to Middle Eastern and some European markets. These white onions incur higher production costs due to factors like seed expenses and stringent quality standards.\n\nThe decision to lift the export ban and authorize limited exports addresses concerns over lower crop yields and rising international demand.

The ban was imposed to ensure adequate domestic availability and keep prices in check as the outputs of both the Kharif and Rabi crops in 2023-24 are estimated to be lower as compared to the previous year and demand has increased in the international market.\n\nThe National Cooperative Exports Limited (NCEL), the agency for export of onion to these countries, sourced the domestic onions to be exported through e-platform at L1 prices and supplied to the agencies nominated by the government of the destination country at the negotiated rate on 100 per cent advance payment basis, according to the Food Ministry.\n\nThe offer rate of NCEL to the buyers takes into account the prevailing prices in the destination market and also international and domestic markets. The quotas allocated for export to the six countries are being supplied as per requisition made by these destination countries.\n\nAs the largest producer of onion in the country, Maharashtra is the major supplier of onions sourced by NCEL for export.\n\nThe Government had also allowed the export of 2000 metric tonnes (MT) of white onion cultivated especially for export markets in the Middle East and some European countries. Being purely export-oriented, the production cost of the white onion is higher than other onions due to higher seed cost, adoption of good agricultural practice (GAP) and compliance with strict maximum residue limits (MRL) requirements.\n\nThe procurement target for onion buffer out of Rabi-2024 under the Price Stabilisation Fund (PSF) of the Department of Consumer Affairs has been fixed at 5 lakh tons this year. Central agencies NCCF and NAFED are tying up local agencies such as FPOs/FPCs/PACs to support the procurement, storage and farmers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 registration to begin the procurement of any store-worthy onion. A high-level team of the Department of Consumer Affairs, NCCF and NAFED visited Nashik and Ahmednagar districts of Maharashtra from April 11-13, 2024 to create awareness among the farmers, FPOs/FPCs and PACs about the procurement of 5 LMT of onion for PSF buffer.\n\nIn order to reduce the storage loss of onions, the Department of Consumer Affairs decided to enhance the quantum of stocks to be irradiated and cold stored from 1200 MT last year to over 5000 MT this year, with technical support from BARC, Mumbai. The pilot of onion irradiation and cold storage taken up last year has been found to have resulted in the reduction of storage loss to less than 10 per cent.", "source": {"uri": "newkerala.com",

( Image Source :Getty )\n\nThe Indian government reportedly sought permission from the Election Commission before removing the restrictions placed on onion exports, media reports said.\n\nCiting official sources, PTI reported that the Finance Ministry's Department of Revenue requested for permission from the Election Commission to do away with the curbs placed on the export of onions, owing to the Model Code of Conduct currently implemented as part of the Lok Sabha Elections.\n\nFollowing this, the government on Saturday allowed the export of the produce, subject to a 40 per cent export duty and a floor price of $550 per tonne. This move is expected to help raise the income for farmers, specifically in major onion-producing regions such as Maharashtra, as the Lok Sabha polls take place.\n\nThe final call on the export ban was taken based on the recommendations of the Department of Consumer Affairs. The department is responsible for overseeing the price and availability of onions in the domestic market.\n\nWith the new duty and the minimum export price (MEP), the lower limit for shipments stands near $770 per tonne, the report noted.

As a result, domestic prices have already started increasing and have reached the range of \u20b91,400 per tonne to \u20b91,800 per tonne from \u20b91000 per tonne a month ago,\" said Sawant.\n\nIn retail markets of Mumbai and Pune, onion is being sold in the range between \u20b920-25 per kg.\n\nFor the past few days, the opposition has been targeting the BJP over a ban on exporting the crop. The poll prospects of some of the candidates such as BJP candidates Bharati Pawar Dondori and Sujay Vikhe in Dindori and Ahmednagar; Shiv Sena's Hemant Godse from Nashik; and Shivajirao Adhalrao of NCP in Shirur, were also linked to resentment among farmers, which according to BJP leaders, will now be subdued after the latest decision. Most of these constituencies go to polls in two phases between May 13 and 20.\n\nDeputy Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis while welcoming this decision said, \"As Prime Minister Narendra Modi took the decision to withdraw the ban on onion export, it will ensure that the farmers in Maharashtra will get good prices and income.\"\n\nSunil Ahire, a farmer from Deola village in Nashik district said, his only request to the government now is not to interfere with onion export.\n\n\"By announcing the onion export ban in December, the government brought down the prices just to offer feel good atmosphere to voters. Considering the polls, the government has now taken this decision but has imposed MEP as well as 40 per cent export duty,\" said Ahire.\n\nSatish Pawar, another farmer from Satana said, \"There was anger among the farmers. We have been demanding for the last three months to lift the ban.\"\n\nAmol Kolhe, Sitting MP and NCP (SP) candidate from Shirur said, \"The BJP government is playing with farmers without any fixed policy on export. I am doubtful if the latest decision will in any way help farmers as the government has kept duty on onion export.\"", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan

First, they split it lengthwise down the middle. Then, carefully, the couple peeled back the onion's layers, laying 12 fresh, eye-watering sections side-by-side, and topping each with a teaspoon of salt.\n\nThe onion wasn't the makings of a celebratory dish for the new year, but a window into the future. While the ground outside was still frozen, the couple looked to the onion layers to predict the coming year's weather for their farm.\n\nEarly the next morning on New Year's Day, the couple rose to check their results. How each onion slice reacted to the salt overnight foretold how wet or dry each month would be. They examined each piece in order -- the first representing January's precipitation, the second predicting February, and so on. Some pieces were left with dry salt, indicating a dry month, while the next might have a pool of briny liquid in its center, indicating heavy rains or snow. Caked or crusty salt crystals meant frost, and bubbles hinted at humidity.\n\nThe onion calendar, or onion oracle, dates back to the Middle Ages, when onions and other root vegetables were used by farmers to predict precipitation for the year ahead. Some of the oldest records of using onions as an oracle are from the small town of Urbania, Italy, where the tradition is still practiced today.\n\nIn Urbania, they do the ritual on the night of January 24, the eve of what's known in the Catholic calendar as the Conversion of St. Paul, when the man named Saul was struck to the ground by a divine light and decided to become a Christian. Paul had received a sign of things to come on that night, so practitioners believed that the onion could best be read on the magical date. \"He received a sign from God, he should be willing to give signs back,\" says Elisa Luzi, an anthropologist at the University of T\u00fcbingen in Germany. Luzi is from a town near Urbania, and has studied onion oracles, earning her the local nickname \"the onion girl.\"\n\nConsulting a vegetable about the long-term weather outlook seems quaint today, in an age of instant weather forecasts at our fingertips, but the tradition served its purpose in the past. \"As humans, we sometimes fear the future,\" says Luzi. \"As a farmer, the weather can destroy an entire year of work. Having no control over rain or sun, you need to at least try and see what is coming.\"\n\nLuzi grew up with her grandparents who were farmers, and she remembers her grandmother saying casually, \"What did the onion say for this month?\" or \"But the onion said that...\" You can still hear the same questions around Urbania today, Luzi says.\n\n\"Some people believe it. Some do not,\" she says. \"It is kind of like a horoscope. Even if you don't believe it, you still check it every now and then, just for fun.\" The palm-sized weather predictors, which are cheap and readily available year-round, don't enjoy any special status. \"The next day, right after the reading, they become soup,\" Luzi says.\n\nWhile the tradition today is best known around Urbania, it can be found elsewhere as well. Australian farmer Halwyn 'Hally' Herrmann, for example, used the method for 65 years.\n\nThe practice can also be traced back to German folklore. In North Dakota, Delbert Eszlinger learned the ritual in childhood from neighbors who also farmed. The year the Eszlingers married, they decided to give the tradition a try -- having continued it ever since. Donna Eszlinger says it usually works, with the exception of one reading several years ago. \"It was such an odd year where the weather changed so often,\" she says. \"The whole onion was way off.\"\n\nThe onion can be surprisingly specific, she adds. Three years ago, two pieces cut from the exact same outermost layer of the onion predicted opposite results for the months of January and July. \"When we checked it the following morning, January had moisture and July had absolutely nothing,\" says Eszlinger. \"So what determines that there's moisture in one and not at all in the other?\" The contrasting results turned out to be right, she says. \"We had a lot of snow that January, and then that July was very dry.\"\n\nIn Ashley, even the local news has started following onion predictions -- but not everyone is on board. \"One time a weatherman on our local station caught wind of this and said, 'Nobody knows the weather better than the weatherman,'\" says Eszlinger with a laugh. \"It was like he was a little put out that we were predicting the weather, like we're taking away his job.\"\n\n\"I think folklore forecasts will continue to reside in our social communities and circles. They're tradition,\" says Steve Ackerman, retired professor of atmospheric and oceanic sciences at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. He adds tactfully: \"While old sayings of the coming weather still enter our social lives, I do think we rely more now on forecasts that better reflect our understanding of atmosphere circulations.\"\n\nThe Eszlingers appreciate science-based weather predictions and the convenience of the Weather Channel, but they still carry on the onion tradition -- and Donna Eszingler hopes others will continue it after her. \"The ones that are doing it, they're the same age I am. I'm 75,\" she says. \"It's a German thing and a heritage that we like to carry on.\"\n\nThere are already signs that her two daughters are interested in continuing the many-layered tradition, she says. \"They'll call and say, 'Okay, Mom, what are we going to have this year?'\"\n\nThe practice of making an onion calendar can vary slightly depending on what area you're in, but the tradition goes something like this:\n\nStep 1: Select a nice round onion. While the color and where it's grown don't matter, everyone has their preferences. The Eszlingers prefer yellow. \"The yellow one seems to be a sturdier onion,\" she says. \"So you probably get a better reading that way.\"\n\nStep 2: Cut the onion in half lengthwise and carefully separate the six outermost layers so that you have 12 sections total. Lay the sections out in two rows: The first half should be January through June, with January being the outermost layer and June the innermost. The second half represents July (the outermost layer) through December (the innermost).\n\nStep 3: Add a teaspoon of salt in the center of each onion cup.\n\nStep 4: Let sit overnight. Some people keep it inside, but many agree it should be outside to get the most accurate reading.\n\nStep 5: In the early morning -- ideally around 5 a.m. -- bring the onion inside and quickly jot down your readings before the inside temperatures change the results.\n\nStep 6: Enjoy consulting your onion calendar throughout the year!", "source": {"uri": "atlasobscura.com", "dataType": "news",

This decision comes after the world's leading onion exporter initially enforced the export ban last December and extended it in March.\n\nThe timing of the policy shift coincides with staggered voting in India's national election, where Prime Minister Narendra Modi is vying for an unprecedented third term. Notably, parts of Maharashtra, a key onion-producing region in India's western state, are yet to cast their votes.\n\nAlongside lifting the export ban, the government has introduced a minimum export price of $550 per metric ton for onion exports. This move is attributed to considerations of the estimated rabi production in 2024 and favorable kharif (summer-sown) prospects due to above-normal monsoon forecasts, according to a government official.\n\nOnions, integral to Indian cuisine and a politically sensitive commodity, are cultivated thrice yearly during the monsoon, winter, and summer seasons.

The ban on exports had apparently sent them on the back foot.\n\nAnil Ghanwat, president of the Swatantra Bharat Party, the political wing of Shetkari Sanghatana, claimed the withdrawal of the ban will hardly benefit the growers.\n\n\"On and above the MEP, an export duty of 40 per cent would be levied. Thus, the on-port price of the bulb would be Rs 64,204 per tonne without the transport cost. Our competition would be with onion from Pakistan which has an MEP of $400 per tonne,\" he said.\n\nMeanwhile, Bharat Dighole, president of the Onion Growers Association, claimed that the onion export ban resulted in losses to the growers. \"We demand Rs 2,000 per quintal as compensation for our losses,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "indianexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Indian

The decision comes on the heels of robust kharif crop production in 2024 and favourable monsoon forecasts, coupled with stable market conditions both at the mandi and retail levels.\n\n\"All restrictions on onion export have been removed with effect from today,\" said Nidhi Khare, Secretary, Dept. of Consumer Affairs at a press conference in Delhi\n\nShe said, \"This is basically taking into account the Rabi 2024 production and approved Kharif prospect because of above normal monsoon.\"\n\nShe further added that \"the current market situation which was stable both at Mandi and retail and also the international availability and prices situation.\"\n\nAccording to the official estimate, the Rabi 2024 onion production is about 191 lakh tons, which is reasonably comfortable considering monthly domestic consumption of about 17 lakh tons.\n\nThe export of onion had been prohibited with effect from 8 December 2023 to increase domestic supply against an estimated 20 per cent decline in the Kharif and late Kharif production.\n\nThe restriction on export helped the government in maintaining stable prices till the arrival of Rabi 2024 crop.\n\nThe removal of export restrictions is expected to bolster India's onion trade and contribute to the country's overall economic stability. With favorable crop conditions and ample supply, the move is likely to benefit both domestic consumers and export markets, ensuring steady prices and ample availability of onions in the coming months.\n\nRabi onion harvested during April-June accounts for 65 per cent of India's onion production and meets the consumer's demand till the Kharif crop is harvested in October-November.

This decision, disclosed on 25 March 2024, aims to facilitate exports from Gujarat, a predominant white onion producing region. The directive specifies that exports will proceed through three designated ports in Gujarat and Mumbai, under the condition that each shipment receives certification from the Horticulture Commissioner of Gujarat. This measure is intended to ensure that the exported onions meet the required quality and quantity standards.\n\nHowever, the government's decision has led to dissent among onion farmers in Nashik and adjacent areas, who view this as a politically motivated action during the Lok Sabha elections. They argue that this move unfairly favors Gujarat over other states, particularly affecting those involved in the cultivation of red onions, such as in Maharashtra.

The absence of a high school in their village is the poll issue that matters for them. \"Our girls have to drop out of school because we cannot send them to another village after Class 8,\" says Ritaba.\n\nJalpa Vaghela, 20, who takes a free bus ride provided by the state government everyday to attend a college in Jamnagar -- about 35 km away -- for studying commerce, says that she hasn't decided yet as to who will get her vote when she exercises her franchise for the first time in the Lok Sabha elections on Tuesday.\n\n\"But look at these overflowing open drains. Getting enough drinking water is a huge problem in this village. Water that our village panchayat supplies through pipeline is so salty that one can't use to even for bathing,\" Jalpa says, adding, \"The nearest government high school in Sikka is around 20 km away from our village and villagers can't afford fees of a private high school in nearby Padana village as people's earnings are not that big.\" Hundreds of kilometres away, in Bahediya village of Sabarkantha, water is a poll issue for Dimple Solanki (21). A third-year student of a private nursing college in Khedbrahma, Dimple recently welcomed Congress leaders at a public meeting in their village by offering them flowers and applying tilak on their foreheads.\n\nSpeaking with The Indian Express, Dimple says, \"I support Congress. We are facing a problem of drinking water in our village. Pipelines and taps have been installed under 'Nal se Jal' (scheme of the government), but we don't get water in it. We get our drinking water from a personal borewell that we have prepared.\"\n\nAt The 'Onion Bowl' In Mahuva\n\nLast year, in December, farmers in Bhavnagar's Mahuva town - 'the onion bowl of Gujarat' - and other parts of the state had blocked roads after the central government banned onion export. At the Mahuva Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC), onion prices crashed from an average Rs 462 per mann (20 kg) to around Rs 210 within four days. A similar drop was also witnessed in 2020 after the government banned exports to rein in soaring prices. Arguably, these are the issues that are playing on the minds of farmers this poll season.\n\n\"Rs 400 per mann would be a worthwhile price but that can happen only if our onions are exported,\" says Nanji Shiyal, 48, a farmer from Khared village of Mahuva after his onion produce (priced at Rs 260 per mann) was auctioned off at rate of Rs 256 per mann at the mandi late last month. \"Onion prices rise once in four years and if the government intervenes during such periods, farmers are denied their chance of recovering losses of previous years,\" says the farmer who has studied till Class 3.\n\nGhanshyam Patel, chairman of Mahuva APMC, says the central government will have to find a long-term solution to address price volatility. \"From the peak of Rs 2,100 per mann in January 2020, onion prices crashed to Rs 50 per mann last summer. This summer, they are hovering at around Rs 200. This gives one an idea how volatile the price remains. In such a market, farmers will be able to sustain themselves if the government remains considerate in its actions when it becomes a sellers' market. Dehydrated onion is an easy substitute during days of high onion prices. But the policy of making fresh onion available to all the people all the time, even at the cost of farmers, will have its own price to pay in the long run,\" says the cooperative leader.\n\nMahesh Bhukan, 23, a farmer of Taredi village, agrees with Patel. \"Not only onion prices, onion yields also remain volatile, especially during the Kharif season and a liberal exports policy will do farmers a world of good,\" he says as sweat streams down his forehead while unloading his onion bags from a tractor trailer on Mahuva APMC yard.\n\nHis onion was sold at Rs 225 per mann last month. \"This price will barely cover the cultivation cost,\" says the farmer who dropped out of school after he failed the Class 10 exam. \"I vote for a good candidate and mostly BJP provides a good candidate,\" he says. In Bildi village of Mahuva, Karan Sankhat, 31, a sharecropper with no formal education, says he is not able to get his head around the onion market. \"When I sow groundnut, prices will be good. But by the time it is time to harvest and cart my onion to market, prices go bust. This is not fair from a farmer's point of view,\" says Sankhat as he oversees labourers harvesting onion from his farm, adding, \"This time, I am going to vote for a change and give a chance to someone else.\"\n\nRecounting Horror of Flash Floods\n\nIn September 2023, flash floods caused by sudden release of water from the Sardar Sarovar Dam on the Narmada River destroyed nearly 25 homes in Juna Chhapra village of Ankleshwar taluka in Bharuch district, which was among the worst hit .\n\nIn the village of mixed communities, Bhavna Vasava, a tribal, says her house became a pile of bricks. She shows a picture saved on her mobile phone. Her daughter, who is 16, dropped out of school after the floods. \"Nobody did anything when the water came. We applied for compensation and half the (affected) people got Rs 7,000. We haven't got anything yet\", says Bhavnaben\n\n\"You can't even build a wall with Rs 7,000,\" says Bhuriben, whose kitchen area got washed out. \"Who has seen Mansukh (Vasava)?\" says Suresh Vasava, Bhuriben's husband, who were among those who got the Rs 7,000 compensation, suggesting that the BJP candidate has not come to this village of mixed population comprising OBCs, tribals and others, but they respect their sarpanch, who is also from the BJP. \"Our sarpanch helped us salvage our belongings,\" they say in unison.\n\nJob Quest & Paper Leaks\n\nIt's a blazing afternoon and two students are waiting for a bus at the campus of Saurashtra University in Rajkot. Rakesh Vasani (25) -- one of the two students -- has taken up a day job to fund his education and other expenses. He polishes diamonds in two shifts - from 8 am-11 am and 1 pm-6 pm - and earns up to Rs 18,000 a month. Hailing from Lilapur village of Rajkot's Jasdan taluka, he is pursuing Masters of Arts in History from Saurashtra University. Amid his pursuit of a government job, Rakesh has so far taken five competitive exams but four got cancelled because of paper leaks. \"I want to get into the police force\", Rakesh tells The Indian Express. But he is angry that the government announces vacancies \"only when there are elections\".\n\n\"Nobody comes to us after elections,\" says Rakesh. His parents are labourers back in Lilapur. They have five children and Rakesh's brothers are also diamond polishers. He finds both the ruling BJP and rival Congress \"unimpressive\".\n\nAlso, he does not relate to the recent controversy linked to the BJP's Rajkot candidate and Union Minister Parshottam Rupala over his alleged anti-Kshatriya comments. \"They (protesters from the community) should forget it and move on,\" he says. Demands for withdrawal of Rupala's candidature grew in the last few weeks as did the protests over his comments.\n\nKaran Rathod, another student standing next to Rakesh, is also from Jasdan, in pursuit of a government job and has taken several competitive exams, at times \"missing the merit list by two marks. His father is employed with the Indian Postal Service.\n\nJobs remain a major election issue for both Karan and Rakesh, who represent an average young voter in Rajkot. They say their vote usually goes to the candidate and not the party.\n\nSapna Meena, 23, a student of M.Pharm at Saurashtra University, puts \"unemployment\" at the top on her list of electoral issues, and says, \"The frequent paper leaks cause immense mental agony.\" Daughter of a railway employee, she aspires to work for the government as it would help her maintain a \"work-life balance\". \"Exam dete hain, aur ghar pahunchte pata chalta hai ki paper leak ho gaya (We take the exam and reach home to realise the paper has leaked),\" says Meena, who has her roots in Rajasthan.\n\nHiren Makwana, 30, a civil engineer with a multinational firm which is executing a project of the Rajkot Municipal Corporation (RMC), however, is of the view that paper leaks are not a new issue. \"It is possible that people didn't come to know about the leaks earlier. But now, the situation is different,\" Makwana says.\n\nThe engineer, who hails from Junagadh, also says that one can't keep waiting for a government job endlessly. \"If one is talented, private jobs are equally well-paying,\" he says.\n\nDrawing parallels between politics and the private sector, he says, \"Ones who work for people, get elected. Performance is all that matters,\" he says.\n\nIn Chhota Udepur, Sunilkumar Rathwa, 28, from Khajuria village says that the lack of employment opportunities in tribal regions forces migration, which, he thinks, can end by setting up more industries in such areas.\n\nSunilkumar, who has completed a course from the Centre of Continuing Education (CCE), says, \"It is a struggle to get jobs. The government jobs are out of reach and taking up a private job means moving to other cities like Surat, Bharuch or Saurashtra... The government needs to set up industries in tribal areas to increase opportunities in the region. In Narmada district, they (the government) have planned to increase tourism but in Chhota Udepur, except mines, there is no other way.\"\n\nSunil is referring to the dolomite mines that are spread across the taluka. But for Veliya Thanak, a mine worker in Vanar village, mining is an industry for those who have no other skill.\n\nCovered with mine dust, he sips tea from a saucer, and says, \"We have grown up in this village and our fathers worked in mines. We grazed cattle as kids and as a natural progression took to mining after our fathers... It would not be a preference to work in mines if we had other opportunities?. Why would anyone be exposed willingly to the risk of silicosis? But we are uneducated and setting out in search of jobs in other cities would mean added expenditures. So we choose to stay back and work in mines and on our farms. My children go to school in the village but I am not sure what kind of opportunities await them later in life as nothing has changed for our village in the last five decades at least -- there are no roads, no water connection, no hospitals in the vicinity...\"\n\nHit-And-Miss\n\nIn Pithavadi village of Amreli district's Savarkundla taluka, Kishor Aal, 23, a truck driver who is set to vote for the first time in Lok Sabha election, says that he votes for Prime Minister Narendra Modi. \"He has done lots of vikas (development). Roads in Amreli look good,\" he says. Kishor dropped out of school after Class 10.\n\n\"But the (government) proposal to punish drivers with 10 years of imprisonment in hit-and-run cases was bad,\" Kishor says, adding, \"I have never seen a non-BJP government in Gujarat and elders tell us that Congress is gone for good. However, it is good to have candidates who are well-educated,\" he further opines. Earlier this year, the new hit-and-run law that came with strict punishment was put on hold by the central government amid countrywide protests by transport bodies.\n\n'Kshatriya samaj first'\n\nIn Surat's Moti Naroli village, Siddhrajsinh Vasi, a businessman, his father Ranjitsinh and uncle Natwarsinh are angry with Union minister Rupala for his comments against the community and say they will \"vote against the BJP\", but they regard Prime Minister Narendra Modi as a \"hero\".\n\n\"Now, this is a national election but when there is a village election, this issue will have an impact. People in the village will not forget this till the panchayat election,\" says Siddhrajsinh, adding that no Rajput has got the ticket this time. \"We know how prices rose, we know how much work was done, and we know how secure we are, but first our Kshatriya samaj and then BJP,\" says Ranjitsinh, adding that there would have been \"no democracy if Bhavnagar's erstwhile ruler Krishnakumarsinh

In fact, the average American eats about 22 pounds of onions per year! But what we don't love is the way onions make our eyes burn and tear when we slice into them. That's why we asked food scientists how to cut onions without crying. Keep scrolling for their genius hacks!\n\nWhy do onions make me cry?\n\nOnions have a natural defense mechanism that prevents predators from eating them and helps them grow to maturity. When we cut an onion, we essentially rip apart its cellular structure, causing a cascade of chemical reactions, says Abbey Thiel, creator of the YouTube channel Abbey the Food Scientist.\n\nOne of these reactions leads to a molecule called syn-propanethial-S-oxide, which vaporizes into a gas and eventually comes into contact with our eyes. \"After reacting with the moisture in our eyes, small amounts of sulphuric acid are produced which irritates the cornea and leads to the tears.\" While you may not be able to completely eliminate tearing up, there are several tricks you can use to beat the burn next time you're chopping onions for a meal.\n\nSee Abbey the Food Scientist discuss the science behind the crying -- as well as some ways to prevent it! - here:\n\nHow to cut onions without crying: 9 smart strategies\n\n1. Sharpen your knives\n\nThe compounds that make your eyes burn and tear up are released when you cut into the onion, but using a sharp knife causes less damage and releases less tear-causing compounds into the air, says \"The Onionista,\" Rene Hardwick, Director of Public and Industry Relations for the National Onion Association. \"If you use a serrated knife or a knife that you've been using to cut through the wall and it's dull, it tends to break into the cells a bit more and then more compounds come out.\"\n\nRelated: Life Hacks Alert! Sharpen Dull Knives in Seconds With This Common Household Item\n\nSee this video from culinary scientist Jessica Gavin that mentions 7 ways to cut an onion without crying -- including the sharp knife method:\n\n2. How to cut onions without crying: Keep them cool\n\n\"We recommend that you chill an onion for 30 minutes prior to cutting into it,\" says Hardwick. Cold temperatures slow down the chemical processes that release the tear-inducing compounds, delaying how quickly they happen and giving you more cutting time. So as long as you're able to chop fairly quickly, any exposure to the compound is greatly reduced.\n\nIf you wear contact lenses, you may have noticed that cutting onions doesn't affect you as severely as it does someone who doesn't wear them. \"Contact lenses act like little shields and protect your eyes from the irritating gas,\" says Thiel. You can replicate this effect -- and even improve on it -- by wearing onion cutting goggles. \"You're basically shielding your eyes from the irritating gas because it can't enter through the goggles.\"\n\nSetting up a fan near your cutting area and turning it on low or cutting under a vent can help to prevent any tearing that occurs while you're chopping an onion. That's because a fan would blow much of the syn-propanethial-S-oxide away rather than allowing it to reach your eyes, while a vent would suck up the air containing the compound, says Hardwick.\n\nLondon Brazil of The Evolving Table mentions using a fan or vent while cutting in this video:\n\nRelated: Home Pro's Genius Fan Trick Helps Get the Smell of Burnt Food Out of Your House\n\n5. How to cut onions without crying: Break out your bread\n\nThough no one seems to really know the science behind this onion cutting hack, there are some that swear that it works. Simply hold a piece of day old white or wheat bread in your mouth like a giant tongue, says Linda Carucci, chef, culinary instructor and author of Cooking School Secrets for Real World Cooks. while chopping the onion and it's said to prevent crying. Carucci thinks \"It sort of deflects the vaporized compound from going up into your nose.\"\n\nSome say to leave the stem intact and others say leaving the root intact is the trick to preventing your onion-cutting tears. Carucci prefers cutting the root off and leaving the stem end intact, and then slicing the onion in half and then cutting each half in half again, always cutting through the stem rather than across it. If you're right-handed, she then recommends cutting slices in the onion perpendicular to the board with the rounded end of the onion facing away from you, the flat end facing down onto the cutting board and the stem in your left hand, without cutting through the stem. Finally, with your knife perpendicular to the cuts you just made, cut through the onion from right to left all the up to the stem.\n\n\"One reason this may work is because you're damaging the onion membranes less when you cut in this way and releasing fewer compounds,\" says Carucci. If you're a leftie, reverse the directions.\n\n7. How to cut onions without crying: Use the wet paper towel trick\n\nSome experts claim that placing a wet paper towel next to the cutting board while you're chopping an onion will attract the syn-propanethial-S-oxide, drawing it into the towel rather than letting it float through the air up to your eyes. Some people say this doesn't work, but the tip went viral on TikTok a few years ago -- and the folks at knifemaker F.N. Sharp mention it, so we say it's worth giving it a shot at least once to see if it works for you.\n\nRelated:How To Clean a Wooden Cutting Board + the Salt Trick That Wipes Out Stubborn Stains\n\nPlace a lit candle right next to the onion on the cutting board, and begin cutting or chopping. When candles burn, oxygen molecules in the air interact with wax molecules and the wax burns. The theory behind this method is that as the candle flame burns using up the oxygen in the air around it, it also burns up the vaporized compound from the onion. \"That might be one I would consider trying because of the atmospherics,\" says Carucci.\n\nGavin mentions this in her video above, but also see this video from Smart Fox that provides an explanation:\n\n9. How to cut onions without crying: Use your microwave\n\nThe folks at Toshiba Lifestyle say your microwave is good for helping to reduce the fumes that occur after you cut into an onion. They recommend heating an onion for 30 seconds in the microwave before beginning your chopping. They say, \"The heat of the microwave releases the eye irritants in the onion so you can cut while avoiding tears.\" If you need your onion crunchy, though, you might not want to give this method a try as heating the onion will also soften it up a bit. Dipping the onion briefly into boiling water would work in the same way.\n\nHow not to cut an onion to avoid crying\n\nOne way you may have hear of to avoid coming into contact with the gas produced by cutting an onion, is to do your chopping with the onion under cold running water or submerged in a bowl of cold water, but Thiel doesn't really recommend them. \"These methods would work because any of the irritating gas that's produced gets flushed away by the water,\" says Thiel, but notes that \"both these methods sound like an awfully good way to accidentally cut yourself.\" If you do choose one of these methods, we advise caution.\n\nFor more on onions, click through the links below!\n\nThis Baking Staple Makes Tasty Caramelized Onions in Half the Time -- Chef's Top Trick\n\nWhy Chefs Love to Cook With Leeks + Easy Recipes Full of Delicious Sweet Oniony Flavor", "source": {"uri": "charlotteobserver.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Charlotte Observer"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_stem", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Plant stem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Onion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syn-Propanethial-S-oxide", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Syn-Propanethial-S-oxide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaporization", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vaporization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goggles", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Goggles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contact_lens", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Contact lens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornea", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cornea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfuric_acid", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sulfuric acid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Predation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Molecule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knife", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Knife"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chemical reaction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bread", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bread"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sterling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pound sterling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaf", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Leaf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perpendicular", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Perpendicular"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_towel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paper towel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutting_board", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cutting board"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Candle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Cook", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "James Cook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toshiba", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Toshiba"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Comics/Distributors", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Comics/Distributors", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Cooking/Fusion", "label": "dmoz/Home/Cooking/Fusion", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Video/Training", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Video/Training", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Walls", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Walls", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Cooking/Techniques", "label": "dmoz/Home/Cooking/Techniques", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://www.mcclatchy-wires.com/incoming/iali97/picture288357895/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/4cc034f1-c602-44d4-b9b2-eff86775411b", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538611", "eventUri": "eng-9538611", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 111, "relevance": 1}

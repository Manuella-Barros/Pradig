Myers, chairman of investment advisory firm Signum Global, voiced his optimism despite Biden\u2019s stumbling and mumbling his way through Thursday\u2019s televised debate against Donald Trump, igniting fresh concern over the 81-year-old\u2019s cognitive faculties. Myers also dismissed the idea that California Gov. Gavin Newsom or Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer could be parachuted in to face off against Donald Trump. Myers stressed that there is \u201cno mechanism\u201d in the Democratic Party\u2019s internal rules to topple Biden as their would-be presidential candidate. \u201cThe Plan B is Kamala,\u201d the major Biden fundraiser told the Post, referring to the vice president, who is less popular in the polls than Biden. Follow the latest on Trump and Biden\u2019s 2024 debate: Biden\u2019s candidacy in doubt after weak, frozen debate performance against Trump leaves Dems in \u2018aggressive panic\u2019 Kamala Harris says Biden had \u2018slow start\u2019 but \u2018strong finish\u2019 in debate after Anderson Cooper pressed her on Dem \u2018panic\u2019 Is Biden sick? Prez\u2019s voice sounds raspy during debate against Trump We just witnessed the end of Joe Biden\u2019s presidency But Myers also said Biden could have to stand down if Trump steals a march on him in the six key presidential battlegrounds: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. \u201cI\u2019m watching the polls closely in the swing states,\u201d the ex-Evercore executive said. \u201cIf Trump pulls ahead by 8-9 points in the swing states over the next 3-4 weeks then there will be people legitimately asking him to step aside.\u201d Some Democratic operatives have questioned whether Barack Obama\u2019s vice president can stay at the top of the ticket. David Axelrod, a top strategist for Obama, told CNN: \u201cThere are gonna be discussions on if he should continue.\u201d \u201cThere is no way to spin this. His performance was disqualifying,\u201d a top Democratic fundraiser who spoke on condition of anonymity was quoted as saying after the debate. \u201cI expect fundraising to dry up. Money follows enthusiasm,\u201d the source told Reuters. \u201cHow can anyone with a straight face say \u2018Donate to elect Joe.\u2019\u201d Biden\u2019s campaign and pro-Biden groups have managed to rake in as much as $389 million for this year\u2019s White House race. If he refuses to pull out, then Democratic National Convention delegates would need to stage a revolt at the event in Chicago in August. The rules state: \u201cDelegates elected to the national convention pledged to a presidential candidate shall in all good conscience reflect the sentiments of those who elected them.\u201d The number of delegates needed is 1,968 and Mr Biden has already gathered 3,894 because he has run virtually unopposed, despite concerns about his health. Biden appeared to lose his train of thought on several occasions on Thursday, drifting between subjects and allowing his voice to trail off before he could complete his answers. But he tried to dismiss calls for him to step aside with a more energetic performance at a rally in North Carolina on Friday. \u201cI know I am not a young man,\u201d he told supporters.", "summary": "\u201cI thought the performance was appalling but not catastrophic, and there is more than enough time to turn it around,\u201d Myers added.", "url": "https://nypost.com/2024/06/28/business/top-dem-donor-says-its-wishful-thinking-that-biden-will-quit-race-despite-appalling-debate/", "image": "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/newspress-collage-86niqg9fd-1719622764175.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1719608396&w=1200", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 01:02:52", "author": "James Franey", "authors": ["James Franey"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.387}

Tavares is coming off a third-round knockout loss in his last fight meanwhile, Park is coming off a razor-close split-decision defeat to Andre Muniz in his last fight. With that said, check out our UFC odds series for our Tavares-Park prediction and pick.\n\nBrad Tavares (20-9) is now just 1-3 in his last four fights and he's coming off a third-round knockout loss to Gregory Rodrigues. Now, Tavares may be fighting for his career at age 36 when he faces off against JunYong Park this weekend at UFC Vegas 94.\n\nJunYong Park (17-6) was on a roll winning four fights in a row until a razor-close split-decision loss to Andre Muniz halted his rise up the rankings. Park will now be looking to get back on track and potentially crack the top 15 when he takes on Brad Tavares this weekend at the UFC Apex.\n\nBrad Tavares has been looking like he's on his last legs in his most recent TKO defeat to Gregory Rodrigues. That has put him at just 1-3 in his last four fights and is desperately needing a win this weekend. The Tavares of old who's been a gatekeeper at the top of the division will need to come back when he faces off with JunYong Park this weekend at the UFC Apex.\n\nTavares is at his best when he's utilizing his lead calf kicks early on in his fights which helps him dictate the fight's pace. From there Tavares has his range and he's able to keep his movement on the feet flowing so that he can stick and move without getting countered. That should make Park fight off his backfoot, where he has had issues in the past.\n\nIf Tavares can get back to his calculated pressure and counters he will make this a tough fight in his backyard of Las Vegas and get back into the winning column.\n\nWhy JunYong Park Will Win\n\nJunYong Park looked like he was going to get into the top 15 after coming into his fight with Andre Muniz riding a four-fight winning streak. Unfortunately, he dropped a close split decision to Muniz which has now set him back. However, a meeting with Tavares is the right matchup for Park to showcase his abilities for a chance to get a number next to his name this weekend at the UFC Apex.\n\nPark is a very well-rounded that does everything well but not great. That's not a knock on his abilities, he is a fighter who doesn't excel in one thing and he's been beaten by getting out grappled and outstruck on separate occasions showing that has areas of weakness. With that said, Park still is a very hard fight for anyone in the middleweight division.\n\nHe throws a ton of volume on the feet making it hard for a fighter like Tavares who wants to sit back and counter. That kind of approach can put Tavares behind on the scorecards from simply not doing enough. Then when Tavares does open up that's when Park can level change and take the fight to the mat. It will be up to Park to be the busier fighter in there and mix it up if he wants to get back to his winning ways this weekend.\n\nFinal Brad Tavares-JunYong Park Prediction & Pick\n\nThis should be a great scrap in the co-main event of the evening. Brad Tavares the once longtime ranked middleweight contender will be needing a big win here this weekend meanwhile, Park wants to solidify that he deserves a ranking next to his name when he steps into the Octagon this weekend. As for how this matchup goes Park will need to overwhelm Tavares with his pace and volume while Tavares will need to systematically break Park down by landing the heavier strikes. Ultimately, the volume and the pace of Park will be too much for Tavares to overcome at this stage of his career as he will just outstrike Tavares throughout the course of this fight and get himself back into the win column and one fight closer to a top-ranked opponent.\n\nClick here for more betting news and predictions", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "garrett_kerman@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Garrett Kerman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Tavares", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brad Tavares"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Knockout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Fighting_Championship", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ultimate Fighting Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregory_Rodrigues", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gregory Rodrigues"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UFC_Apex", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "UFC Apex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amanda_Lemos", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amanda Lemos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virna_Jandiroba", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Virna Jandiroba"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middleweight_(MMA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Middleweight (MMA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middleweight", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Middleweight"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme_Parks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme Parks", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme_Parks/Individual_Parks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme Parks/Individual Parks", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme_Parks/Defunct", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme Parks/Defunct", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme_Parks/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme Parks/Guides", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Team_Spirit/Fight_Songs", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Team Spirit/Fight Songs", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Brad-Tavares-vs-JunYong-Park-prediction-odds-pick-for-UFC-Vegas-94.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9747926", "eventUri": "eng-9747926", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 211, "relevance": 1}

Tavares was originally scheduled to share the card with Xtreme Couture teammate Ige, who was slated to trade leather with Jose Mariscal.\n\nHowever, Ige ended up replacing Brian Ortega against Diego Lopes on four hours' notice in the co-main event at UFC 303 last month. While Ige went on lose by unanimous decision, he gave Lopes a run for his money, putting the Brazilian in survival mode in the final frame. Ige subsequently asked for a spot on the highly sought-after UFC 306 card in September at the Sphere, which he was guaranteed by Dana White.\n\nTavares revealed that he and Ige had discussed potentially fighting at UFC 306 even before \"50k\" accepted the short-notice matchup. But now having to go through fight camp alone, Tavares jokingly called Ige \"selfish\" for taking up the UFC 303 fight.\n\n\"He got that 3 hour - 4 hour short notice and he'll most like get to fight on that card [UFC 306] because of that,\" Tavares said at the UFC on ESPN 60 media day. \"But yeah, we were saying even before that opportunity, like, 'Oh that would awesome to turnaround and get on that card. And bringing up Dan, I'm very disappointed in him for taking that four-hour fight. It was very selfish of him, we're supposed to be in this together. Nah, I'm just kidding. I got my fight and Dan got his, he told me, 'Hey, we're on the same card again.' I was stoked. It's always good to suffer with a brother going through the fight week. And doing everything together. But then when I got the news he took that fight, I was like, 'Well, we're not going to be fighting together anymore.\"\n\nAs brave as Ige is for accepting a fight on short notice, Tavares believes there is an upside to fighting in such circumstances. Tavares claims he also would have jumped at the opportunity to fight someone without having to go through a camp and cut weight.\n\n\"I think Dan, one - he's a freaking hammer for doing it right. But it was super smart of him, it was a great opportunity. And look at how he did in that fight. Like imagine with a full fight camp what that fight would have looked like. The one good thing I'll say about it, it would be nice, imagine you're just chilling, they're like, 'Hey, you got to fight, you're going to win, whatever weight you're at, you're going to fight at that weight.' I'll be like, 'Okay, cool.' And hopefully you hadn't done a hard training session right before that. But yeah, it's something that I definitely would jump at the opportunity if presented to me.\"\n\nTavares is fresh off a TKO loss against Gregory Rodrigues.

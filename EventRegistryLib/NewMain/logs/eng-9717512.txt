They were one of the favorites to progress from the group that also had South Africa, Bangladesh, Nepal, and the Netherlands. However, the Islanders failed to live up to the expectations and exited the competition at the group stage as South Africa and Bangladesh made it to the Super 8s.\n\nSri Lanka started their campaign with a humiliating loss against South Africa. On a treacherous pitch in New York, they were bowled out for just 77 runs and lost the game by 6 wickets. It was followed by a 2-wicket loss against Bangladesh before the game against Nepal was washed out and confirmed their exit.\n\nThe Sri Lankan team has faced criticism not only for the poor performance but also for allegedly partying before their World Cup opener. A news outlet recently reported that at least five leading players of the team as well as some officials were involved in a late-night drinking session in one of the hotel rooms the night before the match.\n\nThe report alleged that three top-order batsmen, a veteran pacer, and an allrounder were involved in the party. The news outlet also stated that a player-manager was at the party as well and said that his presence might have breached the ICC rules and regulations.\n\nWith the Sri Lankan team facing the heat, SLC has reacted to the allegations and has vehemently denied them.

In his resignation, Hasaranga expressed that his decision was made in the best interest of Sri Lanka Cricket. He emphasized his commitment to the team and his desire to contribute as a player. \"Sri Lanka will always have my utmost best efforts as a player, and I will support and stand by my team and leadership as always,\" Hasaranga stated in his resignation letter.\n\nThe SLC, while accepting his resignation, acknowledged Hasaranga's importance to the team. \"Sri Lanka Cricket wishes to state that Hasaranga will remain an important player for us in our international cricketing plans,\" the statement read. The team's struggles at the T20 World Cup have led to significant changes within the coaching staff as well. Head coach Chris Silverwood had earlier resigned, citing personal reasons. The 49-year-old former England coach was thanked by SLC for his \"valuable contributions during his tenure.\"\n\nUnder Silverwood's guidance, Sri Lanka experienced mixed results. The Wanindu Hasaranga-led side won only one match at the T20 World Cup, against the Netherlands, and failed to advance past the group stage, finishing behind South Africa and Bangladesh.

However, his impact on the team's performances was significant, with his all-round abilities often proving to be a game-changer. His leadership skills were put to the test during the T20 World Cup, where Sri Lanka's campaign fell short of expectations.\n\nAs Sri Lanka prepare to host India for a limited-overs series, comprising three T20Is and three ODIs, the focus will shift to identifying Hasaranga's successor as the T20I captain.\n\nThe TOI Sports Desk excels in a myriad of roles that capture the essence of live sporting events and deliver compelling content to readers worldwide.

They were drawn in Group D alongside South Africa, Bangladesh, Netherlands and Nepal. The Wanindu Hasaranga-led side was one of the favourites to progress ahead of the group stage. However, they failed to live up to the expectations and bowed out of the competition at the first stage itself.\n\nSri Lanka began their campaign in the ninth edition of the T20 World Cup in a humiliating fashion. They were bowled out for just 77 runs against South Africa and lost the game by six wickets. In their second game, they suffered a 2-wicket loss against Bangladesh as their batters failed to deliver for the second game in a row.\n\nThey were eliminated from the tournament after their third group game against Nepal was washed out. In their final group game, Sri Lanka had defeated the Netherlands by 83 runs.\n\nDays after the humiliating exit from the T20 World Cup, Wanindu Hasaranga has stepped down as Sri Lanka's T20I captain. The spin-bowling allrounder failed to lead his team from the front in the tournament as Sri Lanka failed to do well in yet another ICC competition.\n\n\"Sri Lanka will always have my utmost best efforts as a player, and I will support and stand by my team and leadership as always,\" Hasaranga wrote in his resignation letter to SLC.\n\nIn the first two games, Wanindu Hasaranga could not even open his account although he picked up 2 wickets in each of the games. In the third game against the Netherlands, he scored an unbeaten 20 and picked up 2 more wickets.\n\nWanindu Hasaranga was appointed as Sri Lanka's T20I captain in December last year after Dasun Shanaka was sacked as the white-ball captain. The spinner led Sri Lanka in a total of 10 T20Is and picked up 19 wickets while scoring 137 runs. Under his captaincy, Sri Lanka won the home series against Zimbabwe and Afghanistan earlier this year.\n\nSri Lanka Cricket (SLC) is expected to announce the new T20I captain soon as they will be taking on India in a three-match T20I series later this month.

Former cricketer Sanath Jayasuriya has been named as the interim coach till the England series.\n\nMeanwhile, Hasaranga opened up his resignation saying that he tried hard and gave his best effort but acknowledged that it wasn't enough. However, despite the resignation, Hasaranga promised to support the team whenever needed.\n\n\"Sri Lanka will always have my utmost best efforts as a player, and I will support and stand by my team and leadership as always,\" said Hasaranga in his resignation letter.\n\nHe led the national team in 10 T20Is only. His resignation may also indicate his plans for the future. Plenty of cricketers in international cricket are not willing to take up any important role in the national team to play more franchise cricket. It needs to be seen what Hasaranga does in the future, especially when he already retired from Test cricket earlier.\n\nSri Lanka Cricket (SLC) is yet to announce Hasaranga's replacement. However, with the squad for the India series set to be announced soon, the answer is on the cards. Before Hasaranga, Dasun Shanaka led the fortress but it's unlikely that the team would go back to him.

It shapes societal well-being and serves as a crucial determinant of the nation's overall strength. A strong economy works to retain and grow jobs and investment within a country (Clickner, 2012) which provides citizens with employment opportunities, and increased living standards. In addition to that, it benefits the government with higher tax revenues that increase the capacity of the government and the resources needed to provide public goods and services such as healthcare, social protection, education and other necessary services (Sen, 2021).\n\nOn the other hand, foreign employment has become a global trend where millions of people from native countries, especially from developing countries migrate to other countries for employment in every labour skill level. According to the latest international migrant workers report released by the International Labour Organization (ILO), in 2019, an estimated 169 million people are international migrant workers. These migrant workers cover up 4.9% of the global labour force whereas 99 million of the migrant workers are men and women migrant workers are calculated to be 70 million (ILO, 2021).\n\nIn the aspect of Sri Lanka, led by the ongoing economic crisis, a high trend of labour migration prevails where a significant number of Sri Lankans migrate to other countries in search of job opportunities. This has created both challenges and opportunities to Sri Lanka. Therefore, this article is aimed at analyzing the contribution of migrant workers to enhance economic security as a pillar of the national security of Sri Lanka.\n\nEconomic Background of Sri Lanka\n\nAs a nation with a long-lasting and rich culture, tradition and history, Sri Lanka owns an economy marked by various phases, challenges and opportunities. The ancient economy of Sri Lanka dwelled around agriculture where the country was called as the \"granary of the east\" for its agricultural richness. At present, Sri Lanka accounts for an overall economy of 77.1 billion USD (Central Bank of Sri Lanka, 2022) where the service, industry and agriculture sectors remain the largest contributing segments. As of 2022, the agriculture sector has contributed 906.5 billion Sri Lankan Rupees; the industry sector has contributed 3,309.8 billion Sri Lankan Rupees and the service sector has contributed 7,265.1 billion Sri Lankan Rupees, which is the highest that covers around 60% of the country's total economy.\n\nThe current economic condition of Sri Lanka is not at its best as the phase has been continuously challenged by several factors including the Easter Sunday attack, Covid-19 pandemic, high public debts and the ongoing economic crisis. Currently, Sri Lanka is experiencing a critical economic condition where the increased inflation has resulted in increased prices of goods and services including essential commodities. In September 2022, the nation experienced a peak rate of 69.8% inflation whereas by the end of 2022, it remained at 57.2% (Ministry of Finance, Economic Stabilization and National Policies, 2022).\n\nLabour migration of Sri Lankans\n\nAnnually, a significant number of Sri Lankans migrate to other countries in search of job opportunities. In 2022 alone, 311,056 (SLBFE, 2022) of Sri Lankans have migrated to other countries for employment purposes. Currently, around 1.5 million Sri Lankans are employed in jobs in other countries, out of which more than 50% of them are of either middle skilled or low skilled labour categories. According to the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment (SLBFE), in 2022, Kuwait, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Oman, Maldives, South Korea, Romania, Jordan and Japan have been identified as the top 10 destination countries (Figure 01) of Sri Lankans for labour migration (SLBFE, 2022).\n\nA number of factors such as poverty, economic disparities, government's encouragement of export labour (Meshelemia and Prasanga, 2017) combined with the current economic crisis are acting as the main push factors that lead Sri Lankans to migrate in search of job opportunities.\n\nThe labour market opportunities in the destination countries, the ability to earn more and send home remittances and the belief that the life will be better abroad (Meshelemia and Prasanga, 2017) are some of the main factors that encourage Sri Lankans to select particular countries as their preferred destinations.\n\nSri Lankan migrant workers in other countries significantly contribute to the growth of the country's economy through remittances they send home. According to (CBSL, 2022) Sri Lanka has received the following amounts of money as foreign remittances between 2018 - 2022 (Figure 02). Adhering to the figure, it shows that there is a significant drop-down of remittances received in 2021 and 2022 compared to the previous years.\n\nChallenges\n\nEven though migration seems like a dream coming true for many people, the reality is not always a novel phenomenon. It is true that working abroad provide people with several advantages including high salaries, the ability to send home remittances, ability to gain new skills and experiences, experience other cultures and expand career opportunities (Immigration Advice Service UK, 2022) but it is also a journey full of challenges and difficulties. Human rights violations including harassment, abuse at the workplace and breach of labour rights (Institute of Policy Studies, 2014) combined with a number of other challenges such as lack of decent work, low language proficiency, forced labour, exposure to health issues, debt bondage and other forms of exploitation (UN Network on Migration in Sri Lanka, 2020) remain the main challenges faced by Sri Lankan migrant workers. Labour skill levels of Sri Lankan migrant workers have a direct impact on this and low and middle-skilled level migrant have been identified as the most vulnerable groups to be subjected to these challenges (Institute of Policy Studies, 2014).\n\nIn addition to that, the COVID 19 pandemic during 2020 can be mentioned as a global issue that significantly challenged the lifestyles of Sri Lankan migrant workers. A significant number of workers lost their jobs or have not received their wages which resulted in an economic downturn. As of June 2020, 10,355 migrants have been repatriated to Sri Lankan and the remittance inflows reduced by 23.3% significantly affecting the beneficiaries of remittances and the Sri Lankan economy as a whole (UN Network on Migration in Sri Lanka).\n\nSteps taken\n\nAs a responsible state, Sri Lanka has taken a number of steps to ensure the protection and well-being of Sri Lankan migrant workers. The latest National Policy and Action Plan 2023 - 2027 on Migration for Employment released by the Ministry of Labour and Foreign Employment has introduced four core policy areas focusing on the individual migrant workers as well as family members of the migrant workers. It aims to promote decent and productive employment, secure rights and protection of migrant workers and ensure the well-being of their families, promote employment opportunities for skilled and semi-skilled migrant workers and enhance the benefits of migration and its nexus with nation development.\n\nAccordingly, it plans to strengthen the legal, regulatory and institutional framework; promote policy linkages, institutional coherence and multi-sectoral coordination; capacity development of key stakeholders and to strengthen structures and systems to ensure professionalization of the recruitment sector to achieve its first policy area of promoting decent and productive employment.\n\nMoreover, it aims to secure rights and protection of migrant workers and ensure well-being of their families through strengthened and well-planned, coordinated, efficient and gender responsive services; strengthening grievance handling and dispute resolutions for the protection and security of migrant workers; establishing social security systems in collaboration with host countries and educating and empowering migrant workers (Ministry of Labour and Foreign Employment, 2023).\n\nSteps already taken by Sri Lanka towards ensuring the safety and rights of the migrant workers include ratification of the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families in 1996, the Convention on the Rights of the Child in 1993 and the UN Trafficking Protocol in 2015 (International Organization for Migration); Not granting job approvals by the SLBFE for the countries where no Sri Lanka Missions are operated; Providing services such as linking migration and development, training and skill development: Conducting mandatory pre-departure training program for migrant domestic workers in a step in the right direction; Increasing the minimum age limit of women migrating for domestic work; Upgrading the training given to women and making the background report compulsory for migration (Ranasinghe, 2020 and Liyanaarachchi and Wijenayake, 2021) and so on.\n\nConclusion\n\nEconomic stability as an economic security factor remains a crucial factor that shape the national security of a nation. A Strong Economy is always the foundation of a strong country (The Government of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, 2021). If the economy is declining, it leads to people's suffering, social unrest and political instability and even lowers the strength of the country's security. In the same way, if the economy is strong, all the other aspects of the country become strong, including the national security of the country.\n\nThe 'developing' economic status of Sri Lanka combined with the ongoing economic crisis and various other variables such as poverty, economic disparities and the government's encouragement of export labour has led a significant number of Sri Lankans to migrate to wealthy nations in search of better job opportunities. Though migration of labour is a path filled with numerous challenges for the migrants, in contrast, it is one of the main income generators to the nation's economy. The sourness of the reality appears here when a significant of these migrant workers having to go through bitter experiences and difficulties for the sake of earning money. Considering the significant contribution of these people to the economic development of the country, it is vital for Sri Lanka to ensure the protection of these people through already implemented mechanisms as well as through implementing recommended mechanisms.\n\nRecommendations\n\nIt is very important to address the push factors including poverty and economic crisis that increase the economic vulnerabilities of people and lead them to migrate for employment, especially those who are from rural and uneducated. Encouraging entrepreneurship and supporting small-scale entrepreneurs to increase their economic positions are some of the steps that can be followed.\n\nIt has been continuously mentioned that Sri Lankan migrant workers from middle and low-skilled labour levels are the most vulnerable to be victims of challenges which were mentioned previously. Hence, it is highly recommended to increase skilled labour migration and conduct further pre-departure training.\n\nAs same as addressing the country-level factors that lead Sri Lankans to migrate, it is equally important to focus on their protection once they leave Sri Lanka for the destination countries. There should be a proper legal mechanism easily accessible to any migrant victim. In addition to that, it is recommended to increase awareness among migrant workers on challenges and the coordination and collaboration with other entities to ensure the protection of the Sri Lankan migrant workers.", "source": {"uri": "moderndiplomacy.eu", "dataType": "news", "title": "Modern Diplomacy"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_migration", "type":

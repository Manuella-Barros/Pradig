Our MLB odds series has our Mariners-Guardians prediction, odds, and pick for Tuesday.\n\nThe Mariners make the trip to Cleveland to face the Guardians! Both teams are playing very well this season and both should be headed towards the postseason thanks in large part to great pitching from both teams. Our MLB odds series has our Mariners-Guardians prediction, odds, and pick for Tuesday.\n\nLast Start: Pitched seven innings and gave up zero runs on two hits with two walks and eight strikeouts in a Mariners win.\n\nLast Start: Pitched 5.1 innings and gave up two runs on four hits with two walks and four strikeouts in a Guardians win.\n\nThe Mariners have been playing well recently and have a 43-31 record. They have won seven of their last eight games and three straight heading into this series. The Mariners have struggled behind the plate this season, but their pitching staff is a top-10 unit in the MLB. Julio Rodriguez, Cal Raleigh, Mitch Haniger, Jorge Polanco, Ty France, and Mitch Garver are standouts on offense despite their struggles. Luis Castillo, Logan Gilbert, George Kirby, and Bryce Miller have all been at varying levels of good to great for the Mariners pitching-wise and have carried the team when needed.\n\nThe Mariners are starting Bryce Miller on the mound where he has a 5-5 record, a 3.48 ERA, and a 0.98 WHIP. Through 82.2 innings, he has allowed 34 runs on 57 hits with 24 walks and 80 strikeouts. In his 14 starts this season, the Mariners have an 8-6 record. Miller has been very good this season, and he faces a Cleveland offense that has talent but has only been average so far this season.\n\nThe Mariners have talent, but they have struggled across the board this season behind the plate. They are 28th in batting average at .223 after finishing last season at .242. Julio Rodriguez, Cal Raleigh, and Ty France lead the Mariners in most batting categories. Rodriguez leads in batting average at .268 and in total hits at 78. Raleigh then leads in home runs at 12 and in RBI at 43. Finally, Ty France leads in OBP at .329. This matchup against McKenzie will be difficult because he has been having a solid year on the mound and the Mariners have struggled on offense as a team.\n\nWhy The Guardians Will Cover The Spread/Win\n\nThe Guardians have been great this season with a 44-25 heading into this series. However, They have lost three out of their last four games and two straight leading into this game. Their bats have jumped into the top 10 of the league, while their pitching has been a top-10 staff. Steven Kwan, Jose Ramirez, Andres Gimenez, Tyler Freeman, and Josh Naylor have carried the Guardians on offense. Tanner Bibee, Triston McKenzie, and Ben Lively have held down the fort in the pitching staff despite Shane Bieber getting Tommy John Surgery. They have been one of the best teams in the MLB this season, and not just the AL.\n\nThe Guardians are starting Triston McKenzie on the mound and he has a 3-3 record, a 4.10 ERA, and a 1.41 WHIP. McKenzie has allowed 34 runs on 58 hits with 38 walks and 65 strikeouts through 68 innings. In his 13 starts so far, the Guardians are 10-3. McKenzie has been solid this season but needs to be more consistent for the Guardians. This is a favorable matchup for him with all of the struggles the Mariners have had on offense.\n\nThe Guardians are a talented team behind the plate but are average statistically. They are 16th in team batting average at .242 after finishing last season at .259. The offense is led by Jose Ramirez in almost every batting category. Ramirez leads the way in batting average at .269, in home runs at 18, in RBI at 62, in OBP at .330, and in hits at 71. This offense has shown flashes, but they get a difficult matchup against Bryce Miller with how well he has played this season and how he has been a key for the Mariners' success as a team.\n\nFinal Mariners-Guardians Prediction & Pick\n\nThis is going to be a pitching duel between Miller for the Mariners and McKenzie for the Guardians. However, the deciding factor is that the Guardians also have a better offense than the Mariners. That combination favors the Guardians, especially at home. Expect the Guardians to cover and win to get back on track at home in this matchup.\n\nClick here for more betting news and predictions", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news",

The Guardians, who have been one of the most surprising teams in 2024, hold a 5.0 game lead in the AL Central while the Mariners have a commanding 9.0 game lead on the AL West.\n\nIn this article, I'm going to dive into everything you need to know to bet on today's series opener.\n\nCal Raleigh: The Mariners' catcher may not have a great batting average at .202, but the guy knows how to hit dingers. He leads the team in both home runs (12) and RBIs (43), while ranking third in WAR (1.5). He may be the most underrated part of the Mariners success this season.\n\nCleveland Guardians\n\nJose Ramirez: The Guardians' third baseman leads the team in virtually every single stat including batting average (.269), home runs (18), RBIs (62), on base percentage (.330), and hits (71). You're going to want to pay attention when he steps into the batters box.\n\nMariners vs. Guardians Prediction and Pick\n\nI believe regression is coming for the Mariners this season. Their offensive numbers haven't been good enough to support their record. For example, they're just 25th in the Majors in OPS this season at .667. The Guardians have been batting at a far more sustainable rate, clocking in at .717 which ranks 12th.\n\nThe starting pitching matchup in this game is largely a wash, but Cleveland has a significant advantage when it comes to the bullpen.\n\nThe Guardians have the best bullpen in the Majors, especially of late, sporting a bullpen ERA of 1.94 over the last 30 days. The Mariners' bullpen sits 16th in that time frame at 4.06, so even if Cleveland gets down early, they'll never be out of it.\n\nOdds refresh periodically and are subject to change.\n\nIf you or someone you know has a gambling problem and wants help, call 1-800-GAMBLER.\n\nYou can check out all of Iain's bets here!\n\nThis article was originally published on www.si.com as Mariners vs. Guardians Prediction, Odds, Pick and Probable Pitchers for Tuesday, June 18.", "source": {"uri": "myrtlebeachonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MyrtleBeachOnline"}, "authors": [{"uri": "iain_macmillan@myrtlebeachonline.com", "name": "Iain MacMillan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Mariners", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Seattle Mariners"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Guardians", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Guardians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Batting average (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League_West", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American League West"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League_Central", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American League Central"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Catcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Third baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wins_Above_Replacement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wins Above Replacement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullpen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bullpen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos\u00e9_Ram\u00edrez_(infielder)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00edrez (infielder)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-base_plus_slugging", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "On-base plus slugging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Maritime", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Maritime", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Watercraft", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Watercraft", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Oceanography", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Oceanography", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Sports", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Subcultures/Spotters", "label": "dmoz/Society/Subcultures/Spotters", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://www.mcclatchy-wires.com/incoming/llcpyp/picture289361660/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/7334015d-4057-4598-a896-5d7c2a2b2f6d", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9660880", "eventUri": "eng-9660880", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-18", "textStart": 2031, "textEnd": 2038}], "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 210, "relevance": 1}

Keep reading for our Mariners vs. Guardians betting prediction.\n\nCan the Guardians win the game outright as money-line home favorites?\n\nProjected starting pitchers: Bryce Miller (SEA) vs. Triston McKenzie (CLE)\n\nThe Seattle Mariners are 43-31 straight up this year. Seattle is 7-3 straight up in their last 10 games. The Mariners are 35-39 ATS this season.\n\nThe Cleveland Guardians are 44-25 straight up this year. Cleveland is 5-5 straight up in their last 10 games. The Guardians are 40-29 ATS this season.\n\nMariners vs. Guardians Game Matchup and Betting Odds\n\nMariners vs. Guardians Public Betting Information\n\nOur MLB Public Betting Information page indicates that 80% of public bettors are currently backing the Guardians money line. Please note that these numbers are subject to change all the way up to game time, so be sure to check the link to ensure that you're receiving the most up-to-date public betting data.\n\nSeattle Mariners DFS Spin\n\nMariners left fielder Luke Raley was instrumental in his team's 5-0 win over the Rangers on Sunday afternoon. In that contest, the left-handed hitter went 1 for 3 with a double, an RBI, a run scored, and a walk. Raley has a .751 OPS against right-handed pitching this season, but just a .624 OPS against southpaws in 2024. He may be a worthwhile option in DFS against Guardians starter Triston McKenzie, who has allowed a .715 OPS to left-handed batters this season.\n\nCleveland Guardians DFS Spin\n\nGuardians shortstop Brayan Rocchio hit well during his team's 7-6 loss to the Blue Jays on Sunday. In that contest, the Caracas, Venezuela native went 1 for 3 with a homer, 2 RBIs, and 2 runs scored. Over the past 15 days, Brayan Rocchio is slashing ..286/.355/.571 with 2 doubles, 2 homers, 4 RBIs, 6 runs scored, and 2 walks. If you're looking for a cheaper option in DFS at shortstop on Tuesday, Brayan Rocchio should be worth a look in the majority of formats.\n\nMariners vs. Guardians MLB Betting Trends\n\nSeattle is 41-29 straight up when playing an opponent on equal rest this season.\n\nSeattle is currently playing like one of the best teams in baseball. The Mariners are 7-1 straight up in their last 8 games with the only loss during that stretch coming in extra innings. The key over that span has been run prevention. In that 8-game period, Seattle held every team to 5 runs or less, and their opponents scored 4 runs or fewer in 6 of those 8 contests. It helps that the Mariners will have Bryce Miller on the bump for this one as well.\n\nBryce Miller is 5-5 this season with an ERA of 3.48 and a WHIP of 0.98. His strikeout-to-walk ratio is 3.3 and his K/9 is 8.7. Miller has tossed 8 quality starts this season, and has gone at least 6 innings and allowed 2 or fewer earned runs in 3 of his past 4 starts. I think Seattle keeps the momentum going with an outright win on the road in Cleveland on Tuesday night.", "source": {"uri": "thespread.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TheSpread.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alex_becker@thespread.com", "name": "Alex Becker", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Guardians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Guardians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Mariners", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Seattle Mariners"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triston_McKenzie", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Triston McKenzie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-base_plus_slugging", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "On-base plus slugging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryce_Miller_(racing_driver)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bryce Miller (racing driver)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starting_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Starting pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Run (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Raley", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Luke Raley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Left fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Rangers_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Texas Rangers (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortstop", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shortstop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_start", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quality start"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extra_innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Extra innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walks_plus_hits_per_inning_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Walks plus hits per inning pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout-to-walk_ratio", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout-to-walk ratio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Earned run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Double (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Blue_Jays", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Toronto Blue Jays"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_on_balls", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Base on balls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caracas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Caracas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Caracas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Venezuela"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Maritime", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Maritime", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Watercraft", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Watercraft", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Oceanography", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Oceanography", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.thespread.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Luke-Raley-Mariners.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9660880", "eventUri": "eng-9660880", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 206, "relevance": 1}

That does really galvanize a group.\n\n\"But these guys like to work; they like to prepare; they like to do the things that are going to give them the opportunity to perform on the biggest stage, and right now they're doing it. And we need to be grateful and enjoy it. It's a grind every day, but I'm gonna enjoy this. We're playing really good baseball. It's fun to watch these guys, and looking forward to coming to work every day.\"\n\nUnder MLB's new playoff format adopted in 2022, the two division winners in each league with the best record are rewarded with a first-round bye.\n\nThe third division winner, meanwhile, plays host to the No. 3 wild-card team in a best-of-three series.\n\nGiven where they are in the American League landscape, the Mariners should make it a goal to earn one of those two first-round byes into the divisional round, and to do that, they will have to leapfrog the Guardians (44-25).\n\nSure, the season is not even halfway complete; a lot can (and will) happen over the next 3 1/2 months.\n\nBut as things stand here in mid-June, the Mariners would host a wild-card series against the Minnesota Twins. The Guardians and AL East-leading Yankees would have first-round byes.\n\nThe Guardians are one of baseball's biggest surprises of the season so far, on pace to win 103 games under first-year manager Stephen Vogt, who served as the Mariners' bullpen coach in 2023 and was expected to be named the Mariners' bench coach before Cleveland hired him.\n\nThe Guardians took two of three from the Mariners in the first meeting in early April in Seattle. That means the Mariners need to win two of three this week to even the season series in what is their final regular-season meeting.\n\n(Note: The first tiebreaker in playoffs seeding is head-to-head record. The second tiebreaker is intradivision record; the Mariners are 17-5 so far against the AL West; the Guardians are 11-6 against the AL Central.)\n\nIn the latest projections from FanGraphs, the Mariners have the AL's third-best odds (86.3%) to make the playoffs -- behind the Yankees (99.8%) and Orioles (98.5%) -- and the third-best odds (28.9%) to clinch a first-round bye.\n\nThe Guardians, leading the AL Central by five games, have an 81.6% chance to make the playoffs and the second-best odds (34.9%) to clinch a bye.\n\nThe Guardians, 21-8 at Progressive Field, own the AL's best winning percentage (.724) at home.\n\nAfter going 19-9 in May, the Guardians are 6-6 in June. They have lost three of four coming into Tuesday's series opener.\n\nPitching, pitching, pitching\n\nBryan Woo is set to return to the mound for the Mariners against the Guardians on Wednesday, a week after an injury scare caused the 24-year-old right-hander to miss a start.\n\nAn MRI on Woo's right forearm came back clean, and he's been working to find a steady routine to keep his arm feeling fresh between starts.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Mariners will send out Bryce Miller to start the series opener; Luis Castillo will close out the series Thursday afternoon.\n\nThe Guardians are scheduled to start right-hander Triston McKenzie, right-hander Tanner Bibee and lefty Logan Allen, in order, against the Mariners.\n\nThe Mariners, of course, have one of the best pitching staffs in baseball -- and the Guardians are right there, too.\n\nSeattle's 3.42 staff earned-run average ranks No. 5 in MLB; Cleveland sits at No. 6 with a 3.48 ERA.\n\nThe Guardians might have MLB's most dominant bullpen, which leads MLB in strikeout rate (27.8%) and batting average against (.188). Closer Emmanuel Clase has been virtually untouchable this season, having allowed just three earned runs in 33.1 innings (0.81 ERA) with a 35-to-3 strikeout-to-walk ratio.\n\nOffensive opposites\n\nThe Mariners' lineup continues to lead the majors in strikeout rate, at 27.6% (while also ranking in the top 10 in walk rate, at 8.9%).\n\nThe Guardians, meanwhile, have one of the lowest strikeout rates, at 19.5%, with a team batting average of .242 that ranks just above league average.\n\nCleveland's switch-hitting third baseman, Jose Ramirez, is having another strong season, with 18 homers and 62 RBI, tied for second-most in MLB.\n\nAnd Oregon State product Steven Kwan has been one of the league's hottest hitters, with a .398 average and a 1.002 OPS. Through his first 196 plate appearances, he has more walks (17) than strikeouts (14).\n\nOne name to watch this week is Cleveland's rookie first baseman/designated hitter, Kyle Manzardo, a second-round draft pick out of Washington State in 2021. Manzardo was WSU's first All-American first-team selection since pitcher Aaron Sele in 1990, and the first position player to earn All-American first-team honors since John Olerud in 1988.\n\nCalled up last month, Manzardo is hitting .207 with 10 doubles and a .571 OPS in his first 87 big-league plate appearances.", "source": {"uri": "seattletimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Seattle

(AP Photo/Sue Ogrocki)\n\nCLEVELAND -- J.P. Crawford hit a two-run homer, Luke Raley and Dylan Moore added solo shots and the Seattle Mariners stayed baseball's hottest team with an 8-5 win over the AL Central-leading Cleveland Guardians on Tuesday night.\n\nWith their fourth straight win and eighth in nine games, the Mariners improved to an MLB-best 17-5 since May 26.\n\nSeattle began a nine-game trip on top of the AL West by nine games -- the largest lead in any division. It's the club's biggest advantage since the end of the 2001 season, when the Mariners won 116 games.\n\nCrawford homered in the third inning off Triston McKenzie (3-4) and added an RBI double in the fourth.\n\nRaley, who grew up in nearby Medina, Ohio, connected in the fifth to put the Mariners ahead 6-1. The homer came only minutes after Raley made a diving catch on the track down the left-field line. He was ejected after striking out in the ninth.\n\nBryce Miller (6-5) held the Guardians to three runs and six hits in 5 2/3 innings. It was the second straight solid outing for the right-hander, who pitched seven scoreless innings last week in a no-decision against the White Sox.\n\nCleveland's Steven Kwan reached base for the 23rd straight game and extended his hitting streak to 12 in a row with a single in the eighth.\n\nDown 7-1, the Guardians didn't go quietly. They scored two in the sixth, one in the seventh and another in the eighth -- helped by Seattle's Trent Thornton hitting two consecutive batters -- before Andr\u00e9s Mu\u00f1oz worked out of a jam.\n\nMu\u00f1oz finished up for his 13th save.\n\nMcKenzie worked around leadoff walks in the first two innings, but another in the third came back to bite him as the Mariners took a 4-1 lead.\n\nAfter No. 9 hitter Moore walked, Crawford connected for a two-run homer that barely cleared the wall and Guardians rookie center fielder Daniel Schneemann's glove.\n\nCal Raleigh's RBI double made it 3-0, and after McKenzie issued his fourth walk, Guardians manager Stephen Vogt pulled the right-hander. who lasted just 2 1/3 innings -- his shortest outing this season.\n\nTEE TIME\n\nWith both teams off Monday, Vogt and Seattle manager Scott Servais went golfing.\n\nThey were together last season as Vogt served as Seattle's bullpen coach. Servais said it didn't take long for him to recognize Vogt was ready to manage and he's not surprised by Cleveland's strong first half under their rookie skipper.\n\n\"They're a good team,\" he said. \"They have a lot of speed. They've hit a few more homers this year. They've got great pitching. They play good defense, They have all the ingredients it takes.\"\n\nTRAINER'S ROOM\n\nGuardians: RHP Gavin Williams (elbow) will make his next rehab start at Double-A Akron on Friday. Williams threw 52 pitched in his previous outing for Triple-A Columbus. There's still no clear timetable for his season debut after getting hurt in training camp. ... RHP Shane Bieber (Tommy John surgery) is around for the homestand after getting a routine post-operation checkup.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nGuardians RHP Tanner Bibee (4-2, 3.94 ERA) starts Wednesday against Mariners RHP Bryan Woo (3-0, 1.07), who missed his last start with arm discomfort. Woo underwent an MRI that came back clean. Servais said the Mariners will keep a close eye on Woo.", "source": {"uri": "vindy.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Vindicator"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Guardians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Guardians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Mariners", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Seattle Mariners"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooks_Raley", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Brooks Raley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triston_McKenzie", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Triston McKenzie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Rojas", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Josh Rojas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andr\u00e9s_Mu\u00f1oz", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Andr\u00e9s Mu\u00f1oz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Raley", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Luke Raley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dylan_Moore", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dylan Moore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._P._Crawford", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

In that game, the California native went 2 for 4 with a double, a homer, an RBI, 3 runs scored, and a stolen base. Moore is hitting .210 with 7 homers, 23 RBIs, 12 stolen bases, and a .731 OPS this season. He is hitting much better on the road (.919 OPS) than at home (.459 OPS) this year, so he's worth a look in DFS as Seattle plays in Cleveland on Wednesday night.\n\nCleveland Guardians DFS Spin\n\nGuardians right fielder Will Brennan had a team-high 3 hits in his team's 8-5 loss to the Mariners on Tuesday. The left-handed batter from Colorado Springs went 3 for 5 with an RBI and a run scored while hitting out of the #6 spot in the lineup. Brennan is hitting .249 with 6 homers, 22 RBIs, 3 steals, and an OPS of .692 this year. He's been tearing it up over the past week. In the past 7 games, Will Brennan is slashing .364/.417/.545. He'll have the platoon edge over Mariners starter Bryan Woo on Tuesday, making Brennan worthy of consideration in most DFS formats.\n\nSeattle is 15-13 straight up as an underdog this season.\n\nThe Mariners are 38-27 straight up when playing on no rest this season.\n\nThe Mariners are 32-22 straight up in American League games this season.\n\nMariners vs. Guardians Betting Prediction\n\nSeattle continues to roll. The Mariners are 8-2 straight up in their last 10 games. They've won 4 straight contests and are currently 10 games up in the American League West division. The numbers back up the case for Seattle in this contest. The Mariners are 42-29 straight up when playing an opponent on equal rest and 27-26 straight up in non-division games this season.\n\nSeattle starting pitcher Bryan Woo is off to a great start this year as he's 3-0 with a 1.07 ERA and a 0.53 WHIP. He's thrown 4 straight quality starts dating back to May 21st, and I like him to make it 5 in a row here.

Mandatory Credit: Steven Bisig-USA TODAY Sports / Steven Bisig-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe Cleveland Guardians continue to be one of the top teams in baseball. They own a 44-25 record and are up 5.0 games in the American League Central. However, this early contender is in store for a big test as they prepare to take on the Seattle Mariners this week.\n\nCleveland last played the Mariners during the first week of April which was the second series of the season. The Guardians' offense was off to a red-hot start which helped them take two of three games against their West Coast opponent.\n\nThe Guardians' bats have cooled off a bit since then. The team is hitting .246/.326/.411 with an OPS of .737 over their last 30 days. Those stats put them at about league average and are by no means bad. However, average isn't going to cut it against Seattle's elite pitching staff.\n\nThe Mariners have a team starter ERA of 3.30 this season which is the second-best in the American League and their 1.01 WHIP is the best in baseball. This is a staff that rarely gives up hits or walks batters.\n\nThe Guardians are going to have to work for each one of their base runners and be patient in the box.\n\nOne weakness the Mariners starters do have is their tendency to give up the long ball. Their rotation has given up 54 home runs this season which is in the bottom 10 in the league. (For reference, Cleveland's starters have given up 57 home runs this year.) The Guardians, who have found a boost in power production this year, need to take advantage of this when they can.\n\nSeattle's projected starters against the Guardians over the next three games are Bryce Miller (3.48), Bryan Woo (1.07), and Luis Castillo (3.32).\n\nCleveland did see Castillo in their first matchup of the season and the Guardians tagged him for a season-high 10 hits and four earned runs. However, this doesn't mean the Guardians can get comfortable in the box. Castillo is one of baseball's best pitchers and he'll likely have a little extra motivation looking back at how his last matchup with Cleveland went.\n\nWhile going up against Seattle's pitching staff will be a difficult challenge for the Guardians, it's also a tremendous opportunity to show the rest of the league once again that this Cleveland offense is a legit contender.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Guardians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Guardians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Mariners", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Seattle Mariners"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Kwan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Steven Kwan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-Mobile_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "T-Mobile Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Left fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League_Central", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American League Central"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Coast_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "West Coast of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Baseball bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walks_plus_hits_per_inning_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Walks plus hits per inning pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-base_plus_slugging", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "On-base plus slugging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_on_balls", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Base on balls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Castillo_(pitcher,_born_1992)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luis Castillo (pitcher, born 1992)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Earned run"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_5924,h_3332,x_0,y_391/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/cleveland_baseball_insider/01j0nrxzvyn3rj8vkkd3.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9660880", "eventUri": "eng-9660880", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 198, "relevance": 1}

Brennan today has two home runs and a double.\n\nDefensively, the Guardians have pulled off a few double plays in recent innings, an example of how Andres Gimenez's defensive value at second base almost cannot be understated.\n\nJosh Naylor injury: RBI double ends with possible knee issue\n\nJosh Naylor gave the Guardians a 5-3 lead with an RBI double to right field, but he might have paid for it.\n\nAs Naylor slid into second base, he grimaced in obvious pain while clutching his right knee. Guardians team trainers came out and appeared to be testing the knee.\n\nNaylor was down for a few moments and in pain, but he's remaining in the game.\n\nAndres Gimenez home run gives Guardians 4-3 lead over Mariners\n\nAfter Wednesday night's win, Guardians manager Stephen Vogt remarked how they wouldn't often win games with three home runs, because it just wasn't really their style. They have two today, and the fifth inning hasn't concluded.\n\nAfter the Mariners grabbed a 3-2 lead in the fourth, Andres Gimenez belted a two-run home run to right-center field that put the Guardians on top 4-3.\n\nWill Brennan is an interesting case for the Guardians.\n\nHe's a younger outfielder who has a baseline of experience, but one who still might have plenty to prove at the major league level. He has role in the lineup, but it's not necessarily on stable ground with a few outfield prospects on the way.\n\nBrennan drilled a solo home run to tie it 2-2. That brought his OPS to .700 this season. Again, he's done just enough to warrant an extended look, but he's still been searching for the kind of consistency to force the team's hand.\n\nKwan led off the first inning with a double over the head of right fielder Mitch Haniger. That brought his average to an even .400.\n\nAnd if he can continue to hover around that number this summer, it'll be one of the more exciting storylines to follow around the game of baseball.\n\nKwan later scored on a fielder's choice to make it 2-1.\n\nDylan Moore home run puts Mariners on top in first inning\n\nI mean, if there's a part of the ballpark called the Home Run Porch, players are probably going to hit home runs there.\n\nDylan Moore belted a towering two-run shot off Logan Allen to give the Mariners a 2-0 lead in the first inning.\n\nGuardians manager Stephen Vogt discusses the passing of the late, great Willie Mays\n\nThe game of baseball lost a legend Tuesday, as the San Francisco Giants confirmed that Hall-of-Fame outfielder Willie Mays, one of the sport's icons, passed away at the age of 93.\n\nGuardians manager Stephen Vogt's father idolized Mays. Vogt discussed Mays' meaning to their family and the impact he had on the sport.\n\nCan Steven Kwan put together a .400 season in 2024?\n\nSteven Kwan entered this series hitting .398. He's now chasing history as he tries to hit one of the game's biggest milestones.\n\nCleveland Guardians activate Jose Ramirez and option Kyle Manzardo to Triple-A Columbus\n\nAbout four and a half hours before the series was scheduled to begin, the Guardians announced they activated five-time All-Star third baseman Jose Ramirez from the paternity list and optioned rookie designated hitter and first baseman Kyle Manzardo to Triple-A Columbus.\n\nRamirez spent three days on the paternity list.\n\nManzardo had been with the Guardians since being called up from Columbus and making his MLB debut on May 6. In 82 at-bats with the Guardians, Manzardo hit .207 with seven RBIs, 10 doubles, three walks, 23 strikeouts and a .571 OPS.\n\nMike Hargrove, wife share Cleveland baseball memories in Akron\n\nFormer Cleveland manager Mike Hargrove shared some baseball tales with the Akron Beacon Journal.\n\nDoes David Fry have a 2024 MLB All-Star Game case with the Guardians?\n\nDavid Fry has been among the game's best hitters by some metrics, but does he have a case to be named to the 2024 AL All-Star team?\n\nDaniel Schneemann debut is a baseball classic tale\n\nDaniel Schneemann made his major league debut and jumped on the first pitch he saw in the major leagues for a two-run double. It completed a long, grinding road to the majors for a former 33rd-round draft pick.\n\nSteven Kwan All-Star case continues despite absence due to injury\n\nSteven Kwan recently returned from the injured list and played so well that his teammates began joking that he isn't even human.\n\nBrowns cornerback Denzel Ward throws a wild ceremonial first pitch at Guardians game\n\nBrowns cornerback Denzel Ward tossed the ceremonial first pitch at a recent game at Progressive Field and, well, it was eventful.\n\nThe Guardians begin a six-game homestand Tuesday night against the Seattle Mariners. After the three-game series against the Mariners, the Guardians welcome the Toronto Blue Jays to Progressive Field. Cleveland will then travel to Baltimore and Kansas City on an upcoming road trip.\n\nHow can I watch, listen or stream the Cleveland Guardians game tonight?\n\nThe game will be broadcast locally on Bally Sports.

Seattle got out to a big lead early on and ended up winning, 8-5.\n\nHere are three observations and takeaways from Cleveland's loss.\n\nTriston McKenzie only lasted 2.1 innings, gave up four runs on three hits, walked four batters, and didn't strike a single batter. This was disappointing considering he had just come off a solid start against the Cincinnati Reds. The issue in this start was clear; McKenzie was struggling to throw strikes and the pitches that were over the plate were crushed.\n\nMcKenzie primarily threw his four-seam fastball and his velocity was notably up as it topped out at 94.3 mph and his average sat at 92.2. The problem was he had no control over where the pitch was headed.\n\nThe Guardians just entered a stretch of 26 games in 27 days. Using six pitchers out of the bullpen certainly isn't a way to start that grueling schedule.\n\nHitting with runners in scoring position was one of Cleveland's biggest strengths early in the season. Now, it's costing them games and their loss against the Mariners is a perfect example of this.\n\nThe Guardians loaded up the bases in the bottom of the second inning and had a great opportunity to get to Mariners starter Bryce Miller. The only run Cleveland scored from this opportunity was on a Daniel Schneemann ground-out, fielder's choice.\n\nAs a team, Cleveland was 3-for-16 with RISP. This is something the Guardians have to get back to doing well to get back on track.\n\nFor what it's worth, the Guardians still hit the ball with some force against the Mariners. Cleveland finished with eight hard-hit balls and only struck out five times as a team. Andres Gimenez, Will Brennan, Schneemann, and Jose Ramirez each had hits with an exit velocity above 100 mph.\n\nThey were making plenty of contact but it just didn't result in the big hit.\n\nPerhaps this is a silverling lining in the loss and hope that the Guardians can get some of these hard hits to fall on and get a victory on Wednesday.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Guardians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Guardians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triston_McKenzie", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Triston McKenzie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Mariners", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Seattle Mariners"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julio_Rodr\u00edguez_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Julio Rodr\u00edguez (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Progressive Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Third baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Outfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Today", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "USA Today"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos\u00e9_Ram\u00edrez_(infielder)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00edrez (infielder)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pitch (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four-seam_fastball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Four-seam fastball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scoring_position", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scoring position"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati_Reds", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati Reds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullpen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bullpen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Batting (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fielder's_choice", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fielder's choice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Maritime", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Maritime", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Watercraft", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Watercraft", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Oceanography", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Oceanography", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Subcultures/Spotters", "label": "dmoz/Society/Subcultures/Spotters", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_3000,h_1687,x_0,y_305/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/cleveland_baseball_insider/01j0q6gyxv828sgsdxjs.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9660880", "eventUri": "eng-9660880", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2018-06-", "textStart": 196, "textEnd": 203}], "sentiment": -0.08235294117647063, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

He leads the team in both home runs (12) and RBIs (43), while ranking third in WAR (1.5). He may be the most underrated part of the Mariners success this season.\n\nJose Ramirez: The Guardians' third baseman leads the team in virtually every single stat including batting average (.269), home runs (18), RBIs (62), on base percentage (.330), and hits (71). You're going to want to pay attention when he steps into the batters box.\n\nI believe regression is coming for the Mariners this season. Their offensive numbers haven't been good enough to support their record. For example, they're just 25th in the Majors in OPS this season at .667. The Guardians have been batting at a far more sustainable rate, clocking in at .717 which ranks 12th.\n\nThe starting pitching matchup in this game is largely a wash, but Cleveland has a significant advantage when it comes to the bullpen.\n\nThe Guardians have the best bullpen in the Majors, especially of late, sporting a bullpen ERA of 1.94 over the last 30 days. The Mariners' bullpen sits 16th in that time frame at 4.06, so even if Cleveland gets down early, they'll never be out of it.\n\nOdds refresh periodically and are subject to change.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Mariners", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Seattle Mariners"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Batting average (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Guardians", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Guardians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League_West", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American League West"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League_Central", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American League Central"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Catcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Third baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wins_Above_Replacement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wins Above Replacement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos\u00e9_Ram\u00edrez_(infielder)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00edrez (infielder)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-base_plus_slugging", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "On-base plus slugging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullpen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bullpen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Maritime", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Maritime", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Watercraft", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Watercraft", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Oceanography", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Oceanography", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Resources", "label": "dmoz/Games/Resources", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_3774,h_2122,x_0,y_16/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/si/01j0nx99xnbnbcmkad2h.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9660880", "eventUri": "eng-9660880", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

Crawford hit a two-run homer, Luke Raley and Dylan Moore added solo shots and the Seattle Mariners stayed baseball's hottest team with an 8-5 win over the AL Central-leading Cleveland Guardians on Tuesday night.\n\nWith their fourth straight win and eighth in nine games, the Mariners improved to an MLB-best 17-5 since May 26.\n\nSeattle began a nine-game trip on top of the AL West by nine games - the largest lead in any division. It's the club's biggest advantage since the end of the 2001 season, when the Mariners won 116 games.\n\nCrawford homered in the third inning off Triston McKenzie (3-4) and added an RBI double in the fourth.\n\nRaley, who grew up in nearby Medina, Ohio, connected in the fifth to put the Mariners ahead 6-1. The homer came only minutes after Raley made a diving catch on the track down the left-field line. He was ejected after striking out in the ninth.\n\nBryce Miller (6-5) held the Guardians to three runs and six hits in 5 2/3 innings. It was the second straight solid outing for the right-hander, who pitched seven scoreless innings last week in a no-decision against the White Sox.\n\nSeattle Mariners' J.P.

They scored two in the sixth, one in the seventh and another in the eighth - helped by Seattle's Trent Thornton hitting two consecutive batters - before Andr\u00e9s Mu\u00f1oz worked out of a jam.\n\nMu\u00f1oz finished up for his 13th save.\n\nMcKenzie worked around leadoff walks in the first two innings, but another in the third came back to bite him as the Mariners took a 4-1 lead.\n\nAfter No. 9 hitter Moore walked, Crawford connected for a two-run homer that barely cleared the wall and Guardians rookie center fielder Daniel Schneemann's glove.\n\nCal Raleigh's RBI double made it 3-0, and after McKenzie issued his fourth walk, Guardians manager Stephen Vogt pulled the right-hander. who lasted just 2 1/3 innings - his shortest outing this season.\n\nTEE TIME\n\nWith both teams off Monday, Vogt and Seattle manager Scott Servais went golfing.\n\nThe winner?\n\n\"Ask him,\" Servais cracked.\n\nThey were together last season as Vogt served as Seattle's bullpen coach. Servais said it didn't take long for him to recognize Vogt was ready to manage and he's not surprised by Cleveland's strong first half under their rookie skipper.\n\n\"They\u00b4re a good team,\" he said. \"They have a lot of speed. They\u00b4ve hit a few more homers this year. They\u00b4ve got great pitching. They play good defense, They have all the ingredients it takes.\"\n\nGuardians: RHP Gavin Williams (elbow) will make his next rehab start at Double-A Akron on Friday. Williams threw 52 pitched in his previous outing for Triple-A Columbus. There's still no clear timetable for his season debut after getting hurt in training camp. ... RHP Shane Bieber (Tommy John surgery) is around for the homestand after getting a routine post-operation checkup.\n\nGuardians RHP Tanner Bibee (4-2, 3.94 ERA) starts Wednesday against Mariners RHP Bryan Woo (3-0, 1.07), who missed his last start with arm discomfort. Woo underwent an MRI that came back clean. Servais said the Mariners will keep a close eye on Woo.\n\nAP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb\n\nSeattle Mariners' Dylan Moore gestures at second base after hitting a double against the Cleveland Guardians during the fourth inning of a baseball game Tuesday, June 18, 2024, in Cleveland.

The Twins have won six in a row heading into Wednesday's slate, and have taken advantage of the Guardians and Kansas City Royals cooling down a bit.\n\nBefore the game, the Guardians placed Nick Sandlin on the injured list with lower back inflammation and recalled right-handed pitcher Darren McCaughan from Triple-A Columbus.\n\nCheck back here throughout Wednesday's game for live score updates, highlights and analysis.\n\nGuardians beat the Mariners 8-0\n\nThe Guardians snapped their recent skid with an 8-0 win over the Mariners, fueled by Tanner Bibee's 12-stirkeout day and Josh Naylor's multi-homer game.\n\nThe added importance of Bibee's start is that the bullpen wasn't needed much after yesterday's short outing from Triston McKenzie.\n\nJosh Naylor has multi-homer night; Guardians lead Mariners 8-0\n\nJosh Naylor is having himself a night.\n\nNaylor just belted a solo home run to right-center field, his second of the night. It's his fourth career multi-homer night and the second this season. He now has a four-RBI night.\n\nNaylor rounding back into form would be a key to the Guardians further unlocking their lineup.\n\nTanner Bibee sets career high with 12 strikeouts against Mariners\n\nTanner Bibee has put together one of the best outings of his career tonight.\n\nBibee struck out a career-high 12 batters -- eclipsing his previous best which was set a week ago with 11 -- and allowed just three hits and a walk in six shutout innings. He also generated 20 swing-and-misses.\n\nThe Guardians are cruising up 7-0 in the seventh inning.\n\nJosh Naylor home run extends Guardians lead over Mariners\n\nThe Guardians have put together a three-run, two-out rally.\n\nAfter Gimenez scored from single on an infield single, Josh Naylor crushed a no-doubt, two-run home run to right field to extend Cleveland's lead to 6-0.\n\nNaylor hasn't been quite as hot as he was earlier this season, but he's had a great night tonight with a home run and three RBIs.\n\nAndres Gimenez scores from second on an infield single; Guardians lead Mariners 4-0\n\nAndres Gimenez just put on a bit of a masterclass of baserunning.\n\nWith two outs, he drew a walk and then stole second base. Jose Ramirez then grounded a ball to second baseman Ryan Bliss, who just entered the game due to J.P. Crawford's ejection. Bliss' throw wasn't great, and Ramirez won the race to first base. But by the time Mariners first baseman Ty France had collected himself, Gimenez had already rounded third and was heading home, and he beat the throw to the plate to give the Guardians a 4-0 lead.\n\nTanner Bibee ties career high with 11 strikeouts; J.P. Crawford ejected as Guardians lead 3-0\n\nTanner Bibee struck out J.P. Crawford looking to end the fifth inning, and Crawford was almost immediately thrown out.\n\nAfter the call, Crawford got right in the face of home plate umpire Doug Eddings and began pointing, leading to a quick hook. Crawford had to be physically held back and led to the dugout. Mariners manager Scott Servais was also ejected a few moments later.\n\nBibee has allowed only three hits thus far. Pitch tracking data seems to suggest that the third strike call was in the zone. The second called strike was borderline, but appears to have clipped the top of the zone.\n\nTanner Bibee has double-digit strikeout game against Mariners\n\nTanner Bibee had never reached double-digit strikeouts in a game until a week ago. Now he's done it in back-to-back starts.\n\nBibee isn't yet through the fifth inning, but he now has 10 strikeouts. Last week against the Reds, he struck out a career-high 11 batters.\n\nSteven Kwan hits two-run home run off the foul pole; Guardians lead Mariners 3-0\n\nSteven Kwan is chasing a .400 average. Adding a little power into the equation as he does it is something the Guardians will certainly welcome.\n\nAfter drawing a walk in his first-bat, Kwan in the second inning launched a two-run home run that hit off the right field foul pole. It extended his current hit streak to 13-games, and the Guardians now have a 3-0 lead.\n\nKwan, meanwhile, is hitting .396.\n\nJosh Naylor drives in Steven Kwan to give the Guardians a 1-0 lead\n\nSteven Kwan drew a walk to open the game for the Guardians and, a few batters later, was driven in via a single to right field by Josh Naylor.\n\nKwan's walk extended his on-base streak to 24 games, and Naylor's single gave him 51 RBIs this season.\n\nWill Brennan had a chance to do some additional damage with runners on the corners and two outs, but Mariners starter Bryan Woo induced a flyout to left-center field.\n\nBelow is some pregame information.\n\nGuardians manager Stephen Vogt discusses the passing of the late, great Willie Mays\n\nThe game of baseball lost a legend Tuesday, as the San Francisco Giants confirmed that Hall-of-Fame outfielder Willie Mays, one of the sport's icons, passed away at the age of 93.\n\nGuardians manager Stephen Vogt's father idolized Mays. Vogt discussed Mays' meaning to their family and the impact he had on the sport.\n\nCan Steven Kwan put together a .400 season in 2024?\n\nSteven Kwan entered this series hitting .398. He's now chasing history as he tries to hit one of the game's biggest milestones.\n\nCleveland Guardians activate Jose Ramirez and option Kyle Manzardo to Triple-A Columbus\n\nAbout four and a half hours before the series was scheduled to begin, the Guardians announced they activated five-time All-Star third baseman Jose Ramirez from the paternity list and optioned rookie designated hitter and first baseman Kyle Manzardo to Triple-A Columbus.\n\nRamirez spent three days on the paternity list.\n\nManzardo had been with the Guardians since being called up from Columbus and making his MLB debut on May 6. In 82 at-bats with the Guardians, Manzardo hit .207 with seven RBIs, 10 doubles, three walks, 23 strikeouts and a .571 OPS.\n\nMike Hargrove, wife share Cleveland baseball memories in Akron\n\nFormer Cleveland manager Mike Hargrove shared some baseball tales with the Akron Beacon Journal.\n\nDoes David Fry have a 2024 MLB All-Star Game case with the Guardians?\n\nDavid Fry has been among the game's best hitters by some metrics, but does he have a case to be named to the 2024 AL All-Star team?\n\nDaniel Schneemann debut is a baseball classic tale\n\nDaniel Schneemann made his major league debut and jumped on the first pitch he saw in the major leagues for a two-run double. It completed a long, grinding road to the majors for a former 33rd-round draft pick.\n\nSteven Kwan All-Star case continues despite absence due to injury\n\nSteven Kwan recently returned from the injured list and played so well that his teammates began joking that he isn't even human.\n\nBrowns cornerback Denzel Ward throws a wild ceremonial first pitch at Guardians game\n\nBrowns cornerback Denzel Ward tossed the ceremonial first pitch at a recent game at Progressive Field and, well, it was eventful.\n\nThe Guardians begin a six-game homestand Tuesday night against the Seattle Mariners. After the three-game series against the Mariners, the Guardians welcome the Toronto Blue Jays to Progressive Field. Cleveland will then travel to Baltimore and Kansas City on an upcoming road trip.\n\nHow can I watch, listen or stream the Cleveland Guardians game tonight?\n\nThe game will be broadcast locally on Bally Sports. It'll be broadcast on the radio by WTAM (1100-AM) and WARF (1350-AM, Spanish broadcast).", "source": {"uri": "coshoctontribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Coshocton Tribune"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Kwan", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Steven Kwan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanner_Bibee", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tanner Bibee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Naylor", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Josh Naylor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Mariners", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Seattle Mariners"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Twins", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Twins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._P._Crawford", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "J.

Crawford, right, takes the throw, in the fifth inning of a baseball game Thursday, June 20, 2024, in Cleveland.\n\nCLEVELAND (AP) -- Andr\u00e9s Gim\u00e9nez hit a two-run homer and Will Brennan had a pair of solo shots, lifting the American League Central-leading Cleveland Guardians to a 6-3 victory over the Seattle Mariners on Thursday.\n\nGimenez's blast to right-center off Luis Castillo (6-8) provided the go-ahead run in the fifth inning, when Cleveland scored three times to take a 5-3 lead. Josh Naylor added an RBI double as the Guardians took two of three in the series.\n\nBrennan went deep against Castillo in the second and Trent Thornton in the eighth for his first multi-homer game. He has eight on the season.\n\nLogan Allen (8-3) pitched six innings, giving up three runs, in winning his second straight start. Emmanuel Clase earned his 22nd save for Cleveland, which has the second-best home record in the majors at 23-9.\n\nDylan Moore hit a two-run homer in the first and Ryan Bliss had an RBI double in the fourth for AL West leader Seattle. The Mariners lost for just the sixth time in 19 games since May 31.\n\nCastillo allowed a season-high tying five runs in five innings, falling to 1-5 in his career against Cleveland.\n\nGuardians left fielder Steven Kwan went 1 for 3, dropping his batting average to .396 and he extended his hitting streak to 14 games. He is batting an MLB-high .500 since May 31, but is 14 plate appearances shy of qualifying for the league leaders.\n\nTRAINER'S ROOM\n\nMariners: Right-hander Bryan Woo (right elbow soreness) reported no issues after pitching four innings and allowing three runs Wednesday against Cleveland. Woo had his previous start skipped because of discomfort in his surgically repaired elbow.\n\nGuardians: Right-hander Gavin Williams (right elbow inflammation) will make his next rehab start Friday for Double-A Akron. Williams, who has been on the injured list all season, had a 7.88 ERA in his first four rehab outings for Triple-A Columbus.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nMariners: Right-hander George Kirby (6-5, 3.54 ERA) takes the hill Friday as Seattle continues its nine-game trip in Miami. Kirby tossed six scoreless innings and gained the win in his lone career appearance against the Marlins on June 13, 2023.\n\nGuardians: Right-hander Carlos Carrasco (2-6, 5.80 ERA) works the opener of a three-game home series Friday against Toronto. The 14-year veteran is 0-5 with a 5.96 ERA in six starts since his most recent victory on May 5 against the Los Angeles Angels.\n\nAP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb", "source": {"uri": "eagletribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Eagle-Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@eagletribune.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "brian_dulik@eagletribune.com", "name": "Brian Dulik", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Castillo_(pitcher,_born_1992)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Luis Castillo (pitcher, born 1992)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Guardians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Guardians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Naylor", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Josh Naylor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Mariners", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Seattle Mariners"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Innings pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andr\u00e9s_Gim\u00e9nez", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Andr\u00e9s Gim\u00e9nez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._P._Crawford", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

Crawford were both ejected in the fifth by Doug Eddings, who had called Crawford out on strikes.\n\nBryan Woo (3-1) made his first start since June 6 at Oakland, giving up three runs in four innings. The right-hander underwent tests on his surgically-repaired elbow after missing his last scheduled outing, but they revealed no cause for concern.\n\nWoo entered with a 1.07 ERA - the lowest in Mariners history through six starts - and just three walks in 33 2/3 innings, but promptly walked leadoff hitter Kwan and allowed him to score.\n\nCleveland Guardians' Josh Naylor gestures as he runs to home plate on a home run during the fifth inning of the team's baseball game against the Seattle Mariners, Wednesday, June 19, 2024, in Cleveland.

He is hitting a major league-best .510 since May 31, but is 16 plate appearances shy of qualifying for the league leaders.\n\nScott Barlow, Hunter Gaddis and Emmanuel Clase worked the final three innings for Cleveland, wrapping up the three-hitter for the team's eighth shutout of the year.\n\nTRAINER\u00b4S ROOM\n\nMariners: 2B Jorge Polanco (right hamstring strain), who has been on the injured list since May 27, is continuing his rehab assignment at Triple-A Tacoma following two games with Single-A Everett.

Sandlin is 5-0 with a 3.49 ERA in 33 appearances, but allowed three runs without recording an out Sunday in Toronto.\n\nMariners RHP Luis Castillo (6-7, 3.32 ERA) takes on Guardians LHP Logan Allen (7-3, 5.30 ERA) in the three-game series finale. Castillo has worked at least five innings in all 15 of his starts this season, including an April 2 loss to Cleveland at T-Mobile Park.\n\nAP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb\n\nCleveland Guardians' Tanner Bibee watches a throw to a Seattle Mariners batter during the first inning of a baseball game Wednesday, June 19, 2024, in Cleveland.

It's very frustrating.\"\n\nAdded Servais: \"You could feel the (unhappiness) building in the dugout because those are balls. But you have to give Bibee credit.

He is batting an MLB-high .500 since May 31, but is 14 plate appearances shy of qualifying for the league leaders.\n\nTRAINER'S ROOM\n\nMariners: Right-hander Bryan Woo (right elbow soreness) reported no issues after pitching four innings and allowing three runs Wednesday against Cleveland. Woo had his previous start skipped because of discomfort in his surgically repaired elbow.\n\nGuardians: Right-hander Gavin Williams (right elbow inflammation) will make his next rehab start Friday for Double-A Akron.

Crawford was ejected from Wednesday's contest against the Guardians after arguing a questionable third strike call in the fifth inning.

Naylor took over this game offensively with a run-scoring single in the first, thunderous home run to break it open in the fifth, and then a solo-shot in the seventh for good measure. He'd been batting under .200 since the start of May after a strong April and knowing how streaky of a hitter Naylor can be, this might be the start of his next hot streak.\n\nMariners are 7-2 SU in their last 9 games when playing on the road against Cleveland\n\nGuardians are 12-5 SU in their last 17 games against an opponent in the American League\n\nMariners vs. Guardians MLB BETTING PREDICTION\n\nTake the over.

He gave a single to J.P. Crawford and a two-run homer to Dylan Moore through the first two batters of the game. Just like that, Seattle had a 2-0 lead.\n\nHowever, Allen was resilient, got a couple of well-timed double plays, and ended up pitching a solid 6.0 innings for the Guardians. His most efficient pitch in their starts was the changeup which Allen threw 21 times and got three swings and misses with.\n\nSteven Kwan was briefly hitting .400 after he smoked a double down the right-field line in the first inning. That ended up being his only hit of the game, be he still extended his on-base streak to 25 games.\n\nThere's not much more to say about how incredible Kwan has been. There are very few players, if any, who are as hot as Kwan is at the plate and he is more than deserving to be voted an All-Star this year.\n\nSeattle's starting pitching was always going to be a challenge in this series. The Mariners saved their best starter in Luis Castillo for the last game, but the Guardians also saved their best at-bats for this game too.\n\nCleveland jumped on Castillo for two hits and one run in the first inning which Stephen Vogt said was crucial to establishing a good mindset against the ace. The Guardians ended up getting eight hits and five earned runs of Castillo in the win.\n\nThis is a very similar stat line to their first matchup with Castillo earlier this season when he gave up six hits and four earned runs to the Guardians on March 28.\n\nIf anything, this should be a warning to all of the game's top pitchers that the Guardians' offense is capable of putting together high-scoring outings against big game's best arms.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Mariners", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Seattle Mariners"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logan_Allen_(baseball,_born_1997)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Logan Allen (baseball, born 1997)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Guardians", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Guardians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._P._Crawford", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

And Cleveland now has the tie-breaking advantage on the Mariners.\n\nThe Mariners looked prime to take the rubber match when Dylan Moore launched a no-doubter to deep left field -- just fair -- for a two-run home run off Cleveland left-hander Logan Allen in the top of the first.\n\nJ.P. Crawford had led off the game with an infield single, and the Mariners were quickly leading 2-0.\n\nMoore's blast measured at 108.1 mph off the bat and 418 feet in distance. He has eight home runs this season -- six of which have come on the road. He also homered here Tuesday in the Mariners' 8-5 win to open this nine-game road trip.\n\nThe Guardians got one run back in the bottom of the first on an unusual inning-ending double play.\n\nWith runners at the corners, rookie first baseman Tyler Locklear fielded a sharp ground ball, stepped on first base (for the second out) and then threw to Crawford, who eventually tagged Andres Gimenez for the final out -- but not before Steven Kwan scored from third base.

The 24-year-old is 3-0 this season through six starts with a pristine 1.07 ERA. If the Mariners want to win their first American League West title since 2001, they'll likely need Woo to help make that a reality.\n\nHowever, they have to do their best to keep him healthy. Woo already had Tommy John surgery while in college at Cal-Poly and then missed time in 2023 because of elbow inflammation. He started the year this year on the injured list with the same ailment and has now had to miss a start. Again, the MRI came back clean, which is the most important thing, but it's likely going to be a constant battle of trying to manage his innings, workload and stress.\n\nAs he takes on the Guardians on Wednesday, it's likely that he'll be on a pitch count, but we don't know what that is yet.\n\nThe Mariners and Guardians will play on Tuesday with the first pitch coming at 3:40 p.m. PT.

And Cleveland now has the tie-breaking advantage on the Mariners.\n\nThe Mariners looked prime to take the rubber match when Dylan Moore launched a no-doubter to deep left field -- just fair -- for a two-run home run off Cleveland left-hander Logan Allen in the top of the first.\n\nJ.P. Crawford had led off the game with an infield single, and the Mariners were quickly leading 2-0.\n\nMoore's blast measured at 108.1 mph off the bat and 418 feet in distance. He has eight home runs this season -- six of which have come on the road. He also homered here Tuesday in the Mariners' 8-5 win to open this nine-game road trip.\n\nThe Guardians got one run back in the bottom of the first on an unusual inning-ending double play.\n\nWith runners at the corners, rookie first baseman Tyler Locklear fielded a sharp groundball, stepped on first base (for the second out) and then threw to Crawford, who eventually tagged Andres Gimenez for the final out -- but not before Steven Kwan scored from third base. (Run counted.)\n\nWill Brennan hit a solo homer in the second inning of Castillo to tie the score at 2-2.\n\nMariners rookie Ryan Bliss hit a scorching two-out double off the wall in left field to drive in Ty France from second base, giving the M's a 3-2 lead in the fourth inning.\n\nFrance had been hit by a pitch (of course he was) and Victor Robles worked a walk to extend the inning for Bliss.\n\nThe lead didn't last.\n\nIn the fifth, the Guardians scored three runs off Castillo -- all with three outs.\n\nCastillo issued his first walk of the game to Steven Kwan -- who is flirting with a .400 batting average -- and then let a changeup over the heart of the plate to Gimenez, who sent it 413-feet out to right-center for a two-run homer. That gave the Guardians a 4-3 lead.\n\nJose Ramirez walked, stole second and then scored on Josh Naylor's double to right field to push the lead to 5-3.\n\nIn the seventh, Robles reached on a check-swing single and Bliss followed with a walk off Cleveland lefty Tim Herrin.\n\nCrawford followed with a flyout for the first out of the inning.\n\nStephen Vogt, Cleveland's first-year manager, then turned to rookie right-hander Cade Smith.\n\nMariners manager Scott Servais elected to stick with Moore -- who has been torrid on the road this season -- instead of turning to one of his left-handed-hitting options (Cal Raleigh, Luke Raley, Josh Rojas, Dominic Canzone).\n\nMoore got ahead 3-1 in the count before getting jammed on a 97-mph fastball and hitting into a 6-4-3 inning-ending double play.\n\nSmith retired Julio Rodriguez, the pinch-hitting Raleigh and France in the eighth.\n\nBrennan hit his second homer of the game, a solo shot off Trent Thornton, with two outs in the eighth to make it 6-3.\n\nEmmanuel Clase closed it out in the ninth for his 22nd save.", "source": {"uri": "seattletimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Seattle Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "adam_jude@seattletimes.com", "name": "Adam Jude", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Mariners", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Seattle Mariners"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Castillo_(pitcher,_born_1992)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Luis Castillo (pitcher, born 1992)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bye_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bye (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "American League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Guardians", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Guardians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_postseason", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball postseason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Progressive Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Yankees", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Yankees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Left fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "First baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullpen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bullpen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logan_Allen_(baseball,_born_1997)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Logan Allen (baseball, born 1997)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Kwan", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Steven Kwan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dylan_Moore", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dylan Moore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._P._Crawford", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J.

Crawford hit a two-run homer, Luke Raley and Dylan Moore added solo shots and the Seattle Mariners stayed baseball's hottest team with an 8-5 win over the AL Central-leading Cleveland Guardians on Tuesday night.\n\nWith their fourth straight win and eighth in nine games, the Mariners improved to an MLB-best 17-5 since May 26.\n\nSeattle increased its lead in the AL West to 10 games -- the largest in any division. It's the club's biggest advantage since the end of the 2001 season, when the Mariners won 116 games.\n\n\"We're feeling good,\" said starter Bryce Miller (6-5). \"This is how we expected to start the year and we're starting to put it together. It's a really good baseball team. We're going to throw it and whenever we swing it like that, it's going to be tough to beat us.\"\n\nCrawford homered in the third inning off Triston McKenzie (3-4) and added an RBI double in the fourth.\n\nRaley, who grew up in nearby Medina, Ohio, connected in the fifth to put the Mariners ahead 6-1. The homer came only minutes after Raley made a diving catch on the track down the left-field line.\n\nIt was an interesting night for Raley, who was ejected after striking out in the ninth.\n\nThe 29-year-old had dozens of family members in attendance, including his uncle, Scott Profitt, who actually got his hands on Raley's homer but dropped it.\n\n\"He'll be hearing about that,\" said Raley, who was able to get his uncle another souvenir. \"He had a good time. He was laughing about it and being a good sport.\"\n\nMariners manager Scott Servais revealed Raley's father got thrown out of Progressive Field the last time Seattle was in Cleveland.\n\nRaley didn't want to get into any specifics about that incident.\n\n\"There's something about this park,\" he said with a smile. \"It doesn't like the Raley family.\"\n\nCleveland's Steven Kwan reached base for the 23rd straight game and extended his hitting streak to 12 in a row with a single in the eighth. Kwan is batting .392, but a few plate appearances short of being eligible to lead the majors.\n\nDown 7-1, the Guardians didn't go quietly. They scored two in the sixth, one in the seventh and another in the eighth -- helped by Seattle's Trent Thornton hitting two consecutive batters -- before Andr\u00e9s Mu\u00f1oz worked out of a jam.\n\nMu\u00f1oz finished up for his 13th save.\n\nThe Guardians have lost three straight for just the second time in 2024.\n\n\"We just didn't get the big hit tonight,\" manager Stephen Vogt said. \"We were close to outhitting them or just about even, but there's were for extra bases. Ours weren't. There's the difference in the game. They cashed in their opportunities and we didn't.\"\n\nMcKenzie worked around leadoff walks in the first two innings, but another in the third came back to bite him as the Mariners scored four runs.\n\nAfter No. 9 hitter Moore walked, Crawford connected for a two-run homer that barely cleared the wall and Guardians rookie center fielder Daniel Schneemann's glove.\n\nCal Raleigh's RBI double made it 3-0, and after McKenzie issued his fourth walk, Vogt pulled the right-hander, who lasted just 2 1/3 innings -- his shortest outing this season.\n\n\"After losing the last two games, I wanted to put my best foot forward,\" McKenzie said. \"I didn't give the guys my best effort, in my opinion.\"\n\nWith both teams off Monday, Vogt and Seattle manager Scott Servais went golfing.\n\nThey were together last season as Vogt served as Seattle's bullpen coach. Servais said it didn't take long for him to recognize Vogt was ready to manage and he's not surprised by Cleveland's strong first half under their rookie skipper.\n\n\"They're a good team,\" he said. \"They have a lot of speed. They've hit a few more homers this year. They've got great pitching. They play good defense, They have all the ingredients it takes.\"\n\nGuardians: RHP Gavin Williams (elbow) will make his next rehab start at Double-A Akron on Friday. Williams threw 52 pitched in his previous outing for Triple-A Columbus. There's still no clear timetable for his season debut after getting hurt in training camp. ... RHP Shane Bieber (Tommy John surgery) is around for the homestand after getting a routine post-operation checkup.\n\nGuardians RHP Tanner Bibee (4-2, 3.94 ERA) starts Wednesday against Mariners RHP Bryan Woo (3-0, 1.07), who missed his last start with arm discomfort.

The right-hander had 11 strikeouts in his previous start on June 12 at Cincinnati, his first double-digit game in the majors.\n\nSteven Kwan hit a two-run homer and Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00edrez and Bo Naylor each had two hits for the Guardians, who are five games ahead of Minnesota in the Central and have won 22 of 31 games at Progressive Field this season.\n\nSeattle, which leads the West, lost for the second time in 10 games and is 17-6 since May 26. Manager Scott Servais and shortstop J.P. Crawford were both ejected in the fifth by Doug Eddings, who had called Crawford out on strikes.\n\nBryan Woo (3-1) made his first start since June 6 at Oakland, giving up three runs in four innings. The right-hander underwent tests on his surgically-repaired elbow after missing his last scheduled outing, but they revealed no cause for concern.\n\nWoo entered with a 1.07 ERA -- the lowest in Mariners history through six starts -- and just three walks in 33 2/3 innings, but promptly walked leadoff hitter Kwan and allowed him to score.\n\nKwan went 2 for 3 to raise his batting average to .397 and extend his on-base streak to 24 games. He is hitting a major league-best .510 since May 31, but is 16 plate appearances shy of qualifying for the league leaders.\n\nScott Barlow, Hunter Gaddis and Emmanuel Clase worked the final three innings for Cleveland, wrapping up the three-hitter for the team's eighth shutout of the year.\n\nTRAINER'S ROOM\n\nMariners: 2B Jorge Polanco (right hamstring strain), who has been on the injured list since May 27, is continuing his rehab assignment at Triple-A Tacoma following two games with Single-A Everett. He went 1 for 3 in his Rainiers debut against Las Vegas.\n\nGuardians: RHP Nick Sandlin (low back inflammation) was placed on the 15-day IL after experiencing discomfort over the past week. Sandlin is 5-0 with a 3.49 ERA in 33 appearances, but allowed three runs without recording an out Sunday in Toronto.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nMariners RHP Luis Castillo (6-7, 3.32 ERA) takes on Guardians LHP Logan Allen (7-3, 5.30 ERA) in the three-game series finale.

The 13 games over .500 is also a season-high for them.\n\nWhile the Mariners' pitching staff usually gets all the credit, this time it was the M's offense that did a majority of the work. The M's got home runs from J.P. Crawford, Luke Raley and Dylan Moore - and they set a season-high mark in extra-base hits.\n\nPer @MarinersPR:\n\nThe @Mariners have tallied 8 extra-base hits (5 2B, 3 HR) in tonight's game, their most in a game this season.\n\nThe M's still rank near the bottom of most offensive metrics but to see them hit the ball hard and do damage on Tuesday was a very welcome sight. In addition to the three homers, Mitch Garver had two doubles, Josh Rojas had a double, as did Cal Raleigh. Crawford also had a double. Five different Mariners players registered multi-hit games.\n\nThe Mariners may never be an offense that can consistently put up eight runs, but if they show the ability to drive the ball from gap-to-gap like they did on Tuesday, they'll have an easier time of maximizing scoring changes and helping out the elite pitching staff.\n\nThe M's will play the Guardians again on Wednesday afternoon with first pitch coming at 3:40 p.m. PT.\n\nContinue to follow our Inside the Mariners coverage on social media by liking us on Facebook and by following Brady on \"X\" @wdevradiobrady\n\n1) M's power past Guardians in Game 1 of series on Tuesday", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Guardians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Guardians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Progressive Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Mariners", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Seattle Mariners"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Rojas", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Josh Rojas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ty_France", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ty France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extra-base_hit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Extra-base hit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League_West", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American League West"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Third baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "First baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Raley", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Luke Raley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dylan_Moore", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dylan Moore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._P._Crawford", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J.

The last AL team: Cleveland in 1968.\n\nRead more in today's Game Notes:\n\nGilbert currently has a WHIP of 0.92 while Miller's is 0.98. Castillo's sits at 1.1 and Kirby's is an even 1.00. The Mariners focus on dominating the strike zone and that's exactly what this group of pitchers does. None of that group has more than 24 walks allowed this season and they each have more than 80 innings pitched. Furthermore, Bryan Woo has an ERA of 0.54. Once he throws enough to qualify, the M's could end up with five pitchers in this amazing class.\n\nSeattle is certainly carried by their staff but they are known to get timely hits as well. They'll head to Cleveland on Tuesday looking for more of the same against the first-place Guardians.\n\nFirst pitch is set for 3:40 p.m. ET as Miller takes the mound against Guardians' righty Triston McKenzie.\n\nContinue to follow our Inside the Mariners coverage on social media by liking us on Facebook and by following Brady on \"X\" @wdevradiobrady\n\n1) M's schedule continues to look favorable the rest of the way", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Castillo_(pitcher,_born_1992)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Luis Castillo (pitcher, born 1992)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Mariners", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Seattle Mariners"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-Mobile_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "T-Mobile Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Angels", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Angels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dugout_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dugout (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walks_plus_hits_per_inning_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Walks plus hits per inning pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starting_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Starting pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Kirby_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "George Kirby (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logan_Gilbert", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Logan Gilbert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Cubs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Cubs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triston_McKenzie", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Triston McKenzie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pitch (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_zone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strike zone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Innings pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_on_balls", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Base on balls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Maritime", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Maritime", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Watercraft", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Watercraft", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Oceanography", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Oceanography", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Whips", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Whips", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_4899,h_2755,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/inside_the_mariners/01j0pdfz90dapjs1wy3f.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9660880", "eventUri": "eng-9660880", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-02", "textStart": 158, "textEnd": 164}], "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

We were hoping to get this one. I think we all were.\"\n\nThe AL Central-leading Guardians (46-26) clinched the season series, 4-2, over the AL West-leading Mariners (44-33).\n\nThat's notable because the two division winners with the best record in each league are rewarded with a first-round bye in the playoffs, and right now those byes would go to the Yankees and Guardians. And Cleveland now has the tie-breaking advantage on the Mariners.\n\nThe Mariners looked primed to take the rubber match when Dylan Moore launched a no-doubter to deep left field -- just fair -- for a two-run home run off Cleveland left-hander Logan Allen in the top of the first.\n\nJ.P. Crawford had led off the game with an infield single, and the Mariners were quickly leading 2-0.\n\nMoore's blast measured at 108.1 mph off the bat and 418 feet in distance. He has eight home runs this season -- six of which have come on the road. He also homered here Tuesday in the Mariners' 8-5 win to open this nine-game road trip.\n\nThe Mariners, though, were able to add on only one more run over the final eight innings.\n\n\"When you're playing really good teams like this, every inning is so critical,\" Servais said. \"You can't let your guard down, whether it's two out and nobody on [on defense] or on the offensive side, you got to keep grinding, grinding.\"\n\nThe Guardians got one run back in the bottom of the first on an unusual inning-ending double play.\n\nWith runners at the corners, rookie first baseman Tyler Locklear fielded a sharp ground ball, stepped on first base (for the second out) and then threw to Crawford, who eventually tagged Andres Gimenez for the final out -- but not before Steven Kwan scored from third base. (Run counted.)\n\nWill Brennan hit a solo homer in the second inning of Castillo to tie the score at 2-2.\n\n\"The lefties were on him today,\" Servais said.\n\nBrennan was one of seven left-handed hitters in the Guardians' lineup, and those lefties combined for seven of the eight hits Castillo allowed.\n\n\"It's very interesting and [it's] a lot of talent those lefties have,\" Castillo said through interpreter Freddy Llanos. \"Unfortunately today, we were not able to get them out and they were able to do some damage to me.\"\n\nMariners rookie Ryan Bliss hit a scorching two-out double off the wall in left field to drive in Ty France from second base, giving the M's a 3-2 lead in the fourth inning.\n\nFrance had been hit by a pitch (of course he was) and Victor Robles worked a walk to extend the inning for Bliss.\n\nThe lead didn't last.\n\nAllen worked around four walks to limit the damage, completing six innings with three runs allowed.\n\nIn the fifth, the Guardians scored three runs off Castillo -- all with two outs.\n\nMitch Garver made his fifth start of the season at catcher -- his first time working with any starter other than George Kirby -- and he threw out Brayan Rocchio attempting to steal second base for the second out of the fifth inning.\n\nBut Castillo issued his first walk of the game to Steven Kwan -- Cleveland's leadoff hitter who is flirting with a .400 batting average -- and then left a changeup over the heart of the plate to Gimenez, who sent it 413-feet out to right-center for a two-run homer.\n\nThat gave the Guardians a 4-3 lead.\n\nJose Ramirez walked, stole second and then scored on Josh Naylor's double to right field to push the lead to 5-3.\n\n\"It's such a tough lineup -- a lot of talent over there,\" Castillo said. \"I tried to get out of that fifth inning. But, you know, they're very aggressive; they like to swing at the ball, and unfortunately I wasn't able to get out of it.\"\n\nIn the seventh, Robles reached on a check-swing single and Bliss followed with a walk off of Cleveland lefty Tim Herrin.\n\nCrawford followed with a flyout for the first out of the inning.\n\nStephen Vogt, Cleveland's first-year manager, then turned to rookie right-hander Cade Smith.\n\nServais elected to stick with Moore -- who has been torrid on the road this season -- instead of turning to one of his left-handed-hitting options (Cal Raleigh, Luke Raley, Josh Rojas, Dominic Canzone).\n\nMoore got ahead 3-1 in the count before getting jammed on a 97-mph fastball and hitting into a 6-4-3 inning-ending double play.\n\n\"He worked himself into a great count. Their pitcher executed a pitch and got a big double-play ball. It happens,\" Servais said. \"Over the course of games, you're trying to go with guys that are hot or doing well or you have a feel for it.

Crawford hit a two-run homer, Luke Raley and Dylan Moore added solo shots and the Seattle Mariners stayed baseball's hottest team with an 8-5 win over the AL Central-leading Cleveland Guardians on Tuesday night.\n\nWith their fourth straight win and eighth in nine games, the Mariners improved to an MLB-best 17-5 since May 26.\n\nSeattle began a nine-game trip on top of the AL West by nine games -- the largest lead in any division. It's the club's biggest advantage since the end of the 2001 season, when the Mariners won 116 games.\n\nCrawford homered in the third inning off Triston McKenzie (3-4) and added an RBI double in the fourth.\n\nRaley, who grew up in nearby Medina, Ohio, connected in the fifth to put the Mariners ahead 6-1. The homer came only minutes after Raley made a diving catch on the track down the left-field line. He was ejected after striking out in the ninth.\n\nBryce Miller (6-5) held the Guardians to three runs and six hits in 5 2/3 innings. It was the second straight solid outing for the right-hander, who pitched seven scoreless innings last week in a no-decision against the White Sox.\n\nCleveland's Steven Kwan reached base for the 23rd straight game and extended his hitting streak to 12 in a row with a single in the eighth.\n\nDown 7-1, the Guardians didn't go quietly. They scored two in the sixth, one in the seventh and another in the eighth -- helped by Seattle's Trent Thornton hitting two consecutive batters -- before Andr\u00e9s Mu\u00f1oz worked out of a jam.\n\nMu\u00f1oz finished up for his 13th save.\n\nMcKenzie worked around leadoff walks in the first two innings, but another in the third came back to bite him as the Mariners took a 4-1 lead.\n\nAfter No. 9 hitter Moore walked, Crawford connected for a two-run homer that barely cleared the wall and Guardians rookie center fielder Daniel Schneemann's glove.\n\nCal Raleigh's RBI double made it 3-0, and after McKenzie issued his fourth walk, Guardians manager Stephen Vogt pulled the right-hander. who lasted just 2 1/3 innings -- his shortest outing this season.\n\nTEE TIME\n\nWith both teams off Monday, Vogt and Seattle manager Scott Servais went golfing.\n\nThey were together last season as Vogt served as Seattle's bullpen coach. Servais said it didn't take long for him to recognize Vogt was ready to manage and he's not surprised by Cleveland's strong first half under their rookie skipper.\n\n\"They're a good team,\" he said. \"They have a lot of speed. They've hit a few more homers this year. They've got great pitching. They play good defense, They have all the ingredients it takes.\"\n\nTRAINER'S ROOM\n\nGuardians: RHP Gavin Williams (elbow) will make his next rehab start at Double-A Akron on Friday. Williams threw 52 pitched in his previous outing for Triple-A Columbus. There's still no clear timetable for his season debut after getting hurt in training camp. ... RHP Shane Bieber (Tommy John surgery) is around for the homestand after getting a routine post-operation checkup.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nGuardians RHP Tanner Bibee (4-2, 3.94 ERA) starts Wednesday against Mariners RHP Bryan Woo (3-0, 1.07), who missed his last start with arm discomfort. Woo underwent an MRI that came back clean. Servais said the Mariners will keep a close eye on Woo.", "source": {"uri": "newsday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsday"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Mariners", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Seattle Mariners"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooks_Raley", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Brooks Raley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triston_McKenzie", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Triston McKenzie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Guardians", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Guardians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andr\u00e9s_Mu\u00f1oz", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Andr\u00e9s Mu\u00f1oz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Raley", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Luke Raley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dylan_Moore", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dylan Moore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._P._Crawford", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

It's the club's biggest advantage since the end of the 2001 season, when the Mariners won 116 games.\n\nCrawford homered in the third inning off Triston McKenzie (3-4) and added an RBI double in the fourth.\n\nRaley, who grew up in nearby Medina, Ohio, connected in the fifth to put the Mariners ahead 6-1. The homer came only minutes after Raley made a diving catch on the track down the left-field line. He was ejected after striking out in the ninth.\n\nBryce Miller (6-5) held the Guardians to three runs and six hits in 5 2/3 innings. It was the second straight solid outing for the right-hander, who pitched seven scoreless innings last week in a no-decision against the White Sox.\n\nCleveland's Steven Kwan reached base for the 23rd straight game and extended his hitting streak to 12 in a row with a single in the eighth.\n\nDown 7-1, the Guardians didn't go quietly. They scored two in the sixth, one in the seventh and another in the eighth -- helped by Seattle's Trent Thornton hitting two consecutive batters -- before Andr\u00e9s Mu\u00f1oz worked out of a jam.\n\nMu\u00f1oz finished up for his 13th save.\n\nMcKenzie worked around leadoff walks in the first two innings, but another in the third came back to bite him as the Mariners took a 4-1 lead.\n\nAfter No. 9 hitter Moore walked, Crawford connected for a two-run homer that barely cleared the wall and Guardians rookie center fielder Daniel Schneemann's glove.\n\nCal Raleigh's RBI double made it 3-0, and after McKenzie issued his fourth walk, Guardians manager Stephen Vogt pulled the right-hander. who lasted just 2 1/3 innings -- his shortest outing this season.\n\nTEE TIME\n\nWith both teams off Monday, Vogt and Seattle manager Scott Servais went golfing.\n\nThey were together last season as Vogt served as Seattle's bullpen coach. Servais said it didn't take long for him to recognize Vogt was ready to manage and he's not surprised by Cleveland's strong first half under their rookie skipper.\n\n\"They're a good team,\" he said. \"They have a lot of speed. They've hit a few more homers this year. They've got great pitching. They play good defense, They have all the ingredients it takes.\"\n\nTRAINER'S ROOM\n\nGuardians: RHP Gavin Williams (elbow) will make his next rehab start at Double-A Akron on Friday. Williams threw 52 pitched in his previous outing for Triple-A Columbus. There's still no clear timetable for his season debut after getting hurt in training camp. ... RHP Shane Bieber (Tommy John surgery) is around for the homestand after getting a routine post-operation checkup.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nGuardians RHP Tanner Bibee (4-2, 3.94 ERA) starts Wednesday against Mariners RHP Bryan Woo (3-0, 1.07), who missed his last start with arm discomfort. Woo underwent an MRI that came back clean. Servais said the Mariners will keep a close eye on Woo.", "source": {"uri": "tsn.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "TSN"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning",

On top of that, he didn't log a single strikeout, and his ERA ballooned to 4.48 after getting shelled.\n\nIt was just the latest putrid outing for a Cleveland starting pitching staff that has been among the worst in baseball over the first half of the 2024 MLB season.\n\nOnly two of the Guardians' starters boast sub-3 ERAs. Two of them lay claim to ERAs over 5. Yes, the Shane Bieber injury definitely threw a wrench into things, but even if he were healthy and available, the starting rotation would still be a problem for Cleveland.\n\nOver the last three weeks, the Guardians have played 17 games. Their starting pitchers have only made it to the seventh inning once during that span (none made it to the eighth), and only twice have they made it through the sixth. They are lasting 4.2 innings on average during this stretch (h/t Zack Meisel of The Athletic).\n\nCleveland may be 44-26 and it may sit in first place in the AL Central by a comfortable 4.5 games (six in the loss column), but it seems hard to imagine the ballclub maintaining its pace if the starting rotation remains this poor.\n\nAnd you know what? It's already reflecting for the Guardians, who have gone just 4-6 over their last 10 and have allowed 20 runs in their current three-game skid.\n\nCleveland began a stretch of 26 games in 27 days on Tuesday evening, and the first 13 games of that run are particularly brutal. Ten of those contests come against teams with winning records (and the Guardians already lost the first one against the Mariners). That includes a three-game series in Baltimore beginning June 24 followed by a four-game road set against the division-rival Kansas City Royals.\n\nCleveland has had the best bullpen in baseball this year, but it's not difficult to see the pen getting taxed over the next month if the starters continue to plummet.\n\nThe Guardians need to find solutions. Bieber isn't returning this season, so it won't be him. They have around six weeks until the July 30 MLB trade deadline to search for answers. Miami Marlins lefty Jesus Luzardo has been mentioned as a possibility, but Luzardo himself has struggled with a 5.00 ERA through 12 starts.\n\nThe New York Yankees and the Orioles are the two best teams in the American League, and they both have something in common: extraordinary starting pitching.\n\nCleveland may have the third-best record in the AL, but based on its current starting rotation, it simply is not in the same class as the two AL East behemoths.\n\nThe Guardians must find an answer, and barring a major turnaround from someone like McKenzie or Logan Allen, it almost certainly isn't going to come internally.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Crawford, visibly annoyed with the strike zone from umpire Doug Eddings, struck out in that first at-bat against Cleveland's Tanner Bibee.\n\nThe Mariners' shortstop struck out again in the third inning, and then a third time in the fifth inning, after which he slammed his helmet and got in Eddings' face.\n\nCrawford was immediately ejected. Manager Scott Servais was tossed out shortly thereafter, too.\n\nAnd then things got really bad for the Mariners in an 8-0 loss to the Cleveland Guardians on Wednesday at Progressive Field.\n\nBryan Woo, making his first start in 13 days, labored through a 30-pitch first inning and managed to complete just four innings, giving up three runs on four hits, with one walk and one strikeout.\n\nOn an encouraging note, Woo did retire the final seven batters he faced -- after surrendering a two-run homer to Steven Kwan in the second inning -- and was able to effectively mix in some off-speed offerings.\n\nThe Mariners (44-32) will turn to Luis Castillo for the series rubber match on Thursday afternoon. It's an important game in the landscape of the American League playoffs; the Mariners are chasing the AL Central-leading Guardians (45-26) for the No. 2 seed, which comes with a first-round bye.\n\nThe 25-year-old Bibee, in his first start against the Mariners, struck out a career-high 12 over six shutout innings. The Mariners managed to put runners in scoring position just twice, and no runner ever got past second base.\n\nCrawford had reason to be irate.\n\nTwo of the pitches in his first at-bat were clearly balls. Two more in his final at-bat were borderline strikes, at best, at the top of the zone.\n\nThe Mariners wound up striking out 14 times and walked just twice, a notable step back for an offense that has shown sustained improvement in June.\n\nMike Baumann took over in relief of Woo in the fifth inning, just after Crawford's ejection ended the top half of the inning, and things unraveled quickly for the Mariners.\n\nWith two outs, Jose Ramirez hit a bouncing ball to the right of rookie second baseman Ryan Bliss, who had entered the game as Crawford's replacement (with Dylan Moore shifting over from second to short). Bliss fielded the ball cleanly on the move to his right, but he made an off-balance throw and the ball skipped twice before reaching Ty France at first base -- and Ramirez beat it out.\n\nA run scored on the play when Andres Gimenez hustled all the way from second and slid home ahead of the throw from France.

We're here to share our MLB odds series, make a Mariners-Guardians prediction, and pick while showing you how to watch.\n\nLast Start: Castillo had a solid outing in his start, going six innings while allowing two earned runs on four hits while striking out seven in a win over the Texas Rangers.\n\n2024 Road Splits: Castillo is 2-4 with a 3.76 ERA over seven starts away from Seattle.\n\nLogan Allen (7-3) with a 5.30 ERA\n\nLast Start: Allen went five innings in his last start and allowed one earned run on three hits while striking out three and walking three in a win over the Toronto Blue Jays.\n\n2024 Home Splits: Allen is 2-0 with a 7.33 ERA over five starts at Progressive Field, not losing despite struggling.\n\nThe Mariners are currently leading the American League West by a sizable margin, having led the Houston Astros by 10 games coming into Wednesday's action. Despite their success, their hitting has struggled.\n\nThe M's entered the day just 28th in batting average, 25th in on-base percentage, 23rd in runs, and 22nd in slugging percentage. Yet, they have tremendous power, ranking sixth in home runs. They have some players who can create some damage.\n\nTy France is one of their longest-tenured players. Currently, he is batting .249 with seven home runs, 27 RBIs, and 22 runs. Julio Rodriguez continues to be one of the top young players in the game. Ultimately, he is hitting .264 with seven home runs, 29 RBIs, and 36 runs. Cal Raleigh is a slugger. Significantly, he is batting .206 with 12 home runs, 44 RBIs, and 28 runs and is on pace for 25 home runs and 100 RBIs.\n\nThe Mariners have one of the top pitching staffs in baseball. However, Castillo struggled in his start against the Guardians earlier this season, going 5 2/3 innings while allowing four earned runs on 10 hits in a loss. Despite how good Castillo is, the bullpen has not been that great. Unfortunately, they are just 15th in team ERA.\n\nThe Mariners will cover the spread if they can string some hits together against Allen. Then, Castillo needs to bounce back and find the strike zone against the Guardians to prevent putting too much pressure on the bullpen.\n\nWhy The Guardians Will Cover The Spread/Win\n\nThe Guardians are currently leading the American League Central. They have managed to dominate in several aspects of their game, including some hitting and elite pitching.\n\nThe Guardians are just 16th in batting average, 14th in home runs, and 13th in slugging percentage. Yet, they are also eighth in on-base percentage and runs. Their hitters have done enough to help put them in first.\n\nJosh Naylor is displaying all the power to help give the Guardians some runs. So far, he is batting .229 with 17 home runs, 50 RBIs, and 38 runs. Jose Ramirez is a monster at the plate. Currently, he is hitting .271 with 18 home runs, 63 RBIs, and 52 runs and is well on his way to 36 home runs, 110 RBIs, and 105 runs if he can keep the pace going.\n\nAndres Gimenez is struggling to get things going consistently. Currently, he is batting .256 with four home runs, 35 RBIs, and 35 runs. But the Guardians really like what they have in Steven Kwan. Significantly, he is hitting .392 with four home runs, 18 RBIs, and 39 runs over 44 games.\n\nThe Guardians are one of the top pitching staffs in the majors. Furthermore, Allen dominated the Mariners earlier this season, tossing six shutout innings while allowing four hits and striking out six in a win. When Allen finishes, he will turn the ball over to the most dominant bullpen in baseball.\n\nThe Guardians will cover the spread if they can figure out Castillo early. Then, they need Allen to replicate his dominance against the Mariners from earlier in the season and then hand it over to the best bullpen.\n\nFinal Mariners-Guardians Prediction & Pick\n\nThis is a potential playoff preview, and we can see these teams play again in the playoffs. For now, the M's have shown they can hang with the Guardians after winning the opener 8-5. But the Mariners are just 36-39 against the spread, while the Guardians are 40-30. Moreover, they are just 16-20 against the spread on the road, mainly because they have won a lot of close games. The Guardians are just 16-14 against the spread at home, as they have also won a lot of close games. We believe this will be a close game, and we also feel it will be low-scoring with the good pitchers on the mound.

He then walked Steven Kwan, and Gimenez followed with a no-doubt shot over the right-center-field wall for a 4-3 Cleveland lead.

It's time to continue our MLB odds series as we hand out a mariners-Guardians prediction and pick. We will also let you know how to watch the game.\n\nLast Start: at Oakland Athletics: Win, 6 innings, 2 hits, 0 runs, o walks, 6 strikeouts\n\n2024 Road Splits: 3 starts, 1.50 ERA, 0.50 WHIP, 18 innings pitched, 14K/0BB, .141 oBA\n\nTanner Bibee (4-2) with a 3.94 ERA, 1.17 WHIP, 75.1 innings pitched, 87K/20BB, .236 oBA\n\nLast Start: at Cincinnati Reds: Loss, 5.1 innings, 4 hits, 4 runs, 1 walk, 11 strikeouts\n\n2024 Home Splits: 7 starts, 5.06 ERA, 1.23 WHIP, 37.1 innings pitched, 41K/9BB, .253 oBA\n\nBryan Woo takes the mound for the Mariners, and he has been extremely impressive this season. Woo has walked just two batters all season, and he is not allowing hits, either. This means Woo not only has elite command, but his stuff is very good, as well. Woo rarely gives up a barrel, so his average exit velocity is pretty low too. The Guardians have the second-lowest barrel percentage at the plate, so I am expecting plenty of weak contact in this game. If Woo can continue pitching as he has been, the Mariners will win this game.\n\nThe Guardians are also a team that will chase pitches. They have the sixth-highest chase rate in the MLB. Now, they do not swing and miss a lot, but Woo should be able to get them to chase in order to generate that weak contact. With his command, Woo can throw any pitch in any count anywhere in the zone. He should have no problem executing his pitches and getting the Guardians to chase. If this happens, expect the Mariners to win.\n\nWhy The Guardians Will Cover The Spread/Win\n\nBibee has done a great job striking out batters this season. This is great news as the Mariners lead the MLB in strikeouts by a large margin. Along with this, the Mariners have the third-highest whiff rate, third-lowest chase contact percentage, and second-lowest zone contact percentage. The Mariners will swing and miss, and they get in trouble because of it. Bibee has to take advantage of this. If he can continue his ways of striking batters out, the Guardians will win this game.\n\nBibee has one of the better sliders in the MLB. It has a whiff rate of 35.1 percent, an oBA of .131, and an average exit velocity of 84.2. The slider is arguably his best pitch, and the Mariners are going struggle against it. With Seattle's tendency to chase pitches, Bibee's slider is going to cause a lot of trouble for the Mariners. If that pitch is one in this game, expect Bibee to shut down the Mariners.\n\nFinal Mariners-Guardians Prediction & Pick\n\nI would not be surprised to see a lower scoring game in this one. I am fully expecting both pitchers to shut down the opposing team. With it being a lower scoring game, I like the Guardians to outlast the Mariners.

Crawford homers, drives in 3 as AL West-leading Mariners stay hot with 8-5 win over Guardians", "body": "CLEVELAND (AP) -- J.P. Crawford hit a two-run homer, Luke Raley and Dylan Moore added solo shots and the Seattle Mariners stayed baseball's hottest team with an 8-5 win over the AL Central-leading Cleveland Guardians on Tuesday night.\n\nWith their fourth straight win and eighth in nine games, the Mariners improved to an MLB-best 17-5 since May 26.\n\nSeattle began a nine-game trip on top of the AL West by nine games -- the largest lead in any division. It's the club's biggest advantage since the end of the 2001 season, when the Mariners won 116 games.\n\nCrawford homered in the third inning off Triston McKenzie (3-4) and added an RBI double in the fourth.\n\nRaley, who grew up in nearby Medina, Ohio, connected in the fifth to put the Mariners ahead 6-1. The homer came only minutes after Raley made a diving catch on the track down the left-field line. He was ejected after striking out in the ninth.\n\nBryce Miller (6-5) held the Guardians to three runs and six hits in 5 2/3 innings. It was the second straight solid outing for the right-hander, who pitched seven scoreless innings last week in a no-decision against the White Sox.\n\nCleveland's Steven Kwan reached base for the 23rd straight game and extended his hitting streak to 12 in a row with a single in the eighth.\n\nDown 7-1, the Guardians didn't go quietly. They scored two in the sixth, one in the seventh and another in the eighth -- helped by Seattle's Trent Thornton hitting two consecutive batters -- before Andr\u00e9s Mu\u00f1oz worked out of a jam.\n\nMu\u00f1oz finished up for his 13th save.\n\nMcKenzie worked around leadoff walks in the first two innings, but another in the third came back to bite him as the Mariners took a 4-1 lead.\n\nAfter No. 9 hitter Moore walked, Crawford connected for a two-run homer that barely cleared the wall and Guardians rookie center fielder Daniel Schneemann's glove.\n\nCal Raleigh's RBI double made it 3-0, and after McKenzie issued his fourth walk, Guardians manager Stephen Vogt pulled the right-hander. who lasted just 2 1/3 innings -- his shortest outing this season.\n\nTEE TIME\n\nWith both teams off Monday, Vogt and Seattle manager Scott Servais went golfing.\n\nThey were together last season as Vogt served as Seattle's bullpen coach. Servais said it didn't take long for him to recognize Vogt was ready to manage and he's not surprised by Cleveland's strong first half under their rookie skipper.\n\n\"They're a good team,\" he said. \"They have a lot of speed. They've hit a few more homers this year. They've got great pitching. They play good defense, They have all the ingredients it takes.\"\n\nTRAINER'S ROOM\n\nGuardians: RHP Gavin Williams (elbow) will make his next rehab start at Double-A Akron on Friday. Williams threw 52 pitched in his previous outing for Triple-A Columbus. There's still no clear timetable for his season debut after getting hurt in training camp. ... RHP Shane Bieber (Tommy John surgery) is around for the homestand after getting a routine post-operation checkup.\n\nGuardians RHP Tanner Bibee (4-2, 3.94 ERA) starts Wednesday against Mariners RHP Bryan Woo (3-0, 1.07), who missed his last start with arm discomfort. Woo underwent an MRI that came back clean. Servais said the Mariners will keep a close eye on Woo.", "source": {"uri": "winnipegfreepress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Winnipeg Free Press"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Mariners", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Seattle Mariners"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooks_Raley", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Brooks Raley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triston_McKenzie", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Triston McKenzie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Guardians", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Guardians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andr\u00e9s_Mu\u00f1oz", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Andr\u00e9s Mu\u00f1oz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Raley", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Luke Raley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dylan_Moore", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dylan Moore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._P._Crawford", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

Crawford, Scott Servais ejected as frustrated Mariners fall 8-0 in Cleveland", "body": "CLEVELAND -- From the very first pitch of the game, the Mariners were behind.\n\nAnd irate.\n\nJ.P. Crawford, visibly annoyed with the strike zone from umpire Doug Eddings, struck out in that first at-bat against Cleveland's Tanner Bibee.\n\nThe Mariners' shortstop struck out again in the third inning, and then a third time in the fifth inning, after which he slammed his helmet and got in Eddings' face.\n\nCrawford was immediately ejected. Manager Scott Servais was tossed out shortly thereafter, too.\n\nAnd then things got really bad for the Mariners in an 8-0 loss to the Cleveland Guardians on Wednesday at Progressive Field.\n\n\"We all try to have good, competitive at-bats,\" Crawford said afterward. \"But, personally, when the at-bats get taken out of your hand from the very first pitch, it's hard to come back from that.\"\n\nBryan Woo, making his first start in 13 days, labored through a 30-pitch first inning and managed to complete just four innings, giving up three runs on four hits, with one walk and one strikeout.\n\n\"We knew there'd be a little rust,\" Servais said. \"That's the concern any time a guy doesn't pitch in 12, 13 days. You know, the command is usually the issue at times.\"\n\nWoo came in with a strict pitch count, and the Guardians fouled off 22 of the 64 pitches he threw. He was asked afterward how he felt physically on the mound.\n\n\"Not great,\" he said. \"But it is what it is.\"\n\nIn his seventh start, Woo was hit with his first loss of the season.\n\n\"Pretty bad,\" Woo said. \"Just not efficient. Walked the leadoff guy in the first inning, leads to a 30-pitch inning on an even lower pitch count [overall]. ... Just didn't do my job.\"\n\nOn an encouraging note, Woo did retire the final seven batters he faced -- after surrendering a two-run homer to Steven Kwan in the second inning -- and was able to effectively mix in some off-speed offerings.\n\nWoo's return, though, became the secondary storyline as the frustration with Eddings mounted among Mariners' hitters through the first few innings.\n\n\"You certainly feel it building in the dugout -- because those are balls,\" Servais said. \"Our leadoff hitter has one of the better eyes in the league, and when the first pitch of the game is four to five inches outside and it's called a strike, there's going to be issues.\"\n\nThe 25-year-old Bibee, in his first start against the Mariners, struck out a career-high 12 over six shutout innings. The Mariners managed to put runners in scoring position just twice, and no runner ever got past second base.\n\nCrawford, the AL leader in walks last season, did have reason to be irate.\n\nTwo of the pitches in his first at-bat were clearly balls. Two more in his final at-bat were borderline strikes, at best, at the top of the zone, including the called third strike.\n\n\"I'm not making excuses; I mean, the guy had his best stuff out there tonight. He pitched very well,\" Crawford said. \"But when at-bats taken out of your hands ... it makes it hard. It's very frustrating.\"\n\nThe Mariners wound up striking out 14 times and walked just twice, a notable step back for an offense that has shown signs of sustained improvement in June.\n\n\"It's our first time seeing [Bibee], and there's a reason he's got really good numbers in this league,\" Servais said. \"He's got really good stuff.\"\n\nMike Baumann took over in relief of Woo in the fifth inning, just after Crawford's ejection ended the top half of the inning, and things unraveled quickly for the Mariners.\n\nWith two outs, Jose Ramirez hit a bouncing ball to the right of rookie second baseman Ryan Bliss, who had entered the game as Crawford's replacement (with Dylan Moore shifting over from second to short). Bliss fielded the ball cleanly on the move to his right, but he made an off-balance throw and the ball skipped twice before reaching Ty France at first base -- and Ramirez beat it out.\n\nA run scored on the play when Andres Gimenez hustled all the way from second and slid home ahead of the throw from France. That extended the Guardians' lead to 4-0.\n\nThe next batter, Josh Naylor, turned on a 97-mph fastball from Baumann and hit it out to right field for a two-run homer, pushing the lead to 6-0.\n\nThe Mariners effectively waved the white flag after that.\n\nNaylor added a solo homer off Eduard Bazardo in the seventh.\n\nThe Mariners (44-32) had their four-game winning streak snapped.\n\nThey will turn to Luis Castillo for the series rubber match on Thursday afternoon. It's an important game in the landscape of the American League playoffs; the Mariners are chasing the AL Central-leading Guardians (45-26) for the No. 2 seed, which comes with a first-round bye.\n\n\"We've got to forget about [the loss],\" Servais said. \"We're going to show up tomorrow with a chance to win a series against a good team here, and we're certainly capable of doing that.\"", "source": {"uri": "spokesman.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Spokesman Review"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pitch (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Servais", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scott Servais"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "At bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Mariners", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Seattle Mariners"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_count", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pitch count"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Guardians", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Guardians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._P._Crawford", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

Woo had his previous start skipped because of discomfort in his surgically repaired elbow.\n\nGuardians: Right-hander Gavin Williams (right elbow inflammation) will make his next rehab start Friday for Double-A Akron. Williams, who has been on the injured list all season, had a 7.88 ERA in his first four rehab outings for Triple-A Columbus.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nMariners: Right-hander George Kirby (6-5, 3.54 ERA) takes the hill Friday as Seattle continues its nine-game trip in Miami. Kirby tossed six scoreless innings and gained the win in his lone career appearance against the Marlins on June 13, 2023.\n\nGuardians: Right-hander Carlos Carrasco (2-6, 5.80 ERA) works the opener of a three-game home series Friday against Toronto. The 14-year veteran is 0-5 with a 5.96 ERA in six starts since his most recent victory on May 5 against the Los Angeles Angels.", "source": {"uri": "tsn.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "TSN"},

An MRI came back clean on the 24-year-old, who likely will be on a pitch count Wednesday. He also missed the first month of the season due to elbow inflammation.\n\nWoo certainly would welcome the offensive fireworks the Mariners flashed in the series opener.\n\nSeattle recorded a season-high nine extra-base hits (six doubles, three homers) in its 8-5 victory over Cleveland on Tuesday. J.P. Crawford belted a two-run homer and Ohio native Luke Raley and Dylan Moore also went deep as the Mariners secured their fourth straight win and their 17th victory in the past 22 games.\n\nThanks to the hot stretch, the Mariners are a season-best 13 games over .500.\n\n\"We're feeling good,\" said Bryce Miller, who picked up the win on Tuesday and is 6-5. \"This is how we expected to start the year, and we're starting to put it together. It's a really good baseball team. We're going to throw it, and whenever we swing it like that, it's going to be tough to beat us.\"\n\nThe Guardians, meanwhile, have matched their longest losing streak of the season, three games. They also dropped three in a row from May 9-11.\n\n\"We just didn't get the big hit tonight,\" Cleveland manager Stephen Vogt said after the Tuesday defeat. \"We were close to outhitting them or just about even, but theirs were for extra bases. Ours weren't. There's the difference in the game. They cashed in their opportunities and we didn't.\"\n\nMoore has flustered the Guardians in his career, recording 11 extra-base hits (five doubles, six homers) in 16 games. Moore also doubled Tuesday.\n\nTy France recorded three of Seattle's seven walks in his first game since being activated from the 10-day injured list. He missed nine games due to a fractured right heel.\n\nWoo will be opposed by Guardians right-hander Tanner Bibee (4-2, 3.94 ERA). Both pitchers will be facing the opposition for the first time in their careers.\n\nBibee, 25, is looking to rebound after one pitch effectively spoiled his latest outing. He struck out a career-high 11 batters before Jeimer Candelario deposited his final offering over the wall in right field for a three-run homer, sending Cleveland to a 4-2 loss against the Cincinnati Reds on June 12.\n\n\"That's the best he's thrown the ball,\" Vogt said. \"There was basically one hard-hit ball the whole game. Candelario was locked in all night. I thought the changeup was a really good pitch. I thought we had a chance to put him away. He just put a really good swing on it.\"\n\nCleveland's Steven Kwan is riding a 12-game hitting streak and a 23-game on-base streak into the Wednesday contest.\n\nWill Brennan, who had three hits in the series opener, is batting .324 (12-for-37) in June and .385 (10-for-26) in nine career games vs. Seattle.\n\n--Field Level Media", "source": {"uri": "thenewstribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The News Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "field_level_media@thenewstribune.com", "name": "Field Level Media", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Mariners", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Seattle Mariners"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extra-base_hit", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Extra-base hit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Guardians", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Guardians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._P._Crawford", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

Mandatory Credit: Katie Stratman-USA TODAY Sports / Katie Stratman-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe Cleveland Guardians have been one of the best teams in baseball thus far, boasting a 44-25 record and sitting five games in front of the Kansas City Royals in the AL Central (seven in the loss column).\n\nHowever, things are about to get tougher for the upstart Guardians.\n\nCleveland is getting set to begin a three-game series with the Seattle Mariners on Tuesday night, which will begin an absolutely brutal stretch that could ultimately define the ballclub's season.\n\nThe Guardians are about to play for 13 straight days and in 26 of the next 27. It makes sense, considering Cleveland has only played 69 games at the time of this writing. That's the least amount of contests in baseball, with no other club having played less than 71.\n\nBut it's not just the quantity of the games that the Guardians are about to play. It's the quality of the opponents.\n\nTen of their next 13 games will feature matchups against teams with winning records. That includes a four-game road set with the division-rival Royals starting on June 27. They will also face the rugged Baltimore Orioles on the road right before battling Kansas City.\n\nThis next month or so could absolutely determine Cleveland's course for the 2024 campaign and will almost certainly influence what the Guardians decide to do at the July 30 MLB trade deadline.\n\nFurther complicating things for Cleveland is the fact that its starting rotation has not exactly been a strength, with only two of its starters owning sub-4 ERAs. As a matter of fact, two of the club's starting pitchers sport ERAs north of 5.\n\nThe Guardians have been largely saved by a terrific bullpen, as they rank No. 1 in the majors with a 2.33 ERA in that category. But with so many games coming up, the pen could get taxed if the starters are unable to deliver.\n\nWe are about to discover if Cleveland is really a legitimate World Series contender that can challenge teams like the New York Yankees and the Orioles in the American League.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Guardians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Guardians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Kwan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Steven Kwan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kole_Calhoun", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kole Calhoun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_American_Ball_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Great American Ball Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Third baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati_Reds", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati Reds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Royals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Royals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Left fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "First baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League_Central", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American League Central"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Mariners", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Seattle Mariners"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Yankees", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Yankees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_Orioles", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore Orioles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullpen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bullpen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starting_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Starting pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City,_Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City, Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kansas City, Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/North_America", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/North America", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/Europe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/Europe", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_2881,h_1620,x_0,y_132/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/cleveland_baseball_insider/01j0ppj3v3reatec3mc9.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9660880", "eventUri": "eng-9660880", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-27", "textStart": 1397, "textEnd": 1404}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-30", "textStart": 1668, "textEnd": 1675}, {"amb": false, "date": "2015-08-", "textStart": 0, "textEnd": 6}], "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 151, "relevance": 1}

Contreras begins rehab assignment:\n\nCardinals catcher Willson Contreras was off to an otherworldly start this year, slashing .280/.398/.551 (170 wRC+) in 31 games before he was struck in the arm by a swing of the bat from Mets DH J.D. Martinez. The incident left him with a fractured arm that was initially expected to cost him at least ten weeks, but the 32-year-old actually appears to be ahead of schedule. He resumed baseball activities earlier this month, just four weeks after his initial injury, and today (as noted by MLB.com's Injury Tracker) is scheduled to begin a rehab assignment at Triple-A Memphis with three at-bats out of the DH slot. When the veteran returns, he'll be entering into a playoff race for the first time in his St. Louis tenure as the Cardinals have surged to second place in the NL Central with a 36-35 record in his absence after possessing a record of just 15-21 at the time of his injury.\n\n2. Series Preview: Mariners @ Guardians\n\nNeither the Mariners nor the Guardians were popular picks to win their divisions heading into the season, but both have substantial leads in mid-June. Seattle has surged ahead of both the Rangers and Astros to grab a commanding nine game lead in the AL West, while the Guardians' 44-25 record is not only good for the AL Central lead but also the fifth-best record in baseball this year. They're up five games over the second-place Royals and 5.5 games over the third-place Twins. Now, the two surprise contenders are set to meet in Cleveland for a three-game set in what could be a preview of a playoff matchup.\n\nThe series opens at 6:40pm local time this evening with a pair of right-handed youngsters on the mound when 25-year-old Bryce Miller (3.48 ERA) faces off against 26-year-old Triston McKenzie (4.10 ERA). The youthful pitching matchups will continue tomorrow when 24-year-old Bryan Woo (1.07 ERA through six starts) takes on 25-year-old Tanner Bibee (3.94 ERA), and the series will wrap up on Thursday with veteran Luis Castillo (3.32 ERA) taking on 25-year-old lefty Logan Allen (5.30 ERA). The Guardians will be looking to cool off the Mariners in this series, as Seattle has won seven of their last eight games, while Cleveland has gone just 4-4 over that same timeframe, including dropping three of their last four contests.\n\n3. MLBTR Chat Today:\n\nThe injury bug has struck a number of clubs recently, with Mookie Betts, Yoshinobu Yamamoto, Kyle Bradish, Michael Harris II, and Anthony Rizzo all facing extended absences. If you have any questions about how those players' absences will be handled by their clubs, or perhaps questions that look ahead to the July 30 trade deadline or the upcoming offseason, MLBTR's Steve Adams will host a live chat with readers today at 1pm CT.

The AL central's first-place team could win the series in today's 1:10 game.\n\nLogan Allen will take the mound for his 15th start on the season. Despite having a 5.30 ERA in 2024, Allen has a favorable matchup against a Mariners' lineup that struggles against LHP. Seattle's offense ranks last in batting average against LHP at .211, while having the fourth most strikeouts against left-handed pitching in 2024 with 206. Allen is not commonly known for a high strikeout rate, but tends to excel when facing teams who struggle at the plate. His strikeout total is set at 4.5 (-135) at DraftKings Sportsbook.\n\nAfter an eight-run performance last night, the Guardians' offense will look to continue the success at the plate against Mariners' starting pitcher Luis Castillo. The RHP gave up 10 hits and four runs in his pervious start against Cleveland. His 2-4 record in away games this year paves the way for another electric game at the dish for Josh Naylor. The Guardians' cleanup hitter went 3-for-4 last night with two home runs and four RBIs, which ties him for sixth in the MLB for RBIs on the year with 54. Naylor's total bases is set at 1.5 (+110) and RBI total at 0.5 (+130) at DraftKings Sportsbook.\n\nOutfielder Steven Kwan extended his hit streak to 14 last night after going 2-for-3 with a home run. During the 14-game span, Kwan has had eight multi-hit games. With a chance to push his batting average over the .400 mark, Kwan's total hits is set at 1.5 (+165) at DraftKings Sportsbook.\n\nDavid Fry was not much of an offensive contributor to last night's victory, going 0-for-4 with a strikeout. Fry, in hopes to make a last-minute push for an All-Star spot, is looking for a bounce-back performace against Castillo. His hit total is set at 0.5 (-155) at DraftKings Sportsbook\n\nGame odds refresh periodically and are subject to change.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logan_Allen_(baseball,_born_1997)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Logan Allen (baseball, born 1997)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Mariners", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Seattle Mariners"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pitch (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DraftKings", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "DraftKings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average_against", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Batting average against"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starting_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Starting pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Kwan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steven Kwan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Castillo_(pitcher,_born_1992)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luis Castillo (pitcher, born 1992)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Batting average (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_bases", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Total bases"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Naylor", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Josh Naylor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleanup_hitter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cleanup hitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Outfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys_and_Games/Games", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys and Games/Games", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Game_Design", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Game Design", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_1320,h_742,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/voltaxMediaLibrary/mmsport/cleveland_baseball_insider/01j0twh9yd3fgrejz2ta.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9660880", "eventUri": "eng-9660880", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 136, "relevance": 1}

Heck, they are just one loss behind the New York Yankees (50-25) in the American League as a whole.\n\nTaking that into consideration, you would think that the Guardians will be major players between now and the MLB trade deadline, which is on July 30. After all, Cleveland absolutely has some needs that should be addressed.\n\nHowever, Bleacher Report's Joel Reuter sees things a bit differently and is actually predicting the Guardians to stand pat over the next six weeks.\n\nReuter backs his argument by saying that Cleveland is rarely active in the buyer's market, noting that reliever Andrew Miller is the last big-name player the club landed in a deadline deal. He also mentions the fact that the Guardians rank 26th in the majors in payroll.\n\nEven if those things may be accurate, it seems hard to envision Cleveland sitting on its hands and doing nothing before the end of July.\n\nThe Guardians are in desperate need of starting pitching, as only two of their starters have ERAs under 4. Two of them -- Logan Allen and Carlos Carrasco -- have ERAs north of 5. They coud also use another bat in their outfield (Will Brennan and Tyler Freeman lay claim to OPSes of .679 and .676, respectively), and they could also stand to upgrade from the light-hitting Brayan Rocchio at shortstop.\n\nThree players on Cleveland have an OPS north of .800. On the flip side, seven of their regulars (minimum 100 plate appearances) have an ugly sub-.700 OPS.\n\nIf the Guardians are going to be able to beat teams like the Yankees and Baltimore Orioles in the playoffs, they will need to buttress their roster in the coming weeks.\n\nAs good as Cleveland has been this season, it will be very difficult for the Guardians to beat New York or Baltimore in a playoff series with the roster as currently constructed.\n\nHolding firm would be a major mistake for a franchise that has not won a World Series since 1948.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType":

In fact, also heading into play on Monday, the M's had the second-easiest remaining schedule in all of baseball, per Tankathon. The collective winning percentage of the M's opponents was .478.\n\nNow, the ease of the M's schedule is a direct result of how poor the division is, with all four other American League West teams sitting under .500.\n\nHowever, as the Rangers get healthier (Josh Jung, Evan Carter, Max Scherzer, Jacob deGrom and Tyler Mahle) and the Astros perhaps get going again, the schedule could look tougher in the second half.\n\nThe M's and Guardians will kick off their series at 3:40 p.m. PT.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Mariners", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Seattle Mariners"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Guardians", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Guardians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julio_Rodr\u00edguez_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Julio Rodr\u00edguez (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-Mobile_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "T-Mobile Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Rangers_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas Rangers (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Center fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_White_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicago White Sox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Marlins", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miami Marlins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League_Central", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American League Central"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Jung", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Josh Jung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_deGrom", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jacob deGrom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Mahle", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tyler Mahle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League_West", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American League West"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winning_percentage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Winning percentage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Astros", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Houston Astros"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Scherzer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Max Scherzer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major League", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Watercraft", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Watercraft", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Oceanography", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Oceanography", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_4500,h_2531,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/inside_the_mariners/01j0m48hrjcv2c16b3zn.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9660880", "eventUri": "eng-9660880", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-15", "textStart": 169, "textEnd": 176}], "sentiment": 0.3568627450980393, "wgt": 135, "relevance": 1}

They have won seven of their last eight and a dominant nine-game lead over American League West powerhouses the Texas Rangers and Houston Astros. It has been a fantastic last month for the M's.\n\nAlso Read: Seattle Mariners game today - Get watch time and channel for tonight's game\n\nHowever, for as good as they are they could be better, specifically in their batting order. While Julio Rodriguez and Cal Raleigh are solid threats in the lineup, the Mariners batters don't strike fear in opposing teams like their pitching staff.\n\nThere has been speculation about potential trades they could make for the July 30 MLB trade deadline, including a blockbuster for New York Mets slugger Pete Alonso. However, USA Today MLB insider Bob Nightengale believes that even if they don't land an impact hitter on the trade block, teams around the AL are very worried about facing Seattle in the postseason.\n\n\"They're scary because of that pitching,\" Nightengale told Sportsnaut recently. \"Remember when the Astros won the World Series a couple of years ago, they could have lost those three games easily to the Seattle Mariners. Nobody wants to play the Seattle Mariners.\n\n\"I don't care if it's the Yankees or Orioles, that's a nightmare because if those guys line up and go lights out you're done. It's about pitching and defense in the playoffs. It's not about who scores the most runs because those offenses get shut down.\"\n\nThe series Nightengale referenced was the 2022 AL Division series. The Astros swept Seattle in three games however, they only outscored them by a combined four runs in those games.\n\nAlso Read: 10 MLB trades we'd love to see in June, including Pete Alonso to the Seattle Mariners\n\nThe Mariners pitching staff is even better this season. Only one of their starters has an ERA over 4.00, and four of them average eight or more strikeouts per nine innings. Two of their starters, Luis Castillo and Logan Gilbert are among the top three in quality starts.

With the Minnesota Twins only 4.5 games back in the division, Cleveland is looking to snap the recent skid tonight.\n\nTanner Bibee gets the nod tonight for the Guardians. The righty is coming off a tough loss against the Cincinnati Reds, giving up four earned runs and two home runs in 5.1 innings of work. One positive takeaway from Bibee's last start: he had 11 strikeouts, which was a season-high. McKenzie may have struggled yesterday, but the Mariners finished the night with nine strikeouts. Seattle's high strikeout rate against RHP pitching gives Bibee a huge advantage tonight. Bibee's total strikeouts is set at 6.5 (-135) at DraftKings Sportsbook.\n\nThe Guardians' offense will have their work cut out for them tonight, as Bryan Woo looks to continue his dominant 2024 campaign this season. In six starts this season, Woo has posted a 1.07 ERA while giving up 14 hits. The crafty RHP is coming off a tremendous start against the Oakland A's, giving up two hits in six innings of work.\n\nDespite Woo's recent success, Cleveland's offense features a few hitters that have been excelling against RHP this season. Jose Ramirez helped fuel the late comeback last night with his 2-for-5 performance. The star switch-hitter carries a .243 batting average against RHP into tonight's matchup, along with 13 home runs and 45 RBIs. Ramirez's total bases is set at 1.5 (+100) along with his RBIs at 0.5 (+125) at DraftKings Sportsbook.\n\nOutfielder Steven Kwan extended his hit streak to 12 games last night. The Guardians' leadoff hitter has racked up seven multi-hit games during the 12-game stint. Kwan's hits is set at 1.5 (+175) at DraftKings Sportsbook. Josh Naylor could also benefit from a right-handed starting pitcher tonight, as Cleveland's power bat is hitting .246 against RHP this season. Naylor has not had a RBI in his last five starts, however, he currently is top 10 in RBIs this season with 50.

Mandatory Credit: Jim Cowsert-USA TODAY Sports / Jim Cowsert-USA TODAY Sports\n\nEmotions were running high in the second game of the Cleveland Guardians and Seattle Mariners' three-game series which resulted in a pair being ejected from the away team's dugout.\n\nTanner Bibee threw a high fastball that home plate Doug Eddings called strike three to end the fourth inning.\n\nImmediately after the call was made, J.P. Crawford slammed his helmet on the ground and turned to emotionally let Eddings know that he didn't agree with the call. It didn't take long for the ump to toss him out of the game.\n\nMariners' manager Scott Servais came running out of the dugout to defend his player, pleaded his case, and ultimately said the magic word or phrase that resulted in Eddings ejecting him too.\n\nThis was brewing for a little while before this happened.\n\nEddings was hearing it from the Mariners' dugout earlier in the game and he even took off his mask and pointed to tell someone that what they were saying was enough. Then Ty France appeared frustrated with some of the calls in his at-bat.\n\nThe Mariners have overall not appreciated the way that this series has been called so far. Cleveland native Luke Raley was playing in his first game in Progressive in the series opener, but his night was cut short after his first career ejection because of waving off an umpire after a strikeout.\n\nSeattle does have a point with some of the calls from Wednesday night's game.

The first three were Joe Sewell (1920-1930), Ken Keltner (1937-1948) and Lou Boudreau (1938-1949). So, Ramirez is the first Cleveland player to do it for the better part of a century.\n\nRamirez went 2-for-5 with an RBI on Tuesday. On the season overall, he is slashing .271/.331/.532 wit 18 home runs and 63 RBI.\n\nThe Dominican native originally signed with the Guardians as an amateur free agent back in 2009. He made his big-league debut in 2013 but did not become a full-time starter until 2016, when he slashed .312/.363/.462 with 11 homers and 76 RBI.\n\nRamirez has made five All-Star appearances and seems to be well on his way to a sixth, as he is currently the leading vote-getter for American League third basemen.\n\nHe has finished inside the top five of AL MVP voting four times, including three top-three finishes. His best season arguably came in 2018, when he registered a .270/.387/.552 slash line with 39 long balls and 105 RBI.\n\nThe Guardians may have been struggling of late, as they entered Wednesday evening's action having lost three straight games. They have also gone just 4-6 over their last 10.\n\nRegardless of the recent skid, Cleveland is 44-26 and sits comfortably in first place in the AL Central, holding a 4.5-game lead -- six in the loss column -- over the Minnesota Twins.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Guardians", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Guardians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Sewell", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Sewell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Keltner", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ken Keltner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lou_Boudreau", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lou Boudreau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Third baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Mariners", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Seattle Mariners"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos\u00e9_Ram\u00edrez_(infielder)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00edrez (infielder)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominican_Republic", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dominican Republic"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Dominican Republic"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League_Central", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American League Central"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Twins", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Twins"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cue_Sports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cue Sports", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Subcultures/Spotters", "label": "dmoz/Society/Subcultures/Spotters", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cue_Sports/Pool", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cue Sports/Pool", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_3569,h_2007,x_0,y_50/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/cleveland_baseball_insider/01j0sckm65t61s1z91vs.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9660880", "eventUri": "eng-9660880", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 117, "relevance": 1}

Josh Naylor added an RBI double as the Guardians took two of three in the series.\n\n\"When they're hitting like that -- in their ballpark -- it's going to be tough to beat them,\" Mariners manager Scott Servais said. \"Every inning is a battle. They're scrappy and they just keep coming.\"\n\nBrennan went deep against Castillo in the second and Trent Thornton in the eighth for his first multi-homer game. He also doubled in amassing a career-high 10 total bases.\n\nLogan Allen (8-3) pitched six innings, giving up three runs, in winning his second straight start. Emmanuel Clase earned his 22nd save with a perfect ninth for Cleveland, which has the second-best home record in the majors at 23-9.\n\n\"That's the resilience of this group, we just stay in it,\" Allen said. \"It's kind of a cat-and-mouse game. Taking the series against a first-place team -- a team you hope to see down the road in the playoffs -- is big.\"\n\nDylan Moore hit a two-run homer in the first and Ryan Bliss had an RBI double in the fourth for AL West leader Seattle. The Mariners lost for just the sixth time in 19 games since May 31.\n\nCastillo allowed a season-high tying five runs in five innings, falling to 1-5 in his career against Cleveland.\n\n\"Good things happen when you swing at strikes,\" Brennan said. \"We do really well at home and I can't wait for the Cleveland fans to keep showing out.\"\n\nGuardians left fielder Steven Kwan went 1 for 3, dropping his batting average to .396 and he extended his hitting streak to 14 games. He is batting an MLB-high .500 since May 31, but is 14 plate appearances shy of qualifying for the league leaders.\n\nMariners >> Right-hander Bryan Woo (right elbow soreness) reported no issues after pitching four innings and allowing three runs Wednesday against Cleveland. Woo had his previous start skipped because of discomfort in his surgically repaired elbow.\n\nGuardians >> Right-hander Gavin Williams (right elbow inflammation) will make his next rehab start Friday for Double-A Akron. Williams, who has been on the injured list all season, had a 7.88 ERA in his first four rehab outings for Triple-A Columbus.\n\nMariners >> Right-hander George Kirby (6-5, 3.54 ERA) takes the hill Friday as Seattle continues its nine-game trip in Miami. Kirby tossed six scoreless innings and gained the win in his lone career appearance against the Marlins on June 13, 2023.\n\nGuardians >> Right-hander Carlos Carrasco (2-6, 5.80 ERA) works the opener of a three-game home series Friday against Toronto. The 14-year veteran is 0-5 with a 5.96 ERA in six starts since his most recent victory on May 5 against the Los Angeles Angels.\n\nGuardians 6, Mariners 3\n\nUp next: Toronto visits for three games

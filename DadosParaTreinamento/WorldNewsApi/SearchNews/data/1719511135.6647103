Richard Dalton At the height of her fame, Princess Diana was the most recognised woman in the world Richard Dalton worked with Princess Diana for more than a decade At the height of her fame, Princess Diana was the most recognised woman in the world. And Richard Dalton was the hairdresser she sought for cutting and styling her hair during this time. 'I was with her every day for 12 years,' Dalton told Town & Country. He continued: 'I met Diana when she was 17. I worked at Fenwick of Bond Street's in-store salon, and cut her sisters' hair.' The Princess once requested a shorter cut for a trip to Africa, but was concerned about the impact a dramatic change might have. Dalton, therefore, decided to trim one-fourth of an inch during each appointment over a period of several weeks. 'Whatever I did to her hair became front page news,' he recalled. 'We had to be very careful. We had to do it one-fourth of an inch at a time over several weeks.", "summary": "Richard Ward is renowned for creating one of the most iconic hairstyles in history - the demi-chignon style she wore for her wedding to Prince William in 2011.", "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/royals/article-13442907/Kate-wedding-Meghan-messy-bun-stylists-Cressida-Bonas.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490", "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/05/22/14/85202801-0-image-a-182_1716386164126.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 15:19:12", "author": "Editor,Rebekah Absalom", "authors": ["Editor", "Rebekah Absalom"], "language": "en", "source_country": "GB", "sentiment": 0.656}

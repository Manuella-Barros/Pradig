A Missouri judge on Monday, July 24, 2024, overturned the conviction of Dunn, who has spent more than 30 years in prison for a killing he has long contended he didn't commit.\n\nST. LOUIS (AP) -- A Missouri man was freed from prison Tuesday after his murder conviction was overturned after 34 years behind bars, despite the state attorney general's efforts to keep him there.\n\n\"I never gave up because my family never gave up,\" Christopher Dunn said from the steps of the downtown St. Louis courthouse. \"It's easy to give up in prison when you lose hope. But when the system throws you away, you have to ask yourself if you wanted to just settle for it or fight for it.\"\n\nDunn, 52, reunited with his wife, Kira Dunn, as he was officially released from the St. Louis city jail Tuesday night. As his release drew imminent, he was driven by van from the state prison in Licking, Missouri, to St. Louis, about 140 miles (225 kilometers) away.\n\nA St. Louis circuit judge overturned Dunn's murder conviction on July 22 and ordered his immediate release. But Dunn remained imprisoned amid a chaotic process that began when Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey appealed to try and keep Dunn locked up.\n\nWhen asked about the delay since the judge's ruling, Dunn said, \"It was testing. To hear the decision by the judge and then be prepared to leave on Wednesday, only to be brought back to prison. It was torture.\"\n\nDunn's release marks the second time in recent weeks that a person was freed from prison despite Bailey's appeals to keep them in custody after a murder conviction was overturned.\n\nSandra Hemme was freed July 19 from a western Missouri prison after serving 43 years for a murder that a judge deemed there was evidence of her \"actual innocence.\" Bailey's office also opposed Hemme's release while an appellate court reviewed the case. She walked out of the prison only after a judge threatened Bailey with contempt if she wasn't freed.\n\nPolitical scientists and some attorneys have said Bailey was taking the tough stance to shore up votes in advance of a contested Republican primary. He faces a challenge from Will Scharf, an attorney for former President Donald Trump, in the Aug. 6 primary.\n\nAt one point last week, Dunn was minutes away from getting out of prison after the circuit judge, Jason Sengheiser, threatened a warden with contempt if he wasn't released. But then the Missouri Supreme Court agreed to consider the case, temporarily halting his freedom.\n\nThen on Tuesday, the state's highest court issued a ruling stating that the St. Louis circuit attorney needed to confirm it had no plans to retry Dunn before he could be freed. Circuit Attorney Gabe Gore immediately filed a memorandum stating he would not seek a new trial, setting in motion the process toward Dunn's freedom.\n\nA statement from the Midwest Innocence Project said Dunn \"is coming home.\"\n\n\"We are thrilled that Chris will finally be reunited with his family after 34 years behind bars for a crime he did not commit,\" the statement read. \"We look forward to supporting Chris as he rebuilds his life.\"\n\nEarlier Tuesday, leaders of the Missouri NAACP and other organizations said that politics and racism were behind Bailey's effort to keep Dunn behind bars. State NAACP President Nimrod Chapel Jr. said at a news conference that Bailey \"superseded his jurisdiction and authority\" in appealing Sengheiser's ruling.\n\n\"What's happening now is another form of lynching,\" said another speaker, Zaki Baruti of the Universal African People's Organization.\n\nBailey's office, in an earlier statement, said the effort to keep Dunn in prison was warranted.\n\n\"Throughout the appeals process, multiple courts have affirmed Christopher Dunn's murder conviction,\" the statement read. \"We will always fight for the rule of law and to obtain justice for victims.\"\n\nDunn was convicted of first-degree murder in the 1990 shooting of 15-year-old Ricco Rogers. St. Louis Circuit Attorney Gabe Gore filed a motion in February seeking to vacate the guilty verdict. A hearing was in May.\n\nSengheiser wrote in his ruling that Gore \"made a clear and convincing showing of 'actual innocence' that undermines the basis for Dunn's convictions because in light of new evidence, no juror, acting reasonably, would have voted to find Dunn guilty of these crimes beyond a reasonable doubt.\"\n\nThe Missouri Attorney General's Office opposed the effort to vacate Dunn's conviction. Lawyers for the state said at the May hearing that initial testimony from two boys at the scene who identified Dunn as the shooter was correct, even though they later recanted as adults.\n\nRogers was shot May 18, 1990, when a gunman opened fire while he was with a group of other teenage boys outside a home. DeMorris Stepp, 14, and Michael Davis Jr., 12, both initially identified Dunn as the shooter.\n\nIn a recorded interview played at the hearing, Davis said he lied because he thought Dunn was affiliated with a rival gang.\n\nStepp's story has changed a few times over the years, Gore said at the hearing. Most recently he has said he did not see Dunn as the shooter. Gore said another judge previously found Stepp to be a \"completely unreliable witness\" and urged Sengheiser to discount him altogether.\n\nDunn has said he was at his mother's home at the time of the shooting. Childhood friend Nicole Bailey testified that she spoke with him by phone that night and he was on a phone at his mother's house.\n\nTristin Estep, the assistant attorney general, said that alibi could not be trusted and that Dunn's story has shifted multiple times over the years. Dunn did not testify at the hearing.\n\nA Missouri law adopted in 2021 lets prosecutors request hearings when they see evidence of a wrongful conviction. While Bailey's office is not required to oppose such efforts, he also opposed another effort in St. Louis that resulted in Lamar Johnson being freed last year after serving 28 years for a murder case in which a judge ruled he was wrongfully convicted.\n\nThe 2021 law has resulted in the release of two men who each spent decades in prison. In addition to Johnson, Kevin Strickland was freed in 2021 after more than 40 years for three killings in Kansas City after a judge ruled he was wrongfully convicted in 1979.\n\nAnother hearing is approaching for Marcellus Williams, who narrowly escaped lethal injection and is now facing another execution date.\n\nSt. Louis County's prosecutor believes DNA evidence shows that Williams didn't commit the crime that landed him on death row. DNA of someone else -- but not Williams -- was found on the knife used in the 1998 killing, experts said.\n\nA hearing on Williams' innocence claim begins Aug. 21. His execution is scheduled for Sept. 24.\n\nBailey's office is opposing the challenge to Williams' conviction, too.", "source": {"uri": "eagletribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

But when the system throws you away, you have to ask yourself if you wanted to just settle for it or fight for it.\"\n\nDunn, 52, was driven by van from the state prison in Licking, Missouri, to St. Louis, about 140 miles (225 kilometers) away as his release was imminent. He was officially released from the St. Louis city jail Tuesday night.\n\nA St. Louis circuit judge overturned Dunn's murder conviction on July 22 and ordered his immediate release. But Dunn remained imprisoned amid a chaotic process that began when Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey appealed to try and keep Dunn locked up.\n\nDunn's release marks the second time in recent weeks that a person was freed from prison despite Bailey's appeals to keep them in custody after a murder conviction was overturned.\n\nSandra Hemme was freed July 19 from a western Missouri prison after serving 43 years for a murder that a judge deemed there was evidence of her \"actual innocence.\" Bailey's office also opposed Hemme's release while an appellate court reviewed the case. She walked out of the prison only after a judge threatened Bailey with contempt if she wasn't freed.\n\nPolitical scientists and some attorneys have said Bailey was taking the tough stance to shore up votes in advance of a contested Republican primary. He faces a challenge from Will Scharf, an attorney for former President Donald Trump, in the Aug. 6 primary.\n\nAt one point last week, Dunn was minutes away from getting out of prison after the circuit judge, Jason Sengheiser, threatened a warden with contempt if he wasn't released. But then the Missouri Supreme Court agreed to consider the case, temporarily halting his freedom.\n\nThen on Tuesday, the state's highest court issued a ruling stating that the St. Louis circuit attorney needed to confirm it had no plans to retry Dunn before he could be freed. Circuit Attorney Gabe Gore immediately filed a memorandum stating he would not seek a new trial, setting in motion the process toward Dunn's freedom.\n\nA statement from the Midwest Innocence Project said Dunn \"is coming home.\"\n\n\"We are thrilled that Chris will finally be reunited with his family after 34 years behind bars for a crime he did not commit,\" the statement read. \"We look forward to supporting Chris as he rebuilds his life.\"\n\nEarlier Tuesday, leaders of the Missouri NAACP and other organizations said that politics and racism were behind Bailey's effort to keep Dunn behind bars. State NAACP President Nimrod Chapel Jr. said at a news conference that Bailey \"superseded his jurisdiction and authority\" in appealing Sengheiser's ruling.\n\n\"What's happening now is another form of lynching,\" said another speaker, Zaki Baruti of the Universal African People's Organization.\n\nBailey's office, in an earlier statement, said the effort to keep Dunn in prison was warranted.\n\n\"Throughout the appeals process, multiple courts have affirmed Christopher Dunn's murder conviction,\" the statement read. \"We will always fight for the rule of law and to obtain justice for victims.\"\n\nDunn was convicted of first-degree murder in the 1990 shooting of 15-year-old Ricco Rogers. St. Louis Circuit Attorney Gabe Gore filed a motion in February seeking to vacate the guilty verdict. A hearing was in May.\n\nSengheiser wrote in his ruling that Gore \"made a clear and convincing showing of 'actual innocence' that undermines the basis for Dunn's convictions because in light of new evidence, no juror, acting reasonably, would have voted to find Dunn guilty of these crimes beyond a reasonable doubt.\"\n\nThe Missouri Attorney General's Office opposed the effort to vacate Dunn's conviction. Lawyers for the state said at the May hearing that initial testimony from two boys at the scene who identified Dunn as the shooter was correct, even though they later recanted as adults.\n\nRogers was shot May 18, 1990, when a gunman opened fire while he was with a group of other teenage boys outside a home. DeMorris Stepp, 14, and Michael Davis Jr., 12, both initially identified Dunn as the shooter.\n\nIn a recorded interview played at the hearing, Davis said he lied because he thought Dunn was affiliated with a rival gang.\n\nStepp's story has changed a few times over the years, Gore said at the hearing. Most recently he has said he did not see Dunn as the shooter. Gore said another judge previously found Stepp to be a \"completely unreliable witness\" and urged Sengheiser to discount him altogether.\n\nDunn has said he was at his mother's home at the time of the shooting. Childhood friend Nicole Bailey testified that she spoke with him by phone that night and he was on a phone at his mother's house.\n\nTristin Estep, the assistant attorney general, said that alibi could not be trusted and that Dunn's story has shifted multiple times over the years. Dunn did not testify at the hearing.\n\nA Missouri law adopted in 2021 lets prosecutors request hearings when they see evidence of a wrongful conviction. While Bailey's office is not required to oppose such efforts, he also opposed another effort in St. Louis that resulted in Lamar Johnson being freed last year after serving 28 years for a murder case in which a judge ruled he was wrongfully convicted.\n\nThe 2021 law has resulted in the release of two men who each spent decades in prison. In addition to Johnson, Kevin Strickland was freed in 2021 after more than 40 years for three killings in Kansas City after a judge ruled he was wrongfully convicted in 1979.\n\nAnother hearing is approaching for Marcellus Williams, who narrowly escaped lethal injection and is now facing another execution date.\n\nSt. Louis County's prosecutor believes DNA evidence shows that Williams didn't commit the crime that landed him on death row. DNA of someone else -- but not Williams -- was found on the knife used in the 1998 killing, experts said.\n\nA hearing on Williams' innocence claim begins Aug. 21. His execution is scheduled for Sept. 24.\n\nBailey's office is opposing the challenge to Williams' conviction, too.", "source": {"uri": "wboc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WBOC TV-16"},

Then a court halted his release.", "body": "He was wearing civilian clothes picked out months before: a sage green button-down, a blazer, and a green and blue tie that brought it all together. He had on real underwear, the kind with an elastic band that he hadn't worn in 34 years, and had thrown out his prison toothbrush. His wife would be waiting with a new one in the parking lot.\n\nA judge had finally ruled two days earlier what Dunn had always maintained: He was wrongfully convicted of murder in 1990.\n\nBut as the Missouri Department of Correction was finalizing his release papers Wednesday, the warden got the call. The state Supreme Court had halted the release order after the state attorney general appealed to keep Dunn in prison.\n\n\"It was probably the highest high and lowest low I can remember in my life,\" said Kira Dunn, who had used saved-up airline miles to fly in from California to see her husband's release. \"We were completely stunned.\"\n\n\"He was literally 50 feet from freedom,\" she added.\n\nOn Monday, St. Louis Circuit Court Judge Jason Sengheiser had ruled Dunn, 52, was wrongfully convicted of the murder of 15-year-old Ricco Rogers and ordered he be released by Wednesday evening.\n\nThe judge wrote that St. Louis Circuit Attorney Gabe Gore had proved Dunn's \"actual innocence,\" after two witnesses who had identified Dunn as the killer in 1990 later recanted their testimony as adults, saying they had been coerced by police to testify.\n\nMissouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey, a Republican, argued that the recantations had been coerced and that Dunn was really guilty. Sengheiser rejected his argument, writing in his decision that, \"The Attorney General provided zero evidence to support these allegations.\"\n\nWithin hours of that ruling, Bailey filed an appeal. Just before the Wednesday deadline to free Dunn, the state's top court stopped his release to let the appeal process play out.\n\nThat court could rule on the case and set Dunn free as soon as next week.\n\nIn the meantime, he has traded in his civilian clothes for another prison jumpsuit, his wife said.\n\n\"He had gotten rid of all his property at the prison,\" Kira Dunn said. \"We're so hurt and, frankly, don't understand why the person who's tasked with defending the well-being of Missourians would do this.\"\n\nDunn has maintained his innocence for decades. In 2020, another judge found that a jury would likely find him not guilty based on new evidence but said he couldn't exonerate Dunn because only those on death row in Missouri were eligible for that ruling.\n\nThe state then passed a law in 2021 expanding who could seek new hearings, allowing prosecutors to bring possible wrongful-conviction cases to court when new evidence arises.\n\nIn February of this year, Gore, the St. Louis prosecutor, did just that, filing a motion seeking to vacate the guilty verdict.\n\nCourt filings show that Bailey, the state attorney general, advised the Department of Corrections to wait to release Dunn until the appeal played out.\n\n\"Throughout the appeals process, multiple courts have affirmed Christopher Dunn's murder conviction,\" said Madeline Sieren, Bailey's spokesperson, in an email. \"We will always fight for the rule of law and to obtain justice for victims.\"\n\nSieren declined to comment further on the record, citing the pending litigation.\n\nDunn's case is the second time in weeks Bailey has sought to appeal an overturned conviction to the state's top court.\n\nAfter another judge overturned the conviction of Sandra Hemme for a 1980 fatal stabbing on June 14, Bailey's office also told prison officials not to release the 64-year-old woman while the appeals process proceeded. Missouri's top court agreed with the vacated ruling, and the judge in that case said last week that if Hemme wasn't released, Bailey would have to appear in court himself. She was released that day.\n\nCharles Zug, a political science professor at the University of Missouri, noted that Bailey gave little legal rationale for why Dunn shouldn't be released. He said there could be a political reason.\n\nBailey is facing a primary challenge to his right by attorney Will Scharf, who has represented Donald Trump. The former president has not yet made an endorsement in the race, but Zug noted that if he did, it could swing the primary. Zug said he interprets what Bailey is doing as trying to bolster his \"law and order\" bona fides to national party officials and garner their support.\n\n\"He seems to be throwing spaghetti at the walls trying to signal as much as possible to national Republicans that he's conservative enough,\" Zug said. \"Unfortunately, Dunn has found himself as a chess piece here.\"\n\nOn Thursday, Dunn's attorneys argued in a filing to the Missouri Supreme Court that Bailey had no right to appeal the judge's ruling, and that only the prosecutor who fought for Dunn's release could do so.\n\n\"This tug-of-war should end,\" they wrote.\n\nDunn's mother, sisters and nephew had joined his wife, Kira, in Missouri to see Dunn walk out of prison Wednesday. When they found out that wouldn't be happening, Kira went inside to talk to the warden, who let her see her husband.\n\nThe light was out of Dunn's eyes, she said. They held hands. She told him it was a bump in the road, that she would be back next week waiting outside the prison, waiting for him.\n\n\"We've been waiting a long, long time,\" she said. \"I guess we'll just keep waiting.\"", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dan_rosenzweig_ziff@washingtonpost.com", "name": "Dan Rosenzweig-Ziff",

LOUIS (AP) -- A Missouri man whose 1991 murder conviction was overturned earlier this month appeared to be on the verge of release Tuesday, following a lengthy legal battle with the state's attorney general that extended his stay behind bars.\n\nChristopher Dunn has spent 34 years imprisoned for a 1990 killing in St. Louis. Circuit Judge Jason Sengheiser on July 21 tossed out Dunn's conviction, citing evidence of \"actual innocence.\" The judge at the time ordered Dunn's immediate release.\n\nBut Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey appealed. The Missouri Supreme Court on Tuesday issued a ruling stating that the St. Louis circuit attorney needed to confirm it had no plans to retry Dunn before he could be freed. Circuit Attorney Gabe Gore immediately filed a memorandum stating he would not seek a new trial.\n\nBy late afternoon, the state Supreme Court had still not granted Dunn's release. But Missouri Department of Corrections spokesperson Karen Pojmann said Dunn was being taken by van to St. Louis, pending further orders from the court.\n\nA statement from the Midwest Innocence Project said Dunn \"is coming home.\"\n\n\"We are thrilled that Chris will finally be reunited with his family after 34 years behind bars for a crime he did not commit,\" the statement read. \"We look forward to supporting Chris as he rebuilds his life.\"\n\nDunn's wife, Kira Dunn, was more cautious.\n\n\"Seeing is believing,\" she said. \"I'm not a Missourian, but I feel like one. I'm like, show me, show me, show me.\"\n\nBailey's office didn't immediately respond to a message seeking comment.\n\nEarlier Tuesday, leaders of the Missouri NAACP and other organizations said that politics and racism were behind Bailey's effort to keep Dunn behind bars. State NAACP President Nimrod Chapel Jr. said at a news conference that Bailey \"superseded his jurisdiction and authority\" in appealing Sengheiser's ruling.\n\n\"What's happening now is another form of lynching,\" said another speaker, Zaki Baruti of the Universal African People's Organization.\n\nBailey's office, in an earlier statement, said the effort to keep Dunn in prison was warranted.\n\n\"Throughout the appeals process, multiple courts have affirmed Christopher Dunn's murder conviction,\" the statement read. \"We will always fight for the rule of law and to obtain justice for victims.\"\n\nDunn was 18 in 1990 when 15-year-old Ricco Rogers was killed. Testimony from a 12-year-old and a 14-year-old at the scene of the shooting was key to convicting Dunn of first-degree murder. Both later recanted their testimony, saying they had been coerced by police and prosecutors.\n\nAt an evidentiary hearing in 2020, another judge agreed that a jury would likely find Dunn not guilty based on new evidence. But that judge, William Hickle, declined to exonerate Dunn, citing a 2016 Missouri Supreme Court ruling that only death row inmates -- not those like Dunn, who was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole -- could make a \"freestanding\" claim of actual innocence.\n\nA 2021 law now allows prosecutors to seek court hearings in cases with new evidence of a wrongful conviction. St. Louis Circuit Attorney Gabe Gore sought the hearing on behalf of Dunn and Sengheiser heard testimony in May.\n\nAnother case involving a Black inmate goes before another judge Aug. 21, with life-or-death consequences.\n\nMarcellus Williams is on death row for the stabbing death of a St. Louis County woman in 1998. His execution is scheduled for Sept. 24, unless his conviction is overturned. St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Wesley Bell requested the hearing. His motion said three experts determined that Williams' DNA was not on the handle of the butcher knife used in the killing.\n\nBailey's office also will oppose overturning Williams' conviction.\n\nBut another inmate who Bailey sought to keep imprisoned after a conviction was overturned was white.\n\nSandra Hemme, 64, spent 43 years in prison for the fatal stabbing of a woman in St. Joseph in 1980. A judge on June 14 cited evidence of \"actual innocence\" and overturned her conviction. She had been the longest held wrongly incarcerated woman known in the U.S., according to the National Innocence Project, which worked to free Hemme.\n\nAppeals by Bailey -- all the way up to the Missouri Supreme Court -- kept Hemme imprisoned at the Chillicothe Correctional Center for several days, until a judge on July 19 ordered her immediate release and threatened Bailey with possible contempt of court charges.

LOUIS (AP) -- A Missouri man was freed from prison Tuesday after his murder conviction was overturned after 34 years behind bars, despite the state attorney general's efforts to keep him there.\n\n\"I never gave up because my family never gave up,\" Christopher Dunn said. \"It's easy to give up in prison when you lose hope. But when the system throws you away, you have to ask yourself if you wanted to just settle for it or fight for it.\"\n\nDunn, 52, was driven by van from the state prison in Licking, Missouri, to St. Louis, about 140 miles (225 kilometers) away as his release was imminent. He was officially released from the St. Louis city jail Tuesday night.\n\nA St. Louis circuit judge overturned Dunn's murder conviction on July 22 and ordered his immediate release. But Dunn remained imprisoned amid a chaotic process that began when Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey appealed to try and keep Dunn locked up.\n\nDunn's release marks the second time in recent weeks that a person was freed from prison despite Bailey's appeals to keep them in custody after a murder conviction was overturned.\n\nSandra Hemme was freed July 19 from a western Missouri prison after serving 43 years for a murder that a judge deemed there was evidence of her \"actual innocence.\" Bailey's office also opposed Hemme's release while an appellate court reviewed the case. She walked out of the prison only after a judge threatened Bailey with contempt if she wasn't freed.\n\nPolitical scientists and some attorneys have said Bailey was taking the tough stance to shore up votes in advance of a contested Republican primary. He faces a challenge from Will Scharf, an attorney for former President Donald Trump, in the Aug. 6 primary.\n\nAt one point last week, Dunn was minutes away from getting out of prison after the circuit judge, Jason Sengheiser, threatened a warden with contempt if he wasn't released. But then the Missouri Supreme Court agreed to consider the case, temporarily halting his freedom.\n\nThen on Tuesday, the state's highest court issued a ruling stating that the St. Louis circuit attorney needed to confirm it had no plans to retry Dunn before he could be freed. Circuit Attorney Gabe Gore immediately filed a memorandum stating he would not seek a new trial, setting in motion the process toward Dunn's freedom.\n\nA statement from the Midwest Innocence Project said Dunn \"is coming home.\"\n\n\"We are thrilled that Chris will finally be reunited with his family after 34 years behind bars for a crime he did not commit,\" the statement read. \"We look forward to supporting Chris as he rebuilds his life.\"\n\nEarlier Tuesday, leaders of the Missouri NAACP and other organizations said that politics and racism were behind Bailey's effort to keep Dunn behind bars. State NAACP President Nimrod Chapel Jr. said at a news conference that Bailey \"superseded his jurisdiction and authority\" in appealing Sengheiser's ruling.\n\n\"What's happening now is another form of lynching,\" said another speaker, Zaki Baruti of the Universal African People's Organization.\n\nBailey's office, in an earlier statement, said the effort to keep Dunn in prison was warranted.\n\n\"Throughout the appeals process, multiple courts have affirmed Christopher Dunn's murder conviction,\" the statement read. \"We will always fight for the rule of law and to obtain justice for victims.\"\n\nDunn was convicted of first-degree murder in the 1990 shooting of 15-year-old Ricco Rogers. St. Louis Circuit Attorney Gabe Gore filed a motion in February seeking to vacate the guilty verdict. A hearing was in May.\n\nSengheiser wrote in his ruling that Gore \"made a clear and convincing showing of 'actual innocence' that undermines the basis for Dunn's convictions because in light of new evidence, no juror, acting reasonably, would have voted to find Dunn guilty of these crimes beyond a reasonable doubt.\"\n\nThe Missouri Attorney General's Office opposed the effort to vacate Dunn's conviction. Lawyers for the state said at the May hearing that initial testimony from two boys at the scene who identified Dunn as the shooter was correct, even though they later recanted as adults.\n\nRogers was shot May 18, 1990, when a gunman opened fire while he was with a group of other teenage boys outside a home. DeMorris Stepp, 14, and Michael Davis Jr., 12, both initially identified Dunn as the shooter.\n\nIn a recorded interview played at the hearing, Davis said he lied because he thought Dunn was affiliated with a rival gang.\n\nStepp's story has changed a few times over the years, Gore said at the hearing. Most recently he has said he did not see Dunn as the shooter. Gore said another judge previously found Stepp to be a \"completely unreliable witness\" and urged Sengheiser to discount him altogether.\n\nDunn has said he was at his mother's home at the time of the shooting. Childhood friend Nicole Bailey testified that she spoke with him by phone that night and he was on a phone at his mother's house.\n\nTristin Estep, the assistant attorney general, said that alibi could not be trusted and that Dunn's story has shifted multiple times over the years. Dunn did not testify at the hearing.\n\nA Missouri law adopted in 2021 lets prosecutors request hearings when they see evidence of a wrongful conviction. While Bailey's office is not required to oppose such efforts, he also opposed another effort in St. Louis that resulted in Lamar Johnson being freed last year after serving 28 years for a murder case in which a judge ruled he was wrongfully convicted.\n\nThe 2021 law has resulted in the release of two men who each spent decades in prison. In addition to Johnson, Kevin Strickland was freed in 2021 after more than 40 years for three killings in Kansas City after a judge ruled he was wrongfully convicted in 1979.\n\nAnother hearing is approaching for Marcellus Williams, who narrowly escaped lethal injection and is now facing another execution date.\n\nSt. Louis County's prosecutor believes DNA evidence shows that Williams didn't commit the crime that landed him on death row. DNA of someone else -- but not Williams -- was found on the knife used in the 1998 killing, experts said.\n\nA hearing on Williams' innocence claim begins Aug. 21. His execution is scheduled for Sept. 24.\n\nBailey's office is opposing the challenge to Williams' conviction, too.", "source": {"uri": "newstimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NewsTimes"},

Then a court stopped him", "body": "\"It was probably the highest high and lowest low I can remember in my life,\" said Kira Dunn, who had used saved-up airline miles to fly from California for her husband's release. \"We were completely stunned.\"\n\n\"He was literally 50 feet [15m] from freedom,\" she added.\n\nLast Monday, St Louis Circuit Court Judge Jason Sengheiser had ruled that Dunn, 52, was wrongfully convicted of the murder of 15-year-old Ricco Rogers and ordered he be released.\n\nThe judge wrote that St Louis prosecutor Gabe Gore had proved Dunn's \"actual innocence\", after two witnesses who had identified Dunn as the killer in 1990 later recanted their testimony as adults, saying they had been coerced by police to testify.\n\nMissouri Attorney-General Andrew Bailey, a Republican, argued that the recantations had been coerced and that Dunn was really guilty. Sengheiser rejected his argument, writing in his decision that, \"the Attorney-General provided zero evidence to support these allegations\".\n\nWithin hours of that ruling, Bailey filed an appeal. Just before the Wednesday night local time deadline to free Dunn, the state's top court stopped his release to let the appeal process play out.\n\nThat court could rule on the case and set Dunn free as soon as this coming week.\n\nIn the meantime, he has traded in his civilian clothes for another prison jumpsuit, his wife said.\n\n\"He had [got] rid of all his property at the prison,\" Kira Dunn said. \"We're so hurt and, frankly, don't understand why the person who's tasked with defending the wellbeing of Missourians would do this.\"\n\nDunn has maintained his innocence for decades. In 2020, another judge found that a jury would likely find him not guilty based on new evidence but said he couldn't exonerate Dunn because only those on death row in Missouri were eligible for that ruling.\n\nThe state then passed a law in 2021 expanding who could seek new hearings, allowing prosecutors to bring possible wrongful-conviction cases to court when new evidence arises.\n\nIn February of this year, Gore did just that, filing a motion seeking to vacate the guilty verdict.\n\nCourt filings show that Bailey advised the Department of Corrections to wait to release Dunn until the appeal played out.\n\n\"Throughout the appeals process, multiple courts have affirmed Christopher Dunn's murder conviction,\" said Madeline Sieren, Bailey's spokesperson, in an email. \"We will always fight for the rule of law and to obtain justice for victims.\"\n\nSieren declined to comment further on the record, citing the pending litigation.\n\nDunn's case is the second time in weeks Bailey has sought to appeal an overturned conviction to the state's top court.\n\nAfter another judge overturned the conviction of Sandra Hemme for a 1980 fatal stabbing on June 14, Bailey's office also told prison officials not to release the 64-year-old woman while the appeals process proceeded. Missouri's top court agreed with the vacated ruling, and the judge in that case said last week that if Hemme wasn't released, Bailey would have to appear in court himself. She was released that day.\n\nCharles Zug, a political science professor at the University of Missouri, noted that Bailey gave little legal rationale for why Dunn shouldn't be released. He said there could be a political reason.\n\nBailey is facing a primary challenge to his right by lawyer Will Scharf, who has represented Donald Trump. The former US President has not yet made an endorsement in the race, but Zug noted that if he did, it could swing the primary. Zug said he interprets what Bailey is doing as trying to bolster his \"law and order\" bona fides to national party officials and garner their support.\n\n\"He seems to be throwing spaghetti at the walls trying to signal as much as possible to national Republicans that he's conservative enough,\" Zug said. \"Unfortunately, Dunn has found himself as a chess piece here.\"\n\nOn Thursday, Dunn's lawyers argued in a filing to the Missouri Supreme Court that Bailey had no right to appeal the judge's ruling, and that only the prosecutor who fought for Dunn's release could do so.\n\n\"This tug-of-war should end,\" they wrote.\n\nDunn's mother, sisters, and nephew had joined his wife, Kira, in Missouri to see Dunn leave prison. When they found out that wouldn't be happening, Kira went inside to talk to the warden, who let her see her husband.\n\nThe light was out of Dunn's eyes, she said. They held hands. She told him it was a bump in the road, that she would be back next week waiting outside the prison, waiting for him.\n\n\"We've been waiting a long, long time,\" she said. \"I guess we'll just keep waiting.\"", "source": {"uri": "nzherald.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "NZ Herald"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Bailey_(banker)", "type": "person",

LOUIS (AP) -- A Missouri man was freed from prison Tuesday after his murder conviction was overturned after 34 years behind bars, despite the state attorney general's efforts to keep him there.\n\n\"I never gave up because my family never gave up,\" Christopher Dunn said from the steps of the downtown St. Louis courthouse. \"It's easy to give up in prison when you lose hope. But when the system throws you away, you have to ask yourself if you wanted to just settle for it or fight for it.\"\n\nDunn, 52, reunited with his wife, Kira Dunn, as he was officially released from the St. Louis city jail Tuesday night. As his release drew imminent, he was driven by van from the state prison in Licking, Missouri, to St. Louis, about 140 miles (225 kilometers) away.\n\nA St. Louis circuit judge overturned Dunn's murder conviction on July 22 and ordered his immediate release. But Dunn remained imprisoned amid a chaotic process that began when Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey appealed to try and keep Dunn locked up.\n\nWho's Donald Trump's pick for Missouri governor?

To hear the decision by the judge and then be prepared to leave on Wednesday, only to be brought back to prison. It was torture.\"\n\nDunn's release marks the second time in recent weeks that a person was freed from prison despite Bailey's appeals to keep them in custody after a murder conviction was overturned.\n\nSandra Hemme was freed July 19 from a western Missouri prison after serving 43 years for a murder that a judge deemed there was evidence of her \"actual innocence.\" Bailey's office also opposed Hemme's release while an appellate court reviewed the case. She walked out of the prison only after a judge threatened Bailey with contempt if she wasn't freed.\n\nPolitical scientists and some attorneys have said Bailey was taking the tough stance to shore up votes in advance of a contested Republican primary. He faces a challenge from Will Scharf, an attorney for former President Donald Trump, in the Aug. 6 primary.\n\nAt one point last week, Dunn was minutes away from getting out of prison after the circuit judge, Jason Sengheiser, threatened a warden with contempt if he wasn't released. But then the Missouri Supreme Court agreed to consider the case, temporarily halting his freedom.\n\nThen on Tuesday, the state's highest court issued a ruling stating that the St. Louis circuit attorney needed to confirm it had no plans to retry Dunn before he could be freed. Circuit Attorney Gabe Gore immediately filed a memorandum stating he would not seek a new trial, setting in motion the process toward Dunn's freedom.\n\nA statement from the Midwest Innocence Project said Dunn \"is coming home.\"\n\n\"We are thrilled that Chris will finally be reunited with his family after 34 years behind bars for a crime he did not commit,\" the statement read. \"We look forward to supporting Chris as he rebuilds his life.\"\n\nEarlier Tuesday, leaders of the Missouri NAACP and other organizations said that politics and racism were behind Bailey's effort to keep Dunn behind bars. State NAACP President Nimrod Chapel Jr. said at a news conference that Bailey \"superseded his jurisdiction and authority\" in appealing Sengheiser's ruling.\n\n\"What's happening now is another form of lynching,\" said another speaker, Zaki Baruti of the Universal African People's Organization.\n\nBailey's office, in an earlier statement, said the effort to keep Dunn in prison was warranted.\n\n\"Throughout the appeals process, multiple courts have affirmed Christopher Dunn's murder conviction,\" the statement read. \"We will always fight for the rule of law and to obtain justice for victims.\"\n\nDunn was convicted of first-degree murder in the 1990 shooting of 15-year-old Ricco Rogers. St. Louis Circuit Attorney Gabe Gore filed a motion in February seeking to vacate the guilty verdict. A hearing was in May.\n\nSengheiser wrote in his ruling that Gore \"made a clear and convincing showing of 'actual innocence' that undermines the basis for Dunn's convictions because in light of new evidence, no juror, acting reasonably, would have voted to find Dunn guilty of these crimes beyond a reasonable doubt.\"\n\nThe Missouri Attorney General's Office opposed the effort to vacate Dunn's conviction. Lawyers for the state said at the May hearing that initial testimony from two boys at the scene who identified Dunn as the shooter was correct, even though they later recanted as adults.\n\nRogers was shot May 18, 1990, when a gunman opened fire while he was with a group of other teenage boys outside a home. DeMorris Stepp, 14, and Michael Davis Jr., 12, both initially identified Dunn as the shooter.\n\nIn a recorded interview played at the hearing, Davis said he lied because he thought Dunn was affiliated with a rival gang.\n\nStepp's story has changed a few times over the years, Gore said at the hearing. Most recently he has said he did not see Dunn as the shooter. Gore said another judge previously found Stepp to be a \"completely unreliable witness\" and urged Sengheiser to discount him altogether.\n\nDunn has said he was at his mother's home at the time of the shooting. Childhood friend Nicole Bailey testified that she spoke with him by phone that night and he was on a phone at his mother's house.\n\nTristin Estep, the assistant attorney general, said that alibi could not be trusted and that Dunn's story has shifted multiple times over the years. Dunn did not testify at the hearing.\n\nA Missouri law adopted in 2021 lets prosecutors request hearings when they see evidence of a wrongful conviction. While Bailey's office is not required to oppose such efforts, he also opposed another effort in St. Louis that resulted in Lamar Johnson being freed last year after serving 28 years for a murder case in which a judge ruled he was wrongfully convicted.\n\nThe 2021 law has resulted in the release of two men who each spent decades in prison. In addition to Johnson, Kevin Strickland was freed in 2021 after more than 40 years for three killings in Kansas City after a judge ruled he was wrongfully convicted in 1979.\n\nAnother hearing is approaching for Marcellus Williams, who narrowly escaped lethal injection and is now facing another execution date.\n\nSt. Louis County's prosecutor believes DNA evidence shows that Williams didn't commit the crime that landed him on death row. DNA of someone else -- but not Williams -- was found on the knife used in the 1998 killing, experts said.\n\nA hearing on Williams' innocence claim begins Aug. 21. His execution is scheduled for Sept. 24.\n\nBailey's office is opposing the challenge to Williams' conviction, too.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

LOUIS (AP) - Leaders of the Missouri NAACP and other organizations said Tuesday that politics and racism are behind the state attorney general's effort to keep Christopher Dunn behind bars, more than a week after a judge overturned his murder conviction from 34 years ago.\n\nState NAACP President Nimrod Chapel Jr. said at a news conference that Republican Attorney General Andrew Bailey \"superseded his jurisdiction and authority\" in appealing Circuit Judge Jason Sengheiser's July 21 ruling. Sengheiser not only tossed out the decadesold conviction, citing evidence of \"actual innocence,\" but ordered the state to immediately release Dunn.\n\nBut when Bailey appealed, the Missouri Department of Corrections refused to release Dunn until the case played out. It is now in the hands of the Missouri Supreme Court. It's uncertain when the court will rule, or when Dunn, 52, will be freed.\n\nAnother speaker at the news conference, the Rev. Darryl Gray, accused Bailey of \"political posturing and political grandstanding\" ahead of the Aug. 6 Republican primary, where he faces opposition from Will Scharf, an attorney for former President Donald Trump.\n\nZaki Baruti of the Universal African People's Organization said the treatment of Dunn is driven by the fact that he is Black.\n\n\"What's happening now is another form of lynching,\" Baruti said.\n\nFILE - Christopher Dunn, right, listens to his attorney Justin Bonus from New York City during the first day of his hearing to decide whether to vacate his murder conviction, Tuesday, May 21, 2024, at the Carnahan Courthouse in St. Louis. A Missouri judge on Monday, July 24, 2024, overturned the conviction of Dunn, who has spent more than 30 years in prison for a killing he has long contended he didn't commit. (Laurie Skrivan/St. Louis Post-Dispatch via AP, Pool, File)\n\nBailey's office, in a statement, said the effort to keep Dunn in prison was warranted.\n\n\"Throughout the appeals process, multiple courts have affirmed Christopher Dunn\u00b4s murder conviction,\" the statement read. \"We will always fight for the rule of law and to obtain justice for victims.\"\n\nDunn was 18 in 1990 when 15-year-old Ricco Rogers was killed. Testimony from a 12-year-old and a 14-year-old at the scene of the shooting was key to convicting Dunn of first-degree murder. Both later recanted their testimony, saying they had been coerced by police and prosecutors.\n\nAt an evidentiary hearing in 2020, another judge agreed that a jury would likely find Dunn not guilty based on new evidence. But that judge, William Hickle, declined to exonerate Dunn, citing a 2016 Missouri Supreme Court ruling that only death row inmates - not those like Dunn, who was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole - could make a \"freestanding\" claim of actual innocence.\n\nA 2021 law now allows prosecutors to seek court hearings in cases with new evidence of a wrongful conviction. St. Louis Circuit Attorney Gabe Gore sought the hearing on behalf of Dunn and Sengheiser heard testimony in May.\n\nAnother case - a Black inmate - goes before another judge Aug. 21, with life-or-death consequences.\n\nMarcellus Williams is on death row for the stabbing death of a St. Louis County woman in 1998. His execution is scheduled for Sept. 24, unless his conviction is overturned. St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Wesley Bell requested the hearing. His motion said three experts determined that Williams\u00b4 DNA was not on the handle of the butcher knife used in the killing.\n\nBailey's office also will oppose overturning Williams' conviction.\n\nBut another inmate who Bailey sought to keep imprisoned after a conviction was overturned was white.\n\nSandra Hemme, 64, spent 43 years in prison for the fatal stabbing of a woman in St. Joseph in 1980. A judge on June 14 cited evidence of \"actual innocence\" and overturned her conviction. She had been the longest held wrongly incarcerated woman known in the U.S., according to the National Innocence Project, which worked to free Hemme.\n\nAppeals by Bailey - all the way up to the Missouri Supreme Court - kept Hemme imprisoned at the Chillicothe Correctional Center for several days, until a judge on July 19 ordered her immediate release and threatened Bailey with possible contempt of court charges. Hemme was released later that day.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAACP",

LOUIS (AP) -- Leaders of the Missouri NAACP and other organizations said Tuesday that politics and racism are behind the state attorney general's effort to keep Christopher Dunn behind bars, more than a week after a judge overturned his murder conviction from 34 years ago.\n\nState NAACP President Nimrod Chapel Jr. said at a news conference that Republican Attorney General Andrew Bailey \"superseded his jurisdiction and authority\" in appealing Circuit Judge Jason Sengheiser's July 21 ruling. Sengheiser not only tossed out the decadesold conviction, citing evidence of \"actual innocence,\" but ordered the state to immediately release Dunn.\n\nBut when Bailey appealed, the Missouri Department of Corrections refused to release Dunn until the case played out. It is now in the hands of the Missouri Supreme Court. It's uncertain when the court will rule, or when Dunn, 52, will be freed.\n\nAnother speaker at the news conference, the Rev. Darryl Gray, accused Bailey of \"political posturing and political grandstanding\" ahead of the Aug. 6 Republican primary, where he faces opposition from Will Scharf, an attorney for former President Donald Trump.\n\nZaki Baruti of the Universal African People's Organization said the treatment of Dunn is driven by the fact that he is Black.\n\n\"What's happening now is another form of lynching,\" Baruti said.\n\nBailey's office, in a statement, said the effort to keep Dunn in prison was warranted.\n\n\"Throughout the appeals process, multiple courts have affirmed Christopher Dunn's murder conviction,\" the statement read. \"We will always fight for the rule of law and to obtain justice for victims.\"\n\nDunn was 18 in 1990 when 15-year-old Ricco Rogers was killed. Testimony from a 12-year-old and a 14-year-old at the scene of the shooting was key to convicting Dunn of first-degree murder. Both later recanted their testimony, saying they had been coerced by police and prosecutors.\n\nAt an evidentiary hearing in 2020, another judge agreed that a jury would likely find Dunn not guilty based on new evidence. But that judge, William Hickle, declined to exonerate Dunn, citing a 2016 Missouri Supreme Court ruling that only death row inmates -- not those like Dunn, who was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole -- could make a \"freestanding\" claim of actual innocence.\n\nA 2021 law now allows prosecutors to seek court hearings in cases with new evidence of a wrongful conviction. St. Louis Circuit Attorney Gabe Gore sought the hearing on behalf of Dunn and Sengheiser heard testimony in May.\n\nAnother case -- a Black inmate -- goes before another judge Aug. 21, with life-or-death consequences.\n\nMarcellus Williams is on death row for the stabbing death of a St. Louis County woman in 1998. His execution is scheduled for Sept. 24, unless his conviction is overturned. St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Wesley Bell requested the hearing. His motion said three experts determined that Williams' DNA was not on the handle of the butcher knife used in the killing.\n\nBailey's office also will oppose overturning Williams' conviction.\n\nBut another inmate who Bailey sought to keep imprisoned after a conviction was overturned was white.\n\nSandra Hemme, 64, spent 43 years in prison for the fatal stabbing of a woman in St. Joseph in 1980. A judge on June 14 cited evidence of \"actual innocence\" and overturned her conviction. She had been the longest held wrongly incarcerated woman known in the U.S., according to the National Innocence Project, which worked to free Hemme.\n\nAppeals by Bailey -- all the way up to the Missouri Supreme Court -- kept Hemme imprisoned at the Chillicothe Correctional Center for several days, until a judge on July 19 ordered her immediate release and threatened Bailey with possible contempt of court charges. Hemme was released later that day.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Chapel and other Black leaders called for the release of Christopher Dunn, who remains imprisoned even after a judge overturned his 1991 murder conviction. (AP Photo/Jim Salter)ST. LOUIS (AP) - A Missouri man was freed from prison Tuesday after his murder conviction was overturned after 34 years behind bars, despite the state attorney general's efforts to keep him there. Christopher Dunn, 52, was driven by van from the state prison in Licking, Missouri, to St. Louis, about 140 miles (225 kilometers) away as his release was imminent. He was officially released from the St. Louis city jail Tuesday night. A St. Louis circuit judge overturned Dunn's murder conviction on July 22 and ordered his immediate release. But Dunn remained imprisoned amid a chaotic process that began when Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey appealed to try and keep Dunn locked up. Dunn's release marks the second time in recent weeks that a person was freed from prison despite Bailey's appeals to keep them in custody after a murder conviction was overturned. Sandra Hemme was freed July 19 from a western Missouri prison after serving 43 years for a murder that a judge deemed there was evidence of her \"actual innocence.\"\u009d Bailey's office also opposed Hemme's release while an appellate court reviewed the case. She walked out of the prison only after a judge threatened Bailey with contempt if she wasn't freed. Political scientists and some attorneys have said Bailey was taking the tough stance to shore up votes in advance of a contested Republican primary. He faces a challenge from Will Scharf, an attorney for former President Donald Trump, in the Aug. 6 primary. At one point last week, Dunn was minutes away from getting out of prison after the circuit judge, Jason Sengheiser, threatened a warden with contempt if he wasn't released. But then the Missouri Supreme Court agreed to consider the case, temporarily halting his freedom. Then on Tuesday, the state's highest court issued a ruling stating that the St. Louis circuit attorney needed to confirm it had no plans to retry Dunn before he could be freed. Circuit Attorney Gabe Gore immediately filed a memorandum stating he would not seek a new trial, setting in motion the process toward Dunn's freedom. A statement from the Midwest Innocence Project said Dunn \"is coming home.\"\u009d \"We are thrilled that Chris will finally be reunited with his family after 34 years behind bars for a crime he did not commit,\"\u009d the statement read. \"We look forward to supporting Chris as he rebuilds his life.\"\u009d Earlier Tuesday, leaders of the Missouri NAACP and other organizations said that politics and racism were behind Bailey's effort to keep Dunn behind bars. State NAACP President Nimrod Chapel Jr. said at a news conference that Bailey \"superseded his jurisdiction and authority\"\u009d in appealing Sengheiser's ruling. \"What's happening now is another form of lynching,\"\u009d said another speaker, Zaki Baruti of the Universal African People's Organization. Bailey's office, in an earlier statement, said the effort to keep Dunn in prison was warranted. \"Throughout the appeals process, multiple courts have affirmed Christopher Dunn's murder conviction,\"\u009d the statement read. \"We will always fight for the rule of law and to obtain justice for victims.\"\u009d Dunn was convicted of first-degree murder in the 1990 shooting of 15-year-old Ricco Rogers. St. Louis Circuit Attorney Gabe Gore filed a motion in February seeking to vacate the guilty verdict. A hearing was in May. Sengheiser wrote in his ruling that Gore \"made a clear and convincing showing of \"~actual innocence' that undermines the basis for Dunn's convictions because in light of new evidence, no juror, acting reasonably, would have voted to find Dunn guilty of these crimes beyond a reasonable doubt.\"\u009d The Missouri Attorney General's Office opposed the effort to vacate Dunn's conviction. Lawyers for the state said at the May hearing that initial testimony from two boys at the scene who identified Dunn as the shooter was correct, even though they later recanted as adults. Rogers was shot May 18, 1990, when a gunman opened fire while he was with a group of other teenage boys outside a home. DeMorris Stepp, 14, and Michael Davis Jr., 12, both initially identified Dunn as the shooter. In a recorded interview played at the hearing, Davis said he lied because he thought Dunn was affiliated with a rival gang. Stepp's story has changed a few times over the years, Gore said at the hearing. Most recently he has said he did not see Dunn as the shooter. Gore said another judge previously found Stepp to be a \"completely unreliable witness\"\u009d and urged Sengheiser to discount him altogether. Dunn has said he was at his mother's home at the time of the shooting. Childhood friend Nicole Bailey testified that she spoke with him by phone that night and he was on a phone at his mother's house. Tristin Estep, the assistant attorney general, said that alibi could not be trusted and that Dunn's story has shifted multiple times over the years. Dunn did not testify at the hearing. A Missouri law adopted in 2021 lets prosecutors request hearings when they see evidence of a wrongful conviction. While Bailey's office is not required to oppose such efforts, he also opposed another effort in St. Louis that resulted in Lamar Johnson being freed last year after serving 28 years for a murder case in which a judge ruled he was wrongfully convicted. The 2021 law has resulted in the release of two men who each spent decades in prison. In addition to Johnson, Kevin Strickland was freed in 2021 after more than 40 years for three killings in Kansas City after a judge ruled he was wrongfully convicted in 1979. Another hearing is approaching for Marcellus Williams, who narrowly escaped lethal injection and is now facing another execution date. St. Louis County's prosecutor believes DNA evidence shows that Williams didn't commit the crime that landed him on death row. DNA of someone else - but not Williams - was found on the knife used in the 1998 killing, experts said. A hearing on Williams' innocence claim begins Aug. 21. His execution is scheduled for Sept. 24. Bailey's office is opposing the challenge to Williams' conviction, too.", "source": {"uri": "medicinehatnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Medicine Hat News"}, "authors": [{"uri":

After spending 33 years in a Missouri prison, Dunn was scheduled to be released Wednesday evening after a St. Louis Circuit judge found there to be insufficient evidence to hold Dunn further, according to USA Today.\n\nWhen Judge Jason Sengheiser announced his decision, Dunn's family including his mother, Martha Dunn; wife, Kira Dunn; and 19-year-old son Sequoia Dunn sat in the courtroom eager to bring Dunn home after years of his incarceration, reported NBC .\n\nThe judge ordered his immediate released saying \"in light of the new evidence, no juror, acting reasonably, would have voted to find Dunn guilty of these crimes beyond a reasonable doubt.\" It wasn't until two days after the judge's ruling that Kira was permitted to pick up her husband from prison, according to NPR.\n\nKira told NPR her husband was dressed in civilian clothes when he was ordered to return back to his cell Wednesday night. \"The sheer and pointless cruelty is mind boggling,\" she said. \"If you know a little about the story, you know we've had a lot of disappointments where we thought we'd finally get his freedom, and it was snatched away,\" she continued.\n\nThe Midwest Innocence Project, an organization working to help free Dunn announced on X, \"Chris' legal team hoped and expected him to be released this evening. But at the Attorney General's request, and less than an hour before Chris' scheduled release, the Missouri Supreme Court stayed the order to release Chris, and requested additional briefing.\"\n\nCorrections Department spokesperson Karen Pojmann told AP News that Dunn was in the middle of signing his release papers when news of the immediate stay took affect. The cause of the stay was Republican Attorney General Andrew Bailey. He had been fighting against Dunn's release, and directly following Judge Sengheiser's ruling, Bailey filed an appeal.\n\nDunn's case marks the second time Bailey has appealed the immediate release of a person whose murder conviction was overturned. Last month, 64-year-old Sandra Hemme had her 1980 murder conviction overturned only for Bailey to appeal her release, according to NBC. Hemme spent 43 years behind bars until a judge ruled her innocent in June.\n\nDespite the ruling, Bailey fought to keep Hemme imprisoned. NBC reported Bailey's appeal kept her locked up for several more weeks until a judge threatened to hold Bailey's office in contempt for continuing to fight against her release. Hemme was released to her family on July 19.\n\nDunn was only 18 years old when he was accused of shooting and killing 15-year-old Rogers, according to NBC. He was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. His first-degree murder conviction relied on two witness statements. The witnesses were 12 and 14 years old at the time. They have since recanted their statements saying they were coerced by police.\n\nDuring a 2020 evidentiary hearing, Judge William Hickle agreed that a jury would not find Dunn guilty with updated evidence, but he declined to set Dunn free, citing a 2016 ruling only allowing death row inmates to make an innocent claim.\n\nDespite two separate judges finding Dunn innocent, his case could be dragged out until next week when Judge Sengheiser and Bailey both have to prove their rebuttals. Dunn's attorney, Justin Bonus, called his client's case \"a travesty of justice,\" to NBC as he continues to sit in a prison cell with an overturned conviction.\n\nMissouri is also set to execute Marcellus Williams in Sept., according to the New York Times. A hearing to appeal Williams' case is scheduled for Aug. 21, and once again, Bailey's office is challenging his case.", "source": {"uri": "theroot.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Root"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPR", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NPR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reasonable_doubt", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reasonable doubt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imprisonment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Imprisonment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Today", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "USA Today"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "St. Louis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_Missouri", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of Missouri"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innocence_Project", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Innocence Project"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney_General", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney General"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Felicia_Gayle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Murder of Felicia Gayle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preliminary_hearing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Preliminary hearing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_row", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Death row"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_imprisonment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Life imprisonment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fill,h_675,pg_1,q_80,w_1200/c1ad6f55cc1328ff64bfc56a4d916dbd.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9770150", "eventUri": "eng-9770150", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-19", "textStart": 2598, "textEnd": 2605}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-21", "textStart": 3699, "textEnd": 3706}], "sentiment": -0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 223, "relevance": 1}

A Missouri judge on Monday, July 24, 2024, overturned the conviction of Dunn, who has spent more than 30 years in prison for a killing he has long contended he didn't commit.\n\nBy JIM SALTER - Associated Press\n\nST. LOUIS (AP) -- Leaders of the Missouri NAACP and other organizations said Tuesday that politics and racism are behind the state attorney general's effort to keep Christopher Dunn behind bars, more than a week after a judge overturned his murder conviction from 34 years ago.\n\nState NAACP President Nimrod Chapel Jr. said at a news conference that Republican Attorney General Andrew Bailey \"superseded his jurisdiction and authority\" in appealing Circuit Judge Jason Sengheiser's July 21 ruling. Sengheiser not only tossed out the decadesold conviction, citing evidence of \"actual innocence,\" but ordered the state to immediately release Dunn.\n\nBut when Bailey appealed, the Missouri Department of Corrections refused to release Dunn until the case played out. It is now in the hands of the Missouri Supreme Court. It's uncertain when the court will rule, or when Dunn, 52, will be freed.\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nWho's Donald Trump's pick for Missouri governor? He's got three.

Is trade only 1? Woman from Valley Park drowns in Big River trying to help another canoeist\n\nAnother speaker at the news conference, the Rev. Darryl Gray, accused Bailey of \"political posturing and political grandstanding\" ahead of the Aug. 6 Republican primary, where he faces opposition from Will Scharf, an attorney for former President Donald Trump.\n\nZaki Baruti of the Universal African People's Organization said the treatment of Dunn is driven by the fact that he is Black.\n\n\"What's happening now is another form of lynching,\" Baruti said.\n\nBailey's office, in a statement, said the effort to keep Dunn in prison was warranted.\n\n\"Throughout the appeals process, multiple courts have affirmed Christopher Dunn's murder conviction,\" the statement read. \"We will always fight for the rule of law and to obtain justice for victims.\"\n\nDunn was 18 in 1990 when 15-year-old Ricco Rogers was killed. Testimony from a 12-year-old and a 14-year-old at the scene of the shooting was key to convicting Dunn of first-degree murder. Both later recanted their testimony, saying they had been coerced by police and prosecutors.\n\nAt an evidentiary hearing in 2020, another judge agreed that a jury would likely find Dunn not guilty based on new evidence. But that judge, William Hickle, declined to exonerate Dunn, citing a 2016 Missouri Supreme Court ruling that only death row inmates -- not those like Dunn, who was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole -- could make a \"freestanding\" claim of actual innocence.\n\nA 2021 law now allows prosecutors to seek court hearings in cases with new evidence of a wrongful conviction. St. Louis Circuit Attorney Gabe Gore sought the hearing on behalf of Dunn and Sengheiser heard testimony in May.\n\nAnother case -- a Black inmate -- goes before another judge Aug. 21, with life-or-death consequences.\n\nMarcellus Williams is on death row for the stabbing death of a St. Louis County woman in 1998. His execution is scheduled for Sept. 24, unless his conviction is overturned. St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Wesley Bell requested the hearing. His motion said three experts determined that Williams' DNA was not on the handle of the butcher knife used in the killing.\n\nBailey's office also will oppose overturning Williams' conviction.\n\nBut another inmate who Bailey sought to keep imprisoned after a conviction was overturned was white.\n\nSandra Hemme, 64, spent 43 years in prison for the fatal stabbing of a woman in St. Joseph in 1980. A judge on June 14 cited evidence of \"actual innocence\" and overturned her conviction. She had been the longest held wrongly incarcerated woman known in the U.S., according to the National Innocence Project, which worked to free Hemme.\n\nAppeals by Bailey -- all the way up to the Missouri Supreme Court -- kept Hemme imprisoned at the Chillicothe Correctional Center for several days, until a judge on July 19 ordered her immediate release and threatened Bailey with possible contempt of court charges. Hemme was released later that day.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

But Missouri Department of Corrections spokesperson Karen Pojmann said Dunn was being taken by van to St. Louis, pending further orders from the court.\n\nA statement from the Midwest Innocence Project said Dunn \"is coming home.\"\n\n\"We are thrilled that Chris will finally be reunited with his family after 34 years behind bars for a crime he did not commit,\" the statement read. \"We look forward to supporting Chris as he rebuilds his life.\"\n\nDunn's wife, Kira Dunn, was more cautious.\n\n\"Seeing is believing,\" she said. \"I'm not a Missourian, but I feel like one. I'm like, show me, show me, show me.\"\n\nBailey's office didn't immediately respond to a message seeking comment.\n\nEarlier Tuesday, leaders of the Missouri NAACP and other organizations said that politics and racism were behind Bailey's effort to keep Dunn behind bars. State NAACP President Nimrod Chapel Jr. said at a news conference that Bailey \"superseded his jurisdiction and authority\" in appealing Sengheiser's ruling.\n\n\"What's happening now is another form of lynching,\" said another speaker, Zaki Baruti of the Universal African People's Organization.\n\nBailey's office, in an earlier statement, said the effort to keep Dunn in prison was warranted.\n\n\"Throughout the appeals process, multiple courts have affirmed Christopher Dunn's murder conviction,\" the statement read. \"We will always fight for the rule of law and to obtain justice for victims.\"\n\nDunn was 18 in 1990 when 15-year-old Ricco Rogers was killed. Testimony from a 12-year-old and a 14-year-old at the scene of the shooting was key to convicting Dunn of first-degree murder. Both later recanted their testimony, saying they had been coerced by police and prosecutors.\n\nAt an evidentiary hearing in 2020, another judge agreed that a jury would likely find Dunn not guilty based on new evidence. But that judge, William Hickle, declined to exonerate Dunn, citing a 2016 Missouri Supreme Court ruling that only death row inmates -- not those like Dunn, who was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole -- could make a \"freestanding\" claim of actual innocence.\n\nA 2021 law now allows prosecutors to seek court hearings in cases with new evidence of a wrongful conviction. St. Louis Circuit Attorney Gabe Gore sought the hearing on behalf of Dunn and Sengheiser heard testimony in May.\n\nAnother case involving a Black inmate goes before another judge Aug. 21, with life-or-death consequences.\n\nMarcellus Williams is on death row for the stabbing death of a St. Louis County woman in 1998. His execution is scheduled for Sept. 24, unless his conviction is overturned. St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Wesley Bell requested the hearing. His motion said three experts determined that Williams' DNA was not on the handle of the butcher knife used in the killing.\n\nBailey's office also will oppose overturning Williams' conviction.\n\nBut another inmate who Bailey sought to keep imprisoned after a conviction was overturned was white.\n\nSandra Hemme, 64, spent 43 years in prison for the fatal stabbing of a woman in St. Joseph in 1980. A judge on June 14 cited evidence of \"actual innocence\" and overturned her conviction. She had been the longest held wrongly incarcerated woman known in the U.S., according to the National Innocence Project, which worked to free Hemme.\n\nAppeals by Bailey -- all the way up to the Missouri Supreme Court -- kept Hemme imprisoned at the Chillicothe Correctional Center for several days, until a judge on July 19 ordered her immediate release and threatened Bailey with possible contempt of court charges. Hemme was released later that day.\n\nHollingsworth reported from Mission, Kansas.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

LOUIS (AP) -- Leaders of the Missouri NAACP and other organizations said Tuesday that politics and racism are behind the state attorney general's effort to keep Christopher Dunn behind bars, more than a week after a judge overturned his murder conviction from 34 years ago.\n\nState NAACP President Nimrod Chapel Jr. said at a news conference that Republican Attorney General Andrew Bailey \"superseded his jurisdiction and authority\" in appealing Circuit Judge Jason Sengheiser's July 21 ruling. Sengheiser not only tossed out the decadesold conviction, citing evidence of \"actual innocence,\" but ordered the state to immediately release Dunn.\n\nBut when Bailey appealed, the Missouri Department of Corrections refused to release Dunn until the case played out. It is now in the hands of the Missouri Supreme Court. It's uncertain when the court will rule, or when Dunn, 52, will be freed.\n\nAnother speaker at the news conference, the Rev. Darryl Gray, accused Bailey of \"political posturing and political grandstanding\" ahead of the Aug. 6 Republican primary, where he faces opposition from Will Scharf, an attorney for former President Donald Trump.\n\nZaki Baruti of the Universal African People's Organization said the treatment of Dunn is driven by the fact that he is Black.\n\n\"What's happening now is another form of lynching,\" Baruti said.\n\nBailey's office, in a statement, said the effort to keep Dunn in prison was warranted.\n\n\"Throughout the appeals process, multiple courts have affirmed Christopher Dunn's murder conviction,\" the statement read. \"We will always fight for the rule of law and to obtain justice for victims.\"\n\nDunn was 18 in 1990 when 15-year-old Ricco Rogers was killed.

LOUIS (AP) -- A Missouri man was freed from prison Tuesday after his murder conviction was overturned after 34 years behind bars, despite the state attorney general's efforts to keep him there.\n\nChristopher Dunn, 52, was driven by van from the state prison in Licking, Missouri, to St. Louis, about 140 miles (225 kilometers) away as his release was imminent. He was officially released from the St. Louis city jail Tuesday night.\n\n\u00d7\n\nAlready a Subscriber? Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nA St. Louis circuit judge overturned Dunn's murder conviction on July 22 and ordered his immediate release. But Dunn remained imprisoned amid a chaotic process that began when Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey appealed to try and keep Dunn locked up.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nDunn's release marks the second time in recent weeks that a person was freed from prison despite Bailey's appeals to keep them in custody after a murder conviction was overturned.\n\nSandra Hemme was freed July 19 from a western Missouri prison after serving 43 years for a murder that a judge deemed there was evidence of her \"actual innocence.\" Bailey's office also opposed Hemme's release while an appellate court reviewed the case. She walked out of the prison only after a judge threatened Bailey with contempt if she wasn't freed.\n\nPolitical scientists and some attorneys have said Bailey was taking the tough stance to shore up votes in advance of a contested Republican primary.

Lawyers for the state said at the May hearing that initial testimony from two boys at the scene who identified Dunn as the shooter was correct, even though they later recanted as adults.\n\nRogers was shot May 18, 1990, when a gunman opened fire while he was with a group of other teenage boys outside a home. DeMorris Stepp, 14, and Michael Davis Jr., 12, both initially identified Dunn as the shooter.\n\nIn a recorded interview played at the hearing, Davis said he lied because he thought Dunn was affiliated with a rival gang.\n\nStepp's story has changed a few times over the years, Gore said at the hearing. Most recently he has said he did not see Dunn as the shooter. Gore said another judge previously found Stepp to be a \"completely unreliable witness\" and urged Sengheiser to discount him altogether.\n\nDunn has said he was at his mother's home at the time of the shooting. Childhood friend Nicole Bailey testified that she spoke with him by phone that night and he was on a phone at his mother's house.\n\nTristin Estep, the assistant attorney general, said that alibi could not be trusted and that Dunn's story has shifted multiple times over the years. Dunn did not testify at the hearing.\n\nA Missouri law adopted in 2021 lets prosecutors request hearings when they see evidence of a wrongful conviction. While Bailey's office is not required to oppose such efforts, he also opposed another effort in St. Louis that resulted in Lamar Johnson being freed last year after serving 28 years for a murder case in which a judge ruled he was wrongfully convicted.\n\nThe 2021 law has resulted in the release of two men who each spent decades in prison. In addition to Johnson, Kevin Strickland was freed in 2021 after more than 40 years for three killings in Kansas City after a judge ruled he was wrongfully convicted in 1979.\n\nAnother hearing is approaching for Marcellus Williams, who narrowly escaped lethal injection and is now facing another execution date.\n\nSt. Louis County's prosecutor believes DNA evidence shows that Williams didn't commit the crime that landed him on death row. DNA of someone else -- but not Williams -- was found on the knife used in the 1998 killing, experts said.\n\nA hearing on Williams' innocence claim begins Aug. 21. His execution is scheduled for Sept. 24.\n\nBailey's office is opposing the challenge to Williams' conviction, too.\n\nJim Salter And Heather Hollingsworth, The Associated Press", "source": {"uri":

Dunn was convicted in 1990 for the shooting death of 14-year-old Ricco Rogers, based solely on the testimony of two young boys who later recanted, claiming they were coerced by police.\n\nDunn's attorney, Justin Bonus, expressed outrage at the state's actions, stating, \"Christopher Dunn has been found innocent by two separate judges after both judges hearing the evidence before them. He remains in prison, an innocent man, with his conviction overturned. This is a travesty of justice.\"\n\nHe added: \"The AG should not be fighting Judge Sengheiser's decision. Their job is not to fight to uphold convictions, but to seek justice. That is not what is happening here.\"\n\nThe heartbreak of the situation was palpable as Dunn's family, including his wife Kira Dunn, awaited his release. At one point, Dunn was reportedly outside the prison, waiting to be picked up by his wife. However, their hopes were slashed when the Missouri Supreme Court ruled against his release while he was signing paperwork for his freedom.\n\n\"If you know a little about the story, you know we've had a lot of disappointments where we thought we'd finally get his freedom and it was snatched away,\" Kira Dunn told the Associated Press. \"So we were just bracing ourselves.\"\n\nThe Missouri Supreme Court's decision to keep Dunn incarcerated stems from a 2016 ruling that only death row inmates could make a \"freestanding\" claim of actual innocence. Despite new state laws enacted in 2021 allowing prosecutors to seek hearings for potentially wrongfully convicted individuals, Christopher Dunn remains in prison due to AG Bailey's appeal against his release.\n\nBailey, appointed by the governor in 2023, has a controversial history of resisting court orders for the release of inmates whose convictions have been overturned. In a previous case, he ignored a judge's ruling to release Sandra Hemme, a 64-year-old woman who spent 43 years in prison for a murder she did not commit. It was only after a judge threatened him with contempt of court that she was freed.\n\nIn Dunn's case, the Missouri Supreme Court's siding with Bailey has been met with widespread condemnation. \"We are devastated and so confused as to why the Missouri Supreme Court entertained the Attorney General's improper intrusion into a matter already settled by a judge. Chris was literally a few steps away from freedom when the call came,\" Kira Dunn said. \"This is unimaginably cruel treatment of a proven innocent person. It is torture. It is pointless. It is a perversion of what justice should be in Missouri.\"\n\nThe case has sparked national outrage and brought attention to the ongoing struggle for justice within the American legal system, particularly for people of color. As the legal battle continues, the hope for Dunn's release remains ongoing.", "source": {"uri": "atlantadailyworld.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Atlanta Daily World"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Dunn_(American_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Christopher Dunn (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_Missouri", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of Missouri"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney_General", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney General"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Bailey_(politician)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Bailey (politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miscarriage_of_justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miscarriage of justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_imprisonment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Life imprisonment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuit_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Circuit court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "St. Louis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_row", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Death row"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contempt_of_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Contempt of court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Governor (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torture", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Torture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Law of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prisons", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prisons", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 48}], "image": "https://atlantadailyworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-07-29-at-9.25.31-AM.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9770150", "eventUri": "eng-9770150", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 208, "relevance": 1}

That meant he couldn't be released from prison until St. Louis Circuit Attorney Gabe Gore's office, which fought to overturn Dunn's conviction, dismissed the underlying charges.\n\nGore's office dismissed Dunn's charges roughly 90 minutes after the Supreme Court's order on Tuesday was filed, according to spokesperson Christine Bertelson.\n\nThat dismissal means \"Chris' nightmare comes to an end,\" the Midwest Innocence Project said in a statement. \"He is coming home.\"\n\nTuesday's Supreme Court decision came roughly a week after Judge Jason Sengheiser found Dunn actually innocent in the 1990 killing of 15-year-old Ricco Rogers. The state's two key witnesses had recanted their testimony.\n\nMissouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey appealed and ordered Dunn to remain in prison pending an appeal of his conviction.\n\nTwo days later, Gore's office called an emergency hearing and Sengheiser ordered Dunn released immediately.\n\nBailey's office then filed with the Missouri Supreme Court to again stop his release. That temporary stay was granted, and Dunn has remained in prison since.\n\nIn subsequent filings, Bailey's office argued that Dunn should remain in prison pending their appeal and that Bailey's office should have the ultimate say in whether his underlying charges should remain.\n\nBut lawyers for Dunn argued in filings that the Circuit Attorney's Office was in charge of such questions and that he should be released because he was no longer convicted of a crime. They also said Bailey's office had no right to appeal.\n\nThe Supreme Court did not rule on whether Bailey's office has a right to appeal in such innocence cases.\n\nMembers of the Missouri NAACP and other racial and legal justice organizations gathered outside of the Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey's downtown St. Louis office on Tuesday to criticize his opposition to Dunn's release.\n\n\"Christopher Dunn needs to go home today,\" said Missouri NAACP president Nimrod Chapel during a press conference.\n\n0 Comments", "source": {"uri": "stltoday.com", "dataType": "news",

His wife, Kira Dunn, stood next to him.\n\nDunn didn't say a word at first and stood silent for a few seconds. Asked by reporters how he felt to be out of prison, he said simply \"surreal.\"\n\nWith a smile on his face, Dunn then added: \"Thank you, St. Louis, we did it. But it shouldn't have taken so long. Not 34 years. There's not enough words in the dictionary to describe this day right here.\"\n\nHe told reporters that he never gave up because his family never gave up. He thanked Gore for putting his life and career on the line for him, as well as his legal team at the Midwest Innocence Project and other attorneys who assisted from New York.\n\n\"It's easy to give up in prison when you lose hope,\" Dunn said. \"But when the system choose[s] to throw you away, you have to ask yourself if you're willing to just settle for it or you're going to fight for it. I come from a strong family. I don't know not how to fight. This is what we have done for the majority of our lives.\n\n\"And whether you want to believe it or not, everyone that's in prison, there's a chance for everyone. The thing is though, you can't give up.\n\n\"Let their stories be heard,\" he said. \"Don't give up on them. Give them a chance.\"\n\nDunn then gave his mother, Martha Dunn, a long embrace before leaving the courthouse.\n\nDunn's release came hours after the Missouri Supreme Court lifted an emergency order it issued last week that delayed a St. Louis judge's order that Dunn be released from the South Central Correctional Center in Licking on a request from Attorney General Andrew Bailey.\n\nIn their opinion, Supreme Court judges wrote that Bailey does not have the authority to hold an inmate in prison. They also wrote that for Dunn to be released, the circuit attorney had to follow proper procedure and drop the charges.\n\nDunn was transported from a state prison in Licking to the St. Louis City Circuit Court in downtown St. Louis' Carnahan Courthouse late Tuesday afternoon.\n\nLast week, St. Louis Circuit Judge Jason Sengheiser overturned Dunn's conviction in the 1990 murder of 15-year-old Ricco Rogers in the city's Wells-Goodfellow neighborhood.\n\nBailey similarly fought against the release of Sandra Hemme, who spent 43 years in prison for the fatal stabbing of a St. Joseph, Mo., woman in 1980. The judge in that case cited evidence of \"actual innocence\" on June 14 and ordered her release. Bailey's appeals all the way to the Missouri Supreme Court kept her imprisoned at the Chillicothe Correctional Center until July 19.\n\nTricia Rojo Bushnell, executive director at the Midwest Innocence Project, said Dunn's lawyers are thrilled that he is reunited with his family after serving so much time for a crime he didn't commit.\n\n\"We look forward to supporting Chris as he rebuilds his life,\" Bushnell said. \"But our joy in welcoming Chris home is tempered by the additional days and moments stolen from him by this week's proceedings. We are grateful for the outpouring of support from all corners of the country over the past few days. As we all observed, that was not justice.\"", "source": {"uri": "stlpr.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "STLPR"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "St. Louis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunn_County,_Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dunn County, Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dunn County, Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Gore", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Al Gore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courthouse", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Courthouse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnahan_Courthouse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carnahan Courthouse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downtown_St._Louis", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Downtown St. Louis"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Central_Correctional_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "South Central Correctional Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_Missouri", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of Missouri"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innocence_Project", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Innocence Project"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuit_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Circuit court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Licking_County,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Licking County, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Licking County, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chillicothe_Correctional_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chillicothe Correctional Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actual_innocence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Actual innocence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Joseph,_Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "St. Joseph, Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "St. Joseph, Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney_General", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney General"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "District attorney"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/064df4c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4050x2126+0+65/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F4c%2Fcd%2Ff7eebdb8470aa1a8e8d3d7f62439%2F073024-sp-christopherdunnfreesocial-02.JPG", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9770150", "eventUri": "eng-9770150", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-30", "textStart": 21, "textEnd": 28}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-14", "textStart": 2839, "textEnd": 2846}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-19", "textStart": 2996, "textEnd": 3003}], "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

Dunn, who was 18 at the time of his arrest and has always maintained his innocence, was convicted mainly on the testimony of two teenage witnesses who, according to NBC, later recanted their testimony and said they had been coerced by prosecutors. There was no physical evidence linking Dunn to the crime, and his mother and sister testified he was home with them at the time of the killing, watching television.\n\nA St. Louis Circuit Court judge overturned Dunn's conviction earlier this week after Dunn's attorney filed a motion to vacate his guilty verdict in February. The Midwest Innocence Project reports that Judge Jason Sengheiser found that Dunn's lawyer \"made a clear and convincing showing of 'actual innocence' that undermines the basis for Dunn's convictions,\" and ordered the state to \"immediately discharge Christopher Dunn from its custody,\" according to NPR.\n\nBut instead of releasing Dunn at 6 p.m. Wednesday as ordered by the court, AG Bailey filed an emergency motion for a stay, which the state Supreme Court sustained. According to NBC, the judge now has until 5 p.m. Friday to file arguments opposing the stay, and Bailey has until 5 p.m. Monday to reply.\n\nWhat's even more baffling is that just last month, Bailey fought to keep another innocent person whose conviction was overturned from being released. Sandra Hemme, who was convicted of killing Patricia Jeschke in 1980, had her conviction overturned last month, also on evidence of \"actual innocence,\" according to KCUR, and Bailey appealed that ruling, and even after losing, prohibited the prison from releasing her.\n\nOnly after the judge who ordered Hemme's release threatened Bailey with contempt of court did he allow her release, KCUR reports. Hemme, now 64, spent 43 years in prison for a crime she didn't commit,\n\nInstead of apologizing to two innocent people who, between them, spent 76 years in prison for crimes they didn't commit and releasing them as quickly as possible in contrition, an obsessed attorney general seeks to continue to subject them to the decades of injustice they've already suffered, like a modern-day Javert.", "source": {"uri": "scheerpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "scheerpost.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney_General", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney General"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_imprisonment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Life imprisonment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defendant", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Defendant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_to_vacate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Motion to vacate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actual_innocence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Actual innocence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_California", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innocence_Project", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Innocence Project"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_discharge", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Military discharge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPR", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NPR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuit_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Circuit court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "St. Louis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javert", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Javert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contempt_of_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Contempt of court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attorney_general", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Attorney general"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 66}], "image": "https://i0.wp.com/scheerpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-07-26-at-10.38.32\u202fPM-1.png?resize=1200%2C1104&ssl=1&w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9770150", "eventUri": "eng-9770150", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "1990-05-", "textStart": 271, "textEnd": 279}], "sentiment": -0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

What could go wrong?", "body": "Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey is determined to win his election campaign this year no matter how many innocent people he has to keep in prison to do it.\n\nThat's the only rational explanation for the extraordinary lengths Bailey's office has gone to in fighting the release of inmates whose guilt is in serious doubt -- or who have even been formally exonerated by courts.\n\nIn at least two recent cases, those lengths have included prodding corrections officials to ignore court orders telling them to release prisoners.\n\nThe case of inmate Christopher Dunn last week should by this point come as no surprise to anyone who has watched Bailey's performance since being appointed as attorney general last year to fill a vacancy.\n\nAs we have charted in our on-going \"Bailey Tally,\" he has abused the authority of that office in unprecedented and often shocking ways in his efforts to appeal to Republican voters as he seeks election to a full term. Acting outside the legitimate authority of his office is a consistent theme.\n\nSt. Louis Public Schools superintendent Keisha Scarlett is out, replaced with interim chief Ranch in Wildwood is sanctuary for abused miniature horses Woman from Valley Park drowns in Big River trying to help another canoeist Inside the ouster: Why the St. Louis Public Schools leader was pushed out after 1 year Kohn's Kosher Deli facing lawsuit of nearly $150,000 Messenger: He fixed up his mobile home.

Librarians say Francis Howell proposals could remove popular books\n\nDunn, 52, has spent 33 years in prison for the 1990 shooting death of 15-year-old Ricco Rogers, when Dunn was 18. His conviction hinged on the testimony of two young boys who later, as adults, recanted, saying they'd been coerced by police.\n\nOn Monday, St. Louis Circuit Judge Jason Sengheiser concluded after an almost two-month review that based on the current evidence, there is \"a clear and convincing showing of 'actual innocence'\" and that \"no juror, acting reasonably, would have voted to find Dunn guilty of these crimes beyond a reasonable doubt.\" Sengheiser ordered Dunn released immediately.\n\nNot only did Bailey's office file an appeal of that ruling, but it contacted the Department of Corrections to advise (read: intimidate) them to keep Dunn locked up despite the court's order that he be released immediately.\n\nSt. Louis Circuit Attorney Gabe Gore has been among those working for Dunn's release. In a motion Wednesday, Gore said Bailey's office had \"advised\" the Department of Corrections not to release Dunn. When Gore's office told them that ignoring a court order was improper, they \"responded that the Attorney General's Office is legal counsel to the DOC and the DOC would be following the advice of counsel.\"\n\nAs a result, corrections officials kept Dunn incarcerated for two more days. Only after Sengheiser on Wednesday threatened the warden of the South Central Correctional Center with contempt did the prison finally start the process of releasing him.\n\nBut later Wednesday, the Missouri Supreme Court, acting on Bailey's appeal, suspended Dunn's release in order to let the appeal play out.\n\nThe result was a scene that sounds like dystopian fiction: Dunn was literally in the process of filling out the paperwork to be released from the prison, with his wife on her way to pick him up, when the suspension of his release arrived -- and he was led back in to be re-incarcerated.\n\nProsecutors can appeal exonerations, and the state Supreme Court has the authority to pause an inmate's release pending such appeal. But for a prosecutor's office to tell corrections officials to ignore a court order is an outrageous violation of the legal process. It's the very definition of contempt of court, for which people can be jailed.\n\nAnd it's not the first time Bailey has done it. Sandra Hemme, 64, spent 43 years in prison before her murder conviction was overturned in June -- then spent another month incarcerated as Bailey's office launched an ultimately fruitless fight to keep her locked up.\n\nAs in the Dunn case, the judge in the Hemme case had to threaten a contempt ruling to finally get the prison to obey his release order. That judge, Ryan Horsman, scolded Bailey's office for calling the Chillicothe Correctional Center and telling officials there to ignore his order releasing Hemme.\n\nThere's nothing in law or common sense requiring Bailey to jump into those cases, second-guessing local prosecutors and judges who are presumably more familiar with the facts than his office is. Yet Bailey's office has repeatedly done just that, using the court system to oppose the righting of these wrongs.\n\nIn addition to the Dunn and Hemme cases, Bailey opposed the review of Lamar Johnson's murder conviction, which was ultimately overturned. Bailey is currently opposing a challenge to the murder conviction of Marcellus Williams, who is scheduled to be executed in September.\n\nDunn, Johnson and Williams are Black.\n\nBailey has also inserted his office into the case of a white Kansas City police officer convicted of manslaughter for the shooting death of an unarmed Black man in the man's own driveway -- but in a very different way. Local prosecutors were stunned when Bailey, for all his tough-on-crime rhetoric, swooped in and sought to overturn the officer's conviction.\n\nAs Missouri's lawyer, Bailey is supposed to act in the best interests of the state's residents and of justice. As he has repeatedly demonstrated in these and other cases, he has little interest in either, flagrantly abusing his authority in order to pursue his own extremist ideological agenda and political ambition. It's imperative that the voters this year remove this uniquely unfit public official from this crucial office.\n\n0 Comments", "source": {"uri": "stltoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "St. Louis

LOUIS - Family members stood along the sidewalk in front of the Carnahan Courthouse in downtown St. Louis Tuesday night and cheered when Christopher Dunn walked outside, taking some of his first steps of freedom following a wrongful murder conviction.\n\n\"I feel like I just want to get up and holler,\" his mother, Martha Dunn, said. \"That's how I feel.\"\n\nDunn was released after prosecutors fought to free him. He gives credit to St. Louis Circuit Attorney Gabe Gore, the Midwest Innocence Project, his family, and his attorney for his freedom.\n\n\"It shouldn't have been this long,\" Dunn said. \"Nor should have it taken this long for everyone to come forward now.\"\n\nWhen asked what he missed out on due to his wrongful conviction, Dunn mentioned he lost his youth and suffered health problems in prison but added that's not what he wants to focus on.\n\nShooting, attack survivor fights back\n\n\"If I hold on to the negativity, if I keep on holding on to the past, I would never be able to move forward,\" he said. \"So, for those that participated in my prosecution, I forgive you. I'm not going to forget, but I do forgive you.\"\n\nDunn was just feet from freedom a few days ago after a judge ordered his release. His release was halted when the Missouri Attorney General's Office argued against his release.\n\n\"It was torture,\" Dunn said. \"I mean, it's something you shouldn't have to put anyone through.\"\n\nDunn said one of the first things he's looking forward to doing is going to a baseball game. He credits having a strong family with the fact he continued to fight for his freedom.\n\n\"It's easy to give up in prison when you lose hope but when the system chooses to throw you away, you have to ask yourself if you're willing to just settle for it or are you going to fight for it,\" he said.\n\nDunn spent the last 34 years behind bars for the 1990 murder of Ricco Rogers. He maintained his innocence the entire time, and two witnesses, ages 12 and 14, recanted their testimonies.\n\nIn 2020, a judge said there was evidence Dunn was innocent. Last May, the St. Louis Circuit Attorney filed a motion to vacate Dunn's sentence. One year later, a judge overturned the conviction, ordering for his release. The judge noted there was evidence he was innocent of the crime.\n\nDunn was moments away from walking free last week until Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey made an appeal to keep him behind bars. Six days later, on Tuesday, the Missouri Supreme Court ruled that, with his conviction overturned, he had to be released back to St. Louis, where he was originally charged.\n\nCircuit Attorney Gabe Gore then filed paperwork stating Dunn could not be retried, meaning not only was he free, but his record was wiped clean.\n\nCopyright 2024 Nexstar Media, Inc.

LOUIS -- The Missouri Supreme Court on Tuesday paved the way for Christopher Dunn's release from prison after 34 years.\n\nThe Supreme Court in a unanimous decision reversed a St. Louis circuit judge's previous order to immediately release Dunn from prison after finding him innocent of a 1990 murder.\n\nDunn's \"actual innocence\" of the crime effectively reversed his conviction, the judges wrote, but his underlying murder charge remained. That meant he couldn't be released prison until St. Louis Circuit Attorney Gabe Gore's office, which fought to overturn Dunn's conviction, dismissed the underlying charges.\n\nIt was unclear Tuesday afternoon how quickly that would happen. A spokesperson for Gore's office did not immediately return a call seeking comment Tuesday.\n\nThe Supreme Court's ruling came after more than a week of legal maneuvering stemming from Judge Jason Sengheiser's finding of Dunn's actual innocence in the 1990 killing of 15-year-old Ricco Rogers after the state's two key witnesses recanted their testimony.\n\nWho's Donald Trump's pick for Missouri governor?

That temporary stay was granted, and Dunn has remained in prison since.\n\nThis is a developing story.

But Bailey appealed, and the Missouri Supreme Court is weighing what to do.", "source": {"uri": "kion546.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KION546"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@kion546.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAACP", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NAACP"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "District attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miscarriage_of_justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miscarriage of justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_Missouri", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of Missouri"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney_General", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney General"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurisdiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jurisdiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuit_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Circuit court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 47}], "image": "https://kion546.b-cdn.net/2023/10/kionlogog-860x540.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9770150", "eventUri": "eng-9770150", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-21", "textStart": 448, "textEnd": 455}], "sentiment": -0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 130, "relevance": 1}

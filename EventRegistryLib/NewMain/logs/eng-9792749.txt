The two deputies go to Sulpizio's house to attempt a well-being check on Michael Sulpizio, the husband, and their two adult children. The sheriff says no one responded to announcements made at the door, and one of the deputies saw three people inside run. Two small dogs were also found dead in the front yard.Deputies hear some loud banging but can't identify or locate the sound. One of the deputies finds an open window on the side of the house with the screen kicked out, raising concerns about the people in the house. Additional units are called in to respond.Marked deputy cruisers are positioned in front of the home with the blue warning lights activated. Master Deputy Bradley Link makes several announcements identifying themselves and calling out to the residents. Deputies try to come up with a plan to make contact.9:03 p.m.: Master Deputy Link, Master Deputy Harold Howell and two others enter the house while making announcements through a rear door. As Link crosses a hallway, his body-worn camera shows several frames of a man positioned on the arm of a couch with a rifle, waiting to ambush the deputies, Sheriff Peyton Grinnell says. The sheriff's office has identified the suspect as Michael Sulpizio. Link is struck multiple times.9:05 p.m.: The first call for help from deputies came in. The other deputies are forced to retreat.

Someone inside the house starts shooting at deputies outside, and the deputies return fire.9:24 p.m.: The first deputy, now identified as Howell, was transported to HCA Florida Lake Monroe Hospital with a gunshot wound to his arm. More resources and deputies are requested. Deputies try to negotiate the return of Master Deputy Link. A woman yells from within the house, \"My king will kill all of you. You are Lucifer's children.\"9:26 p.m.: Master Deputy Stephen Gargano and others with the SWAT team arrive and organize a plan to rescue Link. Gargano was lead and used a ballistic shield as cover as he moved into the house. Gargano was shot through a wall several times.

Background: The Sulpizio home where a deputy was killed (WKMG/YouTube).\n\nIn Florida, a sheriff stated that a woman tricked his deputies into coming to her house where her husband and two adult children were hiding with a large collection of firearms and bullets. Once the deputies entered the home, they were shot at, resulting in the death of one officer who was hit in the back, while two others were wounded.\n\nThe Lake County Sheriff's Office is mourning the death of Master Deputy Sheriff Bradley Michael Link, 28, as deputies Harold Howell, 41, and Stefano Gargano, 28, recover from their injuries.\n\nSheriff Peyton Grinnell told reporters at a press conference it all started around 7:45 p.m. Friday when deputies received a call about a woman who was trespassing and assaulting people at a home in the 3800 block of Brookside Drive, about 40 miles northwest of Orlando. When deputies arrived they encountered a woman later identified as 48-year-old Julie Sulpizio who allegedly claimed she was \"Helen under God's will\" and made several other religious statements.\n\nGrinnell said Sulpizio \"convinced\" deputies to go to her home down the street to check on her husband and two adult children. Cops arrested Sulpizio while other deputies went to her home.\n\nWhen cops got there, they tried to contact the three people to no avail despite hearing movement inside. There were also two small dogs dead in the front yard, according to Grinnell. Deputies then saw an open window with the screen kicked out, raising suspicion that there may be a home invasion or burglary, Grinnell said. After about an hour of trying to get ahold of the people inside, Link, Howell and other deputies entered the home. When Link walked through a laundry room and into a hallway, his body camera captures a man apparently wearing a black shirt and body armor holding a rifle on the arm of a couch \"waiting to ambush deputies,\" according to Grinnell.\n\nHowever, Link did not see the man, believed to be Sulpizio's husband Michael Sulpizio, and turned the other way, Grinnell described. A hail of gunfire erupted. Link was struck in the back multiple times, Grinnell said. A bullet hit Howell in the wrist. Michael Sulpizio continued to shoot at Link as he tried unsuccessfully to crawl to safety, Grinnell stated. Someone else inside the home allegedly began firing at deputies outside.\n\nAs deputies tried to negotiate with the suspects to rescue Link, the suspects allegedly refused.\n\n\"My king will kill all of you,\" a woman inside the home allegedly yelled. \"You are Lucifer's children.\"\n\nAs the SWAT team entered the home with a ballistic shield to get Link, it was met with another volley of bullets, Grinnell said. Gargano was shot through a wall multiple times with a high caliber weapon. Deputies retrieved Gargano and removed him from the home under heavy gunfire.\n\n\"Heroes,\" Grinnell said of the rescuers.\n\nGargano remains in critical condition at the hospital.\n\nAfter one of the suspects mentioned suicide, cops heard two gunshots followed by a third. The SWAT team reportedly used a battering ram to knock down the front wall of the home. Deputies removed Link from the home and paramedics airlifted him to the hospital where doctors pronounced him dead.\n\nCops found two women -- 23-year-old Savannah Sulpizio and 22-year-old Cheyenne Sulpizio -- dead on the couch from self-inflicted gunshot wounds. Officials also found Michael Sulpizio suffering from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. He was rushed to the hospital where he was pronounced dead.\n\n\"Throughout the residence anti-government propaganda was observed, along with conspiracy-theory media,\" Grinnell said.\n\nDuring her interview with detectives, Julie Sulpizio reportedly claimed to be God and said that God speaks through her. She allegedly stated that she was trying to lure the neighbors to her home so that her husband could kill them.\n\n\"They were not successful because of our deputies,\" Grinnell stated.\n\nOn Monday, prosecutors charged her with first-degree murder of a law enforcement officer, seven counts of attempted murder, felony battery/strangulation, two counts of battery and battery on a law enforcement officer.\n\nLake County State Attorney Bill Gladson said the state may seek the death penalty against her.\n\n\"This was nothing short of an ambush,\" he said. \"The evidence will show that. It's absolutely indescribable.\"", "source": {"uri": "internewscast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Internewscast Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Background: The Sulpizio home where a deputy was killed (WKMG/YouTube).\n\nA Florida sheriff said a woman lured his deputies to her home where her husband and two adult children were lying in wait with a stockpile of guns and ammunition before opening fire when they entered, fatally shooting one cop in the back and injuring two others.\n\nThe Lake County Sheriff's Office is mourning the death of Master Deputy Sheriff Bradley Michael Link, 28, as deputies Harold Howell, 41, and Stefano Gargano, 28, recover from their injuries.\n\nSheriff Peyton Grinnell told reporters at a press conference it all started around 7:45 p.m. Friday when deputies received a call about a woman who was trespassing and assaulting people at a home in the 3800 block of Brookside Drive, about 40 miles northwest of Orlando. When deputies arrived they encountered a woman later identified as 48-year-old Julie Sulpizio who allegedly claimed she was \"Helen under God's will\" and made several other religious statements.\n\nGrinnell said Sulpizio \"convinced\" deputies to go to her home down the street to check on her husband and two adult children. Cops arrested Sulpizio while other deputies went to her home.\n\nWhen cops got there, they tried to contact the three people to no avail despite hearing movement inside. There were also two small dogs dead in the front yard, according to Grinnell. Deputies then saw an open window with the screen kicked out, raising suspicion that there may be a home invasion or burglary, Grinnell said. After about an hour of trying to get ahold of the people inside, Link, Howell and other deputies entered the home. When Link walked through a laundry room and into a hallway, his body camera captures a man apparently wearing a black shirt and body armor holding a rifle on the arm of a couch \"waiting to ambush deputies,\" according to Grinnell.\n\nHowever, Link did not see the man, believed to be Sulpizio's husband Michael Sulpizio, and turned the other way, Grinnell described. A hail of gunfire erupted. Link was struck in the back multiple times, Grinnell said. A bullet hit Howell in the wrist. Michael Sulpizio continued to shoot at Link as he tried unsuccessfully to crawl to safety, Grinnell stated. Someone else inside the home allegedly began firing at deputies outside.\n\nAs deputies tried to negotiate with the suspects to rescue Link, the suspects allegedly refused.\n\n\"My king will kill all of you,\" a woman inside the home allegedly yelled. \"You are Lucifer's children.\"\n\nAs the SWAT team entered the home with a ballistic shield to get Link, it was met with another volley of bullets, Grinnell said. Gargano was shot through a wall multiple times with a high caliber weapon. Deputies retrieved Gargano and removed him from the home under heavy gunfire.\n\n\"Heroes,\" Grinnell said of the rescuers.\n\nGargano remains in critical condition at the hospital.\n\nAfter one of the suspects mentioned suicide, cops heard two gunshots followed by a third. The SWAT team reportedly used a battering ram to knock down the front wall of the home. Deputies removed Link from the home and paramedics airlifted him to the hospital where doctors pronounced him dead.\n\nCops found two women -- 23-year-old Savannah Sulpizio and 22-year-old Cheyenne Sulpizio -- dead on the couch from self-inflicted gunshot wounds. Officials also found Michael Sulpizio suffering from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. He was rushed to the hospital where he was pronounced dead.\n\nInside the home there were reportedly more than 20 firearms ranging from pistols to shotguns to high-caliber rifles, along with ammunition, that were \"gathered, placed and staged in the living room,\" according to Grinnell. There was also gas masks, body armor, medical bags and MREs, Grinnell said.\n\n\"Throughout the residence anti-government propaganda was observed, along with conspiracy-theory media,\" Grinnell said.\n\nDuring her interview with detectives, Julie Sulpizio reportedly claimed to be God and said that God speaks through her. She allegedly stated that she was trying to lure the neighbors to her home so that her husband could kill them.\n\n\"They were not successful because of our deputies,\" Grinnell stated.\n\nOn Monday, prosecutors charged her with first-degree murder of a law enforcement officer, seven counts of attempted murder, felony battery/strangulation, two counts of battery and battery on a law enforcement officer.\n\nLake County State Attorney Bill Gladson said the state may seek the death penalty against her.\n\n\"This was nothing short of an ambush,\" he said. \"The evidence will show that. It's absolutely indescribable.\"", "source": {"uri": "lawandcrime.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Law & Crime"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Bradley_(soccer)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Michael Bradley (soccer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheriff", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sheriff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grinnell,_Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Grinnell, Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Grinnell, Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_County,_Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lake County, Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lake County, Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trespass", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trespass"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammunition", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ammunition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlando,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Orlando, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Orlando, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_body_camera", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Police body camera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_armor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Body armor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambush", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ambush"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burglary", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Burglary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SWAT", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "SWAT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_invasion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Home invasion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hail", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Suicide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rifle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rifle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunshot_wound", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gunshot wound"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballistic_shield", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ballistic shield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_mask", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gas mask"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strangling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strangling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battering_ram", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Battering ram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheyenne,_Wyoming", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cheyenne, Wyoming"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cheyenne, Wyoming"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savannah,_Georgia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Savannah, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Savannah, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://lawandcrime.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Julie-Sulpizio.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792749", "eventUri": "eng-9792749", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.4509803921568627, "wgt": 204, "relevance": 1}

According to WOFL, she was apprehended on Friday night before the exchange of fire that resulted in the deaths of Master Deputy Sheriff Bradley Link, who was Sulpizio's husband, and her two daughters.\n\nLake County Sheriff Peyton Grinnell stated that Suplizio was taken into custody on Monday at AdventHealth Waterman Hospital, where she had been admitted following the tumultuous events that unfolded on Friday evening in Eustis.\n\nAs CrimeOnline reported, Link, 28, was killed in the shooting and two other deputies were wounded. Three residents of the home were found dead when the dust cleared: Julie Sulpizio's husband, 49-year-old Michael Sulpizio, and her two daughters, Savannah, 22, and Cheyenne Sulpizio, 23. Lake County officials said that Michael Sulpizio was their stepfather.\n\nLake County identified the wounded deputies as Master Deputy Sheriff Harold Howell, 41, and Deputy First Class Stefano Gargano, 28.\n\nGrinnell provided more detail during a news conference on Monday about what happened Friday night, WESH reported. He said that the initial 911 call came from a neighbor of the Sulpizios who reporte that Julie Sulpizio was in his yard assaulting people. He said that she was hitting the caller's wife, telling them they were sinners and acting \"religious.\"\n\nA deputy arrived on the scene, WOFL reported, and encountered Sulpizio in the yard with her hands behind her back. The deputy ordered her to back up, but she instead came towoard the deputy, who drew his taser.\n\nSulpizio told the deputy that her neighbors \"were involved in pedophilia,\" Grinnell said, and claimed to be \"Helen,\" not Julie,\" who she said \"is in heaven.\"\n\n\"She then went on to state, 'You see, the thing is, we needed to trick Lucy,' and we later learned [Lucy] to be a name she calls Lucifer,\" Grinnell said Sulpizio then pointed to the deputy and said, \"You are one of them.\"\n\nA second deputy arrived on scene, and Sulpizio was handcuffed and taken to the hospital for an evaluation. At that point, the deputies decided to conduct a welfare check on the Sulpizio home, where they found the two dead dogs in the yard and an open window with the screen kicked out. That's when they called for backup, Grinnell said.\n\nGrinnell said that Link and Howell entered the home and that Link was ambushed by Michael Sulpizio, who shot him in the back. The incident was captured on Link's body camera.\n\nGrinnell said that Link's body camera footage showed Sulpizio and the two young women discussing suicide before the SWAT team made entry, WOFL said. The medical examiner has not made a determination of their manner of death.\n\nThe sheriff said that Julie Sulpizio showed no remorse and appeared \"joyful\" when she was arrested at the hospital.\n\nInvestigators said they found more than 20 firearms in the home, \"gathered, placed and staged.\" They also found conspiracy-theory media, gas masks, and other emergency prep items.\n\nJulie Sulpizio reportedly told deputies that she had been trying to lure her neighbors to her home where Michael Sulpizio would kill them.", "source": {"uri": "internewscast.com",

What we know", "body": "Lake County Sheriff Peyton Grinnell described the grim details of what happened in the firefight in Eustis Friday night that ended with 4 people dead.\n\nA Eustis woman has been arrested and charged with murder in the violent, unexpected firefight that killed one Lake County Sheriff's deputy Friday night and left two more injured.\n\nThree people in the household also died during what Lake County SheriffPeyton Grinnell described as an \"ambush\" at Brookside Drive in Eustis' Orlando Hills neighborhood.\n\n\"We went to a disturbance at one house -- the initial call was for a disturbance -- and then, while we were on that scene, somebody at that scene told the deputies they needed to go to the other house, that that's where there was a problem happening,\" Grinnell said at a Saturday morning news conference.\n\nJulie Sulpizio, also known as Julia Jefferson, 48, was arrested and charged with one count of first-degree murder of a late enforcement officer along with 11 other charges.\n\n'Absolute heroes': Lake County deputy shooting details revealed at press conference\n\nWhat happened in the deputy shooting in Eustis?\n\nDeputies responded to a 911 call on Aug. 2 from Sulpizio's neighbors, who said she was harassing them and trying to lead them back to her house.\n\n\"This turned physical, as the trespasser, later identified as Julie Sulpizio, began striking the complainant's wife, his father and others,\" Grinnell said at a press conference Monday. \"The complainant stated she (Sulpizio) was 'acting religious,' accusing them of being sinners, and she said that she knows what they did.\"\n\nThe neighbors told deputies that Sulpizio's husband Michael had told their neighbors' children a few days previously, \"The next time I see you, I'm going to shoot you.\"\n\nSulpizio resisted requests to back off. When a deputy raised a Taser she called it \"God's light.\" She fell and while the deputy was trying to keep her there she said he was only making her madder. She yelled out, \"Michael, Gabriel, Timothy, it's time now to protect my children,\" Grinnell said.\n\nThe deputies found two dead dogs by the Sulpizio's front door, and three people inside the building could be seen moving away but no one responded to attempts to communicate, Grinnell said. An open window had the screen kicked out. Deputies called for backup and, as it arrived, continued to identify themselves and entered.\n\nWho was the Florida deputy who was killed?\n\nMaster Deputy Bradley Link, 28, was gunned down as he entered the living room and he tried to return fire, Grinnell said. His body cam later showed the shots coming from the couch, where Michael Sulpizio was. Master Deputy Sheriff Harold Howell was shot in the wrist while attempting to suppress the gunfire, the sheriff said. Howell and the other deputies were forced to retreat. Link was then shot several more times, Grinnell said.\n\nA firefight ensued between occupants in the house and deputies outside as more law enforcement arrived. The suspects refused to negotiate or release Link's body, Grinnell said.\n\nAccording to the sheriff, Link's body cam, reviewed later, captured a woman's voice yelling as she racked a firearm, \"My king will kill all of you. You are Lucifer's children.\"\n\nDeputies and members of the SWAT team used a ballistic shield to enter the home again to retrieve Link. Deputy First Class Stefano Gargano was shot through a wall several times by a high-caliber round, Grinnell said, and the other deputies were able to get him outside. As a SWAT team made plans to enter, Link's body cam captured a woman talking about suicide, Grinnell said.\n\nTwo gunshots were heard, and then another, the sheriff said. When the SWAT team broke through a wall to retrieve Link, they found Julie Sulpizio's daughters, Cheyenne 22, and Savannah, 23, on the couch dead of apparent self-inflicted gunshot wounds to the head, Grinnell said. Michael Sulpizio, wearing black body armor, was also there with a similar wound but was still alive. He died later at the hospital.\n\nAlthough at least seven deputies returned fire, Lt. John Herrell said, \"there is no indication that (the suspects) were struck with any return fire from our deputies.\"\n\nJulie Sulpizio was detained before the shootings began, under the state's Baker Act. In her interview, she claimed that she was God, Michael was the guardian angel Michael, and \"she was trying to lure the neighbors to her residence so that Michael could kill them,\" Grinnell said.\n\n\"She was not successful because of our deputies,\" he said.\n\nWho died in the deputy shooting in Eustis?\n\nMaster Deputy Sheriff Harold Howell and Deputy First Class Stefano Gargano were injured. Both men are undergoing treatment and are expected to make full recoveries.\n\nThe Florida Deputy Sheriffs Association is selling Lake County Strong T-shirts to support the families of Lake County Deputies Bradley Link, Stefano Gargano, and Harold Howell, the LCSO said.\n\nHow many weapons were found at the home in Eustis? What else was found?\n\nDeputies with a search warrant found more than 20 firearms, ranging from high-caliber rifles to pistols and shotguns, Grinnell, said, staged in the living room area with stockpiles of ammunition.\n\n\"A search of the house showed gas masks, body armor, ghillie (camouflage) suits, medical bags, bug-out bags, MREs, and bottled water stockpiles,\" Grinnell said. \"Around the residence, anti-government propaganda was observed, along with conspiracy theory-related media.\"\n\nDeputies found no drugs beyond medical marijuana, but found \"bumper stickers, stickers, handouts, flyers for Info Wars, various podcasts,\" but no personal writings or suggestions yet that the family was part of a larger network, a detective said. The LCSO and the FBI are still collecting and investigating evidence, he said.\n\nWhere in Florida is Eustis?\n\nEustis is an incorporated city in Lake County, about 40 miles north of Orlando next to Mount Dora and Tavares, nicknamed \"America's Hometown.\"", "source": {"uri": "eu.news-journalonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Florida Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

She was taken into custody Friday night before the shootout that left Master Deputy Sheriff Bradley Link, her husband, and her two daughters dead.\n\nLake County Sheriff Peyton Grinnell said Suplizio was arrested Monday at AdventHealth Waterman Hospital, where she was taken after the chaotic incident Friday night in Eustis.\n\nAs CrimeOnline reported, Link, 28, was killed in the shooting and two other deputies were wounded. Three residents of the home were found dead when the dust cleared: Julie Sulpizio's husband, 49-year-old Michael Sulpizio, and her two daughters, Savannah, 22, and Cheyenne Sulpizio, 23. Lake County officials said that Michael Sulpizio was their stepfather.\n\nLake County identified the wounded deputies as Master Deputy Sheriff Harold Howell, 41, and Deputy First Class Stefano Gargano, 28.\n\nGrinnell provided more detail during a news conference on Monday about what happened Friday night, WESH reported. He said that the initial 911 call came from a neighbor of the Sulpizios who reporte that Julie Sulpizio was in his yard assaulting people. He said that she was hitting the caller's wife, telling them they were sinners and acting \"religious.\"\n\nA deputy arrived on the scene, WOFL reported, and encountered Sulpizio in the yard with her hands behind her back. The deputy ordered her to back up, but she instead came towoard the deputy, who drew his taser.\n\nSulpizio told the deputy that her neighbors \"were involved in pedophilia,\" Grinnell said, and claimed to be \"Helen,\" not Julie,\" who she said \"is in heaven.\"\n\n\"She then went on to state, 'You see, the thing is, we needed to trick Lucy,' and we later learned [Lucy] to be a name she calls Lucifer,\" Grinnell said Sulpizio then pointed to the deputy and said, \"You are one of them.\"\n\nA second deputy arrived on scene, and Sulpizio was handcuffed and taken to the hospital for an evaluation. At that point, the deputies decided to conduct a welfare check on the Sulpizio home, where they found the two dead dogs in the yard and an open window with the screen kicked out. That's when they called for backup, Grinnell said.\n\nGrinnell said that Link and Howell entered the home and that Link was ambushed by Michael Sulpizio, who shot him in the back. The incident was captured on Link's body camera.\n\nHowell was wounded but got out, Grinnell said, according to WKMG. Gargano was a member of the SWAT team that made entry. His team pulled him out of the house, and he underwent his third surgery on Monday.\n\nGrinnell said that Link's body camera footage showed Sulpizio and the two young women discussing suicide before the SWAT team made entry, WOFL said. The medical examiner has not made a determination of their manner of death.\n\nThe sheriff said that Julie Sulpizio showed no remorse and appeared \"joyful\" when she was arrested at the hospital.\n\nInvestigators said they found more than 20 firearms in the home, \"gathered, placed and staged.\" They also found conspiracy-theory media, gas masks, and other emergency prep items.\n\nJulie Sulpizio reportedly told deputies that she had been trying to lure her neighbors to her home where Michael Sulpizio would kill them.\n\nFor the latest true crime and justice news,

She eventually made some statements that drew concern for the well-being of her husband and daughters.\n\nSulpizio was placed in handcuffs and taken to the hospital.

In total, three deputies were shot. Deputy Link died at the hospital. Master Deputy Sheriff Harold Howell and Deputy First Class Stefano Gargano remain hospitalized and are being treated for their injuries.\n\nMichael and both his daughters were found dead inside the house, believed to be from self-inflicted gunshot wounds, officials said.\n\nState prosecutors alleged that Sulpizio intended to lure her neighbors to the house so Michael, her husband, could kill them. Sheriff Grinnell said his deputies ensured that did not happen and saved the neighbors' lives.\n\nSulpizio was not remorseful, Sheriff Grinnell said. He described her as \"joyful.\" She was arrested with Deputy Link's handcuffs, he said.\n\nAs Deputy Link was inside the home, unable to get out, his bodywork camera remained on - facing the ceiling - but captured the audio around him, including those inside the house and the deputies outside eagerly trying to rescue him.", "source": {"uri": "fox35orlando.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FOX 35 Orlando"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheriff", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sheriff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_County,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lake County, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lake County, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Bradley_(soccer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michael Bradley (soccer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_mask", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gas mask"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Gargano", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Walter Gargano"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Attempted murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammunition", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ammunition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conspiracy theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaganda", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Propaganda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grinnell,_Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grinnell, Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Grinnell, Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handcuffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Handcuffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_(archangel)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michael (archangel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hail", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "God"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SWAT", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "SWAT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "U.S. state"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheyenne,_Wyoming", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cheyenne, Wyoming"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cheyenne, Wyoming"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savannah,_Georgia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Savannah, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Savannah, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 55}], "image": "https://images.foxtv.com/c107833-mcdn.mp.lura.live/expiretime=2082787200/0f14f7f77f7b18aa57ed152ee1d7dcd0484f0e18b8c702a9072e9b00815a326f/iupl/2B2/5EB/1280/720/2B25EB019F65F1569D481F62E51B4612.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792749", "eventUri": "eng-9792749", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lake County, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 195, "relevance": 1}

She is being held without bail.\n\nBecause of the nature of the alleged crime, the case must go before a grand jury within 21 days, Gladson said. Sulpizio's arraignment is scheduled for Sept. 3.\n\nThe public defender assigned to represent Julie Sulpizio could not immediately be reached for comment Tuesday.\n\nHer husband, Michael Sulpizio, was found dead inside the family's home on Friday after Grinnell said he fatally shot Lake County Master Deputy Bradley Link, 28, and critically injured a second officer, Deputy First Class Stefano Gargano.\n\nA third officer, Master Deputy Sheriff Harold Howell, was also wounded in the incident.\n\nMichael Sulpizio and the couple's two adult daughters were all found dead on the family's couch, Grinnell said. The body camera on the fatally injured deputy, who was inside the family's home when he was shot multiple times, appeared to have captured the Sulpizios taking their own lives, the sheriff added.\n\nThe sheriff's office first responded to the scene at 7:45 p.m. Friday, when authorities were told that a woman -- later identified as Julie Sulpizio -- was assaulting her neighbors, whom she accused of \"being sinners,\" and saying, 'I know what you did,'\" Grinnell said.\n\nAfter an officer arrived, Julie Sulpizio identified herself as \"Helen under God's will\" and said her neighbors were involved in pedophilia, Grinnell said. One of the neighbors told the officer that Julie Sulpizio had tried to get them to walk to her house, Grinnell said, but they didn't trust her.\n\nIn a later interview with investigators, Julie Sulpizio said she was trying to lure them to her home so that her husband could kill them, Grinnell said.\n\n\"She was not successful because of our deputies,\" he said.\n\nAt the news conference, a detective investigating the case said they found bumper stickers, fliers and hand-outs promoting anti-government propaganda and conspiracy theories at the home. The detective did not say if the material is linked to the incident.\n\nIn her interview with investigators, the detective said, Julie Sulpizio said she could \"visualize souls\" and it was her job to bring her husband \"dark souls.\"\n\nAfter Julie Sulpizio was handcuffed, Grinnell said, deputies tried to conduct a welfare check at her family's nearby home. Officers found two dead dogs in the front yard and a window screen that had been kicked out, the sheriff said.\n\nInside, they saw three people running and believed there may have been a burglary or home invasion in progress, he said.\n\nAfter roughly an hour, Grinnell said, the deputies had announced themselves and failed to reach anyone side. They entered the home through a laundry room, Grinnell said, and Link's body camera allegedly captured a man who appeared to be wearing body armor positioned with a rifle on a couch.\n\nThe gunman, believed to be Michael Sulpizio, fired several rounds, striking Link in the back, Grinnell said. Howell was hit in the wrist, the sheriff said, and he and other deputies retreated.\n\nWhen officers tried to negotiate with the Sulpizios for the release of Link's body, Grinnell said, a woman inside the home was captured on the deputy's body camera racking her gun and yelling, \"My king will kill all of you.\"\n\nAround 9:30 p.m., a tactical unit entered through the same laundry room and was met with a volley of gunfire, Grinnell said. Deputy First Class Stefano Gargano, armed with a ballistics shield, was struck with multiple high-caliber rounds through a wall, incapacitating him, according to Grinnell.\n\nAs other deputies tried to remove him, they were being \"actively engaged by suspects,\" Grinnell added, calling the officers \"heroes.\"\n\nAt 11:02 p.m., Grinnell said, two gunshots were heard in quick succession. A third one was heard moments later.\n\nInside, authorities found the bodies of Michael Sulpizio and the two daughters, Savannah Sulpizio, 23, and Cheyenne Sulpizio, 22, Grinnell said.\n\nGargano is in stable condition and Howell is expected to make a full recovery. Link was airlifted to a hospital and pronounced dead, the sheriff said.\n\nLink had worked for the department since 2019 and \"quickly became part of our family and faithfully served our citizens with courage and zeal,\" the sheriff's office said.", "source": {"uri": "nbcnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Sulpizio will be held without bond on the murder and attempted murder charges, pending a pretrial hearing scheduled within the next five days.\n\nThe judge also ordered Sulpizio to have no contact with any of the victims connected to the case.\n\nSulpizio's next court hearing is scheduled for Sept. 3 at 8:30 a.m.\n\nSulpizio is accused of being the ringleader in the August 2 plot that resulted in the death of 28-year-old Master Deputy Sheriff Bradley Michael Link and injured 41-year-old Master Deputy Sheriff Harold Howell and 28-year-old Deputy First Class Stefano Gargano.\n\nAt a news conference Monday, Sheriff Peyton Grinnell said deputies initially responded to a 911 call about a disturbance at a home on Brookside Drive.\n\nThe caller reported a woman, later identified as Sulpizio, assaulting people and trespassing on their property on Brookside Drive.

daughters, Savannah Sulpizio, 23, and Cheyenne Sulpizio, 22 - the suspects responsible for shooting at deputies, officials said.\n\nThey were later located dead inside the home with self-inflicted gunshot wounds.\n\nJulie allegedly told detectives that she was trying to lure the neighbors to her residence so that Michael could kill them, but was unsuccessful because of the law enforcement response.\n\nBill Gladson, State Attorney for the Fifth Judicial Circuit, who was also present at Monday's news conference, said this case is eligible for the death penalty.\n\nAuthorities continue to review all the evidence in the case, including video captured by Deputy Link's body-worn camera, which helped investigators piece together a timeline of the incident.\n\nSulpizio reportedly had no prior criminal history in Florida.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement_officer",

She was arrested around 1:45 p.m. Monday at the AdventHealth Waterman Hospital in Tavares, and she is being held without bond.\n\nThe three deputies were shot late Friday in the area of County Road 439, near Brookside Drive, north of State Road 44. Lake County Master Deputy Bradley Michael Link, 28, died of his injuries, while Deputy First Class Stefano Gargano was shot and critically injured, and Master Deputy Sheriff Harold Howell was shot and wounded.\n\nLt. John Herrell on Monday told News 6 more about the family at the center of the attack.\n\nHerrell said Julie Jefferson Sulpizio and her husband, Michael Sulpizio, kept to themselves and had very few occasions to call police.\n\nHe said they encountered Julie Jefferson Sulpizio first late Friday night.\n\n\"This lady (Julie) then sent them to this house under the guise of conducting a well-being check,\" Herrell said on Saturday. \"She said something to the effect that you need to go down to this house and check on the people there, so the deputies went down to this house, and it appeared that the house had been burglarized. In fact, they thought they had a possible burglary in progress. As they were posting up on the house, they could hear commotion inside. They tried to order the people out. No one came out, so at that point, they made entry of the home at which time they were immediately met with heavy, heavy gunfire.\"\n\nHerrell said the shooters were the woman's husband and two daughters - Michael Sulpizio, 48; Cheyenne, 23; and Savannah, 22.", "source": {"uri": "clickorlando.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WKMG"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jacob_langston@clickorlando.com", "name": "Jacob Langston", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambush", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ambush"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legislator", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Legislator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_County,_Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lake County, Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lake County, Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Bradley_(soccer)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Michael Bradley (soccer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_watch", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Suicide watch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jefferson_County,_Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jefferson County, Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jefferson County, Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheriff", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sheriff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Suicide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlando,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Orlando, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Orlando, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_State_Road_44", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Florida State Road 44"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Attempted murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_(crime)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Battery (crime)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tavares,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tavares, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tavares, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burglary", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Burglary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coming out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheyenne,_Wyoming", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cheyenne, Wyoming"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cheyenne, Wyoming"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savannah,_Georgia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Savannah, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Savannah, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://res.cloudinary.com/graham-media-group/image/upload/f_auto/q_auto/c_thumb,w_700/v1/media/gmg/SGITTKPAFBBK3IAIBAIX5A5A4E.png?_a=DATAfRfiZAA0", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792749", "eventUri": "eng-9792749", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Orlando, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.6, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

What we know", "body": "A Eustis woman has been arrested and charged with murder in the violent, unexpected firefight that killed one Lake County Sheriff's deputy Friday night and left two more injured.\n\nThree people in the household also died during what Lake County SheriffPeyton Grinnell described as an \"ambush\" at Brookside Drive in Eustis' Orlando Hills neighborhood.\n\n\"We went to a disturbance at one house -- the initial call was for a disturbance -- and then, while we were on that scene, somebody at that scene told the deputies they needed to go to the other house, that that's where there was a problem happening,\" Grinnell said at a Saturday morning news conference.\n\nJulie Sulpizio, also known as Julia Jefferson, 48, was arrested and charged with one count of first-degree murder of a late enforcement officer along with 11 other charges.\n\n'Absolute heroes': Lake County deputy shooting details revealed at press conference\n\nDeputies responded to a 911 call on Aug. 2 from Sulpizio's neighbors, who said she was harassing them and trying to lead them back to her house.\n\n\"This turned physical, as the trespasser, later identified as Julie Sulpizio, began striking the complainant's wife, his father and others,\" Grinnell said at a press conference Monday. \"The complainant stated she (Sulpizio) was 'acting religious,' accusing them of being sinners, and she said that she knows what they did.\"\n\nThe neighbors told deputies that Sulpizio's husband Michael had told their neighbors' children a few days previously, \"The next time I see you, I'm going to shoot you.\"\n\nSulpizio resisted requests to back off. When a deputy raised a Taser she called it \"God's light.\" She fell and while the deputy was trying to keep her there she said he was only making her madder. She yelled out, \"Michael, Gabriel, Timothy, it's time now to protect my children,\" Grinnell said.\n\nThe deputies found two dead dogs by the Sulpizio's front door, and three people inside the building could be seen moving away but no one responded to attempts to communicate, Grinnell said. An open window had the screen kicked out. Deputies called for backup and, as it arrived, continued to identify themselves and entered.\n\nMaster Deputy Bradley Link, 28, was gunned down as he entered the living room and he tried to return fire, Grinnell said. His body cam later showed the shots coming from the couch, where Michael Sulpizio was. Master Deputy Sheriff Harold Howell was shot in the wrist while attempting to suppress the gunfire, the sheriff said. Howell and the other deputies were forced to retreat. Link was then shot several more times, Grinnell said.\n\nA firefight ensued between occupants in the house and deputies outside as more law enforcement arrived. The suspects refused to negotiate or release Link's body, Grinnell said.\n\nAccording to the sheriff, Link's body cam, reviewed later, captured a woman's voice yelling as she racked a firearm, \"My king will kill all of you. You are Lucifer's children.\"\n\nDeputies and members of the SWAT team used a ballistic shield to enter the home again to retrieve Link. Deputy First Class Stefano Gargano was shot through a wall several times by a high-caliber round, Grinnell said, and the other deputies were able to get him outside. As a SWAT team made plans to enter, Link's body cam captured a woman talking about suicide, Grinnell said.\n\nTwo gunshots were heard, and then another, the sheriff said. When the SWAT team broke through a wall to retrieve Link, they found Julie Sulpizio's daughters, Cheyenne 22, and Savannah, 23, on the couch dead of apparent self-inflicted gunshot wounds to the head, Grinnell said. Michael Sulpizio, wearing black body armor, was also there with a similar wound but was still alive. He died later at the hospital.\n\nAlthough at least seven deputies returned fire, Lt. John Herrell said, \"there is no indication that (the suspects) were struck with any return fire from our deputies.\"\n\nJulie Sulpizio was detained before the shootings began, under the state's Baker Act. In her interview, she claimed that she was God, Michael was the guardian angel Michael, and \"she was trying to lure the neighbors to her residence so that Michael could kill them,\" Grinnell said.\n\n\"She was not successful because of our deputies,\" he said.\n\nMaster Deputy Sheriff Harold Howell and Deputy First Class Stefano Gargano were injured. Both men are undergoing treatment and are expected to make full recoveries.\n\nThe Florida Deputy Sheriffs Association is selling Lake County Strong T-shirts to support the families of Lake County Deputies Bradley Link, Stefano Gargano, and Harold Howell, the LCSO said.\n\nDeputies with a search warrant found more than 20 firearms, ranging from high-caliber rifles to pistols and shotguns, Grinnell, said, staged in the living room area with stockpiles of ammunition.\n\n\"A search of the house showed gas masks, body armor, ghillie (camouflage) suits, medical bags, bug-out bags, MREs, and bottled water stockpiles,\" Grinnell said. \"Around the residence, anti-government propaganda was observed, along with conspiracy theory-related media.\"\n\nDeputies found no drugs beyond medical marijuana, but found \"bumper stickers, stickers, handouts, flyers for Info Wars, various podcasts,\" but no personal writings or suggestions yet that the family was part of a larger network, a detective said. The LCSO and the FBI are still collecting and investigating evidence, he said.\n\nEustis is an incorporated city in Lake County, about 40 miles north of Orlando next to Mount Dora and Tavares, nicknamed \"America's Hometown.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheriff", "type": "wiki",

God's wife, and we were all demons, and our dogs were hell hounds and all of this, and it was just a crazy and insane moment.\"\n\n-- witness interviewed by WESH-TV\n\nThis story broke over the weekend, but I didn't report on it immediately because there wasn't much information on the suspects. A deputy was killed, and two others were wounded, when they were ambushed after responding to a situation that began with a woman attacking her neighbors on Brookside Drive in Lake County, Florida. The woman, subsequently identified as 48-year-old Julie Sulpizio, was under some sort of religious delusion, claiming to be acting on behalf of God against pedophiles and \"dark souls.\" She was taken into custody for psychiatric evaluation under the Baker Act, but not before encouraging deputies to go to her house. When they followed up, there was no response from the occupants of the residence and, because a screen on one of the windows had been disturbed, deputies suspected that there might have been some kind of home invasion. Lake County Sheriff Peyton Grinnell laid out the details of what happened at a Monday press conference:\n\n\"The [911 caller] stated [Julie Sulpizio] was acting religious, accusing them of being senators, and she knows what they did...\" Grinnell explained. \"But Julie states that she is 'Helen' under God's will.\"\n\nJust before 8 p.m., a deputy arrived at the scene, and despite being ordered otherwise, Sulpizio began to approach the deputy, according to the sheriff's office. As a result, the deputy pointed his Taser at Sulpizio, prompting her to take a few steps back.\n\n\"During a calm verbal exchange, Julie Sulpizio states that 'they' -- meaning the group of people that was present there -- were involved in pedophilia. She again claims to be Helen, and she asked one of the victims that she had battered, 'Who is your God?'\n\n\"Julie Sulpizio stated to them that 'Julie is in heaven.'\n\n\"She then went on to state, 'You see, the thing is, we needed to trick Lucy.' And we later learned to be a name she calls Lucifer. She then points at (the deputy) and states, 'You are one of them.'\" . . .\n\n[After Julie Sulpizio was taken into custody] Two deputies then went to Sulpizio's home -- a short walk away -- to perform a well-being check on her husband and two daughters -- Michael Sulpizio, 48; Cheyenne Sulpizio, 23; and Savannah Sulpizio, 22.\n\nNo one answered the door when the deputies arrived, though they saw three people running within the house, Grinnell said. Two small dogs were also found dead in the front yard.\n\nAccording to investigators, the deputies then heard a \"loud banging\" and discovered an open window with the screen kicked out, which sparked concern over the well-being of Michael Sulpizio and the two daughters.\n\nAs a result, the deputies called for backup, believing some kind of home invasion or burglary had taken place.\n\nIn addition, investigators interviewing neighbors discovered that Michael Sulpizio a few days prior had allegedly threatened to shoot the neighbor's children the next time he saw them, Grinnell said.\n\nJust after 9 p.m., four deputies attempted to enter through the rear door at the driveway, announcing their entry, Grinnell added.\n\n\"As Master Deputy (Bradley) Link crossed the threshold into the hallway, his body-worn camera captures several frames of what appears to be a male in a black-sleeve T-shirt or body armor positioned with a rifle on the arm of a couch, waiting to ambush deputies,\" the sheriff explained.\n\nInvestigators reported that the deputies were then met with heavy gunfire, which struck Link in the back. Someone also began shooting at the deputies outside, and another deputy -- Master Deputy Sheriff Harold Howell, 41 -- was also injured by the gunfire.\n\nLink was immobilized, though the remaining deputies cleared out of the home, Grinnell explained. Investigators tried to negotiate with those inside the home to release Link, but they were refused.\n\n\"Master Deputy Link's body-worn camera continuously recorded audio and video from within the residence facing up toward the ceiling, and at 9:24 p.m., a female yells from within the residence as she racks a firearm and states, 'My king will kill all of you. You are Lucifer's children,'\" Grinnell said. \"This was in response to deputies yelling for Master Deputy Link to crawl to them.\"\n\nAfterward, a plan was put in place to rescue Link. According to Grinnell, Deputy First Class Stefano Gargano, 28, led a rescue team inside while using a ballistic shield as cover.\n\nHowever, Gargano was shot several times through the wall as he moved through the home, causing him to be incapacitated, according to the sheriff's office. He was ultimately extracted from the home and taken to the hospital in critical condition.\\\n\nEventually, a SWAT team was able to get into the home and rescue Link, though he later died from his wounds at the hospital.\n\nCheyenne Sulpizio and Savannah Sulpizio were also found dead inside the home, having shot themselves in the head, Grinnell said. Michael Sulpizio was also found with a self-inflicted gunshot wound to his head, and he died at the hospital afterward, Grinnell added. . . .\n\nInside the home, investigators found over 20 firearms, stockpiled ammunition, gas masks, body armor, ghillie suits, medical bags, MREs and bottled water, alongside \"anti-government propaganda\" and \"conspiracy-theory-related media,\" Grinnell said.\n\nIn a later interview with Julie Sulpizio, she told detectives that her name is actually \"Helen\" and that God speaks through her, Grinnell continued. He added that Julie Sulpizio told them her husband Michael Sulpizio was actually the biblical guardian angel Michael, who obeyed God's commands through her.\n\n\"She stated that she was trying to lure the neighbors to her residence so that Michael could kill them,\" Grinnell stated. \"She was not successful because of our deputies.\"\n\nSulpizio faces charges of premeditated first-degree murder on a law enforcement officer, seven counts of attempted murder, and four counts of battery.\n\nWhile the investigation is still ongoing, the sheriff and his lead detective said enough during the press conference that we know the family was socially isolated. The two daughters had reportedly been withdrawn from school when they were middle-school age, and did not have access to TV or other media. Despite the evidence of religious mania, there is no report of the family attending any church. The sheriff said the family were not \"on the radar\" of local law enforcement as any kind of extremist threat.\n\nSo there are still lots of unanswered questions, but this would seem to be what we might call \"QAnon adjacent\" insanity. How it got to the stage where deputies were ambushed in this manner, that's the real puzzle. I mean, there's lots of people out there with kooky ideas, without ever resorting to deadly violence. Three of the suspects in this case are dead, and the survivor in custody is so crazy that there's a real chance she'll be found incompetent to stand trial, which means that detectives face a difficult task of putting together a coherent narrative about how this family descended into dangerous lunacy. But as always, we know what the real lesson is: Crazy People Are Dangerous.", "source": {"uri": "theothermccain.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Other McCain"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheriff", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sheriff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grinnell,_Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Grinnell, Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Grinnell, Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_County,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lake County, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lake County, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedophilia", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pedophilia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_invasion", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Home invasion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "God"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baker_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baker Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WESH", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "WESH"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Demon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucifer", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lucifer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taser", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Taser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delusion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Delusion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quality of life"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Psychiatry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheyenne,_Wyoming", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cheyenne, Wyoming"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cheyenne, Wyoming"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savannah,_Georgia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Savannah, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Savannah, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_armor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Body armor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambush", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ambush"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burglary", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Burglary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaven", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Heaven"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-shirt", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "T-shirt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearm", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Firearm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rifle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rifle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QAnon", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "QAnon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement officer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Paranormal/Prophecies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Paranormal/Prophecies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 76}], "image": "https://theothermccain.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Screenshot-2024-08-05-9.09.47-PM-e1722906687939.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792749", "eventUri": "eng-9792749", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3490196078431372, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

She then tried to convince the people she is accused of assaulting into walking toward her home down the street before she approached the deputy who was brandishing a taser, according to the sheriff.\n\nShe continued to walk toward the deputy, calling the taser \"God's light,\" and was then subdued and handcuffed, according to the sheriff.\n\nDeputies then conducted a welfare check on Sulpizio's home to check on her husband, Michael Sulpizio, and their two daughters, Cheyenne and Savannah Sulpizio, in their nearby home. Two dogs were found killed in the front yard, along with an open window, and more deputies were called in to respond for a suspected burglary or home invasion, according to the sheriff.\n\nDeputies reported entering the home and were then met with \"a hail of\" gunfire, hitting Bradley Michael Link, 28, who became trapped in the home, and Harold Howell, 41, who was removed from the home and later revealed to be in stable condition at a hospital.\n\nThose inside the home refused to let deputies extract Link, according to the sheriff, and a woman inside the residence was heard on body camera footage yelling, \"my king will kill all of you. You are Lucifer's children.\" More deputies were then called to the scene.\n\nDeputies, including one identified as 28-year-old Stefano Gargano, then entered the home in an attempt to rescue Link, and were met with more gunfire. Gargano was hit, removed from the home and rushed to the hospital in critical condition.\n\nA SWAT team then entered the home, where Michael and his daughters were found with self-inflicted gunshot wounds, ultimately killing all three. Link was rushed to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead.\n\n\"We will do everything we can to bring justice to the families of the victims,\" said State Attorney Bill Gladstone of the Fifth Judicial District. \"This was nothing short of ambush.\"\n\nGrinnell said a search warrant was executed on the home after it was cleared, discovering a surplus of firearms -- including high-caliber rifles, pistols and shotguns -- staged in the living room. Gas masks, body armor, Ghillie suits, medical bags and anti-government propaganda and conspiracy theory related media were among other items found throughout the home, he said.\n\nJulie Sulpizio later told deputies that \"God speaks to her\" and that she was trying to lure the neighbors she's accused of assaulting to her home so her husband could kill them, according to the sheriff's office. She faces charges including first-degree premeditated murder of a law enforcement officer, seven counts of attempted murder and felony battery.\n\n\"Our sheriff's office family is hurting, and all of

She ripped his hair out, and we couldn't get her off of him,\" Wilbanks said.\n\nHerrell confirmed the woman was Baker Acted, but she then made a request to deputies. He said she asked them to check on the home down the street. It was her own home.\n\nREAD: Central Florida officials react to shooting in Lake County\n\nThere, deputies thought they could be responding to a burglary in progress. But in reality, Herrell said there were three armed suspects: the man who was the husband of the Baker Acted woman and two daughters.\n\nDeputies heard commotion inside the home and saw an open door. Herrell said they started to walk in.\n\n\"At that point, they were met with heavy, heavy gunfire,\" Herrell said.\n\nThe gunfire knocked Master Deputy Bradley Michael Link to the ground inside the home. Master Deputy Harold Howell was shot in the arm but managed to get away from the gunfire.\n\nLake County's Street Crimes Unit, including four SWAT officers, then breached the home to try to rescue Link who was still inside the house.

They had stock piled firearms, ammunition, MREs, canned goods and nonperishable food items,\" Herrell said.\n\nThere is also a question about the woman who originally attacker her neighbors. Did she lure deputies to the home? Lake County Sheriff's Office said that's still being investigated but did say the three suspects ambushed deputies.\n\nInvestigators have not yet identified the suspects.

She was arrested and taken away.\n\nBut when deputies entered the woman's home last Friday night, her husband and daughters ambushed them, then killed themselves after a bloody shootout authorities are still trying to untangle.\n\nThe latest details of what happened before and during the shootout that killed 28-year-old Deputy Bradley Michael Link and injured two other deputies were delivered Monday afternoon by a tearful Lake County Sheriff Peyton Grinnell, as he also announced the arrest of Julie Ann Sulpizio, 48, for first-degree murder.\n\nThe shootings came at the hands of Julie Ann Sulpizio's husband Michael Sulpizio, 49, and her daughters Cheyenne, 23, and Savannah, 22. Grinnell said much of the incident was captured on Link's body-worn camera. The footage has not been released.\n\nA neighbor first called deputies around 7:45 p.m. Friday, saying Julie Ann Sulpizio, 48, was roaming the neighborhood and accosting people.\n\n\"Michael, Gabriel, Timothy: it's time now to protect my children,\" Julie Ann Sulpizio said as she was handcuffed outside her home, according to Grinnell, in an apparent reference to guardian angels. She was later admitted into the hospital under the Baker Act.\n\nLater, Lake County deputies entered the Sulpizios' home where they had found two dead dogs in the front yard. As they went through the door, the trio ambushed them, shooting Link multiple times and trapping him in the house. Other deputies retreated, and awaited backup.\n\nIn the video, Grinnell said, one of the daughters was heard saying, \"My king will kill all of you.\" At 9:26 p.m., SWAT deputies arrived to rescue Link. But two deputies -- Master Deputy Harold Howell and Deputy 1st Class Stefano Gargano -- were shot during the operation, with Gargano being struck by gunfire multiple times as he led the team into the building.\n\nLink's camera continued to record as the situation unfolded. In the hours following the first confrontation with the deputies, a woman can be heard contemplating suicide, according to Grinnell. By 11:02 p.m., two gunshots can be heard in quick succession, followed by a third shortly after.\n\nCheyenne and Savannah Sulpizio were later found dead by suicide along with their father Michael, who died at a hospital, Grinnell said.\n\nGargano, who was in critical condition over the weekend, was declared stable after a series of surgeries, Lt. John Herrell told reporters on Monday. Howell, who was shot in the the shoulder, will make a full recovery.\n\nDetective Josh Mercer, who interviewed Julie Ann Sulpizio, said in the press conference she appeared to be pleased with what happened.\n\n\"She was joyful,\" Mercer said. \"There was no remorse.\"\n\nInvestigators found a stockpile of weapons and other supplies inside the Sulpizios' home, along with \"anti-government propaganda and and conspiracy theory-related media,\" Grinnell said.\n\nWhether the Sulpizios were tied to extremist groups is under investigation.\n\n\"There were bumper stickers, handouts, flyers for things like Infowars, various podcasts,\" said Mercer, referring to the far-right media outlet run by conspiracy theorist Alex Jones. \"We're still going through a lot of evidence at this time.\"\n\nNews of Gargano's condition brought a sigh of relief in the room during Monday's press conference, as it was unclear whether he would survive. Grinnell commended him, Howell and the other deputies for their courage in the effort to rescue Link.\n\n\"They took action right away and for something bigger than them,\" Grinnell said. Lake County State Attorney Bill Gladson, who stood with Grinnell, said what the deputies did was \"nothing short of heroism.\"\n\n\"They are absolute heroes, and enough can't be said about how they saved lives that night,\" he added.\n\nGrinnell told reporters there were no reported warning signs that something like Friday's shooting would happen. The only other calls to the home were related to animal enforcement, and there were no reports of violence.\n\nAn Orlando Sentinel review of the family's criminal history yielded nothing, except for Michael Sulpizio's 1994 conviction for theft, for which he served probation.\n\nThe Sulpizios, however, mostly kept to themselves, according to investigators. Daughters Cheyenne and Savannah were pulled out of public school as early teens and homeschooled to shield them from outside influence. Other relatives, whom detectives have contacted, were also estranged.\n\n\"For the most part, Julie and Michael have been pretty much cut off from their family, by their own choice,\" Mercer said.\n\nAs for Sheriff's Office employees, Grinnell said mental health workers from the University of Central Florida have been working to help them process the shooting.\n\nEarlier on Monday, a procession escorted Link's body from Lake County to a funeral home in Clermont, along with his family. A GoFundMe page created for Link's family has raised nearly $116,000.\n\nLink's funeral is scheduled to take place Saturday at Real Life Church in Clermont. No plans have been made for the public to attend.\n\n\"When I tell you this agency is hurting, we're hurting, but we're going to get through this,\" Grinnell said. \"It takes more than just us -- it takes our community, and our community is doing that. I'm so thankful.\"", "source": {"uri": "police1.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Police1"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shootout", "type": "wiki", "score": 5,

She remains in custody without bond.\n\nThe Lake County deputy who was tragically killed in what has been described as an \"ambush\" by Sheriff Grinnell was identified over the weekend as Master Deputy Sheriff Bradley Michael Link, 28. The two others who were injured have been identified as Master Deputy Sheriff Harold Howell, 41, and Deputy First Class Stefano Gargano, 28.\n\n\"Our sheriff's office family is hurting, and all of you are helping us through this horrific nightmare,\" Grinnell said during a news conference on Monday.\n\nRELATED: Florida officers gather at procession for fallen Lake County deputy\n\nAccording to Sheriff Grinnell, deputies initially responded to a 911 call about a disturbance at a home on Brookside Drive. However, during that call, those deputies were directed to another home not far away.\n\nDeputies found the back door kicked in and heard a disturbance inside the residence. Upon entering the home, deputies were met with \"a hail of gunfire,\" the sheriff said. Deputy Link was struck and trapped inside the home and later died.\n\nBill Gladson, State Attorney for the Fifth Judicial Circuit, was also present at Monday's news conference and said this case is eligible for the death penalty.\n\nAuthorities continue to review all the evidence in the case, including video captured by Deputy Link's body-worn camera, which helped investigators piece together a timeline of the incident.\n\nSheriff Grinnell detailed the incident, starting with a 911 call received just before 8 p.m. on Friday. The caller reported a woman, later identified as Sulpizio, assaulting people and trespassing on their property on Brookside Drive. Sulpizio allegedly struck residents while making religious accusations and proclamations, the sheriff explained.\n\n\"The complainant stated she [Sulpizio] was acting religious, accusing them of being sinners, and she knows 'what they did,'\" the sheriff explained. \"They identified Julie Sulpizio as their neighbor, but Julie states that she is 'Helen, under God's will.'\"\n\nSheriff Grinnell said a deputy arrived at the scene and encountered Sulpizio with her hands concealed behind her back. Despite being ordered to back up, she approached the deputy, prompting him to draw his Taser. Sulpizio walked toward the deputy, which prompted a warning from the deputy.\n\n\"During a calm verbal exchange, Julie Sulpizio states that they, meaning the group of people that were present there, were involved in pedophilia,\" Sheriff Grinnell said. \"She again claims to be 'Helen,' and she asked one of the victims that she had battered, 'Who was your God?'\"\n\nThe sheriff said Sulpizio told the group, \"Julie is in heaven.\"\n\n\"She then went on to state, 'You see, the thing is, we needed to trick Lucy,' and we later learned [Lucy] to be a name she calls Lucifer.\" The sheriff said Sulpizio then pointed to the deputy and said, \"You are one of them.\"\n\nAs deputies attempted to arrest Sulpizio, they decided to conduct a welfare check at her home down the street. Upon arrival, they discovered two dead dogs outside the house and an open window with the screen kicked out, Sheriff Grinnell said. Finding this suspicious, they called for backup.\n\nDeputies Link and Howell entered the home through the back entrance, moving through the living room and hallway. Deputy Link went to the left, and Deputy Howell went to the right. According to the sheriff, Deputy Link, with his back turned, was ambushed by Sulpizio's husband, Michael, who was armed and ready, according to the sheriff.\n\nDeputy Link was shot in the back and, despite trying to crawl out, was shot several more times after running out of bullets, the sheriff explained. This was captured on his body camera, providing both audio and video evidence.\n\n\"His body-worn camera continuously recorded audio and video from within the residence, facing upward,\" the sheriff said.\n\nMichael and their two adopted daughters, Savannah and Cheyenne, were inside the home, with one daughter shouting, \"My King will kill all of you! You are Lucifer's children!\"\n\nThe sheriff indicated religious beliefs heavily influenced the situation. The home contained a stockpile of guns, ammunition, and bottled water, and lacked cell phones, regular phones, or a television, suggesting they were isolated from society. Detectives said they also found what they called \"anti-government propaganda\" and material from conspiracy theory-related media.\n\nThe SWAT team arrived, and Deputy Gargano, who also entered the laundry room, was shot. His team managed to pull him out of the home.\n\nBody camera footage from Deputy Link revealed that Michael and his daughters discussed suicide before being found dead with gunshot wounds to their heads, according to the investigation.\n\nSheriff Grinnell said Sulpizio appeared to show no remorse and was described as \"joyful.\" She was arrested using Deputy Link's handcuffs. She had been under observation in the hospital for the past few days, leading to her arrest.\n\nFOX 35 News has learned more about the family that the Lake County Sheriff's Office says ambushed deputies, killing one and injuring two others.\n\nWhen horrible things happen, neighbors often say they could never have seen this coming. In the case of the Sulpizio family, people might not have expected something so horrible as this - but they wouldn't say it came out of nowhere.\n\n\"I always found them weird. I never really talked to them,\" one neighbor told FOX 35 News. \"They just give me weird vibes.\"\n\nThat family recorded a video the night of the ambush, showing deputies going up to the Sulpizio family's home and knocking out a glass window. They called out that they were with the sheriff's office but didn't get an answer.\n\n\"It just goes to show, you never know,\" said Dan Williams, who's lived in the area for 13 years. \"All of a sudden, chaos.\"\n\n\"If you got that bad vibe about someone you stay away from them,\" said another neighbor, Michael Dietiker. \"Weird.\"\n\nAnother man who sent FOX 35 a video from outside the property said the same thing - that he got bad vibes from the family.\n\nAnd many people had violent interactions with the family in the past.\n\n\"Like a month and a half ago, they had threatened to shoot my brother for riding the little go-kart down the road,\" one neighbor said. \"[Michael Sulpizio] said like, 'Oh, like next time I see you riding that thing with your friend, I'm going to put a bullet in both of y'all.\"\n\nDietiker witnessed an incident like that as well.\n\n\"He chased someone from the road to their house in his truck and was trying to kill that kid.\"\n\nIn another incident within the past couple of months, Dietiker says Michael Sulpizio stopped his truck in the middle of the road to block it off, threatening Dietiker's fianc\u00e9e.\n\n\"My fianc\u00e9e is out trying to talk to him because he is screaming in her face, telling her that he's going to shoot my dog in the face.\"\n\nDietiker is the one who first called 911 on Friday after he said Julie Sulpizio started attacking his fianc\u00e9 and a couple of other people.\n\nWhen deputies showed up, Sheriff Grinnell said Julie Sulpizio was acting erratically, calling herself Helen and God and also saying she was working in the service of God. She said her neighbors were pedophiles and that she hoped to trick Lucifer.\n\n\"We needed to trick the evil to come out,\" the Sheriff says she stated.\n\nThe sheriff said she later admitted she was trying to lure Dietiker and his fianc\u00e9 to her home so she could kill him.\n\nThe Lake County Sheriff's Office provided a statement on the passing of Master Deputy Link.\n\n\"Master Deputy Link, 28, first became part of the Lake County Sheriff's Office as a young Explorer. A graduate of Lake Minneola High School in 2015, he served in the Army Reserves prior to being hired as a deputy sheriff by the Polk County Sheriff's Office in 2017. In October 2019, Master Deputy Link joined our agency as a deputy sheriff, where he quickly became part of our family and faithfully served our citizens with courage and zeal. Brad, as our Sheriff's Office family knew him, touched the lives of all who were blessed enough to work with him; his contributions and the impact of this loss will not soon be forgotten.\"\n\nFlorida sheriff, police departments react to deadly shooting that left Lake County deputy dead, 2 others hurt\n\nA GoFundMe has been created for Master Deputy Link to help support his loved ones. A funeral service is planned for Saturday, Aug. 10, at 11 a.m. in Clermont at Real Life Christian Church at 1501 Steve's Rd.\n\nOn Saturday, the Lake County Sheriff's Office also identified the two deputies who were shot and being treated at Central Florida hospitals.\n\nMaster Deputy Sheriff Harold Howell, 41, joined the Lake County Sheriff's Office in 2005 and became a K9 deputy in 2011, the sheriff's office said in a news release.\n\nHe responded with Master Deputy Link to the house in Eustis and was shot in the arm. He remains in the hospital and is awaiting surgery.\n\nDeputy First Class Stefano Gargano, 28, was part of the rescue team that responded to the Eustis house to help Master Deputy Link.\n\nAs he entered the house, he and the team \"immediately encountered gunfire.\" He was shot numerous times, the sheriff's office said,\n\nDeputy Gargano remains hospitalized, and authorities are hopeful he will make a full recovery.", "source": {"uri": "fox13news.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FOX 13 Tampa Bay"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_camera",

In fact, they thought they had a possible burglary in progress. As they were posting up on the house, they could hear commotion inside. They tried to order the people out. No one came out, so at that point, they made entry of the home at which time they were immediately met with heavy, heavy gunfire.\"\n\nHerrell said the shooters were the woman's husband and two daughters - Michael Sulpizio, 48;

According to the Lake County Sheriff's Office, this was the moment when 28-year-old Deputy Bradley Link was fatally shot.\n\nA second video shows a SWAT team entering the home shortly after. This was followed by another exchange of gunfire.\n\nSheriff Peyton Grinnell described the incident as \"an ambush.\"\n\nOn Sunday night, a large group of law enforcement officers gathered at First Baptist Church Tavares. They were there to discuss the shootings and speculate on the motive. Among those in attendance was Deputy Link's wife, Brittany.\n\nThe vigil closed to the media, also included prayers for the speedy recovery of the two wounded deputies, Stefano Gargano and Harold Howell.\n\n\"We're a community that pulls together when we need to. We're a community of law-abiding citizens,\" vigil organizer Matthew Robinson told WESH 2 News.\n\nShannon Cook, another organizer, expressed her heartbreak over the incident. She called it \"a whole new level of evil.\"\n\nThe initial cellphone video shows deputies responding to a disturbance at a home on Brookside Drive in the Orlando Hills community in Eustis. After hearing a loud commotion inside, five deputies entered the home, with one remaining at the doorway. It was at this point that shots were fired.\n\nLink was gravely wounded. Howell, shot in the arm, managed to escape.\n\nDuring a second attempt to rescue Link, Gargano was critically wounded. He is expected to undergo surgery on Monday.\n\nBy the time control of the home was regained, Link was found dead. The bodies of a man and two young women were also found.\n\nA third woman believed to be the cause of the original disturbance, was taken into custody for a mental health evaluation.\n\nSeveral neighbors who claim to have been attacked by the woman spoke to WESH 2 News. Austin Humphrey described a chaotic scene.\n\n\"She was talking about how she was hell and God's wife, and we were all demons, and our dogs were hell hounds and all of this, and it was just a crazy and insane moment,\" Humphrey said.\n\nThe sheriff's office identified the deceased residents as Michael Sulpizio, 49, and his daughters, Savannah and Cheyenne Sulpizio, both in their early 20s. They believe all three committed suicide.\n\nNeighbors identified the woman who was taken into custody as Julia Jefferson.

She was really upset,\" said Dietiker.\n\nDietiker says once deputies went to Sulpizio's home down the street, they heard the gunfire.\n\n\"There were officers running up and down the road. There was the barrage of gunfire,\" said Dietiker. \"You could hear the sheriffs from all the different [agencies] running down the road because they're out of ammo.\"\n\nInvestigators say when deputies first arrived at the woman's home to check on the people inside, they initially thought the house had been burglarized.\n\n\"They could hear a commotion inside,\" said Lt. John Herrell. \"They tried to order the people out. No one came out.\"\n\nLt. John Herrell describes what they were met with as a \"real-life nightmare.\"\n\n\"They made entry into the home and were immediately met with heavy, heavy, gunfire,\" said Lt. Herrell.\n\nLt. Herrell says Master Deputy Sheriff Bradley Link, the first deputy inside the home, was shot and was not able to retreat. Master Deputy Sheriff Harold Howell was shot in the arm but was able to get out of the house.\n\nWhen backup arrived, Deputy First Class Stefano Gargano was shot in the abdomen and the arm. He has undergone several surgeries since Friday night and is in critical condition, according to the sheriff's office.\n\nLt. Herrell says local and state investigators are working to learn every detail about the situation deputies walked into. Herrell says Sulpizio was taken into custody under the Baker Act for a mental health evaluation. She was arrested Monday afternoon.\n\nLake County Sheriff Peyton Grinnell said that during her interview, Sulpizio said she was trying to lure the neighbors to her residence so a family member could kill them.\n\n\"We're looking at the call notes when the initial call came in. They said she was kind of incoherent, out of her mind, talking about spiritual stuff,\" said Lt. Herrell.\n\nInvestigators believe three people inside the home shot at law enforcement - Michael Sulpizio, 48, and his two adopted daughters, Cheyenne, 23, and Savannah, 22.\n\n\"What our detectives have found throughout the course of our investigation is this dwelling was described as almost a bunker-style dwelling,\" said Lt. Herrell. \"They had stock-piled firearms, ammunition, MREs, canned goods, as well as non-perishable items, and what they've found as they've gone through this house is a lot of literature to suggest that they were very much anti-government leaning people.

She also faces several other charges. Sulpizio was detained pursuant to the state's Baker Act during a visit to her home on Brookside Drive.\n\nThe clash that took place Friday night has been described as an ambush. After the shooting, a search warrant was executed at the home, and deputies found more than 20 firearms, ranging from high-caliber rifles to pistols and shotguns. They were gathered and staged all around in the living room area.\n\nAmmunition also had been stockpiled in the living room, Grinnell told reporters at the news conference. The FBI and other law enforcement were called to the scene.\n\nWhat happened in Eustis on the evening of Aug. 2, 2024, was more disturbing than most horror films or true crime stories.\n\nDeputies responded to a complaint that Sulpizio was harassing her neighbors.\n\n\"This turned physical, as the trespasser, later identified as Julie Sulpizio, began striking the complainant's wife, his father and others,\" Grinnell said. \"The complainant stated she (Sulpizio) was 'acting religious,' accusing them of being sinners, and she said that she knows what they did.\"\n\nA corporal confronted Sulpizio and showed her a Taser. Its flicker was the light of God, she told him. Deputies also found two dead dogs outside her front door. Lake County animal welfare officials were called to the house in recent months for a reason related to the dogs.\n\nThe corporal subdued her by making her lie on the ground on her back. Grinnell said that Sulpizio, while on her back, gave what seemed like a command: \"Let's do this now!\" followed by \"I can feel him\" and yelled out, \"Michael Gabriel Timothy, it's time now to protect my children!\" just before other deputies arrive at the scene.\n\nMaster Deputy Bradley Link, 28, entered left as Master Deputy Harold Howell and another deputy entered right from a back laundry room just after 8 p.m. Link's bodycam captured Michael Sulpizio, 49, in a room he passed wearing black body armor, waiting with an automatic rifle on the arm of the sofa. Sulpizio ambushed Link while his back was turned to him and expended several rounds of bullets. Link, lying on his back, returned fire.\n\nHowell was also struck from a projectile that came from the area of where Michael Sulpizio was positioned, the sheriff said. A neighbor had told deputies on the scene that Sulpizio had threatened them a few days before their visit Friday.\n\nHe told them, \"The next time I see you, I'm going to shoot you,\" while addressing their children, Grinnell recounted.\n\nOther deputies arrived on the scene after Link was shot. They called out to get Link to crawl to them. At 9:24 p.m., a woman shouted while racking a firearm, \"My king will kill all of you. You are Lucifer's children!\"\n\nMaster Deputy Stefano Gargano and members of the Lake County SWAT team entered using a ballistic shield as cover while moving through the laundry room into the threshold of the hallway. Gargano was shot through the wall multiple times by a high-caliber round, causing him to be incapacitated.\n\nOther deputies extracted Link. Two women were inside the house: Savannah Sulpizio, 23; and Cheyenne Sulpizio, 22. They were Julie Sulpizio's two biological daughters, whom Michael Sulpizio had adopted. The young women died from self-inflicted gunshot wounds.\n\nMaster Deputy Link, who was airlifted, died, as did Michael Sulpizio. Julie Sulpizio was kept under watch at AdventHealth Hospital and arrested on Monday. She is now in \"protective custody.\"\n\nDuring the news conference, Grinnell and Gladson answered questions on the puzzling motive of what seemed like an organized effort by a husband, his wife and two daughters.\n\nGladson said that antigovernment literature was found and other evidence suggesting that they read up on conspiracy theories.\n\nNo violence to the neighbors or among themselves had been reported to the sheriff's office before the incident. Jefferson's mother and extended family members reached by investigators said that the Eustis family had been out of touch with them and they were just now learning of the violence that transpired Aug. 2.\n\nGargano, almost killed while attempting to rescue Link, looks to be on the mend. He underwent his third surgery Monday and is now listed in stable condition. Deputy Howell underwent a second surgery on his arm and is also expected to make a full recovery to include full mobility of his left arm.\n\nAs for how the LCSO staff are dealing with the aftermath of the incident, \"We have a partnership with the University of Central Florida; it's called UCF Restores,\" Grinnell said of grief counselors sent to the sheriff's office by the college.\n\nGrinnell had more than 80 employees speak with the counselors on the first day.\n\n\"We want to make sure that their wellbeing is good,\" Grinnell said. \"There's a lot of heads hung low here.

Lake County Master Deputy Bradley Michael Link, 28, died of his injuries, while Deputy First Class Stefano Gargano was shot and critically injured and Master Deputy Sheriff Harold Howell was shot and wounded.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nLt. John Herrell on Monday told News 6 more about the family at the center of the attack.\n\nHerrell said Julie Jefferson Sulpizio and her husband, Michael Sulpizio, kept to themselves and had very few occasions to call police.\n\nHe said they encountered Julie Jefferson Sulpizio first late Friday night.\n\n\"This lady (Julie) then sent them to this house under the guise of conducting a well-being check,\" Herrell said on Saturday. \"She said something to the effect that you need to go down to this house and check on the people there, so the deputies went down to this house, and it appeared that the house had been burglarized. In fact, they thought they had a possible burglary in progress. As they were posting up on the house, they could hear commotion inside. They tried to order the people out. No one came out, so at that point, they made entry of the home at which time they were immediately met with heavy, heavy gunfire.\"\n\nHerrell said the shooters were the woman's husband and two daughters - Michael Sulpizio, 48; Cheyenne, 23; and Savannah, 22.\n\nHerrell said all three appeared to have fatally shot themselves.\n\n[STORY CONTINUES BELOW VIDEO]\n\n\"This dwelling has been described as almost a bunker-style dwelling,\" Herrell said. \"They had stockpiled firearms, ammunition, MREs and non-perishable food items.\"\n\nHe said they also found antigovernmental literature.\n\nHerrell told News 6 his team is working to find out more about the family's motives.\n\nJulie's mother told News 6 on Monday that she was shocked to hear what happened.\n\nHer daughter was sent for mental health treatment immediately following the shooting. She said she was still undergoing treatment on Monday.\n\nShe told News 6 she had no idea her daughter was antigovernment, and added that she is mourning the loss of her two granddaughters.\n\nA News 6 investigation showed one of the last known contacts the Sulpizios had with Lake County sheriff's deputies was in May 2023.

The two others who were injured have been identified as Master Deputy Sheriff Harold Howell, 41, and Deputy First Class Stefano Gargano, 28.\n\n\"Our sheriff's office family is hurting, and all of you are helping us through this horrific nightmare,\" Grinnell said during a news conference on Monday.\n\nAccording to Sheriff Grinnell, deputies initially responded to a 911 call about a disturbance at a home on Brookside Drive. However, during that call, those deputies were directed to another home not far away, where, upon entering, they were met with \"a hail of gunfire,\" the sheriff said. Deputy Link was struck and trapped inside the home and later died.\n\nSheriff Grinnell said a 911 call reported a woman, later identified as Sulpizio, assaulting people and trespassing on property. Sulpizio allegedly struck residents while making religious accusations and proclamations, the sheriff explained.\n\n\"The complainant stated she [Sulpizio] was acting religious, accusing them of being sinners, and she knows 'what they did,'\" the sheriff explained. \"They identified Julie Sulpizio as their neighbor, but Julie states that she is 'Helen, under God's will.'\"\n\nRELATED: Florida officers gather at procession for fallen Lake County deputy\n\nGrinnell said a deputy arrived at the scene and encountered Sulpizio with her hands concealed behind her back. Despite being ordered to back up, she approached the deputy, prompting him to draw his Taser. Sulpizio walked toward the deputy, which prompted a warning from the deputy.\n\n\"During a calm verbal exchange, Julie Sulpizio states that they, meaning the group of people that were present there, were involved in pedophilia. She again claims to be 'Helen,' and she asked one of the victims that she had battered, 'Who was your God?'\"\n\nThe sheriff said Sulpizio told the group, \"Julie is in heaven.\"\n\n\"She then went on to state, 'You see, the thing is, we needed to trick Lucy,' and we later learned [Lucy] to be a name she calls Lucifer.\" The sheriff said Sulpizio then pointed to the deputy and said, \"You are one of them.\"\n\nEventually, another deputy arrived, and Sulpizio was handcuffed and taken into custody.\n\nAfter deputies arrested Sulpizio, they decided to conduct a welfare check at her home down the street. Upon arrival, they discovered two dead dogs outside the house and an open window with the screen kicked out, Sheriff Grinnell said. Finding this suspicious, they called for backup.\n\nDeputies Link and Howell entered the home through the back entrance, moving through the living room and hallway. Deputy Link went to the left, and Deputy Howell went to the right. According to the sheriff, Deputy Link, with his back turned, was ambushed by Michael Sulpizio, Julie's husband, who was armed and ready, according to the sheriff.\n\nDeputy Link was shot in the back and, despite trying to crawl out, was shot several more times after running out of bullets, the sheriff explained, adding that this incident was captured on his body camera, providing both audio and video evidence.\n\nRELATED: Late Lake County deputy's bodycam reveals timeline of ambush\n\nMichael Sulpizio and their two adopted daughters, Savannah and Cheyenne, were inside the home. The SWAT team arrived, and Deputy Gargano, who also entered the laundry room, was shot. His team managed to pull him out of the house.\n\nBody camera footage from Deputy Link revealed that Michael and his daughters discussed suicide before being found dead with gunshot wounds to their heads, according to the investigation.\n\nSheriff Grinnell said Julie Sulpizio appeared to show no remorse and was described as \"joyful.\" She was arrested using Deputy Link's handcuffs. She had been under observation in the hospital for the past few days, leading to her arrest.\n\nThe sheriff said his deputies saved the lives of several neighbors because the suspect was allegedly planning to kill them first.\n\n\"If you got that bad vibe about someone, you stay away from them,\" said neighbor Michael Dietiker, who placed the initial 911 call.\n\nSheriff Grinnell said Sulpizio later admitted she was trying to lure Dietiker and his fianc\u00e9e to her home so that she could kill him.\n\nBill Gladson, State Attorney for the Fifth Judicial Circuit, was also present at Monday's news conference and said this case is eligible for the death penalty. Authorities continue to review all the evidence in the case, including body-worn camera video.", "source": {"uri": "fox35orlando.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FOX 35 Orlando"}, "authors": [],

Harrell said the deputies were \"ambushed,\" and met with a barrage of bullets inside a Eustis, Florida home. \"They were immediately met with heavy gunfire,\" he said.\n\nThe gunfire stemmed from a well-being check after deputies initially responding to a distressed call about a woman attacking her neighbors, according to the sheriff's office.\n\n\"She was incoherent and out of her mind, talking about spiritual stuff,\" Lt. Herrell said. \"She was attacking people in the neighborhood. She was trying to get dogs to attack people.\"\n\nThe woman, then led deputies to a home for a well-being check where they were met with heavy gunfire, according to deputies. Master Deputy Sheriff Bradley Link was killed and two others wounded.\n\nThe Sheriff's Office says three suspects who fired the shots at deputies were living in a bunker-style home.\n\n\"They had stockpiled firearms, ammunition, MREs, canned goods, and nonperishable food items,\" said Harrell.\n\nLCSO confirmed to FOX35 two adopted daughters and their father are the suspects. All of the suspects are dead from self-inflicted gunfire, according to officials. \"There is no indication that they were struck with any return fire from our deputies,\" he said.\n\nThe suspects, appeared to be doomsday preppers with anti-government literature inside the home.\n\nHarrell said it was a \"bizarre situation.\" \"Our deputies obviously didn't realize what they were going into at that time. They thought they were going there to do a well-being check.\"\n\nThe woman who the sheriff's office said led deputies to the house, was sent to a mental health facility Friday evening.

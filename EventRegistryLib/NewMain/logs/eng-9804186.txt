Former Jets tight end Anthony Becht will succeed him alongside play-by-play man Bob Wischusen.\n\nBut Lyons' 45-year association with the organization will continue. He will be an \"ambassador\" for the team, serving in a variety of roles that include engaging with fans and business partners as well as making media appearances on the team's digital and broadcast programming.\n\nLyons, 67, played for the Jets from 1979-89 as a defensive lineman and is a member of the team's Ring of Honor. He and Wischusen began together as the radio team for the 2002 season.\n\nThe Jets this season will move from their longtime radio home on ESPN New York to Q104.3-FM.\n\n\"[I'm] definitely going to miss the booth, because there's been a 22-year relationship up there with Bob and [producer] Joe [Loughran] and all the guys,\" Lyons told Newsday. \"But I'm excited about this new opportunity.\"\n\nLyons said he first spoke to Jets president Hymie Elhai two years ago about the ambassador role.\n\n\"I think the timing is right, not just for the organization, but also for myself,\" Lyons said. \"You know, 22 years up in the booth, 45 years being with the organization, and I'm very thankful to Hymie and [communications vice president Eric [Gelfand] and [owner] Woody [Johnson] for giving me this opportunity.\"\n\nBecht, who turned 47 on Thursday, played in the NFL from 2000-2011, the first five of those seasons with the Jets, for whom he scored 17 touchdowns.\n\nSince retiring he has done TV analysis for college and pro games, including for Jets preseason games. Quincy Enunwa will work with Wischusen for the Jets' first two preseason games, and Becht will make his debut for the Aug. 24 game against the Giants.\n\nBecht will continue to serve as head coach of the United Football League's St. Louis Battlehawks, a job he has held the past two seasons.\n\nLyons said he recommended Becht to the Jets.\n\n\"They allowed me to say, you know what, if I'm going to slide into another role, who do I think would be the person that would fit in?\" Lyons said. \"A sign of respect was, I suggested Anthony, and they said, well, we'll look into it.\"\n\nLyons will continue his work with the Marty Lyons Foundation, which he founded in 1982 and which grants wishes to children with terminal or life-threatening illnesses, among Lyons' other charitable endeavors.\n\n\"The way I'm going to look at this [Jets] position, I'm just very grateful to the organization to be in place with them for 45 years,\" he said. \"That's truly an honor, because the organization really doesn't owe me anything.\n\n\"I owe the organization, so they're giving me another opportunity to take on a different role, and I'm happy with it. I'm content with it, and I look forward to it.\"\n\nLyons missed only four games on radio in his 22 seasons, when he suffered a stroke in 2017 and missed the preseason. He has remained a fan favorite, even among fans not old enough to have seen him play.\n\n\"I have a great deal of respect for the fans, what they've done for me personally, as a player, as a broadcaster, and also what they've done for the Foundation,\" he said. \"I'm one of those players that definitely appreciates everything that they've done for me.\"\n\nWhen Lyons was inducted into the Ring of Honor in 2013, Wischusen said, \"Marty will never be inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. He's not going to see his bust some day in Canton. But some players mean more to their team and more to their community than the outside world will ever understand.\n\n\"If there was a Hall of Fame that combined athletic achievement with charity, benevolence, love, being a great father and a great friend, Marty Lyons would be a first-ballot inductee.\"", "source": {"uri": "newsday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsday"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Becht", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Becht"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Wischusen", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bob Wischusen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyon", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lyon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lyon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newsday", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Newsday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lineman (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marty_Lyons", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marty Lyons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WEPN-FM", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "WEPN-FM"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_commentator", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sports commentator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quincy_Enunwa", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quincy Enunwa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_of_Honor", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ring of Honor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "St. Louis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Football_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pro Football Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stroke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canton,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canton, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Canton, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://cdn.newsday.com/ace/c:Y2NiNTdlZWItZjNiNC00:ZmVmOTA4/landscape/1280", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9804186", "eventUri": "eng-9804186", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-24", "textStart": 1753, "textEnd": 1760}], "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 235, "relevance": 1}

In his new role, the New York Sack Exchange Legend will maintain a focus on engaging Jets fans at events, assist the organization on business development opportunities, and maintain a prevalent role commentating on the team via the club's digital and broadcast programming. Selected in the first-round of New York's historic 2000 draft, former Jet Anthony Becht will assume the responsibility of color analyst for the organization's radio broadcast.\n\nPrior to moving into this role, Lyons served as the analyst for the Jets radio broadcast since 2002. The Ring of Honor member said, \"First, I want to thank the Good Lord for allowing me to live out my dream. 45 years with the Jets, and many more to come. I want to thank all the guys in the radio booth for a great 22 years.

To my friend Anthony Becht, I wish you the best of luck. You're in good hands. Have a great season.\"\n\n\"On behalf of the entire organization and the fan base, I want to thank Marty for his continued contribution to the Jets organization,\" said team president Hymie Elhai. \"A true professional and respected member of our community, I am excited to further work with him in this new capacity while maintaining our ongoing support of the Marty Lyons Foundation as we have since 1982. I am also excited for Anthony. This opportunity enables him to expand his already strong connection with the Jets and our fans.\"\n\nAfter an 11-year playing career in the NFL, Becht has stayed close to the game of football, working as a television analyst for both the college and pro games, as well as color analyst for Jets pre-season games on CBS2 and on the team's digital pre- and post-game shows. Becht joins a team comprised of long-time play-by-play announcer Bob Wischusen, the Voice of the New York Jets, along with pregame, halftime, and postgame hosts Dan Graca and Greg Buttle. Becht's first game will be August 24 vs, the New York Giants. Quincy Enunwa will be in the radio booth for the August 10 game vs the Washington Commanders and August 17 game at the Carolina Panthers.\n\nBecht will continue as the head coach of the United Football League's St. Louis BattleHawks, whom he has coached the past two seasons.\n\nAnthony Becht shared the following: \"I am forever grateful to the New York Jets organization for again giving me an opportunity of a lifetime. Since the day I was drafted, this team has been an extraordinary part of my life, and I hope to convey gratefulness in the work I do in this new role.

I want to thank him for that friendship, for the laughter, for the support, for making me a better broadcaster and a better person. I'm also looking forward to working with Anthony Becht, who I've not only known since his playing days but have grown closer to in the years since.

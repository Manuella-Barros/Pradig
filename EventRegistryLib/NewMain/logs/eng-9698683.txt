With the Oilers, Skinner will make $3 million for his year of service.\n\nFinding forwards who could contribute at a team-friendly price was the biggest challenge facing the Stanley Cup runners-up entering free agency.\n\nOne of the ways the Oilers created additional salary cap space was by buying out goaltender Jack Campbell for the final three years of his deal, which saw him earn $5 million annually.\n\nEdmonton entered free agency Monday with seven unrestricted free agent forwards and the expectation that some of them might go elsewhere, such as Warren Foegele, who signed a three-year deal with the Los Angeles Kings.\n\nThe Oilers re-signed two of those seven UFAs -- Connor Brown and Corey Perry -- to one-year deals worth a combined $2.15 million. They then signed Kings forward Viktor Arvidsson to a two-year deal worth $4 million annually. They also signed defenseman Josh Brown for three years at $1 million annually.\n\nLater in the day, the Oilers also reportedly struck a new deal for Mattias Janmark, with the forward returning on a three-year deal worth $1.45 million annually.\n\nAnd just when it looked like the Oilers might have been done, they brought back NHL trade deadline day acquisition Adam Henrique on a two-year deal worth $3 million annually.\n\nWhile those signings saw the Oilers address their needs, it also saw them over the cap by an additional $2.54 million. It leaves the Oilers needing to reduce that figure while creating the additional space for restricted free agents Philip Broberg and Dylan Holloway, who need new deals which could likely force the club to shed cap space via trade.\n\nBy signing Skinner, Edmonton is getting someone who authored six 20-goal seasons -- among them three with 30-plus goals -- with the Carolina Hurricanes.\n\nThe Sabres were literally banking on Skinner to be a consistent goal-scoring threat, which he was in the first year of his deal when he scored a career-high 40 goals.\n\nBut the next few seasons would prove challenging as Skinner scored just 21 goals and 37 points over 112 games between the 2019-20 and 2020-21 seasons.\n\nEven though he bounced back to score 30 goals and 63 points in the 2021-22 season and another 35 goals and a career-high 82 points in 79 games during the 2022-23 season, Skinner had 24 goals and only 46 points this past season.\n\nIt was his third-fewest goals in his career when playing more than 64 games; his 46 points were the second fewest in a season in which he played more than 64 games.\n\nUltimately, it proved to be a level of production that was too costly for the Sabres but could come at the right price for the Oilers as they seek to win their first Stanley Cup since 1990.", "source": {"uri": "ktbb.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KTBB"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Skinner", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jeff Skinner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Campbell_(ice_hockey)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jack Campbell (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salary_cap", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Salary cap"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Forward (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo_Sabres", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Buffalo Sabres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goaltender", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Goaltender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmonton_Oilers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Edmonton Oilers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmonton", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Edmonton"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Edmonton"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mattias_Janmark", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mattias Janmark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Brown_(ice_hockey)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Josh Brown (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Foegele", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Warren Foegele"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Arvidsson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Viktor Arvidsson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connor_Brown_(ice_hockey)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Connor Brown (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corey_Perry", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Corey Perry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Henrique", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Adam Henrique"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Kings", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Kings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defenceman", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Defenceman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Hockey League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dylan_Holloway", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dylan Holloway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Broberg", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Philip Broberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolina_Hurricanes", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carolina Hurricanes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restricted_free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Restricted free agent"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work-Life_Balance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work-Life Balance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Mailing_List_Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Mailing List Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games/Mah_Jongg", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games/Mah Jongg", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://ktbb.com/post/wp-content/media/2022/12/facebook-og-1200630.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9698683", "eventUri": "eng-9698683", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 208, "relevance": 1}

Toronto was one of the teams in contention to sign the bought-out forward, but the Oilers beat them to his signing.\n\n\"He's going there [Edmonton] clearly to win. I mean, he could have signed for one year and $3 million in about ten spots,\" Johnston said on the July 2 episode of The Chris Johnston Show. \"I know the Leafs were among the teams that had talked to him and were trying to pitch him in the idea, 'Hey, you can play alongside Auston Matthews and Mitch Marner on our team!'\"\n\nSkinner signed an eight-year, $72 million contract with the Sabres in June 2019 but Buffalo cut him ahead of free agency before the 2024-25 season. After that, Skinner entered free agency and signed with the team of his choice.\n\nInstead of opting for the pairing of Matthews and Marner referenced by Johnston, Skinner ultimately decided he would be better off signing with the Oilers' duo of superstars comprised of Connor McDavid and Leon Draisaitl.\n\nSkinner signed a bargain deal with the Oilers inking a one-year, $3 million deal. The franchise announced the agreement on July 1. As a result, he went from potentially earning $9 million during each of the final two seasons of his contract with Buffalo to just that figure in a single year.\n\n\"For me personally, getting a chance to be a part of that group I think is a great feeling, it gets you excited,\" Skinner said Tuesday, via NHL.com. \"Obviously there's a ton of work to do. I think everyone realizes that.\n\n\"But being able to play with that group, I'm sure they've gained a lot of useful experience on the run they went on and I'm hoping to slide in, be a piece of the puzzle and contribute, and I'm excited to get going.\"\n\nThe Carolina Hurricanes drafted Skinner with the No. 7 pick in the 2010 NHL draft. He has amassed 357 goals and 313 assists for 670 total points in 1,006 games through the 2023-24 season.\n\nSkinner won the Calder Trophy as the NHL's best rookie in 2011 and he's coming off a 24-goal, 22-assist, 46-point season with the Sabres playing 74 games in 2024.\n\nAmong his new teammates, that 46-point figure was only topped in Edmonton by Zach Hyman, McDavid, and Draisaitl during the 2024 campaign. Furthermore, it also marked the third consecutive year for Skinner hitting the 45-point plateau.\n\nIn his 14-year career, however, Skinner has yet to play in an NHL playoff game, setting an NHL record. He became the first NHL player to hit the 1,000-game mark without a postseason appearance in April 2024.\n\nThe Oilers were one of the most active franchises at the start of free agency, signing at least 13 players, per Brian Swane of The Hockey Writers.\n\nTaking over Ken Holland after he departed the Oilers at the end of the season, new Oilers CEO Jeff Jackson completed a smooth job at the helm of the organization in his first offseason in that position.\n\nArvidsson and Skinner are the two biggest signings of Jackson's free-agency haul, something he discussed on July 1, via Daniel Nugent-Bowman of The Athletic.\n\n\"Both of those guys are going to add a really nice element to our top six,\" Jackson said.", "source": {"uri": "heavy.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Heavy"},

Signing him as a UFA on a team-friendly deal after the Buffalo Sabres bought out his $9 million contract, Skinner doesn't bring a lot of speed or physicality to the team, but he does know how to put the puck in the net. On a club as deep as the Oilers, he should have no trouble putting up another 20-plus goal season, maybe more.\n\nBut, on a roster this deep, opportunities may not come like they did in Buffalo.\n\nSo, what is a realistic expectation for the number of goals Skinner can score next season?\n\nLast season, Skinner posted 24 goals for the Sabres in 74 games. That's about 27 goals in 82 games. The two seasons prior, he had 30-plus goal campaigns, scoring 35 in 2022-23 and 33 in 2021-22. He's got a 40-goal season on his resume and three more 30-plus goal seasons. One could argue, in all of those years, he's never been on a team as loaded up front as this Oilers team is.\n\nUnless something drastic happens, Skinner will play with one of Connor McDavid and/or Leon Draisaitl; at times, maybe both. Skinner will get opportunities to score and he's good at finishing.\n\nIt's important to note that Skinner has been an important part of the power plays on the teams he's been a part of. He scored eight goals each of the last two seasons. He's not going to see nearly that much time on the power play in Edmonton. Skinner averaged 2:42 seconds per game on the man-advantage last season. He'll be lucky to get anything close to that as a second-unit guy in Edmonton.\n\nRelated: NHL Rumors: Maple Leafs, Predators, Flames, Jets, Senators\n\nThe Oilers' top unit power play won't be changing. As one of the best in the NHL, they play the lion's share of the time on ice for the team, often eating up 90 percent of any opportunity. Skinner will join names like Evander Kane, Darnell Nurse, Ryan McLeod, Corey Perry, Viktor Arvidsson, and Mattias Ekholm on the second unit. It's still going to be one of the stronger second units in the NHL, but it won't see a lot of ice time.\n\nPutting the over-under at 24 goals seems fair. It's what he scored last season and on this roster, he should do that without much issue, even if the power play time isn't available to him. Skinner said when talking to Edmonton media, \"My goal is to fit in and be a piece of the puzzle & bring the things that I do well to the team.\" It's key to remember though, his job is to score. That's why the Oilers signed him. He's that piece of the puzzle.\n\nConsidering Warren Foegele was able to get 20 goals with this team last season and Skinner is a much better scorer than Foegele (their games are different), my prediction is 28 goals, but I wouldn't be surprised to see him post 30.\n\nThis was an extremely solid signing by the Oilers. Skinner is the type of player Edmonton has needed on that second line for some time and while he's one year older, he's going to be playing with elite talent that will understand how to get him the puck in scoring positions. Skinner is savvy enough to figure out where to go and how to play with elite-level players. He shouldn't need a lot of time to get up and running.", "source": {"uri": "thehockeywriters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hockey Writers"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jim_parsons@thehockeywriters.com", "name": "Jim Parsons", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Skinner", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jeff Skinner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo_Sabres", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Buffalo Sabres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmonton_Oilers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Edmonton Oilers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Hockey League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmonton", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Edmonton"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Edmonton"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Buffalo, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Buffalo, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leon_Draisaitl", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Leon Draisaitl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nashville_Predators", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nashville Predators"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connor_McDavid", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Connor McDavid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottawa_Senators", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ottawa Senators"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_McLeod", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ryan McLeod"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Foegele", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Warren Foegele"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Arvidsson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Viktor Arvidsson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corey_Perry", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Corey Perry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mattias_Ekholm", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mattias Ekholm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darnell_Nurse", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Darnell Nurse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evander_Kane", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Evander Kane"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/Ice_Hockey", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/Ice Hockey", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work-Life_Balance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work-Life Balance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games/Mah_Jongg", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games/Mah Jongg", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://s3951.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Jeff-Skinner-Sabres-3.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9698683", "eventUri": "eng-9698683", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "wgt": 206, "relevance": 1}

Can't play in traffic. Doesn't go hard to the net. Too small at 5-11. Too slight at 187. Smooth skater -- that's the figure skating background -- but prone to long stretches of time when the goalscoring can go ice cold. Not great for someone primarily known as a scorer. And, up until the Buffalo Sabres bought out the final three years of his contract the other day, a player vastly overpaid for what he produces. Skinner isn't, and maybe never was, a $9 million per year player.\n\nOf course, none of which really matters to the Oilers, who took a calculated risk Monday and signed Skinner to a one-year deal worth $3 million. The Oilers added Skinner once the early rush to sign players slowed down. Now that his salary has shrunk by two-thirds, the risk/reward ratio suddenly tilts a little more favorably in the direction of the player. Because Skinner is just 32. He does have 1,006 NHL games under his belt. He was the Calder Trophy winner as the NHL's rookie of the year in 2011 -- and even in a down year like last year, still scored 24 goals in 74 games. In Edmonton, only Zach Hyman, Connor McDavid and Leon Draisaitl scored more than 24 goals last season. And prior to this year, Skinner had posted consecutive 30-goal seasons. So, he definitely represents a gamble worth taking.\n\nFrom Skinner's perspective, Edmonton is an attractive destination primarily for one reason. In a career that began 14 years ago, he's never played in a single NHL playoff game. That's an NHL record. With the Oilers, given that they were within a game of winning the Stanley Cup this past season, he'll almost certainly get a chance to end that drought. Along with Viktor Arvidsson signed earlier in the day, the Oilers added two natural scorers to their top nine -- for reasonable dollars. Considering how many players were already off the board by the time Skinner came to terms, that's a decent late-in-the-game move.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "eric_duhatschek@nytimes.com", "name": "Eric Duhatschek", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Skinner", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jeff Skinner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winger_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Winger (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo_Sabres", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Buffalo Sabres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmonton_Oilers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Edmonton Oilers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Hockey League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calder_Memorial_Trophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Calder Memorial Trophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmonton", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Edmonton"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Edmonton"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zach_Hyman", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zach Hyman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Arvidsson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Viktor Arvidsson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leon_Draisaitl", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Leon Draisaitl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connor_McDavid", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Connor McDavid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Spill_and_Spell", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Spill and Spell", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2024/07/01191146/GettyImages-1473288281-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9698683", "eventUri": "eng-9698683", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "wgt": 203, "relevance": 1}

Plus, they also signed defenseman Josh Brown for three years at $1 million annually.\n\nLater in the day, the Oilers also reportedly struck a new deal for Mattias Janmark with the forward returning on a three-year deal worth $1.45 million annually.\n\nWhile those signings saw the Oilers address their needs, it also saw them have less than $1.35 million in cap space at a time in which restricted free agents Philip Broberg and Dylan Holloway need new deals which could likely force the club to shed cap space via trade.\n\nBy signing Skinner, they're getting someone who has authored six, 20-goal seasons who also had three 30-goal seasons with the Carolina Hurricanes.\n\nThe Sabres were literally banking on the belief Skinner would give them a consistent goal-scoring threat, which he did in the first year of his deal when he scored a career-high 40 goals.\n\nIt's just that the next few seasons would prove challenging as Skinner scored just 21 goals and 35 points over 112 games between the 2019-20 and 2020-21 seasons.\n\nEven though he bounced back to score 30 goals and 63 points in the 2021-22 season and another 35 goals and a career-high 82 points in 79 games during the 2022-23 season, Skinner had 24 goals and 46 points.\n\nIt was his third-fewest goals in his career when playing more than 64 games; his 46 points were the second fewest in a season in which he played more than 64 games.\n\nUltimately, it proved to be a level of production that was too costly for the Sabres but could come at the right price for the Oilers as they seek to win their first Stanley Cup since 1990.", "source": {"uri": "espn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ESPN.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Campbell_(ice_hockey)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jack Campbell (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salary_cap", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Salary cap"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Forward (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goaltender", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Goaltender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmonton", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Edmonton"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Edmonton"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dylan_Holloway", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dylan Holloway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mattias_Janmark", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mattias Janmark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Broberg", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Philip Broberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Brown_(ice_hockey)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Josh Brown (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Foegele", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Warren Foegele"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Arvidsson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Viktor Arvidsson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connor_Brown_(ice_hockey)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Connor Brown (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corey_Perry", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Corey Perry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Kings", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Kings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defenceman", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Defenceman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restricted_free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Restricted free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolina_Hurricanes", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carolina Hurricanes"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work-Life_Balance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work-Life Balance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Mailing_List_Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Mailing List Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games/Mah_Jongg", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games/Mah Jongg", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://a3.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2024%2F0629%2Fr1352264_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9698683", "eventUri": "eng-9698683", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 198, "relevance": 1}

Barring some major breakdown, the Edmonton Oilers are shoo-ins to once again make a deep playoff run, and few deserve to play in the postseason more than Skinner.\n\nWhile some may believe Skinner signed an ill-fated contract in 2019, the truth is, he played well for the Sabres after former head coach Don Granato took over for Ralph Krueger in 2021. In the first full season without Krueger at the helm, Skinner scored 33 goals, once again tied his career-high of 63 points, and he followed that up with a 35-goal season and a new career-high of 82 points.\n\nHe didn't reach the same milestones this past season, but in his defense, Skinner was rarely 100 percent healthy, and he missed eight games thanks to various injuries. Still, 24 goals weren't half-bad, and joining a team that features Connor McDavid, Zach Hyman, Evan Bouchard, Viktor Arvidsson, Adam Henrique, and if he sticks around, Leon Draisaitl, Skinner is yet another key fixture on a stacked and fun Oilers team.\n\nDuring the latter half of the 2021-22 season and throughout 2022-23, Jeff Skinner was part of a surprising trio of first-liners that also featured Tage Thompson and Alex Tuch. The trio combined for 255 points and 118 goals that year, surpassing expectations by miles. And even if they couldn't duplicate those numbers in 2023-24, they were nevertheless solid when playing alongside one another.\n\nWhile the Sabres are taking a loss in moving on from Skinner, it's a massive gain for the Oilers, regardless of where they line him up - my guess is he will play next to Leon Draisaitl on the second line, but at this point, it's safe to say he will play in the top-six.\n\nIf Skinner regains the form we saw from him in 2022-23, I would be more than surprised if he wasn't the missing piece for this team to hoist its first Stanley Cup since 1990. Oilers fans watched their team come so close to pulling off an epic comeback in this past season's Stanley Cup Final, but it wasn't meant to be.\n\nBut Skinner, who through 1,006 games (and counting) has never even seen a playoff series, isn't just a solid scorer who will more than help this team win; he's got some added motivation to finally see a postseason series. And on a team as talented as the Edmonton Oilers, expect Skinner to more than do his part for the Oilers to remain the Western Conference's most dominant team.\n\nWe already talked about why this is Edmonton's gain, but let's discuss why the Sabres are losing a key asset. For one, there are no truly established players on the team who could adequately replace Skinner on the top line, even if there are intriguing options like JJ Peterka and Zach Benson.\n\nPeterka enjoyed a stellar season in 2023-24, and he could likely move up to the top line and emulate Skinner's success after he finished his second full NHL season with 28 goals. Zach Benson fell to the Blue and Gold in the 2023 NHL Draft and was such a revelation, his reward was a full NHL season at age 18.\n\nWhile Benson was one of the more obscure rookies last season and finished the year with just 11 goals and 30 points, he started figuring things out toward the end of 2023-24, foreshadowing what could be a major jump in 2024-25. But still, neither Peterka nor Benson has seen perennial success in the NHL, and unless the Sabres make a blockbuster trade, Skinner would have been their best option next to Tage Thompson and Alex Tuch this season, and no, Jason Zucker isn't the answer.\n\nBut, this is why the Sabres can't seem to put a winning team together - 13 years since their last playoff appearance - and it's why the Oilers look more than ready for another deep playoff and potential run for the Stanley Cup. Overall, the Oilers enjoyed a big win here by bringing in one of the NHL's more intriguing talents, who is still playing at a high level.", "source": {"uri": "oilonwhyte.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Oil On Whyte"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Skinner", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jeff Skinner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Krueger", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ralph Krueger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evan_Bouchard", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Evan Bouchard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zach_Hyman", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Zach Hyman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Arvidsson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Viktor Arvidsson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Granato", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Don Granato"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leon_Draisaitl", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Leon Draisaitl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connor_McDavid", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Connor McDavid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo_Sabres", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Buffalo Sabres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmonton_Oilers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Edmonton Oilers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Tuch", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alex Tuch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Henrique", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Adam Henrique"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tage_Thompson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tage Thompson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Zucker", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jason Zucker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Conference_(NHL)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Western Conference (NHL)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NHL_Entry_Draft", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NHL Entry Draft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Hockey League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmonton", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Edmonton"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Edmonton"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/Ice_Hockey", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/Ice Hockey", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Airsoft/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Airsoft/Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Theme_Merchandise", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Theme Merchandise", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_5237,h_2945,x_0,y_536/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/156/01j1tdk4r2epnzp5d349.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9698683", "eventUri": "eng-9698683", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

Despite the Sabres choosing to move in a different direction, Skinner still has good hockey left in the tank.\n\nEven though there were three years left on his contract, the Sabres chose to buy out those remaining years. Despite that, Skinner had shown to be productive and be a key contributor to their offensive attack. For two straight seasons (2021-22, 2022-23), he had back-to-back 30-goal seasons. His nose for the net and finishing ability were stellar for their offense.\n\nSkinner had a career year during the 2022-23 season with 82 points and 35 goals. His offensive impacts are notable, and he is also a precise passer. However, what he thrives in production, he lacks in defensive ability.\n\nSkinner is a forward who does not thrive with his defensive play. He is also not great on the forecheck, but he is great offensively. For a team needing added depth and an influx of offense, getting Skinner at this price point is a great move. Over the course of his career, he has 357 goals and 670 points in over 1,000 games played.\n\nYou can never have too much depth or too much offense. For a team looking to win a Stanley Cup and shore up the depth in their forward group, this is a great addition. Skinner has shown tremendous finishing ability and is a great depth scorer. For a guy who's hit the 30-goal mark five times and the 40-goal mark once, this is a great grab.\n\nSkinner gets to be a complementary piece on an Oilers team that lost in Game 7 of the Stanley Cup Final. He finds himself in a similar spot that Matt Duchene did last season, as he was bought out and brought into a contending team in the Dallas Stars. This is a great deal for both sides and for a player who has good hockey left in the tank.", "source": {"uri": "thehockeywriters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hockey Writers"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tommy_bennett@thehockeywriters.com", "name": "Tommy Bennett", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Skinner", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jeff Skinner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo_Sabres", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Buffalo Sabres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmonton_Oilers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Edmonton Oilers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Forward (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Duchene", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Matt Duchene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Stars", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Stars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/Ice_Hockey", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/Ice Hockey", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work-Life_Balance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work-Life Balance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://s3951.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Jeff-Skinner-Sabres-2.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9698683", "eventUri": "eng-9698683", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

We're super happy, very pleased to get both of them and look forward to next year with them in that group.\"", "source": {"uri": "nhl.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NHL.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Skinner", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jeff Skinner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolina_Hurricanes", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Carolina Hurricanes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Assist (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo_Sabres", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Buffalo Sabres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmonton_Oilers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Edmonton Oilers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Jackson_(ice_hockey,_born_1955)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jeff Jackson (ice hockey, born 1955)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NHL_Entry_Draft", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NHL Entry Draft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmonton", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Edmonton"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Edmonton"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Arvidsson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Viktor Arvidsson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Kings", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Kings"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games/Mah_Jongg", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games/Mah Jongg", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Spill_and_Spell", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Spill and Spell", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://media.d3.nhle.com/image/private/t_ratio16_9-size50/prd/thgrmi3waddbwlgnmnqz.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9698683", "eventUri": "eng-9698683", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-30", "textStart": 395, "textEnd": 402}], "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

The 32-year-old joins Edmonton after playing the last six seasons for the Buffalo Sabres. Before that, he spent the first eight years of his NHL career with the Carolina Hurricanes.\n\nSkinner's NHL resume is pretty well known. He won the Calder Trophy in 2011, has played in two All-Star Games, and is a 10-time 20-goal scorer.\n\nHe also has the infamous distinction of playing the most games (1,006) and scoring the most goals (357) in NHL history without appearing in a single Stanley Cup Playoff contest. But there are a lot of things that Oilers fans probably don't know about the 14-season NHL veteran. As it turns out, Skinner might have one of the most interesting childhoods in all of hockey.\n\nDuring his pre-teen years in Markham, Ont., Skinner was heavily involved with figure skating. And he was good. So good in fact that in 2004, an 11-year-old Skinner won bronze at the juvenile level at the Skate Canada Junior Nationals.\n\nDuring an interview with WGRZ-TV in Buffalo, Skinner explained how he first got into figure skating: \"My mom tells this story, that my sister was a figure skater and I went to the rink and she won a medal, and I said my mom, 'I want to win one of those', and she's like, 'Ok, well then you have to skate.'\"\n\nSkinner eventually chose to pursue hockey, which he \"enjoyed just a little bit more.\" But his figure skating roots are evident when he's playing hockey, especially with how good he is on his toes and edges. And even after giving up figure skating, he was still able to land an axel - on hockey skates, no less.\n\nHockey and figure skating were far from the only sports that a young Skinner participated in. He and his older brother, Ben Skinner, played soccer around Markham with another kid by the name of Steven Stamkos.\n\nThat's the same Stamkos who is a two-time Stanley Cup champ, has won the Maurice \"Rocket\" Richard Trophy twice, and played in seven NHL All-Star Games. And like Skinner, Stamkos also signed with a new team on Canada Day, joining the Nashville Predators after spending his entire 16-season NHL career with the Tampa Bay Lightning.\n\nImagine a youth soccer team featuring two players that would go on to score well over 900 goals (Stamkos has 555 in the regular season, 50 more in the playoffs) in the NHL, and counting.\n\nAs it turns out, Skinner has a few childhood chums that now possess a Stanley Cup ring. He played on a Toronto area minor hockey team that featured several future NHLers, including Devante Smith-Pelly and Tyler Toffoli, who won championships with the Washington Capitals in 2018 and the Los Angeles Kings in 2014, respectively.\n\nFormer Florida Panthers forwards Chase Balisy and John McFarland were also part of that team. But it was Skinner's reveal of one particular minor hockey teammate that got Oil Country talking, that being Edmonton's 60-goal scorer Zach Hyman.\n\n\"I'm not sure the history is well-known, I actually played minor hockey with him,\" Skinner said on Tuesday (July 2), during his initial Oilers media availability.\n\nTo top it off, this generational team was coached by Kevin Donoghue, brother of Canadian comic Gerry Dee, who starred in the TV sitcom Mr. Dee.\n\nBut that's not the only connection Skinner has to a famous comedian: When he was age nine, he had a small part in the 2002 dark comedy Death to Smoochy, starring the legendary Robin Williams. The flick also starred Edward Norton, a three-time Academy Award nominee (for American History X, Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance), and Primal Fear).\n\nSkinner was one of several young skaters from around Toronto that filmmakers cast as extras to appear in the climactic scene, which was shot at Maple Leaf Gardens.\n\nIn the scene, the villains attempt to assassinate children's TV character \"Smoochy\" (portrayed by Norton) during an ice show. Skinner's role is as one of the kids who are part of the show.\n\nRelated: Edmonton Oilers Sign Jeff Skinner to 1-Year Contract\n\nBetween mastering the performative art of figure skating and spending time on a movie set, Skinner obviously knows about drama. And that's not even mentioning the conflicting emotions of joy and envy that must come from watching so many friends party in hockey's penthouse while he can't even get a room on the first floor.\n\nCould there be a story more ready-made for Hollywood than Skinner finally getting to the playoffs after 16 years and helping Edmonton end its Stanley Cup drought after 35 years? Oilers fans hope that 2024-25 will be a blockbuster.", "source": {"uri": "thehockeywriters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hockey Writers"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Certainly it's gone better than was expected (or should that be feared), when considering the plethora of free agents they had to contend with combined with the lack of projected cap space for next season.\n\nYes, the Oilers didn't come through entirely unscathed, with it a major shame that players such as Warren Foegele and Vincent Desharnais chose to re-sign elsewhere. However, the organisation did extremely well/performed miracles, in bringing back the likes of Adam Henrique, Corey Perry, Calvin Pickard, Connor Brown, Mattias Janmark and Troy Stecher.\n\nIn addition, Jeff Jackson and company were able to bring in new faces, including Viktor Arvidsson and Jeff Skinner. As with everyone else mentioned, they signed for what can be termed as team-friendly deals.\n\nWith Skinner in particular, an interesting report has come out, courtesy of TSN's Chris Johnston. During Wednesday's edition of The Chris Johnston Show, the NHL insider claimed that the veteran sniper turned down the Leafs (among others), in order to sign with the Oilers.\n\nThe Leafs' angle apparently included enticing Skinner with the prospect of playing alongside players such as Auston Matthews and (assuming he stays in Toronto) Mitch Marner. Certainly, you can appreciate why this would be appealing to a lot of people.\n\nMore generally speaking, the Leafs are also a team which is a consistent contender. In this respect, they've been to the playoffs in each of the past eight seasons, which is how long Matthews and Marner have played in the NHL.\n\nDespite this however, Skinner rejected the Leafs' overtures to instead sign in Edmonton, which speaks volumes. Particularly when you consider he would have at least received the same -- if not more -- than the $3 million he will make with the Oilers on a one-year deal.\n\nThis tells you everything you need to know about how favourably the Oilers are compared to the Leafs as contenders. And this is despite having 'only' qualified for the playoffs six times in the past eight seasons.\n\nThat's because while the Leafs do make the postseason more, they have only won one playoff series during the time period in question. Whereas in Edmonton, the Oilers have won seven playoff series, including six in the previous three seasons, and coming within a whisker of winning it all this past season.\n\nWith all due respect to Matthews and Marner, it also helps the Oilers that the have the duo of Connor McDavid and Leon Draisaitl. One is the best player in the world, while the other regularly features in the top 5-10 of best NHL players.\n\nThis comparison of the players extends to the different levels of success all four have in the playoffs. Pure and simple, the Leafs duo are unable to rise to the occasion and replicate their regular seasons productivity when the pressure increases.\n\nConsider that Matthews has just 48 points in 55 playoff games, while Marner has only 50 in 57. Meanwhile, McDavid has 117 points in 74 games and Leon Draisaitl has 108 in the same number of appearances.\n\nAs a result of all this, the Oilers were able to convince Skinner to join the gang in Edmonton. As a result, it makes the roster arguably even stronger than the one which just went all the way to the Stanley Cup Final versus the Florida Panthers.\n\nAs we wrote on Tuesday, we consider Skinner an underrated, sneaky good signing. He's usually good for around 30 goals per season, and it was only in 2022-23 that he set a whole host of career highs, including 82 points and a +15 rating, along with a 60.5 Corsi For % in All Situations.\n\nThe 2010 seventh overall draft pick carries the burden of playing the most games in NHL history without making even one playoff appearance. Barring a disaster of epic proportions this should end in 2024-25, after a signing which hugely benefits both player and team.", "source": {"uri": "oilonwhyte.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Oil On Whyte"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Skinner", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jeff Skinner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mattias_Janmark", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mattias Janmark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Foegele", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Warren Foegele"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Arvidsson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Viktor Arvidsson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connor_Brown_(ice_hockey)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Connor Brown (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calvin_Pickard", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Calvin Pickard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corey_Perry", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Corey Perry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederik_Andersen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Frederik Andersen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Henrique", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Adam Henrique"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Maple_Leafs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toronto Maple Leafs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troy_Stecher", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Troy Stecher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo_Sabres", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Buffalo Sabres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmonton_Oilers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Edmonton Oilers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Hockey League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmonton", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Edmonton"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Edmonton"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitch_Marner", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mitch Marner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auston_Matthews", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Auston Matthews"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leon_Draisaitl", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Leon Draisaitl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connor_McDavid", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Connor McDavid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Panthers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Florida Panthers"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/Ice_Hockey", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/Ice Hockey", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Craps", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Craps", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_4500,h_2531,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/GettyImages/mmsport/156/01j1yejk05ag9h11xehn.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9698683", "eventUri": "eng-9698683", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3568627450980393, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

However, as per the oft-repeated saying, the show must go on.\n\nIn this respect, the Oilers -- like the rest of the NHL -- have been extremely busy since their season concluded. There's been a draft where they moved into position to select in the first round, making qualifying offers to their restricted free agents, and buying out Jack Campbell.\n\nOn top of this, there was the not so small matter of free agency, which began in earnest on Monday. As per Stephen Whyno and John Wawrow of the Associated Press, this resulted in a furry of activity that saw teams combine to commit to a record $1.12 billion in contracts.\n\nAs for the Oilers specifically, as we've already written, their marquee signing was arguably Viktor Arvidsson at a bargain price of two years and $8 million. However, let's now break down day one of free agency overall for the organisation, with our five takeaways:\n\nOf all the signings the Oilers have completed so far, we would contend Jeff Skinner is the most underrated one. In fact, at just $3 million for one season, we'd even argue he's one of the top underrated signings of NHL free agency full stop.\n\nWhile Skinner hasn't always been the most consistent of players, overall he's still produced well enough during his 14 seasons in the NHL. He's an excellent skater with a terrific shot; he's good for around 30 goals per season, something which should easily be achievable given who he'll be playing alongside in Edmonton.\n\nIn this respect, it was only last season when the 32-year-old had a career year. He set single season highs of 47 assists, 82 total points and a +15 rating, along with a 60.5 Corsi For % in All Situations.\n\nSkinner won the Calder Memorial Trophy in 2010-11 and is the youngest ever player to appear in the NHL All-Star Game. He does also hold the distinction of the most games in NHL history without a playoff appearance, but you'd like to think this drought will end in 2024-25.", "source": {"uri": "oilonwhyte.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Oil On Whyte"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmonton_Oilers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Edmonton Oilers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restricted_free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Restricted free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo_Sabres", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Buffalo Sabres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Hockey League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Arvidsson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Viktor Arvidsson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Campbell_(ice_hockey)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jack Campbell (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Skinner", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jeff Skinner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NHL_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NHL All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calder_Memorial_Trophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Calder Memorial Trophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmonton", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Edmonton"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Edmonton"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/Ice_Hockey", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/Ice Hockey", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Theme_Merchandise", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Theme Merchandise", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Trading", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Trading", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_3822,h_2149,x_0,y_68/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/GettyImages/mmsport/156/01j1srcadk8569z0mbe1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9698683", "eventUri": "eng-9698683", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1}

Drafted seventh overall in the \"Taylor vs. Tyler\" draft of 2010, he eclipsed both in winning the Calder Trophy the following season at age 18.\n\nNow 32, he's a veteran of 1006 NHL regular season games, but shockingly, not a single appearance in the playoffs. He played eight years with Carolina, then got swapped to Buffalo for a bushel of picks and prospects in the summer of 2018, just before the Hurricanes broke through as an annual contender.\n\nAfter hitting a career-high 40 goals in 2018-19, the Sabres extended him with an eight-year deal at a whopping $9 million cap hit. It was a deal the Sabres came to regret quickly as his production collapsed the following two season, even as he subsequently rebounded with two more 30-goal campaigns including a career high 82 points riding shotgun with Tage Thompson in 2022-23. But after sliding back to \"just\" 24-22-46 in the season just past, the Sabres decided to move on, buying out the last three years of that giant pact this past Saturday.\n\nThe Oilers signed him at a fraction of the cost. Like fellow signee Viktor Arvidsson, he pencils in on a projected line with Leon Draisaitl. With two veteran scoring wingers added on Monday, one wonders where Evander Kane will fit on the Edmonton landscape in 2024-25.\n\nA high level figure skater as a youth, Skinner brings exceptional skating skills which are a delight to watch, at least to this long-time fan of that sport. No triple Axels in the NHL, but spins and step sequences project as useful hockey skills which can be directly observed in Skinner's game.\n\nOn his career, he's averaged 29-26-55 per 82 games, very similar to Arvidsson.", "source": {"uri": "edmontonjournal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Edmonton Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calder_Memorial_Trophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Calder Memorial Trophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018\u201319_OHL_season", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2018\u201319 OHL season"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolina_Hurricanes", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carolina Hurricanes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cap_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cap (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Hockey League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Buffalo, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Buffalo, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tage_Thompson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tage Thompson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Arvidsson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Viktor Arvidsson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leon_Draisaitl", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Leon Draisaitl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evander_Kane", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Evander Kane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Figure_skating", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Figure skating"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmonton", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Edmonton"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Edmonton"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/Ice_Hockey", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/Ice Hockey", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work-Life_Balance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work-Life Balance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 75}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9698683", "eventUri": "eng-9698683", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 141, "relevance": 1}

It'll cost them $1.45MM against the cap through 2026-27. The Swede is coming off a career-worst year offensively, limited to only four goals and 12 points in 75 games, but was a key part of an Edmonton penalty kill that clicked at 94.3% in the postseason. CHEK's Rick Dhaliwal adds that depth defenseman Troy Stecher is returning on an undisclosed deal. Edmonton later confirmed Stecher's deal is a two-year, $1.575MM pact ($787.5K cap hit).\n\n5:49 p.m.: The Oilers are expected to add winger Jeff Skinner in free agency, Daily Faceoff's Frank Seravalli reports. It's a one-year deal worth $3MM, Seravalli adds.\n\nSkinner, 32, became a UFA after the Sabres bought out the final three seasons of the eight-year, $72MM pact he signed back in 2019. He's had varying results throughout the contract, which carried a $9MM cap hit and was coming off a middling 24 goals and 46 points in 74 games in 2023-24.\n\nHowever, he did become one of the higher-ceiling options available on the market upon his buyout. That's because he's got a claim to fame that few other UFA wingers have - a 40-goal season under his belt. He's also only one year removed from a career-high 82 points and +15 rating in 79 games with Buffalo.\n\nAnd what better way to unlock that potential than putting him into an Oilers top six, potentially on a line centered by Leon Draisaitl and fresh free-agent add Viktor Arvidsson on his right flank? He immediately jumps out as one of the better value signings of the day, especially after outproducing Evander Kane (who he'll likely challenge for second-line duties) in slightly fewer minutes on a worse team.\n\nSkinner won't be a major defensive upgrade on whoever he pushes down the lineup. He's not a terribly physically involved player and has consistently owned poor individual chance-prevention metrics. But he does have a knack for finishing, especially at 5-on-5, helping balance out an Edmonton offense that can occasionally be too power-play reliant.\n\nWith Skinner on the books, Edmonton still has roughly $2.75MM in projected cap space remaining, per CapFriendly.", "source": {"uri": "prohockeyrumors.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Pro Hockey Rumors"}, "authors": [{"uri": "josh_erickson@prohockeyrumors.com", "name": "Josh Erickson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mattias_Janmark", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mattias Janmark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Skinner", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jeff Skinner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troy_Stecher", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Troy Stecher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmonton", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Edmonton"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Edmonton"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short-handed", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Short-handed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defenceman", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Defenceman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winger_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Winger (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Arvidsson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Viktor Arvidsson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leon_Draisaitl", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Leon Draisaitl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evander_Kane", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Evander Kane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Buffalo, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Buffalo, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Signage", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Signage", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads_and_Highways/Signs_and_Signals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads and Highways/Signs and Signals", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://cdn.prohockeyrumors.com/files/2024/06/USATSI_23002592-1024x666.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9698683", "eventUri": "eng-9698683", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "wgt": 128, "relevance": 1}

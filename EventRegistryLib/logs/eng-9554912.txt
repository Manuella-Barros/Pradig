What we are doing is putting the safeguards in place,\" said Mike Ellis, minister of public safety and emergency services.\n\nLike other recent bills increasing provincial oversight, officials said \"authority would only be assumed in extreme circumstances.\"\n\nSmith said she doesn't believe municipalities will take issue with the legislation, which she said is based on their own feedback.\n\n\"When we've had these major catastrophes in the past ... it's always, 'Why didn't the province step in earlier?'\" Smith said. \"If that happens time and time again, you've got to start listening, and that's what we're doing.\"\n\nHowever, the president of the Rural Municipalities of Alberta said members are confused by the bill and other new legislation aimed at local governements.\n\n\"Our understanding of this government was following conservative values which was actually supporting local government and local decision making,\" said Paul McLauchlin. \"We're quite surprised by a lot of these moves for centralization.\"\n\nNatural disasters\n\nThe province says changes will let it act faster in emergency situations.\n\nThose include empowering provincial crews to access, occupy and use private property on all provincial lands, including M\u00e9tis Settlements. That includes building fire guards and removing buildings where needed.\n\nCabinet would also decide where water goes during a water-related emergency - including unilateral approval of low-risk inter-basin water transfers.\n\nAuthorization processes would be removed from some flood and drought mitigation activities and the province would be able to direct water licence holders to reduce or stop water use.\n\n\"[It's] really about making sure that we can prioritize human health and safety if we find ourselves in drought emergency,\" said Rebecca Shultz, minister of environment and protected areas.\n\nAlberta is currently in Stage 4 of the provincial drought response. Stage 5 is the declaration of an emergency under The Water Act.\n\nMcLaughlin said he understhis central Alberta members are always concerned when there is talk of inter-basin water transfers, which currently require a special decision by the legislature.\n\n\"In dire situations, I think entrenching that legislation does make sense,\" he added. \"But my members are wanting to make sure that there's public accountability by the government - ensuring that all other things are considered prior to any move like that.\"\n\nBill 21 includes changes that prevent any actions taken by the province during an emergency to be challenged through the Environmental Appeals Board, the independent body managing appeals on environmental decisions made by the province.", "source": {"uri":

Apart from changing the election date, it also proposes changes to a number of emergency-related policies, that would allow the province to assume control of a local emergency response.\n\nThe changes are needed so the province can better respond to emergencies, according to the government.\n\nChanges to this act would allow the provincial government to assume control of some or all of a local emergency response. While the province said municipalities are critical in an emergency, their resources are often more limited than those available to the provincial government.\n\nThe government said it would take over local response efforts only in extreme circumstances, including when local resources are exhausted, mutual aid is unavailable or local authorities ask for help.\n\nProposed changes would also require local officials to provide more information to the province during a local state of emergency. Things that would need to be communicated to the provincial government include the nature of an emergency, the powers the local authorities intend to use during the emergency and the status of evacuation orders or alerts.\n\n\"These amendments underscore the government's commitment to protecting lives and ensuring a swift and effective response to emergencies,\" Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Services Mike Ellis said.\n\n\"By providing clearer mechanisms for government intervention and enhancing co-ordination efforts, we're strengthening our ability to keep Albertans and communities safe during times of crisis.\"\n\nUnder the legislation, a municipality would not have to agree to the province taking control during an emergency. The province would also step in if the local decisions are at cross purposes of provincial authorities.\n\nIn Alberta, flood, drought and wildfire-related emergencies are most likely to happen in May and June. The province pointed to the 2011 Slave Lake wildfire, which happened in May, the Calgary floods in 2013, which happened in June, and the 2016 Fort McMurray wildfire, which happened in May.\n\nLast year's record-setting wildfire season also took place in May, at the same time a provincial election campaign was underway.\n\nBill 21 would change the fixed election date in Alberta from the last Monday in May to the third Monday in October, as a way to decrease the likelihood of a provincial election coinciding with a natural disaster.\n\nIf passed, the next provincial election date would be moved from May 31, 2027 to Oct. 18, 2027.\n\nJustice Minister Mickey Amery said the change \"just makes sense.\"\n\n\"The change would also bring Alberta in line with other jurisdictions that already hold provincial elections in the fall,\" Amery said.\n\nProposed changes to this act include enhancing the authority the province has to conduct and direct emergency wildfire response on all provincial lands, both in and outside of the Forest Protection Area and M\u00e9tis Settlements.\n\nThis includes taking over firefighting efforts on wildfires on any provincial land, including M\u00e9tis Settlements.\n\nMunicipalities would be required to report critical information to the province, and clarifications would be made to Alberta's authority to construct fireguards and allow the removal of buildings in emergency situations.\n\nThe legislation would allow the province to step in and lead response efforts when a large or multi-jurisdictional wildfire occurs, the province added.\n\n\"Large, complex wildfires have become increasingly common in Alberta in recent years, and these events demand effective co-ordination between jurisdictions,\" Minister of Forestry and Parks Todd Loewen said.\n\n\"The proposed amendments will ensure a robust response during wildfire emergencies by enabling Alberta's government to actively support local authorities when additional provincial aid is needed or intervene if absolutely necessary.\"\n\nThe province said changes to this act would strengthen its ability to respond to emergencies like drought or flood.\n\nIf a water-related emergency is declared, the province would be able to determine the priority of water use in the area under emergency. The province could direct water licence holders to change how, when or if they divert water use.\n\nThe change would also allow for the temporary transfer of water between water basins.", "source": {"uri": "globalnews.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "Global News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provinces_and_territories_of_Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Provinces and territories of Canada"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed_election_dates_in_Canada", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fixed election dates in Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Local government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Municipality", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Municipality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_disaster", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Natural disaster"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildfire", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wildfire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alberta", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Alberta"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alberta"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alberta_Legislature", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alberta Legislature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Council_of_Alberta", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Executive Council of Alberta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_of_Public_Safety", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minister of Public Safety"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Fort_McMurray_wildfire", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2016 Fort McMurray wildfire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Ellis_(Canadian_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mike Ellis (Canadian politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M\u00e9tis_in_Alberta", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "M\u00e9tis in Alberta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slave_Lake", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Slave Lake"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Slave Lake"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_emergency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "State of emergency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drought", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drought"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Flood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calgary", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Calgary"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Calgary"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mickey_Amery", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mickey Amery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todd_Loewen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Todd Loewen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_of_Justice_and_Attorney_General_of_Canada", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurisdiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jurisdiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefighting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Firefighting"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Whistleblowing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Whistleblowing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 52}], "image": "https://globalnews.ca/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/20230516120524-591ea141c6e1f34eb3fca058446b92521cf2e1921d5b514ec80433f87ecfc6b9-5.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&w=720&h=379&crop=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554912", "eventUri": "eng-9554912", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2018-10-", "textStart": 2776, "textEnd": 2783}], "sentiment": -0.1529411764705882, "wgt": 200, "relevance": 1}

It would amend the Election Act to state that provincial elections would be held the third Monday in October every four years, instead of the last Monday in May.\n\nThis date change is meant to decrease the likelihood that any cabinet minister, in any government, would face the conflict of having to address a natural disaster during a campaign, Mr. Ellis said.\n\nWhile some will view it as a United Conservative Party acknowledgement of the effects of climate change, the minister pointed at other factors in last year's record wildfire season.\n\n\"Climate change is a factor, and we always have to be cognizant of that. But the reality is, from a wildfire perspective, 67 per cent were caused by negligence,\" Mr. Ellis said. \"Sixty-seven per cent of the fires were human-caused.\"\n\nPremier Danielle Smith speaks of her province reducing greenhouse-gas emissions, but rarely uses the words \"climate change\" when discussing the litany of fires, floods and droughts that have hit Alberta in recent years.\n\nThe proposed change would apply to the provincial election expected in 2027, and beyond.\n\nThe fixed election date change isn't likely to be controversial. Many other provinces have their elections in the fall, and outgoing Alberta NDP Leader Rachel Notley has also said the course of the 2023 campaign was upended by the wildfires.\n\nHowever, this same bill also would change several pieces of legislation to tighten provincial responses and give it more control when emergencies are declared. Mr. Ellis said it's about making \"sure that the full capacity of the government is available to address these emergencies.\"\n\nIt's unclear whether this legislation will open a new chapter of conflict between the UCP and municipalities, or other groups, which have recently pushed back against two other bills: one that would give the province control over federal funding coming into the province, and another that would allow the government to have the authority to fire councillors and cancel bylaws.\n\nUnder Bill 21, the Emergency Management Act would be changed to allow the province to assume authority over local emergency response efforts when local authorities ask for help, are overwhelmed or when the emergency spans across a number of jurisdictions. The Water Act would be amended to allow the province to determine the priority of water use in the area, direct water licence holders and to allow temporary low-risk water transfers between major water basins in the case of emergencies.\n\n\"These changes would really help us to act more nimbly should we be in a water-related emergency, whether that be a drought or a flood,\" said Environment Minister Rebecca Schulz.\n\nThere's no one cause for natural disasters. But globally, 2023 was the warmest year on record, and the 10 warmest years since 1850 have all occurred in the past decade. Scientists warn that climate change means extreme weather events will become more frequent and severe.\n\nThe ferocity of fires in a hotter, drier climate was on full display during last year's election. Some candidates in affected communities halted their campaigning, and Elections Alberta scrambled to make alternative arrangements for those displaced by the fires. A few municipal leaders had argued the whole election should be postponed. In an effort to set aside the partisan politics of the campaign, Ms. Smith and Ms. Notley met to discuss the wildfire situation.\n\nThis week, Mr. Ellis said that as he led the province's response to the disaster, he, the Premier and other cabinet ministers acted under the threat of thousands of dollars in daily fines from Elections Alberta - where officials watched to see whether politics intruded in the fire updates and the public safety messages.\n\nMr. Ellis said his role as Public Safety Minister \"doesn't stop during the election.\"\n\n\"Elections Alberta didn't want us updating the media,\" Mr. Ellis said. \"They looked at it as possibly some kind of, we'll call it interference. And we're explaining: 'But we're not being partisan. We have to let the public know what is going on under these extraordinary circumstances.'\"\n\nHowever, Ms. Smith was also criticized for delivering a fire update at a party news conference, and for announcing to party members she was invoking a state of emergency before she told the public about it later in the day.", "source": {"uri": "theglobeandmail.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

THE CANADIAN PRESS/Spencer ColbyEDMONTON - Alberta is moving its election date from the spring to the fall to avoid clashing with major natural disasters -- but the Opposition says in doing so, Premier Danielle Smith's government is conveniently granting itself six extra months of power. Smith's United Conservatives introduced a bill Thursday to move the scheduled vote date from the fourth week of May every four years to the third week of October. That would mean the next election will be Oct. 18, 2027, a time when there is less risk the province will face wildfires, droughts and floods. Smith told reporters last year's election was a prime example of the dilemma as her government had to campaign while also fighting fires and organizing evacuations. She had to be careful to not appear to be using the crisis to boost her profile while also needing to raise her profile to get the word out to Albertans on what was happening with the fires. \"Running an election parallel to this crisis made a difficult situation more challenging,\" Smith said prior to the bill being introduced in the house. She noted she and her ministers faced the threat of fines from Elections Alberta for using government resources during the campaign. \"I also found myself answering questions about the election at wildfire briefings as well as questions about wildfires at campaign events,\" said Smith. An election requires the government go into caretaker mode, while cabinet ministers are still technically in their posts. Last year's record-breaking wildfire season saw almost 30,000 people forced from their homes by early May, days after the spring election campaign had officially kicked off. NDP Leader Rachel Notley said given climate change is making natural emergencies more frequent, she is not opposed to reconsidering the fixed election date. But she said Smith could have looked at going to the polls earlier than the current date, such as February 2027 or October 2026. \"Giving themselves an extra six months seems very self-serving and opportunistic from a government that has a strong record of being very self-serving and opportunistic,\" Notley told reporters. Notley said if the problem is a need for proper communication, the government could instead have had public servants lead public emergency updates. The bill, if passed, would also give the province the authority to quickly take over local emergency response efforts in what it considers extreme circumstances. That includes situations where the municipality becomes overwhelmed or is working at cross purposes with the province. Smith said if the province had that authority last season, they could have stepped in sooner to help fight jurisdictions, particularly those that threatened to stretch across local jurisdictions. Forestry Minister Todd Loewen said the legislation is about providing clarity to powers that already exist. \"This isn't about taking over or trying to control municipalities. They still have the right to be there, and we still respect that,\" he said. The legislation would allow cabinet, during emergencies, to direct water use and make \"temporary low-risk\" water transfers between major water basins. The proposed legislation comes after two other pieces of legislation have already sparked backlash from municipalities over concerns the province is making an unnecessary power grab. One bill would give the province gatekeeping power to veto federal funding deals with cities and towns. Another would give Smith's cabinet the power to fire councillors and overturn local bylaws. Tyler Gandam, the head of Alberta Municipalities, which represents Alberta towns, cities and villages, said he was still examining the bill but has concerns. \"Once again, another bill was introduced and tabled without consultation with municipalities,\" said Gandam.

Proposed amendments would \"ensure Alberta's government can, when needed, assume authority over local emergency response efforts in situations where additional provincial oversight and support is required,\" the provincial government stated. Additional amendments would require local authorities to report more information to the province during a state of local emergency.\n\nProposed amendments to the Forest and Prairie Protection Act would aim to \"clarify and enhance the province's discretionary authority to conduct emergency wildfire response on all provincial lands, both inside and out of the Forest Protection Area.\"\n\nProposed changes would also clarify the Alberta government's authority to construct fireguards and allow the removal of buildings or structures in emergency situations when required by wildfire suppression efforts. Additionally, the act would be amended to include M\u00e9tis Settlements and clarify that the government can take action to fight wildfires on any provincial lands, including M\u00e9tis Settlements.\n\nFinally, proposed amendments to the Water Act would \"help government to protect the supply of water for all communities\" and ensure water is readily available for priority uses, including public health and safety needs, livestock welfare, critical infrastructure and critical environmental needs. The proposed amendments could only be used if a water-related emergency is declared under the Water Act and would only apply to the geographic area designated within the emergency declaration.", "source": {"uri": "reddeeradvocate.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Red Deer Advocate"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provinces_and_territories_of_Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Provinces and territories of Canada"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drought", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Drought"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildfire", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wildfire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alberta", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alberta"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alberta"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_disaster", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Natural disaster"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Alberta", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Government of Alberta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_(government)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet (government)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mickey_Amery", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mickey Amery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_of_Justice_and_Attorney_General_of_Canada", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Council_of_Alberta", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Executive Council of Alberta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senate_of_Canada", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Senate of Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurisdiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jurisdiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Flood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M\u00e9tis_in_Alberta", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "M\u00e9tis in Alberta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildfire_suppression", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wildfire suppression"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livestock", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Livestock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Local government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Welfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Public health"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Parliaments_and_Legislatures", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Parliaments and Legislatures", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Civic_Participation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Civic Participation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 57}], "image": "https://www.bpmcdn.com/f/files/kelowna/import/2023-05/32716124_web1_231015-CPW-Wildfire-Alberta-fire_1.jpg;w=1200;h=800;mode=crop", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554912", "eventUri": "eng-9554912", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

Some candidates in affected communities halted their campaigns and Premier Smith found herself answering questions about the election at wildfire briefings and questions about wildfires at campaign

fire is beyond their capabilities, then the province, through that proper reporting structure, will be able to come in and effectively take over control,\" said Mike Ellis, Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Services.\n\nAlberta's government says this will allow them to respond to emergencies quickly, although Notley fears this is part of an ongoing pattern.\n\n\"It seems to be an opportunity where they exploit the crisis in order to accrue power and to undermine democracy and also transparency,\" said Notley.\n\nThe changes will apply to the provincial election expected in

The proposed Bill 21 would apply to the provincial election slated for 2027 -- essentially extending the current government's mandate by five months.\n\nThe province is citing a disruption to the campaign trail last spring as wildfires forced the evacuation of nearly 30,000 Albertans.\n\n\"Albertans need their government's undivided attention during an emergency,\" said Premier Danielle Smith, during Thursday's announcement. \"It was bizarre for ministers and other candidates to have to go through these motions while so much of Alberta was burning and so many Albertans were out of their homes.\"\n\nPublic safety minister Mike Ellis says that planning another spring election borders on \"negligence.\"\n\n\"Moving the election date lessens the likelihood of a provincial election coinciding with a natural disaster, such as a fire or a flood,\" he says.\n\nThe change outlined in the bill would amend the Election Act, changing the fixed election date to the third Monday in October, instead of the last Monday in May.\n\nThe NDP opposition claim the latest legislation is another example of Premier Danielle Smith's desire to control everything. Opposition leader Rachel Notley says the government is giving themselves more time.\n\n\"You know, it could have been February of 2027, or it could have been October of 2026 but giving themselves an extra six months seems very self-serving, and opportunistic from a government that has a strong record of being very self-serving, and opportunistic,\" said Notley.\n\nSmith's government has recently come under fire from cities and municipalities over their controversial Bill 20, which aims to give the province sweeping powers to fire city councillors and repeal municipal bylaws.\n\nAlberta Municipalities, the group that represents towns and cities across the province, has been critical of the legislation since it was introduced last month. The group now believes it should be rescinded due to a lack of consultation.\n\nNew legislation also means municipalities are required to provide information to the province during a state of local emergency- and the province can take control when they feel it's necessary.\n\nThe province says it will help improve its ability to respond to droughts and floods in a timely and efficient way.\n\n\"These changes would help make sure that water is readily available for public health and safety,\" says Ellis. \"As well as secondary priorities of livestock welfare, critical infrastructure, and critical environmental needs.\"", "source": {"uri": "calgary.citynews.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "CityNews Calgary"}, "authors": [{"uri": "shilpa_downton@calgary.citynews.ca", "name": "Shilpa Downton", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "michael_ranger@calgary.citynews.ca", "name": "Michael Ranger", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Conservative_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Conservative Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed_election_dates_in_Canada", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fixed election dates in Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provinces_and_territories_of_Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Provinces and territories of Canada"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danielle_Smith", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Danielle Smith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alberta", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Alberta"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alberta"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_of_Alberta", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Premier of Alberta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildfire", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wildfire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Ellis_(Canadian_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mike Ellis (Canadian politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leader_of_the_Official_Opposition_(Canada)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Leader of the Official Opposition (Canada)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Democratic_Party", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New Democratic Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rachel_Notley", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rachel Notley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Municipality", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Municipality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_disaster", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Natural disaster"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livestock", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Livestock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Welfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drought", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drought"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Public health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Councillor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Councillor"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Whistleblowing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Whistleblowing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online_Issues_Polls", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online Issues Polls", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Civic_Participation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Civic Participation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://calgary.citynews.ca/wp-content/blogs.dir/sites/8/2024/04/2024041211044-66194e334d147341ec5aad26jpeg.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554912", "eventUri": "eng-9554912", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.09019607843137256, "wgt": 452991142, "relevance": 2}], "totalResults": 10, "page": 1, "count": 1, "pages": 10}}}

They still have the right to be there, and we still respect that,\" he said.\n\nThe legislation would allow cabinet, during emergencies, to direct water use and make \"temporary low-risk\" water transfers between major water basins.\n\nThe proposed legislation comes after two other pieces of legislation have already sparked backlash from municipalities over concerns the province is making an unnecessary power grab.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nOne bill would give the province gatekeeping power to veto federal funding deals with cities and towns. Another would give Smith's cabinet the power to fire councillors and overturn local bylaws.\n\nTyler Gandam, the head of Alberta Municipalities, which represents Alberta towns, cities and villages, said he was still examining the bill but has concerns.\n\n\"Once again, another bill was introduced and tabled without consultation with municipalities,\" said Gandam.\n\nThis report by The Canadian

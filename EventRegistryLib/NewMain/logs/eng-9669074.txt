As a result, Novartis is the majority shareholder of MorphoSys, making MorphoSys a Novartis company.\n\nMorphoSys and Novartis Sign Delisting Agreement\n\nFollowing the settlement of the Takeover Offer, MorphoSys and Novartis today signed an agreement confirming that Novartis intends to launch a public delisting purchase offer (the \"Delisting Offer\") for all outstanding MorphoSys no-par value bearer shares that are not presently held by Novartis. Novartis will offer MorphoSys shareholders \u20ac 68.00 per share in cash, corresponding to its preceding Takeover Offer.\n\nThe Delisting Offer document is expected to be published by Novartis in early July 2024 after the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (\"BaFin\") has approved its publication, in accordance with the provisions of the German Securities Acquisition and Takeover Act. Once the Delisting Offer document is published by Novartis, a four-week (but not less than 20 U.S. business days) offer period for MorphoSys shareholders to tender their shares will commence.\n\nFollowing publication of the Delisting Offer document, the MorphoSys Management Board and Supervisory Board will issue a joint reasoned statement in accordance with sec. 27 of the German Securities Acquisition and Takeover Act. Additionally, in accordance with U.S. securities laws, Novartis will file the Delisting Offer document and a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO, and MorphoSys will file the joint reasoned statement and a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\").\n\nFollowing BaFin approval, the Delisting Offer document and additional information relating to the Delisting Offer will be published by Novartis on this website: https://www.novartis.com/investors/morphosys-acquisition/delisting-purchase-offer. The Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO and the Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 will be made available on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov and under the \"SEC Filings\" section of the MorphoSys website at www.morphosys.com/en/investors.\n\nFollowing the publication of the Delisting Offer document by Novartis, MorphoSys will apply for revocation of the admission to trading of MorphoSys shares on the regulated market of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. MorphoSys also intends to delist from NASDAQ. After the delisting becomes effective, MorphoSys shares will no longer be traded on the regulated market of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange or on NASDAQ, and follow-up obligations from such a public listing no longer apply. Additionally, following deregistration with the SEC, MorphoSys will no longer be required to file reports with the SEC. Both the delisting from the Frankfurt Stock Exchange and the delisting from NASDAQ are expected to take place in the third quarter of 2024.\n\nMorphoSys and Novartis Intend to Implement a Merger Squeeze-out of MorphoSys' Minority Shareholders\n\nNovartis also informed MorphoSys of their intention to merge MorphoSys into Novartis. In this context, Novartis has proposed entering negotiations with the MorphoSys Management Board regarding a merger agreement.\n\nGiven Novartis holds approximately 91.04% of the total MorphoSys share capital, Novartis is able to facilitate a squeeze-out of MorphoSys' minority shareholders in connection with such a merger. Novartis will therefore seek the transfer of MorphoSys' minority shareholders' shares to Novartis against an adequate cash compensation (merger squeeze-out). The amount of the cash compensation has not yet been determined.\n\nIt is planned that the necessary shareholders' resolution on the merger squeeze-out will be adopted at the MorphoSys Annual General Meeting expected to take place in August 2024.\n\nAbout MorphoSys\n\nAt MorphoSys, we are driven by our mission: More life for people with cancer. As a global biopharmaceutical company, we develop and deliver innovative medicines, aspiring to redefine how cancer is treated.

This communication is neither an offer to purchase nor a solicitation of an offer to sell shares of MorphoSys AG (the \"Company\"). The final terms and further provisions regarding the Delisting Offer will be in the offer document once the publication of the offer document by Novartis BidCo AG (the \"Bidder\") has been approved by the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (the \"BaFin\"), after which the offer document will be filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\"). A solicitation and an offer to buy shares of the Company will be made only pursuant the offer document. In connection with the Delisting Offer, the Bidder and Novartis AG will file a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with the SEC (together with the offer document, an Offer to Purchase including the means to tender and other related documents, the \"Delisting Offer Documents\"), the Company's management board and supervisory board will issue a joint reasoned statement in accordance with sec. 27 of the German Securities Acquisition and Takeover Act and the Company will file a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 with the SEC (together with the joint reasoned statement, the \"Recommendation Statements\"). THE COMPANY'S STOCKHOLDERS AND OTHER INVESTORS ARE URGED TO READ THE DELISTING OFFER DOCUMENTS AND THE RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS BECAUSE THEY WILL CONTAIN IMPORTANT INFORMATION WHICH SHOULD BE READ CAREFULLY BEFORE ANY DECISION IS MADE WITH RESPECT TO THE DELISTING OFFER.

The Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO and the Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 will be made available for free at the SEC's website at www.sec.gov. Additional copies may be obtained for free by contacting the Bidder or the Company.

The Company's filings with the SEC are also available for free to the public from commercial document-retrieval services and at the website maintained by the SEC at www.sec.gov and are also available free of charge under the \"SEC Filings\" section of the Company's website at www.morphosys.com/en/investors.\n\nIn order to reconcile certain areas where German law and U.S. law conflict, Novartis AG and the Bidder expect to request no-action and exemptive relief from the SEC to conduct the Delisting Offer in the manner described in the offer document.\n\nAcceptance of the Delisting Offer by stockholders residing outside Germany and the United States of America may be subject to further legal requirements. With respect to the acceptance of the Delisting Offer outside Germany and the United States, no responsibility is assumed for the compliance with such legal requirements applicable in the respective jurisdiction.\n\nThis communication contains certain forward-looking statements concerning the Company, the Bidder and the Delisting Offer that involve substantial risks and uncertainties.

Novartis will offer MorphoSys shareholders \u20ac 68.00 per share in cash, corresponding to its preceding Takeover Offer.\n\nThe Delisting Offer document is expected to be published by Novartis in early July 2024 after the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (\"BaFin\") has approved its publication, in accordance with the provisions of the German Securities Acquisition and Takeover Act. Once the Delisting Offer document is published by Novartis, a four-week (but not less than 20 U.S. business days) offer period for MorphoSys shareholders to tender their shares will commence.\n\nFollowing publication of the Delisting Offer document, the MorphoSys Management Board and Supervisory Board will issue a joint reasoned statement in accordance with sec. 27 of the German Securities Acquisition and Takeover Act. Additionally, in accordance with U.S. securities laws, Novartis will file the Delisting Offer document and a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO, and MorphoSys will file the joint reasoned statement and a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\").\n\nFollowing BaFin approval, the Delisting Offer document and additional information relating to the Delisting Offer will be published by Novartis on this website: https://www.novartis.com/investors/morphosys-acquisition/delisting-purchase-offer. The Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO and the Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 will be made available on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov and under the \"SEC Filings\" section of the MorphoSys website at www.morphosys.com/en/investors.\n\nFollowing the publication of the Delisting Offer document by Novartis, MorphoSys will apply for revocation of the admission to trading of MorphoSys shares on the regulated market of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. MorphoSys also intends to delist from NASDAQ. After the delisting becomes effective, MorphoSys shares will no longer be traded on the regulated market of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange or on NASDAQ, and follow-up obligations from such a public listing no longer apply. Additionally, following deregistration with the SEC, MorphoSys will no longer be required to file reports with the SEC. Both the delisting from the Frankfurt Stock Exchange and the delisting from NASDAQ are expected to take place in the third quarter of 2024.\n\nMorphoSys and Novartis Intend to Implement a Merger Squeeze-out of MorphoSys' Minority Shareholders\n\nNovartis also informed MorphoSys of their intention to merge MorphoSys into Novartis. In this context, Novartis has proposed entering negotiations with the MorphoSys Management Board regarding a merger agreement.\n\nGiven Novartis holds approximately 91.04% of the total MorphoSys share capital, Novartis is able to facilitate a squeeze-out of MorphoSys' minority shareholders in connection with such a merger. Novartis will therefore seek the transfer of MorphoSys' minority shareholders' shares to Novartis against an adequate cash compensation (merger squeeze-out). The amount of the cash compensation has not yet been determined.\n\nIt is planned that the necessary shareholders' resolution on the merger squeeze-out will be adopted at the MorphoSys Annual General Meeting expected to take place in August 2024.\n\nAbout MorphoSys\n\nAt MorphoSys, we are driven by our mission: More life for people with cancer.

This communication is neither an offer to purchase nor a solicitation of an offer to sell shares of MorphoSys AG (the \"Company\"). The final terms and further provisions regarding the Delisting Offer will be in the offer document once the publication of the offer document by Novartis BidCo AG (the \"Bidder\") has been approved by the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (the \"BaFin\"), after which the offer document will be filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\"). A solicitation and an offer to buy shares of the Company will be made only pursuant the offer document. In connection with the Delisting Offer, the Bidder and Novartis AG will file a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with the SEC (together with the offer document, an Offer to Purchase including the means to tender and other related documents, the \"Delisting Offer Documents\"), the Company's management board and supervisory board will issue a joint reasoned statement in accordance with sec. 27 of the German Securities Acquisition and Takeover Act and the Company will file a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 with the SEC (together with the joint reasoned statement, the \"Recommendation Statements\"). THE COMPANY'S STOCKHOLDERS AND OTHER INVESTORS ARE URGED TO READ THE DELISTING OFFER DOCUMENTS AND THE RECOMMENDATION STATEMENTS BECAUSE THEY WILL CONTAIN IMPORTANT INFORMATION WHICH SHOULD BE READ CAREFULLY BEFORE ANY DECISION IS MADE WITH RESPECT TO THE DELISTING OFFER. The Delisting Offer Documents and the Recommendation Statements will be distributed to all stockholders of the Company in accordance with German and U.S. securities laws. The Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO and the Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 will be made available for free at the SEC's website at www.sec.gov. Additional copies may be obtained for free by contacting the Bidder or the Company. Free copies of these materials and certain other offering documents will be made available on the Company's website in English at morphosys.com/en/investors/Novartis-TakeoverOffer and in German at morphosys.com/de/investoren/Novartis-TakeoverOffer, by mail to MorphoSys AG, Semmelweisstrasse 7, 82152 Planegg, Germany or by phone at +49 89 8992 7179.\n\nIn addition to the Offer to Purchase, including the means to tender and certain other Delisting Offer Documents, as well as the Solicitation/Recommendation Statement, the Company files other information with the SEC. The Company's filings with the SEC are also available for free to the public from commercial document-retrieval services and at the website maintained by the SEC at www.sec.gov and are also available free of charge under the \"SEC Filings\" section of the Company's website at www.morphosys.com/en/investors.\n\nIn order to reconcile certain areas where German law and U.S. law conflict, Novartis AG and the Bidder expect to request no-action and exemptive relief from the SEC to conduct the Delisting Offer in the manner described in the offer document.\n\nAcceptance of the Delisting Offer by stockholders residing outside Germany and the United States of America may be subject to further legal requirements. With respect to the acceptance of the Delisting Offer outside Germany and the United States, no responsibility is assumed for the compliance with such legal requirements applicable in the respective jurisdiction.\n\nForward-Looking Statements\n\nThis communication contains certain forward-looking statements concerning the Company, the Bidder and the Delisting Offer that involve substantial risks and uncertainties.

This move comes as Novartis BidCo seeks to consolidate its ownership over MorphoSys.\n\nThe announcement, dated today, was made in compliance with regulatory requirements and signals the intention of Novartis BidCo to acquire all remaining shares held by minority stakeholders. MorphoSys AG, listed under the pharmaceutical preparations industry with a SIC code of 2834, is subject to this corporate action by its majority shareholder.\n\nThe process of a merger squeeze-out allows a majority shareholder to acquire the shares of minority shareholders of a company, often at a determined price, thereby transferring full ownership to the majority shareholder. This action typically follows a situation where the majority shareholder has obtained a certain threshold of ownership that enables it to enforce such a measure.\n\nMorphoSys AG, with its corporate headquarters located at Semmelweisstrasse 7, Planegg, 82152, Germany, operates within the life sciences sector under the organization name 03 Life Sciences. The company is incorporated in the state of 2M and ends its fiscal year on December 31.\n\nThe report, filed under the SEC Act of 1934, is a Form 6-K submission, indicating that it pertains to a foreign private issuer. MorphoSys AG files annual reports under Form 20-F, as indicated in the document.\n\nThe ad hoc announcement made by MorphoSys does not detail the terms of the squeeze-out, such as the price to be offered to the minority shareholders or the timeline for the completion of this process. Such details are often subject to further negotiation and will be disclosed in due course as required by law and corporate governance standards.\n\nThis development is significant for investors and stakeholders in MorphoSys AG, as it represents a change in the ownership structure and potentially the strategic direction of the company. The information in this article is based on the press release statement issued by MorphoSys AG.\n\nIn other recent news, MorphoSys AG has urged its shareholders to accept a takeover bid from Novartis BidCo AG, a subsidiary of Novartis AG (SIX:NOVN). The offer, priced at \u20ac68.00 per share, brings the total equity value to \u20ac2.7 billion. This bid represents a substantial premium of 94% and 142% above the volume-weighted average share price of the past one and three months, respectively.\n\nThe acceptance period for the offer has commenced and will end later this year. MorphoSys CEO, Jean-Paul Kress, expressed that this acquisition could enhance commercial and development opportunities for their oncology pipeline. The MorphoSys Board, following a comprehensive review, found the offer to be fair and advantageous.\n\nThe acquisition hinges on a minimum acceptance of 65% of MorphoSys's share capital and other standard closing conditions. All required antitrust approvals have been obtained. Upon completion of the takeover, MorphoSys shares are projected to be delisted from both German and U.S. stock exchanges. These are recent developments in the company's operations.\n\nIn light of the recent developments at MorphoSys AG, investors may find the following InvestingPro Insights particularly relevant. According to InvestingPro data, MorphoSys AG has a market capitalization of approximately $2.74 billion and has experienced a significant price uptick of 93.8% over the last six months, with a year-to-date price total return of 83.03%. This reflects a strong performance in the market, despite analysts expecting a sales decline and net income drop for the current year. The company also trades near its 52-week high, with the price at 93.33% of this peak.\n\nIt's notable that MorphoSys AG has had a high return over the last year, with a 139.37% price total return, which aligns with the company's recent merger squeeze-out announcement. However, the company does not pay dividends, which might influence the investment decisions of income-focused shareholders considering the squeeze-out terms. Additionally, the InvestingPro Tips suggest that the stock generally trades with low price volatility, which could be a factor for investors seeking stability in their portfolio.\n\nFor those looking to delve deeper into the financial metrics and future projections for MorphoSys AG, there are additional InvestingPro Tips available.

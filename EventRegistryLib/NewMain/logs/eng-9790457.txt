As of this writing, CoinGlass reports $269 million worth of positions liquidated over the past 24 hours across the market, led by $82 million worth of Bitcoin positions.\n\nIt's the second straight day of sizable crypto liquidations as the price of top assets continue to fall.\n\nA weaker-than-expected U.S. jobs report released early Friday appeared to spook markets across the board, with the stock market showing red across the board and crypto prices eventually following suit. The report, which noted a jump in the unemployment rate as nonfarm jobs fell well short of expectations, prompted fears that a U.S. recession is taking hold.\n\nHowever, while the panic has shown apparent short-term effects on crypto prices, some analysts believe that Bitcoin may ultimately benefit amid a weaker U.S. dollar and potential Federal Reserve interest rate cuts that are expected.\n\n\"With the Fed weakening monetary policy, it will be supportive for fixed-supply assets such as Bitcoin and gold,\" CoinShares Head of Research James Butterfill told Decrypt.", "source": {"uri": "decrypt.co", "dataType": "news", "title": "Decrypt"}, "authors": [{"uri": "andrew_hayward@decrypt.co", "name": "Andrew Hayward", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ethereum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquidation", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liquidation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stock market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Short (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Volatility (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Monetary policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://cdn.decrypt.co/resize/1024/height/512/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/bitcoin-ethereum-market-losses-gID_7.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790457", "eventUri": "eng-9790457", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

According to the data, around $840 million worth of leveraged positions were liquidated in the last 24 hours due to the catastrophic market crash.\n\nHowever, Bitcoin recovered shortly after it fell below $50K and at the time of writing, it was trading at around $52,734.54 as per CoinMarketCap.\n\nThe total value of the cryptocurrency market dropped by 12.9% to $1.96 trillion in the past day, losing over $292 billion. The last time the market value was below $2 trillion was in February.\n\nOver the past 24 hours, more than 217,000 crypto traders using leverage faced $841.3 million in liquidations, according to CoinGlass. Ethereum (ETH) had $310 million in margin calls, and Bitcoin (BTC) followed with $255 million.\n\nWhile technical analysts expect the $50K-$52K range to be a critical support zone for Bitcoin for a strong bounce back, many investors are clueless about the potential devastation, once the U.S. markets open.\n\nHere are the five possible reasons behind the crypto market crash:\n\nDespite the impressive performance of Bitcoin over the past decade, the coin is still struggling to maintain liquidity.\n\nBitcoin experienced a significant crash today, struggling to maintain liquidity which led to a sharp price decline. The cryptocurrency saw a dramatic drop of around 13%, falling from $64,000 to $52,000. This abrupt reversal triggered over $700 million in crypto liquidations.\n\nThe main issue behind this liquidity struggle is a mixture of different factors. Firstly, there's been a substantial amount of Bitcoins being withdrawn from exchanges, particularly in the U.S. due to the surging unemployment rate, contributing to a supply shortage.\n\nAdditionally, the ongoing distribution of Bitcoins from the Mt. Gox rehabilitation plan and the German government's sale of seized Bitcoins have added to the market pressure.\n\nMoreover, there's been a liquidity crisis triggered by the growing inflows into Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). These inflows are expected to continue. This creates a \"sell-side liquidity crisis\" as institutional investments increase without a rise in BTC liquidity directly.\n\nThe growing tension in the Middle-East after the killing of the Hamas leader, Ismail Haniyeh, in Tehran by Israel could have serious detrimental effect on global markets including Crypto.\n\nThe recent assassination of Haniyeh in Tehran has significantly heightened tensions between Israel and Iran, leading to a broader geopolitical instability where U.S. could also be potentially involved. Haniyeh was killed in what Hamas described as an Israeli airstrike while he was in Iran attending a ceremony for the new Iranian president.This event has sparked threats of retaliation from both Hamas and Iran.\n\nHamas and Iranian officials have vowed to avenge Haniyeh's death, which has led to concerns about further escalation in the region.\n\nThe heightened tensions and potential for conflict have also impacted financial markets, including the cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin, along with other major cryptocurrencies, experienced a notable drop. Traders and analysts suggest that the instability and uncertainty caused by the conflict are driving investors away from volatile assets like cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe recent intensification of the global stock sell-off, particularly the significant drop in Japan's Nikkei 225 index, has greatly affected the cryptocurrency market with the drop in BTC price.\n\nOn August 5, 2024, the Nikkei 225 index suffered its second-worst daily drop since the infamous 'Black Monday' crash of 1987, plummeting by around 12%.\n\nThis catastrophic decline was fueled by fears of an economic slowdown, sparked by disappointing manufacturing index data and the rapid appreciation of the yen against the dollar. This turbulence in the stock market affected tech-heavy indices like the Nasdaq, which saw substantial losses.\n\nThe global market turmoil has spilled over into the cryptocurrency market due to its correlation with major stock indices. Bitcoin has mirrored the volatility of traditional financial markets and the BTC free fall was partly due to the overall risk aversion among investors during periods of economic uncertainty and market instability.\n\nThe Bitcoin crash on August 5, 2024, was also attributed to regulatory uncertainty and delays in policy decisions concerning the cryptocurrency market.\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has been increasingly aggressive in its regulatory approach. The SEC's enforcement actions, led by Chair Gary Gensler, have targeted various cryptocurrency platforms, creating a climate of fear and uncertainty.\n\nThe lack of clear and consistent regulatory guidelines has left market participants uncertain about the future legal landscape for cryptocurrencies. This regulatory ambiguity discourages investment and drives volatility, as investors cannot predict which assets might be targeted next by regulatory bodies.\n\nMany experts believe that the significant drop in Bitcoin's price on August 5, 2024, was largely due to a massive sell-off involving two major sources: the defunct crypto exchange Mt. Gox and the German government.\n\nThe Mt. Gox exchange, which had collapsed in 2014, began distributing its remaining Bitcoin holdings worth of $9 billion to creditors. This activity introduced a large volume of Bitcoin into the market, creating substantial selling pressure.\n\nAt the same time, the German government, which had been holding a substantial amount of Bitcoin, initiated another sell-off, moving over 16,000 BTC to exchanges. This move was part of their ongoing liquidation strategy and contributed to the increased supply in the market, further driving down the price.\n\nThese massive sell-offs resulted in a major increase in the available supply of Bitcoin which led to a sharp decline in its price. The market responded with heightened selling pressure as investors anticipated further drops in BTC price. As a result, Bitcoin's price fell sharply. This shows the market's reaction to the sudden influx of Bitcoin from these large entities.\n\nAs Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies continue to plunge, market analysts are predicting that they will plunge to further depths once the U.S. markets open on Monday. For BTC to recover from the bloodbath, would require weeks if not months, but given the recent events of global instability, even that prospect appears to be bleak at the moment.", "source": {"uri": "cryptotimes.io", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Crypto Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ethereum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquidation", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liquidation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_liquidity", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Market liquidity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stock market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquidity_crisis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liquidity crisis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margin_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Margin (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange-traded_fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Exchange-traded fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_value", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Market value"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_analysis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Technical analysis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leverage_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Leverage (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tehran", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tehran"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tehran"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mt._Gox", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mt.

{"uri": "2024-08-442924346", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2024-08-03", "time": "14:44:35", "dateTime": "2024-08-03T14:44:35Z", "dateTimePub": "2024-08-03T14:41:21Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6431372761726379, "url": "https://coingape.com/crypto-market-crash-5-reasons-why-bitcoin-altcoins-dropping-today/", "title": "Crypto Market Crash: 5 Reasons Why Bitcoin & Altcoins Dropping Today", "body": "Moreover, the stock market decline also could have led to FUD in the crypto market.\n\nToday's cryptocurrency market has witnessed a dramatic downturn, with Bitcoin (BTC) plummeting and Ethereum (ETH) extending below $3,000. Furthermore, other altcoins also suffered a similar trajectory. In addition, fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) mounted owing to fears of recession. Here are the five reasons for today's crypto market crash:\n\n1. Disappointing Nonfarm Payrolls Data\n\nThe latest U.S. nonfarm payrolls report revealed that only 114,000 jobs were added in July, significantly below the anticipated figures. Additionally, the unemployment rate unexpectedly rose to 4.3%, marking its fourth consecutive increase.\n\nAccording to BlackRock's Jeffrey Rosenberg, \"The reaction here is probably the right reaction. We've had a string of disappointing data, and that's pushing more concerns about the economic outlook.\" The weaker-than-expected jobs data has stoked fears of a slowdown, impacting risk assets including cryptocurrencies.\n\n2. Rising Recession Fears\n\nThe weak jobs report has intensified recession fears, with economist Peter Schiff amplifying these concerns. Schiff argued, \"Rate cuts will fail to revive the economy or employment, but they'll heat up already hot inflation. This isn't your father's stagflation. It's much worse!\"\n\nHis comments highlight fears that the Federal Reserve's potential rate cuts might not prevent a recession and could instead accelerate inflation. These concerns are fueling broader market volatility and and catalyzed today's crypto market crash.\n\n3. Bitcoin Long Liquidations\n\nThe cryptocurrency market has seen a surge in long liquidations over the past 24 hours. Approximately $241.07 million worth of long positions were liquidated, accounting for 90% of total market liquidations. This large-scale unwinding of positions has intensified the downward pressure on crypto prices.\n\nIn addition, BTC price crash, from $65,000 to $60,000, reflects this significant liquidations impact. Coinglass data also revealed that the 14% drop in BTC price over the past five days also resulted in around $1 billion worth of long positions being liquidated.\n\n4. Stock Market Decline\n\nThe broader stock market decline has further weighed on the crypto market crash. On Friday, August 2, stocks fell sharply as the weaker-than-anticipated jobs report ignited worries of an economic downturn. The broad market index plunged 1.84% to end at 5,346.56. In addition, the\n\nNasdaq Composite lost 2.43%, closing at 16,776.16. This brings its decline from a recent all-time high to over 10%. Furthermore, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 610.71 points, or 1.51%, finishing at 39,737.26, with the index plunging as much as 989 points at its session low. This stock market decline has potentially spilled over into the crypto market.\n\n5. Bitcoin & Ethereum ETF Outflows\n\nBoth Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs have faced significant outflows, contributing to the market's woes. Bitcoin ETFs saw $237.4 million in outflows on August 2, with a weekly total of $80.4 million. Meanwhile, Ethereum ETFs experienced outflows totaling $54.3 million for the day and $169.4 million for the week.\n\nGrayscale's ETHE saw $61.4 million in outflows on Friday. These negative ETF flows coupled with Genesis Trading's bankruptcy repayments in BTC and ETH may have exacerbated the crypto market crash.", "source": {"uri": "coingape.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Coingape"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kritika_mehta@coingape.com", "name": "Kritika Mehta", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquidation", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liquidation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ethereum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Schiff", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Peter Schiff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BlackRock", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "BlackRock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stock market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stagflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stagflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Volatility (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasdaq_Composite", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nasdaq Composite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange-traded_fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Exchange-traded fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bankruptcy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dow_Jones_Industrial_Average", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dow Jones Industrial Average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Consulting", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Internet_Marketing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Internet Marketing", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Industrial_Goods_and_Services/Marketing_and_Advertising", "label": "dmoz/Business/Industrial Goods and Services/Marketing and Advertising", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Associations", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Crypto-Market-Crash.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790457", "eventUri": "eng-9790457", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-02", "textStart": 2303, "textEnd": 2311, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.3803921568627451, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

Simultaneously, U.S.-based spot Bitcoin ETFs saw significant cash outflows, with a net withdrawal of approximately $237 million on Friday.\n\nDespite the overall market collapse, Bitcoin's dominance index surged to 56.23%, its highest since May 2021, signaling its increased consolidation compared to other cryptocurrencies.\n\nMeanwhile, market analysts also speculate that the escalating conflict between Iran and Israel could be influencing global market stability, potentially affecting cryptocurrency markets as investors seek safer assets.", "source": {"uri": "crypto.news", "dataType": "news", "title": "crypto.news"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rony_roy@crypto.news", "name": "Rony Roy", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "dorian_batycka@crypto.news", "name": "Dorian Batycka", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ethereum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Long (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Volume (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquidation", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liquidation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Market capitalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Volatility (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikkei_225", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nikkei 225"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stock market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficient-market_hypothesis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Efficient-market hypothesis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange-traded_fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Exchange-traded fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://crypto.news/app/uploads/2024/06/crypto-news-bitcoin-option62.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790457", "eventUri": "eng-9790457", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-05", "textStart": 39, "textEnd": 45}, {"amb": false, "date": "-03-14", "textStart": 353, "textEnd": 361}], "sentiment": -0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

This decline extended a trend from the previous week when Bitcoin fell 13.1%, marking its largest drop since the collapse of the FTX exchange in 2022. At the same time, Ether saw an even steeper drop of 17%, falling to $2,221 and bringing its total loss for the week to over 30% -- its sharpest decline since 2021. Overall, the crypto market is down nearly 12% in the last 24 hours.\n\nWhat's driving this sharp decline? Investors are increasingly concerned about the potential for a US recession, heightened by rising geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. This combination of economic uncertainty and global instability is fostering a risk-off sentiment among investors.\n\nRecent economic data is adding to the anxiety. July's job growth was unexpectedly weak, and the unemployment rate rose higher than anticipated, signaling a slowdown in the labor market. This has heightened recession fears, leading to a 2.43% drop in the Nasdaq and a 1.84% drop in the S&P 500, according to Yongjin Kim, CEO of crypto derivatives platform Flipster.\n\nKim pointed out that market sentiment has shifted due to the diminishing impact of the Trump rally and increasing election odds for Harris. Additionally, the movement of Ether to a centralized exchange by Jump Trading, amid rumors of the firm exiting the crypto business following a CFTC investigation, has further unnerved investors. As a result, investors are seeking greater clarity regarding Jump Trading's situation, election forecasts, and potential buying opportunities at current market levels.\n\nAdding to the bearish sentiment, Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) saw their largest outflow in three months on August 2. This massive withdrawal of $237 million has fueled speculation about a potential new bear market. Investors are now watching closely to see if these ETFs will attract new buyers at lower prices or if the selling pressure will continue to increase.\n\nLarge-scale withdrawals from Bitcoin ETFs typically indicate a broader market sell-off, which can further depress Bitcoin's price. The recent outflow is the largest single-day withdrawal in three months and the fourth largest since the ETF's launch in January. This significant outflux highlights the current bearish sentiment among investors.\n\nThe crypto market is also contending with potential government Bitcoin sales and the possibility of a surplus supply from tokens returned to creditors in bankruptcy cases.\n\nMoreover, recent data from Coinglass shows that $830.8 million worth of bullish crypto derivatives positions were liquidated within a 24-hour period, indicating that leveraged bets are unraveling.\n\nHow will the crypto market navigate these turbulent times?

The market was, for lack of a better word, smacked by sell pressure, with almost every major cryptocurrency in the top 20 falling by double digit percentages. Optimism of a potential BTC all-time high was on the cards just a week ago, when the coin made its way to US $70k (AU $107k) for the first time in months.\n\nBut the hype was short-lived, and Bitcoin has fallen below US $55k (AU $84.5k), losing almost 22% on the week (10% of that coming in the last 24 hours alone).\n\nRelated: ETH Drops 20% as Jump Crypto Liquidates Staked Ether Positions, Blockchain Data Indicates\n\nA lot is going wrong for Bitcoin at the moment.\n\nSeveral bulls in the derivative markets had their long positions liquidated over the past seven days, resulting in a whopping US $801m (AU $1,231m) leaving the market. This added even more downward price pressure onto a struggling asset.\n\nMeanwhile, recession fears are growing among the US, with early August financial reports showing the jobs market slowing and major tech companies posting less revenue than expected.\n\nThe result was losses across the board - not just in the crypto market. However, when economic fears creep into investors, risky, more volatile assets are the first to leave the portfolio, meaning crypto cops the brunt of the sell-off.\n\nAnalyst Benjamin Cowen believes the current Bitcoin chart resembles the price action in 2019. Although, in the long-term, this could be bullish for BTC, it does suggest some short-term pain.\n\nAs investors stabilise from last week's sell-off, a key to crypto rebounding will be ETF inflows/outflows, with both spot ETH and BTC funds struggling over the past few days.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs Flows Suffer Setback Amid Lacklustre Trading Day\n\nBitcoin was far from the only coin to suffer through the week's downtrend.

Major assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana dropped further, leading to a lot more liquidations.\n\nBitcoin's price dipped below $50,000 for the first time since February, reaching a low of $49,351 before making a recovery to around $51,000. As a result, the original coin's dominance rose to 58% as both the altcoin and stock markets collapsed, wiping out over 17% of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization.\n\nThe total market cap, which stood at roughly $2.16 trillion last month, fell to around $1.76 trillion as of writing.\n\nSome crypto experts predict that the recent declines in Bitcoin's price could be the beginning of a more dramatic fall, citing a looming economic storm and a decoupling of cryptocurrency from the broader stock market.\n\nTristan Dickinson, CMO exSat Network, told Investing.com that Bitcoin isn't immune to global macro events.\n\n\"The capitulation of Japanese markets (Nikkei down by 12%) has combined with poor performance of the Dow Jones, S&P 500, Nasdaq and extends a broader sentiment of global fears of recession.\"\n\nTristan believes that \"pullbacks are inevitable,\" and if Bitcoin is able to hold above 50k then this could usher in the start of a bull market. \"But caution is needed, August and September are historically poor months, so expect sideways action and further testing of Bitcoin support levels,\" he added.\n\nEthereum also plummeted, losing almost 25% of its value in just two hours, its worst single-day hit since May 2021. At the time of writing, ETH was trading at around $2,190, recovering from a low of $2,170 earlier in the day. Binance Coin and XRP saw declines of more than 10%.\n\nThe sell-off only got worse on rumors of a major crypto market maker liquidating assets after massive Ether transfers to centralized exchanges.\n\nThe panic selling in Bitcoin and the overall crypto market was spurred by a broader fall in financial markets due to fears of a global recession and rising tensions in the Middle East. Japan's Nikkei 225 Index dropped 12.4%, the Stoxx Europe 600 Index fell 2.8%, and micro futures on the S&P 500 Index lost by 2.9%.\n\nSolana and Dogecoin were the biggest losers among the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap. Solana fell nearly 28% over the past week to $133, while Dogecoin dropped about 23% to just under $0.10.\n\nThe latest wave of market declines was worsened by a disappointing U.S. jobs report on Friday.

Bitcoin was closing in on its all-time high again on Monday after briefly touching $70,000 per coin on America's biggest crypto exchange, Coinbase.\n\nBut by Friday, it had dipped so, so low: Bitcoin has over the week dropped by more than 9% to $61,358 -- dipping as low as $60,704 -- according to CoinGecko.\n\nThe reason was in part down to a weak jobs report that sparked fears that the U.S. economy could be sliding into a recession, causing a Wall Street sell-off.\n\nThat, combined with tensions in the Middle East and prediction markets suggesting a slightly lower chance of Trump winning the election, pushed traders to get rid of their crypto investments, David Lawant, head of research at FalconX, told Decrypt.\n\nThis all came after a relatively optimistic meeting from the Federal Reserve on Wednesday, where the central bank's chair Jerome Powell suggested that a long-awaited cut to historically high interest rates could come by September.\n\nThe silver lining? Bitcoin mining difficult hit a new all-time high, meaning the network is stronger than ever.\n\nElsewhere, the price of Ethereum also dropped hard over the week, despite exchange-traded funds launching last month and proving popular with Wall Street.\n\nThe second-biggest coin by market cap has dropped by 8% in seven days and entered the weekend priced at $2,963.\n\nSolana also had a rough week, down over 7% to $151. Indeed, essentially all of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market cap were down over that span.\n\nBut hit the hardest have been the riskiest assets of them all: meme coins and tokens. Dogwifhat, the largest meme token running on Solana, has dropped the most by over 35% since this time a week ago. It's now priced at $1.68. Meanwhile, Bonk is down by 22%.\n\nCrypto policy was still the talk of the town with politicians, though. Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) formally introduced a bill to establish a national Bitcoin reserve. And Republican nominee and ex-president Donald Trump said the federal government could wipe out its $35 trillion in debt with Bitcoin.\n\nBut just how that would work was not made clear by the next potential leader of the U.S.", "source": {"uri": "decrypt.co", "dataType": "news", "title": "Decrypt"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mat_di_salvo@decrypt.co", "name": "Mat Di Salvo", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coinbase", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coinbase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economy of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Powell", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jerome Powell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ethereum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin_network", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prediction market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange-traded_fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Exchange-traded fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Silver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Market capitalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynthia_Lummis", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cynthia Lummis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_meme", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internet meme"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coin", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities_and_Futures", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities and Futures", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Paper_Money", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Paper Money", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Coins", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Coins", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Paper_Money", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Paper Money", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://cdn.decrypt.co/resize/1024/height/512/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/bitcoin-crash-gID_7.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790457", "eventUri": "eng-9790457", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

Japan's Nikkei 225 index dropped by as much as 7%, continuing a downward trend that started last week when the Bank of Japan raised its key interest rate to the highest level in 16 years.\n\nThe Bank of Japan increased its interest rate to 0.25%, up from a previous range of 0% to 0.1%. This is the highest rate since 2008 and is part of a plan to tighten monetary policy, including cutting back on the purchase of Japanese government bonds.\n\nShortly after the market opened, the Nikkei index fell more than 2,400 points. Within an hour, it had dropped 12.3%, losing about 1,900 points.\n\nIs a US Recession on the Way?\n\nMany believe a US recession might be coming because the chances of a major economic downturn have increased.\n\nEconomist Peter Schiff says, \"Central banks took big risks by keeping interest rates low for years, creating a large debt bubble. When inflation rose, higher rates burst that bubble. Now we have to face the fallout.\"\n\nThe tech market is struggling, and the global economy is uncertain. On Monday, US stock futures fell sharply. Rising tensions between Iran and Israel are making the situation worse. This could also impact the cryptocurrency market as investors become more cautious.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) Price Fall\n\nBitcoin recently reached $70,000 but has now fallen to $50,350, a 17% decrease. In the last 24 hours, over $1.04 billion has been taken out of the crypto market. Out of this, $901 million came from investors who expected prices to go up, while $145 million came from those betting on prices going down.\n\nMeanwhile, other cryptocurrencies, like altcoins, have also seen big drops. Ethereum's price has decreased by 20%, and many top altcoins have fallen between 15-20%.\n\nThis is the largest single-day drop since April 13. It happens as global markets are declining, with investors losing faith in major tech stocks in the U.S. and around the world.", "source": {"uri": "coinpedia.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Coinpedia - Fintech & Cryptocurreny News Media| Crypto Guide"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mustafa_mulla@coinpedia.org", "name": "Mustafa Mulla", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ethereum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_Japan", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bank of Japan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market_crash", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stock market crash"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stock market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nikkei", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Nikkei"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia-Pacific", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Asia-Pacific"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikkei_225", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nikkei 225"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_bond", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Government bond"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Monetary policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futures_contract", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Futures contract"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Consulting", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Internet_Marketing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Internet Marketing", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Industrial_Goods_and_Services/Marketing_and_Advertising", "label": "dmoz/Business/Industrial Goods and Services/Marketing and Advertising", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Associations", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 98}], "image": "http://image.coinpedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/05123711/Crypto-Bloodbath-Why-Is-Crypto-Crashing-Right-Now.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790457", "eventUri": "eng-9790457", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-04-13", "textStart": 2363, "textEnd": 2371}], "sentiment": -0.1686274509803921, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

Bitcoin and Ethereum also saw a massive sell-off, decreasing significant amount from their value in the recent 24 hours. This crypto crash coincided with the crash of stock market especially Japan's market falling a record 11%. Data from Coinglass, a well-known platform for trading crypto futures and concerning information, has disclosed that this enormous market crash has liquidated up to 214,066 traders.\n\nAccording to Coinglass, the cumulative liquidations have reached a value of up to $915M. The majority of these liquidations happened on long positions. Keeping that in view, the biggest single liquidation took place on Huobi. In line with the statistics, Huobi reportedly experienced a liquidation of nearly $27 million in terms of the BTC-USD pair. The market data highlights that this event has influenced the whole crypto sector including Bitcoin as well as the altcoins.\n\nThe top losers in this respect take into account Bitcoin, Ethereum, Aave, Polygon, Algorand, Shiba Inu, and Ripple. The chief crypto token Bitcoin has gone through a plunge of up to 11.42% in the past twenty-four hours. As a result of this, the crypto token is currently changing hands at $53,600. In addition to this, the top altcoin ETH experienced a substantial dip of 20.20%. With this huge decline, the token's price has now lowered to $2,314.72.\n\nAnother well-known altcoin Aave also saw a 20% slump. Due to this, Aave's price has reached $84.53. Moreover, the crypto market plunge has also impacted Polygon. The MATIC token of Polygon has reportedly recorded a 20.62% dip in its price. Because of that large slump, the token is currently trading at $0.3610. Additionally, Algorand's native token ALGO beheld a 16.23% price slump. This dip has placed the crypto token at $0.1012 in terms of price.\n\nTrending Now: QCP Capital Warns of High Bitcoin Volatility\n\nA popular meme token Shiba Inu has also witnessed the heat of the market crash. As per the market data, the SHIB token's price has now reached $0.00001180 after a plunge of approximately 16.31%. The famous crypto exchange Ripple's XRP token also went through a 16.06% decline. With this, XRP's price has touched $0.4661.\n\nOne of the possible reasons behind this wider market crash takes into account the increasing tension within the Middle Eastern region. Along with that, the fears concerning a looming recession are also driving this huge market decline. Keeping in view the Coinglass data, the latest immense liquidations raise several concerns among the members of the crypto community.", "source": {"uri": "fxdailyreport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FXDailyReport.Com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "umair_younas@fxdailyreport.com", "name": "Umair Younas", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquidation", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liquidation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ethereum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygon_(website)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Polygon (website)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futures_contract", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Futures contract"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stock market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorand", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Algorand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ripple_(payment_protocol)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ripple (payment protocol)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiba_Inu", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shiba Inu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Volatility (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_meme", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internet meme"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities_and_Futures", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities and Futures", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Derivatives", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Derivatives", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 47}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 51}], "image": "https://fxdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Crypto-crash-stock-market-crash.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790457", "eventUri": "eng-9790457", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 150, "relevance": 1}

Similarly, Ethereum (ETH) plunged 39% from $3,400 to $2,100. This downward trend was not isolated but echoed across the altcoin spectrum, which experienced even steeper declines.\n\nThe initial spark for the current market volatility appears to stem from intensifying fears of a US recession, triggered by unexpectedly weak US job market data on Friday. The July report showed a gain of only 114,000 jobs -- significantly below the Wall Street prediction of 175,000. This was the weakest job growth since December of the previous year and nearly the lowest since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020.\n\nCharles Edwards of Capriole Investments remarked via X, \"Every single time the unemployment rate turns up as it has today, we have a recession. Just as the Fed was too slow to tighten in 2021, it looks like they were too slow to ease in 2024.\"\n\nFurther compounding the market's nervousness was the revelation that Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway sold about 50% of its Apple holdings. This sell-off by one of the world's most watched investors was interpreted as a move to hedge against potential market downturns, considering Berkshire Hathaway disclosed holding a record $277 billion in cash in its Q2 report.\n\nAdditionally, the Bank of Japan's decision to raise its key interest rate to about 0.25% from a range of zero to about 0.1% has had significant implications. This rate hike, the second since 2007, sent shockwaves through the financial sectors globally. Historically, rate hikes by the Japanese central bank have been precursors to global recessions. Following the announcement, the Nikkei experienced its largest 2-day drop in history, surpassing even the declines seen on Black Monday in 1987.\n\nNick Timiraos, often referred to as the \"Fed's mouthpiece\" and a reporter for the Wall Street Journal, revealed, \"Goldman Sachs says there are good reasons to think the rising unemployment rate in the weak-across-the-board July payroll report is less fearsome than normal...But raises its recession-probability-tracking odds to 25% from 15%.\"\n\nGoldman Sachs also adjusted its expectations for the Federal Reserve's policy response, anticipating rate cuts at each upcoming meeting, with a possibility of a more aggressive 50 basis point cut if the August employment report mirrors July's weakness.\n\nFurther exacerbating the market's fall was a significant movement in the forex markets, particularly with the Japanese yen. After the Bank of Japan raised its key interest rate, the yen strengthened considerably against the US dollar. This move pressured traders who had engaged in the \"yen carry trade\", borrowing yen at low rates to purchase higher-yielding US assets.\n\nAdam Khoo noted, \"The sharp rise in the JPY/USD is causing a massive unwind of yen carry trade positions and contributing to the sharp decline in US stocks.\" The reversal of these trades has probably not only impacted the forex and stock markets but also had a cascading effect on Bitcoin and crypto as assets are liquidated to cover losses and repay yen-denominated liabilities.\n\nBitMEX founder Arthur Hayes commented via X, \"My TradFi birdies are telling me somebody big got smoked, and is dumping all #crypto. No idea if this is true, I won't name names, but let the fam know if you are hearing the same?????\"\n\nThere were unusual sell orders recorded across major exchanges such as Kraken, Gemini, and Coinbase, predominantly on a Sunday, which is typically a quieter trading day. This suggests orchestrated actions by large players, potentially involving the unwinding of positions by firms like Jump Trading.\n\nJump Trading has reportedly been involved in substantial unloading of Ethereum, amounting to about $500 million worth over the past two weeks. Market rumors suggest that the company's sell-off could be a strategic exit from its crypto market-making ventures or an urgent need for liquidity. Ran Neuner commented via X: \"I'm watching this selling by Jump Trading [...] They are the smartest traders in world, why are they selling so fast on a Sunday with low liquidity? I would imagine they are being liquidated or have an urgent obligation.\"\n\nDr. Julian Hosp, CEO of the Cake Group, suggested on X: \"The reason for the crazy crypto sell off seems to be Jump Trading, who are either getting margin called in the traditional markets and need liquidity over the weekend, or they are exiting the crypto business due to regulatory reasons (Terra Luna related). The sell-off is relentless atm.\"\n\nFurthermore, Mike Alfred highlighted the possibility of distress within the market, suggesting that a large Japanese fund might have collapsed, holding substantial amounts of Bitcoin and Ethereum. \"A big Japanese fund blew up. Unfortunately, it was holding some Bitcoin and Ethereum. Jump and other market makers sensed the distress and exacerbated the move. That's it. Game over. On to the next one,\" Alfred stated.\n\nThe market witnessed a dramatic increase in liquidations, with CoinGlass reporting that 277,937 traders were liquidated in the last 24 hours, leading to total crypto liquidations of approximately $1.06 billion. The largest single liquidation order, valued at $27 million, occurred on Huobi for a BTC-USD position.\n\nIn total, $302.07 in Bitcoin longs were liquidated in the last 24 hours, according to CoinGlass data. These forced liquidations, driven by margin calls and stop-loss orders, have amplified the downward pressure on cryptocurrency prices, pushing them further into the red.\n\nAnother less significant factor may involve the shifting political landscape, as Kamala Harris gains according to Polymarkets against Donald Trump (Harris 43% vs. Trump 55%). This shift is perceived negatively by the Bitcoin and crypto market. The entire market is favoring a Trump win. He wants to build a \"strategic Bitcoin stockpile\" and over the weekend said BTC could be used to pay off the US debt of $35 trillion.\n\nFinally, the ongoing distribution of Bitcoins from the defunct Mt.

According to CoinGecko, the total crypto market capitalization has dropped by 12.5%, now standing at approximately $1.97 trillion.\n\nThis marks the first time since mid-February that the market cap has fallen below the $2 trillion mark.\n\nBitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, saw its price drop below the $60,000 mark, now trading at $53,399. This figure represents a 10.8% decrease in the last 24 hours.\n\nSimilarly, Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency, witnessed a significant decline of 21.2% over the same period.

On-chain data reveals that as Ethereum's price fell to nearly $2,100, the maximum gas fee reached 710 gwei, with the current average at 350 gwei. Crypto journalist Colin Wu noted that if Ethereum's price dips further, it could trigger massive liquidations in DeFi protocols.\n\n\"When Ethereum fell to $1,950, $92.2 million of crypto assets in the DeFi protocol would be liquidated; when $1,790, $271 million DeFi assets would be liquidated,\" Wu said.\n\nThe broader impact of today's drop is also evident in the liquidation numbers. According to Coinglass, the liquidation amount for the last 24 hours has exceeded $800 million, with $699.45 million from long positions and $100.56 million from short positions. The largest single liquidation occurred on Huobi with a BTC-USD pairing valued at $27 million.\n\nThe fear and greed index for the crypto market has plummeted to 26, indicating a state of \"fear.\" This metric reflects the overall market sentiment, which has become increasingly bearish.\n\nMany industry experts attribute the recent drop to the recent macroeconomic developments.

This gesture has intensified worries that the Fed is late in adjusting rates, necessitating aggressive monetary policy easing to prevent a recession.\n\nRead more: How to Protect Yourself From Inflation Using Cryptocurrency\n\nHowever, many crypto traders believe the current situation could prompt the Fed to make an emergency rate cut in 2024.

This unprecedented market collapse has stunned many investors, with the total market value plunging by up to $510 billion over three days. As the biggest crypto freefall unfolds, top digital assets are experiencing their most severe downturn in recent memory.\n\nThe biggest crypto freefall of the year began on August 2, 2024, when the cryptocurrency market's total capitalization plummeted by $314 billion, according to TradingView. This dramatic decline represents the largest three-day sell-off in over a year and has been fuelled by a mix of disappointing economic data and escalating fears of a recession. During this period, the broader financial market also took a hit, with the S&P 500 falling by 4.4%.\n\nThe impact of the biggest crypto freefall of the year has been intensified by a series of negative developments in the tech sector. Major companies such as Microsoft and Intel reported earnings that fell short of expectations, while NVIDIA has faced backlash from expectations of imminent rate cuts. These issues have caused a significant shift in investor sentiment, pushing capital away from leading tech firms and further exacerbating the current market crisis.\n\nBitcoin and Ether, two of the largest cryptocurrencies by market cap, are at the epicentre of the biggest crypto freefall of the year. As of August 5, Bitcoin (BTC) price has dropped to $54,229, marking a steep decline of 20% over the past week. Ether (ETH) has also suffered, falling to $2,297, which represents a significant 28% loss in the same timeframe. This sharp downturn has been marked by a sudden and severe sell-off, with Bitcoin and Ether each losing 10% and 18% in value within just two hours on August 5.\n\nAmong the top ten cryptocurrencies by market cap, Layer-1 network Solana (SOL) has been hit the hardest, experiencing a staggering 30.6% drop since July 30. This has been attributed to substantial selling by Jump Crypto, which has reportedly liquidated hundreds of millions of dollars in assets in recent days. Such large-scale selling has only intensified the ongoing biggest crypto freefall of the year.\n\nThe biggest crypto freefall of the year has had a profound impact on market sentiment. The Crypto Fear and Greed Index, a key gauge of investor sentiment towards Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, has fallen into the \"fear\" zone. It currently shows a score of 26, according to Alternative.me, reflecting a level of market anxiety not seen in 23 days.\n\nLooking ahead, the biggest crypto freefall of the year suggests that the market will face a challenging week. Recovery will likely depend on increased activity from traditional financial institutions in both spot and derivatives markets. \"Bitcoin has entered the CME Gap, but technically, it can only be filled during TradFi trading hours,\" Keith Alan observed. As Bitcoin suffers its most significant weekly loss since the collapse of FTX in 2022, analysts are keeping a close eye on key technical levels. The biggest crypto freefall of the year has created potential support zones at $56,000, $47,000, $40,000, and $35,000.\n\nAs Bitcoin suffers its most significant weekly loss since the collapse of FTX in 2022, analysts are keeping a close eye on key technical levels. The biggest crypto freefall of the year has created potential support zones at $56,000, $47,000, $40,000, and $35,000. The market is also grappling with broader economic concerns, including geopolitical tensions and uncertainties surrounding the economic impact of artificial intelligence investments.\n\nThe recent upheaval has also led to substantial Bitcoin liquidations, with nearly $200 million in long positions being closed in the past two days, the highest level since early July.

Altcoins didn't escape the rout: Cardano plunged 27.7%, Solana 36.2%, Dogecoin 34.6%, XRP 23.1%, Shiba Inu 30.1%, and BNB 25.7%.\n\nCrypto's bloodbath appears to be part of a broader flight to safety.\n\nAfter the worse-than-expected unemployment report on Friday, the economy entered a technical recession according to a measure called the \"Sahm Rule.\"\n\nThis rule marks the beginning of a recession when the unemployment rate's three-month average increases by at least half a percentage point from its lowest point in the past year.\n\nFriday's unemployment figures crossed that threshold and capped off a week of disappointing data that points to a more abrupt downshift in the economy than expected.\n\nIn response, investors flew for safety and the stock market went downhill.\n\nSince Friday, the S&P 500 is down 2%, the Nasdaq 2.5%, and the Dow 1.5%. It may be, however, just the beginning of a broader rout, considering the Monday bloodbath overseas.\n\nWill crypto ever work as a risk hedge?\n\nCrypto's sudden crash begs the question: Is crypto still a speculative asset or a hedge against inflation and recession? So far, it appears to be the latter.\n\nAs stock markets dipped on August 2 due to recession fears, crypto went into a downright freefall.\n\nSince Friday's downturn, the crypto market has experienced its largest three-day sell-off in almost a year, losing more than $500 billion in total market value. According to CoinGlass data, the bloodbath wiped out more than $1 billion in leveraged positions over the last 24 hours, including over $365 million in Bitcoin and $348 million in Ether.\n\nHowever, one analyst argues that crypto is just a bystander caught in a broader sell-off, which doesn't necessarily indicate any weakness in the asset class itself.\n\nSpeaking to Bloomberg, Lightning Ventures's Khushboo Khullar, who invests in crypto-tied firms, said that crypto was caught in a \"panic\" rush for liquidity as traders scrambled to cover margin calls.\n\nShe argues that it's a temporary sell-off, presenting a \"fine buying opportunity.\"\n\neToro market analyst Josh Gilbert supports Khullar's view.\n\n\"Crypto assets have sold off, but many investors will see an opportunity. We see Federal Reserve rate cuts, which are now likely to come sharper than expected, as hugely positive for crypto assets,\" Gilbert said in an interview with Coindesk.\n\nCrypto is making leaps and bounds toward the mainstream\n\nMeanwhile, crypto, especially Bitcoin, continues to gain ground as a mainstream alternative asset.\n\nMore than half a year after the introduction of the first Bitcoin ETF, Morgan Stanley announced that its advisers will be able to offer Bitcoin ETFs starting Wednesday.\n\nCiting people familiar with the matter, CNBC reported that the investment bank will allow over 15,000 of its financial advisors to sell BlackRock's IBIT and Fidelity's FBTC.\n\nIt's a major win for crypto considering the lengthy company and regulatory processes in major investment banks, and yet another significant step toward the \"mainstreamization\" of crypto.", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Popular memecoin $DOGE also dipped by some 2.7% in the past day.\n\nWhat triggered the market crash?\n\nProminent crypto analyst Miles Deutscher suggested that there are at least nine issues within the broader financial market that have been affecting crypto prices over the weekend, including the reported decrease in Trump's odds of winning in November, continuing creditor repayments by collapsed Japanese crypto exchange titan MtGox, and lingering fears about a potential U.S. recession.\n\nHe called the various economic and political headwinds a \"perfect storm\" that's triggered a bloodbath in the crypto market.\n\nTrump's Polymarket odds down\n\nWithin just days, Trump's chances of winning the 2024 presidential race, at least among Polymarket traders, dipped from 54% to 51%, as of late Sunday night. Late last week, Polymarket reported that Trump's odds have plunged by 18% among traders in the decentralized platform, which allows users to buy and sell crypto to bet on future events.\n\nMtGox distributions continue\n\nMtGox, which is attempting to meet an October deadline for repaying creditors, has been sending repayments to customers in recent weeks. Just last week, the fallen Bitcoin exchange moved some $3 billion worth of $BTC, shaking the crypto market amid fears that prices may fall as creditors begin cashing out their Bitcoins.\n\nUS reports lackluster employment figures\n\nWall Street slumped by roughly 1.5% Friday following the U.S. Labor Department's report that non-farm payrolls only increased by 114,000 in the past month - figures well below the 185,000 initially projected by economists. It also marks a sharp plunge from June's 179,000 jobs.\n\nThe jobs data triggered concerns that the world's largest economy may be stepping closer to a recession, especially as the report also revealed that American unemployment rates spiked to 4.3% in July - the highest since October 2021.\n\nMaxis attempt to calm users down\n\nOn X, where many crypto users engage in discussions about market trends, maximalists - crypto holders who believe crypto's only path is upward regardless of market sentiment - are attempting to lift the community's spirits.\n\nProminent Bitcoin investor Lark Davis posted a video of how long-time crypto holders supposedly react to market storms. The video shows a man nonchalantly sipping wine and eating as a storm brews and a fire breaks out behind him.\n\nAnother well-followed maximalist, @CryptoGodJohn, said the current market crash is the \"best buying opportunity\" since the COVID-19 pandemic and the spectacular collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried's FTX.\n\nControversial businessman Robert Kiyosaki said it is a time when \"cowards get poorer.\" He urged the crypto community to \"grow some b*lls, stay calm, and invest when the cowards are quitting.\"", "source": {"uri": "dnyuz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "DNyuz"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ethereum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Blockchain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_asset", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Digital asset"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Market capitalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ripple_(payment_protocol)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ripple (payment protocol)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Decentralization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Financial market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTX", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FTX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Bankman-Fried", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sam Bankman-Fried"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency_exchange", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Kiyosaki", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Robert Kiyosaki"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_trend", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Market trend"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Labor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Labor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Games", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://dnyuz.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Crypto-Crash-Ethereum-Bitcoin-Lead-Price-Bloodbath-In-'Perfect-Storm.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790457", "eventUri": "eng-9790457", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 143, "relevance": 1}

hardest-hit cryptocurrency among the top 10 largest tokens by market cap, falling 25.7% from $184 to $137 since July 30.\n\nMeanwhile, Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) also tumbled, plunging 14% and 17%

Notably, this valuation reflects an outflow of about $340 billion, considering the total market cap stood at $2.15 trillion just 24 hours ago.\n\nAlthough Bitcoin (BTC) is one of the most affected cryptocurrencies, other digital assets account for a major share of the capital outflow. For instance, excluding Bitcoin, many other cryptocurrencies have seen their market cap drop by almost 10% in the last 24 hours, reflecting an $89.46 billion wipeout.\n\nWith investors rattled, Bitcoin faces an uphill task of maintaining its price above the $50,000 support zone. By press time, the maiden crypto was trading at $52,355, reflecting losses of about 13% on the daily chart, while the weekly timeframe shows BTC is down almost 25%.\n\nBesides Bitcoin, altcoins have also suffered notable losses, with Ethereum (ETH) plunging 19% to trade at $2,350. Solana (SOL), valued at $121 at the time of writing, recorded a 14% drop on the 24-hour chart. Meanwhile, XRP lost the critical support of $0.50, dropping by 14% to trade at $0.47 by press time.\n\nInvestors have been rattled by growing fears of a recession hitting the United States. The sell-off also impacted equities markets, partly due to disappointing earnings, a weaker-than-expected jobs report, higher unemployment, and a declining manufacturing sector. These elements are further compounded by escalating geopolitical tensions, adding uncertainty to risk assets.\n\nNotably, the ongoing plunge in crypto has also coincided with a broader slide in equities in Asia-Pacific markets. Specifically, Japan's Nikkei 225 dropped as much as 7%, extending losses from last week after the Bank of Japan announced it would hike its benchmark interest rate to the highest level in 16 years.\n\nAdditionally, there are concerns that Mt. Gox payout beneficiaries are adding extra pressure on the markets by selling their Bitcoin, increasing supply, and contributing to the downward pressure on prices.\n\nIn the meantime, the focus is on the Federal Reserve's next monetary policy, as the institution's decision will likely have a major impact on the economy's trajectory.", "source": {"uri": "finbold.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Finbold"}, "authors": [{"uri": "paul_l@finbold.com", "name": "Paul L.", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Market capitalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_asset", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Digital asset"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valuation_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Valuation (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solana_(blockchain_platform)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Solana (blockchain platform)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ethereum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ripple_(payment_protocol)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ripple (payment protocol)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mt._Gox", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mt.

Even the Japanese stock market has delivered harsher losses than BTC/USD, a nod to the global nature of the current market reset.\n\nWhat will happen in the coming days is anyone's guess, but for crypto holders, the main concern is where the bottom might now lie.\n\nBitcoin has given up -- once again -- multiple bull market support levels and plunged a significant section of its hodler base into unrealized losses.\n\nSome see only central bank policy intervention saving the day, while others argue that, despite its brutal nature, a stock correction was only a matter of time.\n\nCointelegraph takes a look at the state of play on Bitcoin and beyond as a new Wall Street trading week begins and a grim sense of uncertainty pervades crypto markets.\n\nBitcoin price sags under $50K in brutal crypto crash\n\nTo say that Bitcoin bulls have lost big is an understatement in the current climate.\n\nNot only is BTC/USD trading at levels last seen 25 weeks ago, crypto liquidations in the past 24 hours have passed $1 billion, as confirmed by monitoring resource CoinGlass.\n\nIn total, the combined crypto market cap has lost more than $500 billion over the last three days, setting a yearly record.\n\nData from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView confirms lows of $49,647 on Bitstamp -- a number last seen on Feb. 14.\n\n\"Bitcoin & Crypto are in capitulation as everything drops 10-18% overnight,\" Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe, founder and CEO of trading firm MNTrading, summarized in part of a reaction on X.\n\nLike many, Van de Poppe was taken by surprise as the pace of market losses accelerated in step with the first Asia trading session of the week for stocks.\n\n\"Uncomfy in spot,\" popular trader Jelle admitted on the day, characterizing the sense of unease across the trading community.\n\nFellow trader Credible Crypto hoped that $50,000 would at least remain intact as support.\n\n\"BTC lows taken, weekly demand tapped, front-running the higher TF zone at 49k (for now), meanwhile $ETH has dived right into it's own HTF zone and nearly pushed through it,\" part of his latest X coverage explains.\n\nCredible Crypto added that more proof was needed before establishing likely lines in the sand for the markets, referencing a July chart showing likely areas of mass demand.\n\n\"Ideally, BTC never makes it to that HTF demand below 50k and this is the worst of the drop,\" he continued.\n\n\"I'm inclined to believe this is the case, but we have zero confirmation yet, so will be watching PA to get further signs of a full on reversal.\"\n\nVeteran trader Peter Brandt nonetheless warned that further downside could easily result from current levels.\n\n\"Crazy Sunday to end a crazy prior week to start an even crazier week to come,\" he concluded about current events.\n\nBuffett's Apple sale adds poignancy to stocks sell-off\n\nWhile the crypto comedown is distressing for traders due to its voracity, it appears little more than a reaction to bigger problems on global stock markets.\n\nJust like the end of last week, the start of the next is being led by major losses in Japan, where the Nikkei has seen a record-breaking dive.\n\nAt the time of writing, this is set to be the largest two-day drop in the history of the Nikkei 225.\n\nCommentators note that this has beaten \"Black Monday\" from the 1987 global stocks crash, and that contagion is spreading.\n\n\"Now, South Korea has halted ALL sell orders as markets crash,\" part of ongoing X commentary from trading resource The Kobeissi Letter states.\n\n\"Panic selling has arrived.\"\n\nThe Nikkei has fallen so far, in fact, that on monthly timeframes its losses are outpacing Bitcoin's.\n\nIn the US, signs of what may become a knee-jerk reaction to Asia are already emerging. Nvidia stock, previously the classic outperformer, is now down 30% versus its June all-time high, erasing a giant $1.2 trillion in market cap.\n\n\"To put this in perspective, only 7 public companies in the world have a market cap of $1.2 trillion or more,\" Kobeissi commented.\n\n\"Nvidia has lost more market cap then the total market cap of Tesla, $TSLA, and Walmart, $WMT, combined. Truly historic.\"\n\nStocks are also focusing attention on what could turn out to be a shrewd move by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, which sold nearly 50% of its stake in Apple, per its Q2 earnings report.\n\nAPPL traded at $216 per share at the end of Q2.\n\nFed calls emergency meeting with rates still sky high\n\nThe latest panic is turning up the heat for the US Federal Reserve, which just last week opted to maintain high interest rates while only gently suggesting that it could lower them at its next meeting in September.\n\nMarkets had already priced in a 100% chance that a rate cut would occur, with consensus favoring a minimal 0.25% decrease.\n\nThe latest data from CME Group's FedWatch Tool, however, shows that those expectations are being upended.\n\nFrom just 22% odds on Aug. 3, the likelihood of a larger 0.5% cut now stands at 96.5%.\n\nThe numbers reflect the likely increasing pressure on Fed officials to protect the economy from the fallout from several years of hawkish policy.\n\nAgainst the background of recession fears, criticism of the Fed, which announced an emergency meeting for Aug. 5, was easily seen.\n\n\"Just as the Fed was too slow to tighten in 2021, it looks like they were too slow to ease in 2024,\" Charles Edwards, founder of quantitative Bitcoin and digital asset fund Capriole Investments, wrote in part of X commentary on rising unemployment at the weekend.\n\nAnthony Pompliano, founder of investment firm Professional Capital Management, speculated that the Fed might take emergency measures.\n\n\"If there is enough pain in asset prices, we could get an emergency rate cut to calm the market. Very unlikely but the Fed has a lot of options with rates at over 5%,\" he argued.\n\nBitcoin speculator holdings take a beating\n\nUnsurprisingly, BTC/USD has abandoned many a bull market support level by crashing below $50,000.\n\nFor recent buyers, however, the pain is especially poignant -- Bitcoin's short-term holders now face serious unrealized losses.\n\nThe latest data from onchain analytics firm Glassnode spells out the extent of the problem for speculators, as captured by the short-term holder market value to realized value (STH-MVRV) metric.\n\nSTH-MVRV measures the aggregate cost basis of unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs) up to 155 days ago to the current price.\n\nAt 0.88 as of Aug. 4, the metric confirms net losses for the STH cohort, and the number has likely dipped far lower as losses mount.\n\nIn a recent edition of its weekly newsletter, \"The Week Onchain,\" Glassnode linked high levels of unrealized losses to investors' risk of panic selling.\n\n\"This cohort saw over 90% of their supply fall into a loss in late July, putting them into a financially stressful position,\" it wrote.\n\nGlassnode subsequently added that Bitcoin's \"diamond hands,\" the long-term holder cohort, remained committed to not selling as of late July.\n\n\"Long-term investors currently hold 45% of the network wealth, which is relatively elevated compared to near macro cycle topping events. This underscores that LTHs hold the coins in HODL mode and are arguably patiently waiting for higher prices to divest into market strength,\" it suggested.\n\nNo talk of buying\n\nNot a surprise, but telling nonetheless -- crypto market sentiment is back on the cusp of \"extreme fear.\"\n\nOn July 29, \"extreme greed\" was around the corner as markets headed for a retest of all-time highs, but just days later, such a scenario could not be further from reality.\n\nFear & Greed measured 26/100 as of Aug. 5, and as a lagging indicator, likely has further to fall.\n\nAnalyzing the social media landscape, research firm Santiment even suggested that there might not be enough panic to produce confidence in a long-term market bottom and justify a mass buying spree.\n\n\"Is this THE dip?\" it queried on X.\n\n\"Discussions about buying have spiked, but not as much as you may think on such a dramatic drop. Expect for the bigger reaction to come as the US wakes up for their Monday morning shock. Emotional selloffs will only accelerate the timing of crypto's rebound.\"\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Now, Bitcoin is down, crypto markets are down, and traditional finance markets are trading in the red -- well, except for defense stocks. A note from The Kobeissi Letter to investors this morning advises, \"Don't fear bear markets; welcome them.\" However, is that doable?\n\nThe crypto market has lost 16% of its capitalization in 24 hours. The global crypto market cap sits at $1.93 trillion today, down 13.85% in the last 24 hours. At the time of this writing, Bitcoin's value sits at $51,829, down 14.6% in the last 24 hours and 25.5% in 7 days.\n\nThe second-largest crypto coin, Ethereum (ETH), is currently trading at $2,286.03, down 21.5% in 24 hours and 32.5% in 7 days. To that end, on-chain data from Coinglass shows that 282,966 traders have been liquidated in the last 24 hours, bringing total liquidations to $1.08 billion. The largest single liquidation order happened on Huobi -- BTC-USD value $27.00M.\n\nWhy? Japanese stocks collapsed on Monday, their biggest loss since the 1987 Black Monday sell-offs.\n\nThe collapse is driven by last week's dip in global stock markets and economic worries tied to the recession. The Nikkei share average shed 12.4%, bringing in fears tied to the October 1987 crash.\n\nIn addition, U.S. stock index futures tumbled today, with those tied to the Nasdaq falling nearly 4%. Apple Inc. tanked 7.3% after Berkshire Hathaway sold almost 50% of its stocks.

Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content.\n\nInvestors are fleeing perceived riskier assets like Bitcoin due to a challenging macroeconomic environment severely impacting the crypto market.\n\nBitcoin's price plunged to a six-month low of under $50,000 amid a broader crypto market sell-off that led to over $1 billion in liquidations.\n\nThe flagship digital asset lost critical support levels in the past day, extending its poor weekend performance into the Asian trading hours of Aug. 5. Bitcoin fell to as low as $49,121, marking a 13% decline within 24 hours. However, it has since rebounded to above $52,000 as of press time.\n\nSimilarly, Ethereum experienced a nearly 20% drop to $2,100, its lowest price since December 2023, amid speculation about institutional offloading.\n\nMeanwhile, other major cryptocurrencies, excluding stablecoins, also suffered significant losses. Solana, XRP, BNB, Cardano, and Dogecoin all saw losses exceeding 15% during the reporting period.\n\nAccording to CryptoSlate's data, the asset declines resulted in the total crypto market capitalization falling by roughly 16.57% to about $1.88 trillion. This represents the market's lowest value since February, when it was under $2 trillion.\n\nAdditionally, the sell-off resulted in $1.05 billion in liquidations. The most significant single liquidation occurred with a BTC-USD transaction worth $27 million on Huobi. Long traders, who had expected prices to rise, lost approximately $902 million, while short traders lost $153 million.\n\nMarket analysts attribute these sell-offs to various factors, including the macroeconomic situation, and there are speculations about a systemic market risk involving an industry player.\n\nArthur Hayes, co-founder of BitMEX, suggested that significant market players may be dumping their digital assets. He stated:\n\n\"My TradFi birdies are telling me somebody big got smoked and is dumping all #crypto. No idea if this is true, but let the fam know if you are hearing the same.\"\n\nRumors earlier suggested that Tron founder Justin Sun was liquidated, but Sun has denied these claims. He stated that his firm does not engage in leveraged trading strategies because they do not benefit the market. He added:\n\n\"We prefer to engage in activities that provide greater support to the industry and entrepreneurs, such as staking, running nodes, working on projects, and helping project teams provide liquidity.\"\n\nMeanwhile, others have linked the crypto downturn to broader economic factors. Markus Thielen, founder of 10X Research, told CryptoSlate that the US economy appears weaker than initially believed. He predicts a high likelihood of a 2025 recession, with the stock market often anticipating such downturns in advance.\n\nThielen warned that if the stock market continues to decline, Bitcoin prices could revisit the $50,000 level and potentially drop further.\n\nSimilarly, Gracy Chen, CEO of BitGet, noted that BTC prices could continue to fall due to geopolitical tensions, concerns about the US recession, and declines in the US and Japanese stock markets.", "source": {"uri": "cryptoslate.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CryptoSlate"}, "authors": [{"uri": "oluwapelumi_adejumo@cryptoslate.com", "name": "Oluwapelumi Adejumo", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquidation", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liquidation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macroeconomics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Macroeconomics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ethereum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_asset", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Digital asset"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solana_(blockchain_platform)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Solana (blockchain platform)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardano_(blockchain_platform)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cardano (blockchain platform)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stablecoin", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stablecoin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ripple_(payment_protocol)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ripple (payment protocol)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dogecoin", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dogecoin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Market capitalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Hayes_(banker)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arthur Hayes (banker)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tron_(cryptocurrency)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tron (cryptocurrency)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquidity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liquidity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Sun", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Justin Sun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitMEX", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BitMEX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economy of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entrepreneurship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Entrepreneurship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stock market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/bitcoin-crash.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790457", "eventUri": "eng-9790457", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-05", "textStart": 547, "textEnd": 553}], "sentiment": -0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 139, "relevance": 1}

This article examines the critical reasons behind the recent crypto market crash and its broader implications.\n\nThe primary catalyst for the crypto market's recent downturn is escalating fears of a US recession. This sentiment was ignited by disappointing US job market data, which revealed only 114,000 new jobs in July, far below the expected 175,000. This weak performance is the lowest since December of the previous year. As a result, investors are becoming increasingly concerned about an impending economic slowdown.\n\nCharles Edwards of Capriole Investments highlighted the recession risks, comparing the current situation to previous economic downturns. Additionally, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway sold a significant portion of its Apple holdings, raising further concerns about market stability. The Bank of Japan's decision to raise its key interest rate also contributed to global market jitters, as such moves have historically preceded recessions.\n\nThe yen's significant appreciation against the US dollar following Japan's interest rate hike triggered the unwinding of yen carry trade positions. Traders who had borrowed yen at low rates to invest in higher-yielding US assets were forced to liquidate their positions, impacting the forex and stock markets and cascading into the cryptocurrency market.\n\nAnalysts have noted that the sharp rise in the JPY/USD caused a massive unwinding of yen carry trade positions, contributing to the sharp decline in US stocks and subsequently affecting Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as assets were liquidated to cover losses.\n\nUnusual sell orders on major exchanges like Kraken, Gemini, and Coinbase suggest orchestrated actions by large players, potentially involving the unwinding of positions by firms like Jump Trading. Jump Trading reportedly sold substantial amounts of Ethereum, exacerbating the market decline.\n\nMarket rumors suggest Jump Trading's sell-off could be due to regulatory pressures or urgent liquidity needs. This sell-off, coupled with other large sellers, intensified the downward pressure on the crypto market.\n\nThe recent market crash triggered a significant increase in liquidations, with CoinGlass reporting that 277,937 traders were liquidated in the last 24 hours, leading to total crypto liquidations of approximately $1.06 billion. These forced liquidations, driven by margin calls and stop-loss orders, amplified the downward pressure on cryptocurrency prices.\n\nGeopolitical tensions, particularly between Iran and Israel, also contributed to the market's negative sentiment. These tensions, combined with macroeconomic factors, have created an environment of uncertainty, causing investors to seek safer assets.\n\nThe distribution of Bitcoins from the defunct Mt. Gox exchange continues to influence the market. As former users of the exchange received and potentially sold their returned Bitcoins, this has added to the selling pressure, further depressing prices.", "source": {"uri": "cryptoticker.io", "dataType": "news", "title": "cryptoticker.io"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_yen", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Japanese yen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carry_(investment)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carry (investment)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquidation", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liquidation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Labour economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jump_Trading", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jump Trading"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficient-market_hypothesis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Efficient-market hypothesis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_Japan", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bank of Japan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire_Hathaway", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Berkshire Hathaway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Buffett", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Warren Buffett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_exchange_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Foreign exchange market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stock market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kraken_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kraken (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coinbase", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coinbase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ethereum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mt._Gox", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mt.

Key Reasons Behind the Bloodbath on Satoshi Street", "body": "Nidhi is a Certified Digital Marketing Executive and Passionate crypto Journalist covering the world of alternative currencies. She shares the latest and trending news on Cryptocurrency and Blockchain.\n\nRecently, the bloodbath in Satoshi Street has hit all crypto assets hard, with Bitcoin dropping nearly 20% from its $70,000 high and many altcoins falling by 50% or more. This sharp decline is the result of several factors coming together, creating a perfect storm of market troubles.\n\nHere are the key catalysts:\n\nGeopolitical tensions are also significant, with rising conflicts impacting investor sentiment. As geopolitical issues escalate, they create additional challenges for the cryptocurrency market, further impacting its stability.\n\nRecession fears are another crucial element. As economic indicators suggest a potential downturn, investors are becoming more cautious, leading to sell-offs in various asset classes, including cryptocurrencies. The Sahm Rule Recession Indicator has surpassed the 0.50 threshold, historically signaling the beginning of a recession in the U.S. economy.\n\nMoving on, the recent drop in the crypto market can partly be traced to the Bank of Japan's decision to raise interest rates from 0% to 0.25%. This change, the first rate hike in years, has increased the cost of maintaining leveraged investments funded by cheap yen. As a result, investors have no funds left to invest in crypto assets, causing ripples of instability across financial markets, including cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe long-awaited Mt. Gox distributions are putting additional pressure on the market. As former creditors begin receiving their payouts, some are opting to sell their Bitcoin, increasing supply and contributing to the downward pressure on prices.\n\nAccording to the LookonChain report, Jump Trading, a major player in the crypto space, is offloading 120,695 $wstETH ($481M), having sold 83K $wstETH ($377M) since July 24. The market has dropped 33%+ since then. This move by a significant market participant can trigger further sell-offs, as others may react to the increased volatility and follow suit, amplifying the downward pressure.\n\nThe stock market felt the tremors when Japan's Nikkei and TOPIX indices dropped over 8% each, marking the worst stock market loss since 1987 and a 20% decline from their highs in July. This crash follows a previous dip, driven by the Bank of Japan's interest rate hike and reduced government bond purchases.\n\nAnother factor in the crypto crash is the growing chance that Kamala Harris could defeat Donald Trump in the November election. With Harris raising over $300 million and gaining momentum, PredictIt gives her a 53% chance of winning. Investors, concerned about potential policy changes, are adjusting their positions, adding to market instability.\n\nThe recent surge in crypto prices led many new investors to enter the market, hoping for continued gains. However, as the market reversed, these new positions faced liquidation, intensifying the downward momentum and contributing to the current market instability.\n\nThe recent surge in crypto prices attracted many new investors, but as the market reverses, these positions are being liquidated, worsening the downward momentum. Plus, Bitcoin's ongoing trend of lower lows and lower highs signals bearish control, undermining previous bullish patterns. With Bitcoin below the 200-day moving average, further declines are possible, and altcoins are likely to experience more extreme movements.", "source": {"uri": "coinpedia.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Coinpedia - Fintech & Cryptocurreny News Media| Crypto Guide"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nidhi_kolhapur@coinpedia.org", "name": "Nidhi Kolhapur", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Blockchain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_indicator", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economic indicator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_Japan", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bank of Japan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geopolitics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Geopolitics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Currency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mt._Gox", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mt.

Halted in Japan - Decrypt", "body": "The crypto market sank to its lowest levels in more than five months as Japan's stock market balked at recessionary fears following a rate hike by its central bank last week.\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum, the two largest cryptos by market capitalization, have fallen considerably over the last 24 hours, down 9% and 18%, respectively.\n\nTrading volumes surged by just over 214% Sunday compared to Saturday, driven by heavy dip buying, with volumes up around 226%, a spokesperson for crypto exchange Swyftx told Decrypt.\n\nBitcoin, Solana, and Ethereum were the most traded, dominating the market at \"unusual levels\" and accounting for approximately 67% of all volume late Sunday.\n\nNotably, Bitcoin buys were around three times the number of sales, and similar figures were observed for Ethereum compared to the normal 2:1 buy-to-sell ratio, they said.\n\nOther large-cap cryptos have seen declines ranging between 6% and 20%, CoinGecko data shows.\n\n\"Recessionary fears drove a huge sell-off in U.S. equity markets last Friday,\" Sylvia To, director of Bullish Capital, the venture capital arm of Bullish, told Decrypt.\n\nThat's now spread over to crypto as investors seek more traditional safe-haven assets, she said.\n\nSunday's drop, the single-largest daily decline since April 13, comes as the broader market and Japan face an equity rout as investors sour on major tech stocks in the U.S. and abroad.\n\n\"The U.S. unemployment rate climbed from 4.1% to 4.3% in June, sparking concern of a slowing labor market,\" To said. \"The fear appears to have spread with the Nikkei 225.\"\n\nOn Sunday, the Topix and Nikkei 225 stock indexes in Japan tumbled more than 7% in morning trading in Tokyo, extending their losses to around 20% from their July 11 peaks and signaling a bear market, Bloomberg reported.\n\nThe Topix, or Tokyo Stock Price Index, measures the performance of all companies listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange's main market segment.\n\nThe steep drop in the Topix triggered a circuit breaker, halting trading on that market for approximately 10 minutes, per the report.\n\nBoth benchmarks are headed for their worst three-day decline since the 2011 tsunami and Fukushima nuclear disaster.\n\nIt comes as the Bank of Japan raised its benchmark interest rate to 0.25%, up from the previous range of 0% to 0.1% at the end of last month.\n\nThat's the highest level for rates since 2008 as the country takes its first steps in moving away from its decade-long policy of near-zero interest rates.\n\nThe rate hike was reportedly part of a broader strategy to tighten monetary policy, which also included a reduction in the purchase of Japanese government bonds.\n\nThe uncertainty leaves domestic traders and markets in doubt as the cost of shipping exports overseas from the island nation rises ahead of any further economic tightening.\n\nSeveral tailwinds are also converging, with uncertainty mounting over the next U.S. president and increasing tensions in the Middle East, Decrypt was told on Sunday.\n\nIn the past 24 hours, the crypto market has seen some $780 million in liquidations, with the majority of the wipeout stemming from those betting on higher prices, CoinGlass data shows.\n\n\"That signals investors are cautious of risk-assets and may be looking over to safe-haven assets like bonds while growth fears remain a headwind,\" To said.", "source": {"uri": "decrypt.co", "dataType": "news", "title": "Decrypt"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sebastian_sinclair@decrypt.co", "name":

In a dramatic turn of events, Bitcoin's value has taken a nosedive, marking its most significant decline in four months. The cryptocurrency dropped below the $61,000 mark, causing mass panic among investors and prompting a flurry of liquidations.\n\nBitcoin isn't alone in its freefall. The global stock market has been experiencing a turbulent period, with major indexes like Japan's NIKKEI 225 and the Asia Dow Index plunging. The NIKKEI 225, for instance, saw a staggering 12.4% drop, its worst performance in recent memory. This financial turmoil has undoubtedly contributed to Bitcoin's steep decline, as investors scramble to liquidate their assets and minimize losses.\n\nOver the past 48 hours, Bitcoin saw more than $142 million in liquidations, with long positions bearing the brunt of the sell-off. The total crypto market cap plummeted by 16%, dragging other cryptocurrencies down with it. Ethereum, for example, faced a brutal 21% drop, showcasing the widespread panic within the crypto market.\n\nAs Bitcoin's price flirts with the $50,000 line, the crypto community is in a frenzy. Prominent figures who once championed Bitcoin are now expressing concern. This shift in sentiment is evident as Bitcoin's fear and greed index dipped below 26, signaling extreme fear among traders.\n\nThe panic isn't just limited to retail investors. Institutional players, including those involved with Bitcoin ETFs, have also felt the heat, with net cash outflows reaching approximately $80 billion last week (Coinspeaker). Even financial moguls like Warren Buffett are making moves, liquidating significant portions of their stock portfolios and holding onto cash (Coinspeaker).\n\nWhile the current scenario looks bleak, some analysts believe this could be a setup for a rebound.

This article examines the critical reasons behind the recent crypto market crash and its broader implications.\n\nThe primary catalyst for the crypto market's recent downturn is escalating fears of a US recession. This sentiment was ignited by disappointing US job market data, which revealed only 114,000 new jobs in July, far below the expected 175,000. This weak performance is the lowest since December of the previous year. As a result, investors are becoming increasingly concerned about an impending economic slowdown.\n\nCharles Edwards of Capriole Investments highlighted the recession risks, comparing the current situation to previous economic downturns. Additionally, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway sold a significant portion of its Apple holdings, raising further concerns about market stability. The Bank of Japan's decision to raise its key interest rate also contributed to global market jitters, as such moves have historically preceded recessions.\n\nThe yen's significant appreciation against the US dollar following Japan's interest rate hike triggered the unwinding of yen carry trade positions. Traders who had borrowed yen at low rates to invest in higher-yielding US assets were forced to liquidate their positions, impacting the forex and stock markets and cascading into the cryptocurrency market.\n\nAnalysts have noted that the sharp rise in the JPY/USD caused a massive unwinding of yen carry trade positions, contributing to the sharp decline in US stocks and subsequently affecting Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as assets were liquidated to cover losses.\n\nUnusual sell orders on major exchanges like Kraken, Gemini, and Coinbase suggest orchestrated actions by large players, potentially involving the unwinding of positions by firms like Jump Trading. Jump Trading reportedly sold substantial amounts of Ethereum, exacerbating the market decline.\n\nMarket rumors suggest Jump Trading's sell-off could be due to regulatory pressures or urgent liquidity needs. This sell-off, coupled with other large sellers, intensified the downward pressure on the crypto market.\n\nThe recent market crash triggered a significant increase in liquidations, with CoinGlass reporting that 277,937 traders were liquidated in the last 24 hours, leading to total crypto liquidations of approximately $1.06 billion. These forced liquidations, driven by margin calls and stop-loss orders, amplified the downward pressure on cryptocurrency prices.\n\nGeopolitical tensions, particularly between Iran and Israel, also contributed to the market's negative sentiment. These tensions, combined with macroeconomic factors, have created an environment of uncertainty, causing investors to seek safer assets.\n\nThe ongoing distribution of Bitcoins from the defunct Mt. Gox exchange continues to influence the market. As former users of the exchange receive and potentially sell their returned Bitcoins, this has added to the selling pressure, further depressing prices.", "source": {"uri": "cryptorank.io", "dataType": "news", "title": "CryptoRank"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_yen", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Japanese yen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carry_(investment)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carry (investment)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquidation", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liquidation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Labour economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jump_Trading", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jump Trading"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficient-market_hypothesis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Efficient-market hypothesis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_Japan", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bank of Japan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire_Hathaway", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Berkshire Hathaway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Buffett", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Warren Buffett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_exchange_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Foreign exchange market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stock market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kraken_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kraken (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coinbase", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coinbase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ethereum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mt._Gox", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mt.

traditional markets are now looking at big losses today,\" Tom Cohen, head trader at Algoz Technologies, a crypto asset manager, told DL News.\n\nThere's also heightened political tensions in the Middle East, as well as the Japanese central bank's decision to increase interest rates to strengthen the yen.\n\nAnd, on Monday, Tokyo's benchmark stock exchange saw its biggest one-day decline since its inception.\n\n\"Economic conditions across the globe, with an election due in the US, tensions in the Middle East, and Japan raising interest rates have all contributed to trading uncertainty,\" added Cohen.\n\nWeekend trading also exacerbated market selloffs, when liquidity is low because institutions are usually inactive and fiat transfers are difficult, Ruslan Lienkha, chief of markets at YouHodler, a crypto wallet and trading platform, told DL News.\n\nThat's not to mention that August is historically a weak month for Bitcoin and Ethereum, Cohen said.\n\nEugene Cheung, head of institutions at Bybit, is still bullish.\n\n\"The underlying fundamentals for Bitcoin and Ethereum remain exceptionally strong,\" he told DL News.\n\nHe pointed to increased institutional adoption of crypto, highlighting Morgan Stanley's recent decision to let wealth advisers pitch Bitcoin exchange-traded funds to clients.\n\nAnd he said that anticipated US rate cuts, the US's growing national debt, and increased political support for crypto all point to price gains in the second half of 2024.\n\n\"Bitcoin has the potential to break out of its current range and reach targets of $86,000 or

With 10+ years of writing experience, I am a Crypto Journalist by chance, exploring, and learning all the dynamics of the sci-fi action-filled crypto world. Currently, focusing on cryptocurrency news and price data. With a passion for research and challenging my capabilities, I am slowly getting into the crypto arena to bring new insights every day.\n\nThe global market is in turmoil, and crypto is no less than a boiling volcano. South Korea's stock market fell 4%, hitting correction status, while Japan braces for its worst two-day drop ever, even worse than Black Monday in 1987. Big Crash in the Stock Market is yet to come?\n\nThe NASDAQ is in correction, the S&P 500 is close, and volatility has doubled in a month. Top stocks are down 20% from their highs, Bitcoin is having its worst week since the FTX collapse, and crypto is crashing. The U.S. is heading into a recession, with the Sahm Rule triggered, and the Fed is expected to cut rates three times by year-end.\n\nJapan's Nikkei and TOPIX indices have fallen by over 8% each, marking the country's worst stock market loss since 1987. Both indices have dropped by about 20% from their all-time highs on July 11. Popular trading houses like Mitsubishi, Mitsui & Co., Sumitomo, and Marubeni have all plummeted by around 10% each. Monday's crash followed a dip on Friday when the Nikkei and TOPIX plunged 5% and 6%, respectively. The market drop was likely caused by the Japanese central bank raising interest rates to reduce government bond purchases.\n\nIn response, South Korea has halted all sell orders as markets crash, signaling the arrival of panic selling.\n\nOn Monday, the yen hit its lowest level against the US dollar since January 2024, reaching 142.77. Kelvin Tay from UBS Global Wealth Management explained that the recent strength in Japanese stocks was due to a weak yen. With the yen now reversing, investors are quickly exiting the market.\n\nWarren Buffett sold more stock last quarter than any time before, signaling potential concerns about the market's direction. Plus, the recent surge in crypto prices attracted many new investors, but as the market reverses, these positions are being liquidated, worsening the downward momentum.\n\nThe US market may have contributed to Japan's current situation. The Federal Reserve is undecided about cutting US interest rates in September, as markets expect. Investors may have panicked due to this uncertainty, causing a selloff. The Japanese Central Bank governor, Kazuo Ueda, said, \"If the economy and prices move in line with our projection, we will continue to raise interest rates.\"\n\nBitcoin dropped 17% to $50,350 from $70,000, causing the crypto market to lose $1.04 billion in 24 hours. This included substantial losses from both bullish and bearish investors. Trading below its 200-day moving average, Bitcoin risks further declines, with altcoins potentially facing even steeper drops.

Leading this decline, Bitcoin plummeted by almost 20%, reaching $49,121, its lowest level since February at $53,091.\n\nEther also suffered a substantial drop of 21%, falling to $2,300, erasing its gains for the year. Other cryptocurrencies like Binance's BNB and Solana have also suffered significant losses.\n\nThis dramatic downturn in the crypto market coincided with a broader selloff in equities, particularly in Asia-Pacific markets, exacerbated by Japan's Nikkei 225 falling by as much as 7%.\n\nThe Bank of Japan's decision to hike its benchmark interest rate to the highest level in 16 years triggered this selloff, sending shockwaves through financial markets.\n\nThe US Nasdaq also slid into correction territory, marking its worst three-week stretch since September 2022, further contributing to the decline in risky assets, including cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe market's reaction was influenced by Japan's monetary tightening and the US Federal Reserve's recent actions.\n\nAlthough the Fed opted to hold its benchmark rate steady, it did not indicate a rate cut in September, which many market experts had anticipated.\n\nThis uncertainty added to the market's anxiety, causing traders to price in a 100% chance of lower US base rates in September.\n\nThe selloff reflects growing concerns about a potential US recession, triggered by softer economic data and rising geopolitical tensions.\n\nTony Sycamore, a market analyst at IG, highlighted that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are risk assets and are highly susceptible to market volatility. He noted that Bitcoin is currently testing crucial support levels and must hold the $53,000 mark to prevent further declines.\n\nHowever, at press time Bitcoin was trading at $51,657, well below this support level, despite making a comeback from around $49k.\n\nThe cryptocurrency market's volatility has also heightened security concerns. The FBI has issued a warning about scammers exploiting the market crash to steal users' funds.\n\nThe FBI advised users to be cautious of unsolicited messages or calls indicating account problems and urged them to verify any issues through official channels. The agency's warning comes amid a significant increase in crypto-related fraud and hacking incidents.\n\nIn the first half of 2024, hackers stole nearly $1.4 billion worth of crypto, more than double the amount stolen in the same period in 2023.\n\nThis increase is attributed to the rising value of various tokens, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. Ari Redbord, global head of policy at TRM Labs, noted that while the security of the cryptocurrency ecosystem has not fundamentally changed, the higher value of tokens has made them more attractive targets for criminals.\n\nAs Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies navigate these turbulent times, investors and users should remain vigilant about market conditions and potential security threats.", "source": {"uri": "coinjournal.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "CoinJournal"}, "authors": [{"uri": "charles_thuo@coinjournal.net", "name": "Charles Thuo", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Volatility (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ethereum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_Japan", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bank of Japan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_trick", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Confidence trick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia-Pacific", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Asia-Pacific"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikkei_225", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nikkei 225"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasdaq", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nasdaq"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geopolitics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Geopolitics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Financial market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anxiety"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_hacker", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Security hacker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fraud"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Derivatives", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Derivatives", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://coinjournal.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/BTC-red.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790457", "eventUri": "eng-9790457", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 133, "relevance": 1}

Read on\n\nThe crypto market has crashed brutally, sending shockwaves through the financial world. As of August 5, the global crypto market cap stands at $1.81 trillion, a staggering 15.88% decrease in just one day, triggering extreme panic and strong indications of a bear market.\n\nThe turbulence isn't limited to the crypto market. Major global stock indices like NASDAQ100 (U.S.), FTSE100 (UK), and NIFTY50 (India) have seen sharp declines of 2-3% in a single trading session.\n\nJapan's Nikkei225 took the worst hit, plunging nearly 14% in one day, marking its steepest decline since 1987.\n\nSo, why is crypto crashing right now? What are the global triggers causing this widespread panic and dragging down all financial markets? Let's delve into the underlying reasons behind this market turmoil.\n\nThe crypto market's recent crash isn't happening in isolation. The U.S. job market is showing signs of trouble, which is fueling fears of a recession.\n\nAccording to data released on August 2, the unemployment rate jumped to a nearly three-year high of 4.3 percent in July, up from 4.1 percent in June and a stark increase from a five-decade low of 3.4 percent in April last year.\n\nEconomists from Goldman Sachs have increased the probability of a recession in the U.S. next year to 25 percent from 15 percent, Bloomberg reported.\n\nDespite this, they noted there are \"several reasons not to fear a slump,\" even with the jump in unemployment. According to Goldman economists, 'The economy continues to look fine overall, there are no major financial imbalances and the Fed has a lot of room to cut interest rates and can do so quickly if needed.'\n\nHowever, there are also concerns that the Federal Reserve may have \"waited too long\" to cut interest rates. The Goldman report suggests that if job growth recovers in August, a 25 basis points (bps) cut would be sufficient to address any downside risks. But if the August employment report is as weak as July's, a 50 bps cut might be necessary in September.\n\nThe rising unemployment and potential recession fears are creating a ripple effect. Investors are becoming more risk-averse, moving away from volatile assets like crypto, leading to massive sell-offs in the crypto space.\n\nWhen people fear a recession, they tend to sell off riskier investments and hold onto safer assets like cash, gold, or government bonds.\n\nJapan's financial system is undergoing some critical changes, and these shifts are having a ripple effect on markets worldwide.\n\nOn July 31, Japan's central bank raised its benchmark interest rate to \"around 0.25%\" from its previous range of 0% to 0.1%. This was the second time this year that the Bank of Japan (BoJ) increased rates, the first being on March 19, marking the first rate hike since 2007.\n\nWhile this move is aimed at benefiting Japan's economy, it has an adverse impact on carry trade, a popular strategy among forex traders and fund managers.\n\nCarry trade involves borrowing money in a currency with a low-interest rate and investing it in assets that offer higher returns. When Japan raises its interest rates, it makes the yen more attractive for borrowing, disrupting this strategy and causing global financial adjustments.\n\nThe effect of Japan's rate hike was immediately felt. The Nikkei 225 stock index plunged 12.4% on August 5, marking a widespread sell-off.\n\nOne of the factors driving the BoJ to raise rates was the prolonged weakness in the Japanese yen, which has pushed inflation above the central bank's 2% target.\n\nEarly on August 5, the dollar was trading at 142.59 yen, down from 146.45 late Friday and sharply below its level of over 160 yen a few weeks ago.\n\nThe market sell-off in Japan is not occurring in isolation. Stocks began tumbling globally on August 2 after weaker-than-expected data on U.S. jobs sparked worries that high interest rates might push the U.S. economy into a recession.\n\nThis anxiety is compounded by Japan's rate hike, which adds another layer of complexity to the global financial picture.\n\nThe current scenario, where both U.S. and Japanese markets are showing signs of stress, is causing investors to reassess their positions. As a result, there is a massive sell-off in riskier assets, including cryptocurrencies.\n\nGeopolitical tensions are another major factor impacting the crypto market. On August 3, tensions in the Middle East escalated as Iran and its allies prepared their response to the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, an act they blamed on Israel.\n\nThis followed the killing of Hezbollah's military chief in Beirut, prompting vows of vengeance from Iran and the 'axis of resistance', which raised fears of a regional war.\n\nMeanwhile, the U.S., an ally of Israel, announced it would move warships and fighter jets to the region. Western governments urged their citizens to leave Lebanon, where the powerful Iran-backed Hezbollah movement is based, and airlines canceled flights.\n\nIran-backed groups from Lebanon, Yemen, Iraq, and Syria have already been drawn into the ongoing conflict between Israel and the Palestinian militant group Hamas in Gaza.\n\nThe fear of a regional war and its potential global implications can lead to massive sell-offs in the crypto market as investors seek stability. Geopolitical instability often causes heightened volatility in both traditional and crypto markets.\n\nAs the crypto market continues to tumble, let's explore the insights of some prominent figures in the industry and analyze their perspectives on the situation.\n\nAlex Kr\u00fcger, a well-known macroeconomist, suggests that the current debacle is driven more by macroeconomic factors rather than issues specific to crypto.\n\nKr\u00fcger argues that the policy mistake wasn't the Fed not cutting rates quickly enough, but rather the Fed not cutting rates while Japan hiked theirs, creating a financial crisis spurred by levered Japanese speculators, which, according to him, is a less severe scenario than a crisis caused by a U.S. recession.\n\nMeanwhile, Justin Sun, the founder of Tron (TRX), remains optimistic despite the market downturn. He suggests that the industry has grown over the past year and that the current market fluctuations aren't due to negative news.\n\nIn these turbulent times, you should exercise caution and stay informed. Diversify your portfolio to mitigate risks and avoid putting all your eggs in one basket.\n\nConsider setting stop-loss orders to protect your investments from further decline. Don't make impulsive decisions based on fear or market hype, and never invest more than you can afford to lose.", "source": {"uri": "crypto.news", "dataType": "news", "title": "crypto.news"},

Bitcoin on Monday, August 5, reflected a price drop of 10.98 percent on international exchanges that brought its trading value to $54,073 (roughly Rs. 45 lakh). On Indian exchanges meanwhile, Bitcoin registered a similar percentage of loss - bringing its price to $61,560 (roughly Rs. 51 lakh).\n\n\"Investors, fearing a prolonged bearish trend, are reacting with increased volatility and panic. The price decline has triggered the liquidation of approximately $600 million (roughly Rs. 5028 core) in leveraged long positions. This highlights the inherent risks of leveraged trading in the crypto space, as sudden price movements can lead to substantial losses for investors caught in unfavorable positions,\" the CoinSwitch Markets Desk told Gadgets360, commenting on the market status.\n\nEther's loss on Monday was higher in comparison to Bitcoin. At the time of writing, ETH's price point stood at $2,307 (roughly Rs. 1.9 lakh) after the asset logged a loss of over 20 percent in the last 24 hours. This price point for Ether is almost the same on national and international exchanges.\n\n\"While the sudden drop is alarming, history suggests swift market recoveries are possible. The Bank of Japan's interest rate hike triggered this broad-based correction, impacting both crypto and traditional markets,\" Avinash Shekhar, Co-founder and CEO, Pi42 told Gadgets360.\n\nThe overall market cap of the crypto sector dropped by a notable 12.27 percent in the last 24 hours. With this, the crypto market valuation has dropped to $1.89 trillion (roughly Rs. 158,39,844 crore), according to data by CoinMarketCap.\n\n\"The crypto market went down by 15-20 percent in the last four days, driven by heavy selling in global stocks and significant declines in indices. Geopolitical tensions between Israel and Iran, as well as the movement of BTC worth $1 billion (roughly Rs. 8,380 crore) by Genesis for in-kind repayments to creditors, have also contributed to the decline,\" CoinDCX told Gadgets360.\n\nJudging from historical trends in the crypto market, before the market forms a true bullish drive, it needs to experience a sharp decline to reduce the long positions of the contract in order to reduce the selling pressure for future rises.\n\n\"This is a key factor in the rapid rise of the market, observers can continue to pay attention to changes in the macro market including the panic index indicators.

At the time of publication, Bitcoin (BTC) is down 20% and Ethereum (ETH) has fallen 28% over the past week. Among the top 10 largest cryptocurrencies by market cap, Solana has been the hardest hit, with its value dropping 30.6% since July 30.\n\nThe Crypto Fear and Greed Index, which tracks market sentiment toward Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, has plunged back into \"fear\" territory. Much of the losses incurred over the weekend will need to be offset by increased activity in both spot and derivatives markets from traditional financial institutions.", "source": {"uri": "finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

However, the cryptos backed by utility and integrity will recover, while fiat currencies will most likely not.\n\n\"Markets are not above the reality of unlimited money printing, hundreds of false unicorns, and the Ponzi scheme that is the modern economy.

Currently, focusing on financial news and analysis, as well as cryptocurrency news and data. One may not call me a crypto \"Enthusiast\" but trust me I'm getting there.\n\nThe crypto market has been hit hard by a dramatic downturn, with many altcoins plummeting 20-50% in a single day. This unexpected and severe drawdown has been described as the worst since the FTX collapse in 2022.\n\nThis selloff isn't isolated to crypto alone -- global markets are also suffering, marking one of the worst trading periods for equities in recent history. The sharp drop in crypto prices is largely due to its nature as a \"risk-on\" asset, which tends to sell off rapidly in times of market fear. The analyst compares the situation to previous market crashes, like FTX.\n\nAnalyst Miles Deutscher said that Bitcoin has been leading the market's decline, breaking below key support levels. The cryptocurrency plunged through the critical $60,000 range, triggering a cascade of liquidations that saw it drop to as low as $50,000. As of the latest updates, Bitcoin has found temporary support around $48,000, a level that previously marked the breakout zone during its last major rally and the dead-cat bounce during the bear market following FTX.\n\nCrypto has been hit particularly hard, with over $1 billion in liquidations occurring in the last 24 hours alone. This marks one of the largest liquidation cascades since the FTX collapse. Although the liquidations aren't as severe as those in April due to reduced leverage in the market, the overall impact on market cap has been devastating, wiping out billions of dollars in value.\n\nThe initial weakening in the market followed Trump's rally, which created a Sovereign Bitcoin narrative. However, the market sold off after this, partly due to Kamala Harris's rising odds, which were seen as less favorable for crypto than Trump's potential presidency.\n\nMiles discusses how the recent aggressive market downturn, leading to a liquidation cascade and forced selling, often sets the stage for opportunities in the crypto market, especially with potential catalysts on the horizon. Despite the aggressive nature of the current downturn, he believes the selling has been more severe than warranted by the de-risking.", "source": {"uri": "coinpedia.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Coinpedia - Fintech & Cryptocurreny News Media| Crypto Guide"}, "authors": [{"uri": "anjali_belgaumkar@coinpedia.org", "name": "Anjali Belgaumkar", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTX", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "FTX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquidation", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Liquidation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Research"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_trend", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Market trend"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leverage_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Leverage (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Market capitalization"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 79}], "image": "http://image.coinpedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/30190239/Bitcoin-Price-Crash-Are-Long-Term-Holders-Secretly-Preparing-for-a-Major-Breakout.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790457", "eventUri": "eng-9790457", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.09019607843137256, "wgt": 128, "relevance": 1}

Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency, continued its downward trend for the seventh consecutive day, marking its most significant drop since at least May 2021.\n\nThe broader crypto market saw a substantial decrease of nearly 20%, settling at a 17% loss by 6 AM EDT, according to data from CoinGecko, rounding off to $1.8 trillion. This downturn coincided with falling equity markets in Asia and Europe, reflecting a global shift in investor sentiment.\n\nCrypto mining companies were among the hardest hit in the stock market. Marathon Digital and Iren both saw declines of almost 14%, while Hut 8 and Riot Platforms experienced losses of 12% and 11%, respectively. These steep drops in mining stocks closely mirrored the fall in Bitcoin's price.\n\nThe market turmoil comes in the wake of disappointing US economic data. The Labor Department's recent jobs report revealed lower-than-expected figures and a higher unemployment rate than forecast, raising concerns about the strength of the world's largest economy. This follows rising geopolitical tensions have intensified following Iran's threats to attack Israel in response to the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh, the political chief of Hamas, in Tehran last week.\n\nLate hours Sunday, Bitcoin's value dipped to $53,000 with Ether falling sharply due to a panic triggered by the Bank of Japan's interest rate hike.

Beyond traditional financial factors like interest rates and monetary policy changes, the paper outlines crypto-specific factors like adoption rates and network effects.\n\nSunday's crypto market decline is a prime example of the impact of recession fears and a global equity rout.\n\nOn Saturday, the E-Mini Nasdaq 100 index dropped by nearly 3% in light of stock market sell-offs. Japan's stock market also plummeted, with the Topix and Nikkei 225 indexes falling over 7% and triggering a market halt.\n\nIs this the beginning of a global economic crisis akin to the 2008 scenario or a temporary turbulence? Let's unpack what happened during the weekend.\n\nUniswap Lab's report strived to assess the extent to which crypto price fluctuations result from traditional financial market spillovers versus inherent cryptocurrency risks.\n\nThe study also highlights that stablecoin market capitalization tends to increase during economic downturns, as investors see them as safe-haven assets.\n\nContrary to Uniswap's findings, the impact of Saturday's stock market sell-offs on the crypto market was almost instant.\n\n$ETH slumped by 30.97%, struggling below $2.35K, and $SOL experienced the sharpest decline of 36.73%, currently worth $121.\n\nThe overall crypto market capitalization fell by 13.6% in the last 24 hours. Ninety-six out of the top 100 tokens are in decline, and only stablecoins show resilience.\n\nBinance's Fear & Greed Index now stands at 26, signaling growing concerns among crypto investors. Only last week, the index stood at 74, displaying an overall bullish sentiment.\n\nWeekend's stock market sell-offs continue. Japan's Nikkei 225 and Topix indices dropped over 12% in the last 24 hours and more than 20% From their all-time highs on July 11. August 5 became the worst day for Nikkei since the 'Black Monday' of 1987.\n\nThe liquidation wave triggered a circuit breaker for approximately ten minutes, halting trading on Tokyo's stock market to prevent further decline.\n\nBank of Japan's decision to raise interest rates after a prolonged period of ultra-low rates is the most likely cause of this market turmoil.\n\nNasdaq and S&P 500 also remain on a downward trend, with a 4.1% and 2.4% respective 24-hour decline.\n\nThe stock market sank in response to July's report from The Bureau of Labor Statistics, which showed a jump in the unemployment rate (from 4.1% to 4.3%, a three-year high).

CoinGecko data shows it briefly touched $2,100 before trading at $2,359.\n\nThese swift fluctuations led to extensive liquidations.

Still, unlike the other recent plunge, BTC has fallen even lower, breaking below $56,000 and there is no singular major event such as the German government selling seized cryptocurrency to blame.\n\nIndeed, it is likely a mix of factors that caused the selloff, including the recent employment report, spillover effects from the stock market, which has itself seen a substantial drop during the latest full trading day and during the extended session, and the general persistent and recently-heightened recessionary fears.\n\nSome prominent figures within the industry have, however, speculated there may be other reasons behind the ongoing crypto market bloodbath. Arthur Hayes, for example, recently stated on X that his sources in the world of traditional finance tell him that a major institutional player is in trouble and is linked to the selloff.\n\nWhatever the reason - or the cocktail of reasons - behind the crypto market wipe may be, the fact remains that nearly $400 billion has been erased from the total market capitalization of digital assets and that Bitcoin appears to be struggling to hold on to its psychologically-important $1 trillion valuation.\n\nIndeed, though BTC has so far evaded a collapse below $50,000, it is worth remembering that recent days have seen multiple events in which the coin's price would briefly plunge below a critical support level only to recover somewhat before plunging even deeper toward a lower key zone\n\nThe next level Bitcoin is likely to find some support at - should it truly plunge under $50,000 - will be near $47,000 since nearly 1 million addresses purchased almost half a million BTC close to that price.", "source": {"uri": "finbold.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Finbold"}, "authors": [{"uri": "andreja_stojanovic@finbold.com", "name": "Andreja Stojanovic", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stock market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Hayes_(banker)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arthur Hayes (banker)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_asset", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Digital asset"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valuation_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Valuation (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Market capitalization"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 64}], "image": "https://assets.finbold.com/uploads/2024/08/Bitcoin-price-set-to-crash-below-50k-amid-market-chaos.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790457", "eventUri": "eng-9790457", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-05", "textStart": 454, "textEnd": 462}], "sentiment": -0.09019607843137256, "wgt": 120, "relevance": 1}

This has raised major concerns among investors who now worry about the future outlook of the market. Major updates like the delay in rate cuts by the Fed, massive long liquidations, and negative BTC and ETH ETF flows have contributed to the downturn.\n\nAs a result, the price of Bitcoin plummeted to new monthly lows, briefly touching $49k but has quickly regained the $50,000 mark. Similarly, Ethereum has crashed more than 20% over the last day and now trades close to $2,000. Consequently, the total crypto market cap has seen 17.43% wiped out of its value, now resting on $1.78 trillion. Below is an overview of the top cryptocurrencies and how they have performed in the last 24 hours.\n\nThe price of BTC has dropped by 15.48% over the last day to rest at $51,547. Moreover, Bitcoin has touched lows and highs of $49,221.15 and $61,048 respectively in the last 24 hours with an increase of 152% in its one-day trading volume underscoring heightened selling activities. According to data from Soso Value, Bitcoin has witnessed negative ETF flows as of August 2, recording outflows of $237.45 million.\n\nAt the same time, the price of ETH has nosedived by 22.14%, reaching $2,271 in the last 24 hours. Just like BTC, Ethereum has seen negative ETF flows. Per Soso Value data, ETH ETF saw a $54.27 million daily net inflows as of August 2. The coin has reached the bottom and top of $2,171.25 and $2,922 respectively with a 24-hour trading volume of $49.8 billion.\n\nThe price of Solana has plummeted by 18.05% to $117.62. Also, SOL had its bottoms and tops at $112.01 and $144 respectively. In the weekly chart, SOL has crashed by 39%, and, recorded a 6.30% decrease in the last 30 days.\n\nThe XRP Price has dropped way below the $0.6 mark. XRP nosedived by 17.50% to trade at $0.4575 over the last day. Interestingly, XRP has traded between $0.4441 and $0.5534 in one day.\n\nMeanwhile, Cardano (ADA) has dropped by 17.64% to $0.297, maintaining a bottom and top range of $0.2789 and $0.3603 respectively. Also, Toncoin (TON) has declined by 14.93% to $5.12. Its one-day lows and highs were $4.93 and $6.17.\n\nDogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) are leading the memecoin downtrend today. While DOGE saw a notable 19.20% loss, SHIB recorded a decline of 16.59%. As a result, DOGE and SHIB are now trading at $0.083 and $0.00001177 respectively. Also, PEPE has lost 21.98% of its value, now changing hands at $0.00006608.\n\nNotably, the only crypto gainer observed today is Gifto (GFT) which has surged by 14.39% to $0.03353.

The crash was exacerbated by Japan's Nikkei index dropping 20% from its July peak, reflecting a broader trend of risk aversion.\n\nIt is worth noting that the bearish sentiment is further fueled by fears of a U.S. recession and rising geopolitical tensions, creating a challenging environment for the cryptocurrency market.\n\nFurthermore, an update from CoinMarketCap revealed that the significant correction in both crypto and traditional markets may have been triggered by the Bank of Japan's recent interest rate hike. This monetary tightening caused the yen to surge and Japan's Nikkei stock index to plummet, with the Nikkei falling an additional 6% early Monday.\n\nThis brings its total decline to approximately 15% over the past three sessions and 20% from its mid-July peak.

The Labor Department reported an increase of just 1,14,000 nonfarm payrolls, well below the 1,75,000 forecast and far short of the 2,00,000 needed to keep up with population growth. The unemployment rate also rose to 4.3%, nearing a three-year high.\n\nThe sell-off was further exacerbated by the Bank of Japan's decision to raise interest rates to 0.25% and reduce bond purchases, leading to an appreciation of the yen and forcing investors to unwind their positions.

The FOMC meeting brought \"nearing\" a rate cut, which was generally positive, however, surprisingly weak jobs data made investors to re-think their positions, fearing a potential recession in the US. The Bank of Japan also surprised markets with a rate increase of 25 bps, pushing parity of the Yen 8% higher against US Dollar. The US equity markets continued with a correction, with S&P 500 ending the week at the level of 5.346. The US Dollar and the US Treasury yields reacted strongly on weak jobs data on Friday, bringing the USD lower and 10Y Treasury benchmark at the level of 3.78%. Aside from weakening of USD, the price of gold reacted to increased geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, still ending the week at the level of $2.443, after a profit taking. The crypto market was the worst weekly performer, where BTC reached a support level at $60K.\n\nThe Federal Reserve held a regular meeting on Wednesday, and held the rates unchanged for the ninth consecutive meeting. Still, the only significant change in Fed Chair Powell's rhetoric is that the first rate cut is \"nearing\". The markets are now strongly perceiving that the first rate cut will occur in September. At this moment, there are some 58% odds that the rate cut will be 50 bps, instead of previously anticipated 25 bps, considering weak July's jobs data. There is also discussion among investors that July's jobs data showed the potential that the US is slowly entering into the recession. However, there are also few analysts who are noting that there might be a seasonal effect in July's weak jobs data.\n\nThe Bank of Japan lifted interest rates to the levels around 0.25%, from the previous range of 0.0%-0.1% and is halving its bond-buying purchase program. The BoJ Governor Ueda did not rule out another hike of rates during this year. At the same time, Yen strengthened against the US Dollar by around 8%. A move from the BoJ is significant for the US markets due to heavy carry trade which investors are traditionally using. Namely, investors are using interest rate differentials, and through leveraged funds in Yen with low interest rates to finance investments in the US markets. Increased interest rates and strengthening of Yen will impact investors to close some positions, which might bring additional negative impact to the US financial markets.\n\nAnother news that hit the US stock markets during the previous week, was that Warren Buffet's Berkshire Hathaway cut holdings of AAPL by almost 50%. At the same time, their cash holdings reached $276 billion from $189 billion posted for the first quarter. These figures were obtained from the company's quarterly filings, but the company itself did not make any comments. The analysts are referring to Warren Buffet's comment to shareholders made in may, where he noted that the current stocks are too expensive in order to make a solid profit for the company.\n\nCrypto market cap\n\nThe previous week was a tight one for the crypto market. The week started with unconfirmed news that the US Government has transferred around $2 billion worth of BTC to the unknown address. Based on a name provided, it seems that this transfer is related to the Silk Road DoJ. A lot of investors were concerned that this might be related to a potential sale of BTC, and started closing positions, in a fear of a potential BTC price drop. The week continued with news that BoJ increased interest rates, in which sense, some decrease in a carry trade might be expected. Friday's weak jobs data increased fears among investors over a potential for a recession in the US. All these factors had an impact for investors' re-positioning, in which sense, the crypto market suffered another losing week. Total crypto market capitalization decreased by 11% on a weekly basis, whipping out around $263B from the crypto market. Daily trading volumes reached levels around $170B on a daily basis, which is significantly higher from $101B traded a week before. Total crypto market capitalization increase from the end of the previous year dropped to $ 468B, which represents a 29% surge from the beginning of this year.\n\nAlmost all coins lost value during the previous week. Certainly, BTC was the one to lose the most in nominal terms. BTC decreased its market capitalization by almost $171B, which represents a 12.5% drop on a weekly basis. ETH was following the general market trend, and decreased its cap by almost 12% or $46B. Previous week Solana was the one of the coins with a significant drop in the market cap of $19.2B or 22.6% on a weekly basis. Another coin which should be mentioned in this group is Binance Coin, which decreased its cap by $8.5B or 10%. In relative terms altcoins lost a significant portion of their value, which ranges from 10% - 20%. Among higher losers in relative terms were Filecoin, with a drop of 20.5%, DOGE was down by almost 20%, Theta lost 21.2% in value. One of the rare coins which managed to actually increase its market cap on a weekly level is Zcash, which managed to add almost 2% to its market cap.\n\nThere has been some increased activity when coins in circulation are in question. Polkadot was the coin which strongly increased the number of its coins on the market by 2.7%. Filecoin traditionally increased its circulating coins by 0.3% this week, while Stellar and Tether had an increase of the number of coins by 0.2% w/w.\n\nCrypto futures market\n\nThe crypto futures market closed on Friday, so developments on the spot market have not been fully captured in the closing prices for the week. Nevertheless, both BTC and ETH futures closed the week more than 8% lower from the week before.\n\nBTC futures maturing in December this year were last traded at price $64.775, while those maturing a year later closed the week at $71.780. On a positive side is that the futures maturing in December 2025 are still holding above the $70K level, which is a positive sign that the market is perceiving current drop in prices as only a temporary. ETH December 2024 futures closed the week at $3.125, while those maturing in December 2025 were last traded at $3.346.", "source": {"uri": "tradingview.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TradingView"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_the_Treasury", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of the Treasury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_Japan", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bank of Japan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Financial market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stock market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Market capitalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chair_of_the_Federal_Reserve", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chair of the Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S&P_500_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "S&P 500 Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carry_(investment)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carry (investment)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Open_Market_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Open Market Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire_Hathaway", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Berkshire Hathaway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coin", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silk_Road", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Silk Road"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binance", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Binance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filecoin", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Filecoin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tether_(cryptocurrency)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tether (cryptocurrency)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futures_exchange", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Futures exchange"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities_and_Futures", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities and Futures", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://s3.tradingview.com/2/27Qr1O1u_big.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790457", "eventUri": "eng-9790457", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 111, "relevance": 1}

The fall in Cryto market worldwide mirrored the global mayhem in stock markets. Japan's Nikkei index has its worst day in decades. European stocks drop most in two years. Closer home, Bombay Stock Exchange closed 2000-plus points down.\n\nSimilar to the stock market rout, Bitcoin plummeted over 16% at one point, marking its steepest decline since the FTX collapse.Ethereum also experienced its most dramatic fall since 2021. The broader cryptocurrency market was hit hard, with most major coins posting substantial losses. Bitcoin's value dropped by 11% to $52,680, following a 13.1% decline the previous week. Ethereum's price plunged by over 20% before partially recovering to $2,342. About $900 million of bullish crypto positions were liquidated in the past 24 hours, Coinglass data showed, as per a report in Bloomberg.\n\nThe declines come as a global stock selloff intensifies, reflecting concerns about the economic outlook and questions over whether heavy investment into artificial intelligence will live up to the hype surrounding the technology. Geopolitical tension is rising in the Middle East, adding to investor anxiety.\n\nKey factors that contributed to the Crypto crash:\n\n* Global economic uncertainty: Concerns about a potential recession and the impact of heavy AI investments on the economy fueled a stock market selloff, which negatively affected cryptocurrencies.\n\n* Geopolitical tensions: Rising tensions in the Middle East added to investor anxiety.\n\n* Unwinding yen carry trade: As investors adjusted to higher interest rates in Japan, they reduced their exposure to riskier assets like cryptocurrencies.\n\n* US political climate: The ongoing presidential race, with its implications for crypto regulation, created uncertainty in the market.\n\n* Bitcoin supply concerns: Potential sales of seized Bitcoin and a supply overhang from bankruptcy proceedings weighed on prices.\n\nThe TOI Tech Desk is a dedicated team of journalists committed to delivering the latest and most relevant news from the world of technology to readers of The Times of India.

Polymarket forecasts and Sahm Rule", "body": "It was a sea of red in the crypto market on Monday as the fear and greed index moved to the fear zone of 35, with most tokens falling by over 20%.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) plunged by 17% in the past 24 hours while other notable coins like Pepe (PEPE), Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and Notcoin (NOT) performed even worse. Altogether, the market cap of all cryptocurrencies has dropped from almost $3 trillion in March to $1.8 trillion.\n\nThe outlook for Bitcoin and other coins seems highly bearish, with Bitcoin forming a series of lower lows and lower highs. It has even moved below the lower side of the falling broadening wedge pattern.\n\nTechnically, Bitcoin has moved below the 50-day and 200-day moving averages, meaning that bears are in complete control.\n\nFurther, crypto investors have turned fearful, with the fear and greed index dropping to the fear zone of 35. In most cases, cryptocurrencies drop when there is a sense of fear in the market.\n\nAdditionally, crypto liquidations have soared, crossing over $1 billion on Monday. Bearish volume has also risen across the biggest crypto exchanges.\n\nThis trend is happening for several reasons. The biggest one is that the Bank of Japan is moving in the opposite direction from other central banks like the Bank of England and the European Central Bank.\n\nFurther, the US presidential election is much tighter than before, and there are rising odds that Trump will not win the election. Trump is seen favorably among crypto investors.\n\nStill, a bull case can be made in the crypto market. Goldman Sachs has raised its recession odds while the Sahm Rule index has risen to 0.53. The Sahm Rule looks at the average unemployment rate in the US over 12 months.\n\nOdds of a recession rise when the Sahm Rule moves above 0.50%. Recent data shows that it has risen to 0.53%, meaning that a recession could happen.\n\nIronically, stocks and cryptocurrencies do well during a recession because of the Federal Reserve. If a recession happens, the Fed will likely cut interest rates at a quicker rate than expected. Polymarket traders anticipate a jumbo rate cut of 0.50% in September while ING analysts see four cuts this year.\n\nSuch cuts would have an enormous impact on the market since investors have allocated $6.1 billion in money market funds, where they are earning about 5%. When rates start falling, these investors will likely move funds to riskier assets like stocks and crypto.\n\nWe saw this happen during the COVID-19 pandemic when stocks jumped after the Fed slashed interest rates to zero.", "source": {"uri": "crypto.news", "dataType": "news", "title": "crypto.news"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jayson_derrick@crypto.news", "name": "Jayson Derrick", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "crispus_nyaga@crypto.news", "name": "Crispus Nyaga", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coin", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Coin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ethereum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Market capitalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_Japan", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bank of Japan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_England", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bank of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Central_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "European Central Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_market_fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Money market fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ING_Group", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ING Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldman_Sachs", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Goldman Sachs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://crypto.news/app/uploads/2024/08/crypto-news-A-bull-a-bear-fight-option03.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790457", "eventUri": "eng-9790457", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3647058823529412, "wgt": 460560550, "relevance": 2}

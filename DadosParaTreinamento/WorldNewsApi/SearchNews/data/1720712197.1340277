(Photo by Denise Truscello/Getty Images for iHeartMedia) Getty Images for iHeartMedia Miley Cyrus has been a global superstar for nearly two decades now. Even though she\u2019d landed plenty of big hits and sold millions of albums, the singer and actress still managed to score the smash of a lifetime in early 2023 when she dropped \u201cFlowers,\u201d and things have never been the same for the musician. It\u2019s been nearly a year and a half since that single debuted, but it hasn\u2019t disappeared entirely from the Billboard charts. This week, the tune is still going strong on one worldwide ranking, and it\u2019s even climbing\u2014a showing rarely seen for a track that\u2019s so old. \u201cFlowers\u201d returns to the top 40 on the latest edition of the Billboard Global 200 this frame. The chart, which was introduced several years ago by Billboard, ranks the most-consumed songs in the world, based on a methodology that includes both sales and streams. This time around, \u201cFlowers\u201d grows by three rungs on the Billboard Global 200. The tune improves from No. 43 to No. 40, re-entering the region that usually turns a charting cut into a hit. Of course, \u201cFlowers\u201d is not new to the top 40 on the tally. It\u2019s already spent many months inside the tier on the Billboard Global 200, and apparently, the world isn\u2019t done listening to the cut. \u201cFlowers\u201d made history during the first few months of its run on the Billboard Global 200, and it holds as one of the biggest and most successful tracks in the tally\u2019s tenure. Cyrus\u2019 smash spent 13 weeks at No. 1 on the list, which stands out as the third-longest stay on the throne.

Mariah Carey\u2019s holiday favorite \u201cAll I Want for Christmas Is You\u201d owns the record, with 18 nonconsecutive turns atop the tally. Harry Styles\u2019 \u201cAs It Was\u201d is in second place, with 15 frames at No. 1. Speaking of Styles, he\u2019s sitting very, very close to Cyrus this week. \u201cAs It Was\u201d steps up from No. 41 to No. 39 on this week\u2019s Billboard Global 200. He joins Cyrus in finding his way back to the top 40 and lands just one rung ahead of her.

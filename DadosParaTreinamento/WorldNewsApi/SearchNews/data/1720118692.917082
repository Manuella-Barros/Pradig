{"id": 227488976, "title": "Number of men working from home while their wives return to the office rises", "text": "The pandemic has led to the emergence of the \u201cWFH Husband\u201d, a reported phenomenon where men work from home while their wives go into the workplace. Professor Heejung Chung, a sociologist at the University of Kent, says that data supports a trend showing men are less likely to return to the office compared to women. However, she points out that men are not more inclined to take on domestic responsibilities, often avoiding childcare and housework to \"protect their masculinity.\" Office for National Statistics data has shown one in five women work in health or social care while a further quarter work in retail and education. These are the types of jobs where it is often necessary to return to a workplace. Men, on the other hand, are more likely to hold positions that can be done from a bedroom or study. Professor Chung told the Telegraph: \u201cThe three big occupations or sectors where remote work is still limited are healthcare, education, not all education but mainly primary and secondary, and then the third is retail. \u201cThose are very female-centric occupations, where remote working is not possible. \u201cOpportunity-wise, I think there are more jobs where it is traditionally more male-dominated where remote working is possible.\u201d She added: \u201cSometimes men will shirk away from the domestic responsibility just to ensure that their masculinity is not attacked.\u201d Workplaces have adapted since the pandemic to changing culture and a new British law means that employees now have a legal right to request flexible working. The WFH culture has been met with some resistance and some banks have been quick to try and get their staff back into the office. The Telegraph found that for some couples the new hybrid system is working - and not all men are subscribing to the stereotype of shying away from housework. Sam Evans, 57, who runs Humphreys of Henley, a company which curates countryside activities for visitors, is enjoying the balance shared with her husband Benet. \u201cI have worked from home when I was in my corporate life, but I really enjoy having the office to come into. \u201cHe is fantastic about just quietly getting on with stuff. I will think of something that needs doing during the day and make a note of it, and I will get home and it\u2019s been done.\u201d", "summary": "<p>Men worried \u2018masculinity is under attack\u2019 by change in working patterns</p>", "url": "https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/wfh-husbands-working-from-home-women-ons-b1161566.html", "image": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2024/06/02/11/22/PA_75790724.jpg?width=1200", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-02 12:18:01", "author": "William Mata", "authors": ["William Mata"], "language": "en", "source_country": "GB", "sentiment": 0.168}

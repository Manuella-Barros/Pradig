The editorial comes after the president appeared frail during the Thursday evening debate. His voice was soft and raspy, which his campaign attributed to a cold. He also interrupted himself and gave rambling answers to multiple questions. Vice President Kamala Harris even admitted Biden struggled: \u201cYes, it was a slow start,\u201d she said Thursday. \u201cThat\u2019s obvious to everyone.\u201d \u201cThe president appeared on Thursday night as the shadow of a great public servant,\u201d the board wrote on Friday night. \u201cHe struggled to explain what he would accomplish in a second term. \u201cHe struggled to respond to Mr. Trump\u2019s provocations,\u201d the board continued. \u201cHe struggled to hold Mr. Trump accountable for his lies, his failures and his chilling plans. More than once, he struggled to make it to the end of a sentence.\u201d While the editorial board said Biden would be their \u201cunequivocal\u201d pick over Trump, they called on the Democratic party to put forward a new candidate. \u201cThe clearest path for Democrats to defeat a candidate defined by his lies is to deal truthfully with the American public: acknowledge that Mr. Biden can\u2019t continue his race, and create a process to select someone more capable to stand in his place to defeat Mr. Trump in November,\u201d the Board wrote. \u201cIt is the best chance to protect the soul of the nation \u2014 the cause that drew Mr. Biden to run for the presidency in 2019 \u2014 from the malign warping of Mr. Trump.\u201d \u201cThe expectations for Joe Biden were low, but he didn\u2019t come close to meeting them,\u201d one Democratic strategist told The Independent. Another Democratic strategist told The Independent the debate was \u201chorrible.\u201d \u201cNeed to have Harris take over,\u201d the person said. \u201cCleanest option.\u201d Meanwhile, the president has yet to show any signs of stepping down. Biden\u2019s campaign said he has no plans of dropping out. The president also acknowledged his weak performance at a campaign rally on Friday in Raleigh, North Carolina. \u201cFolks, I don\u2019t walk as easy as I used to,\u201d Biden said. \u201cI don\u2019t speak as well as I used to. I don\u2019t debate as well as I used to. But I know what I do know. I know how to tell the truth. I know right from wrong. I know how to do this job.\u201d \u201cI know what millions of Americans do: When you get knocked down you get back up,\u201d he continued. Biden, for his part, did have strong moments amid his overall-weak performance. Biden laid into Trump over his alleged affair with porn star Stormy Daniels and the recent civil ruling that found him liable for sexually abusing writer E Jean Carrol. The president said Trump has the \u201cmorals of an alley cat.\u201d \u201cThe crimes that you are still charged with \u2014 think of all the civil penalties you have,\u201d Biden said. \u201cHow many millions of dollars do you owe in civil penalties for molesting a woman in public? For doing a whole range of things? Of having sex with a porn star...while your wife was pregnant?\u201d Trump responded by denying the affair with Daniels and calling his Manhattan trial \u2014 which centered around hush money payments to the adult film star \u2014 politically rigged.", "summary": "<p>Biden defended his weak debate performance on Friday, saying he still knows \u2018how to do this job\u2019 </p>", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/biden-presidential-race-editorial-b2570970.html", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/06/28/20/SEI210712180.jpg?width=1200", "video": "https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/tkq74zeF-4VHSaSK0.mp4", "publish_date": "2024-06-29 00:21:25", "author": "Katie Hawkinson", "authors": ["Katie Hawkinson"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.196}

About eight years ago, the county identified areas where a new station would help with response time. One of those areas included the Lightfoot Road area, which would mean the addition of a sixth station. But that still hasn\u2019t happened. The reason goes back several years. During development of the budget for fiscal year 2021, the county shifted gears and decided to focus on general staffing and rebuilding the existing \u2014 and aging \u2014 Station 3, pushing a new Station 6 further out. It could be 2031 before the sixth station is requested. According to James City County Fire Chief Ryan Ashe, that timetable is necessary due to financial constraints and because the department felt it was best to ensure existing stations were sustained before adding a new station. Also, adequately staffing current facilities is preferred to adding a new facility that may not be staffed as well. In the meantime, though the reconstruction and construction of the stations is years off, the county says it has been making changes to adapt and meet the community\u2019s needs. The James City County Fire Department has five stations spread throughout the 144-square-mile county, serving more than 82,000 people. In the 2019 budget process, priority was placed on a new station and the needed staff. By spring 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic was taking hold, \u201cthe fire department had already been approved for 12 of the ultimate 18 firefighter positions planned for Fire Station 6,\u201d Ashe said. During the development of the fiscal year 2021 budget, however, the department shifted priorities and focused on \u201cthe staffing initiatives and rebuilding Fire Station 3.\u201d Increasing maintenance challenges, increased costs for repairs and smaller apparatus bays at the station all played a role in the decision. \u201cDuring the same timeframe, we were increasingly relying on the Williamsburg Fire Department for mutual aid and initiatives to reduce that demand were needed,\u201d Ashe said. Changes over time The county authorized the department in May 2020 to redirect the 12 firefighter positions to address staffing and mutual aid reduction initiatives. Between July and September 2020, the department increased the number of firefighters on the engine companies at Station 1 and Station 5 to a minimum of three firefighters each day. Prior to the change, the department relied on the two firefighters from the ambulances to pair with the two firefighters from the engine to have a company, Ashe said. The move reduced the need for help from Williamsburg and it allowed firefighters to be available for emergency situations while ambulances were already occupied. In January 2022, the Board of Supervisors approved nine additional firefighter positions, Ashe said. The department aims to have three firefighters scheduled each day on each engine, ladder and rescue company, Ashe said. The department currently has 135 uniformed staff positions, and 120 of them operate three shifts of 40. The fire department aims to maintain response times of six minutes or less in areas with 365 emergency incidents or more per year. The department measures the time from when the department is notified by the 911 call center to when crews arrive on the scene. \u201cIn FY 2023, our average response time was 6:15 and we were able to respond to 49% of our calls within six minutes,\u201d Ashe said. The fire department responded to 14,413 calls in calendar year 2023, according to Ashe. The Lightfoot area generated about 1,050 calls in fiscal year 2023, and a Fire Station 6 would reduce calls for stations 1 (3135 Forge Road) and 4 (5312 Olde Town Road) in the area. Across the county, 58% of calls to the county are medical, and \u201cthe remaining 42% is a combination of calls such as vehicle accidents, gas leaks, alarms, building fires and public service calls.\u201d Despite the delay in building Station 6, there are some who would like to see it sooner than later. Lisa Ownby, who unsuccessfully ran for the Stonehouse district seat on the Board of Supervisors last year, championed the issue. Ownby said the additional station is needed to increase services in the Lightfoot area and in Colonial Heritage. She also said the location of the fire stations in the county has led to an increase in costs for her homeowners insurance in the Stonehouse district. \u201cIt\u2019s a real issue,\u201d she said. Jim Baldyga, a James City County resident, said he also thinks Station 6 is needed. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame that it got lost \u2026 in the COVID years.\u201d \u201cHaving been in the insurance industry, I know how important it is to have good fire department coverage for your town,\u201d he said. He said people in the Colonial Heritage area need emergency services often. Baldyga said he feels safe with the county\u2019s current emergency infrastructure, but he said he could feel safer. Supervisor Barbara Null, who represents the district where a new Station 6 would go, said the Board of Supervisors follows Ashe\u2019s advice when it comes to making decisions on the future of the fire and emergency medical services. \u201cWe agree with his plans for our future projects,\u201d she said. \u201cEventually we will see another station in the Lightfoot area, but not until needs of the area of Station #3 are met.\u201d Rebuilding Station 3 Station 3 on John Tyler Highway, which opened in 1980, has had increased maintenance costs due to its age, smaller apparatus bays and requires apparatus to make a 90-degree turn leaving the bay, Ashe said. The new station will have more living space, and \u201cthe apparatus bays will be wider and taller to accommodate modern apparatus and positioned to eliminate the 90 degree turn when leaving the facility that increases wear and tear on the apparatus,\u201d Ashe said. The department is working on plans to rebuild the station without interrupting operations at the current station. Construction is expected to begin in 2029.

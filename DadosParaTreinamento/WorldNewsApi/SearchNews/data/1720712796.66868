We all know Elon is one of the wealthiest people on the planet, and he would remain so even if Tesla were to renege on the commitment we made in 2018.\"Musk is the third richest person in the world, worth $203 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.Although Tesla delivered record sales of more than 1.8 million electric vehicles worldwide in 2023, the EV maker has faced increased scrutiny in recent months.According to emails obtained by CNBC earlier this week, Musk has been diverting important resources to his other businesses: social media platform X and his AI startup xAI.Earlier this year, investors accused Musk of \"blackmailing\" them by tweeting that he was \"uncomfortable growing Tesla to be a leader in AI and robotics without having 25 percent voting control.\"In April, Musk sacked Tesla's entire Supercharger team, including senior director of EV charging Rebecca Tinucci, a move that was criticized by Tesla's investors and partners.", "summary": "Norway's sovereign wealth fund will vote against Elon Musk's $56 billion paycheck at Tesla's annual meeting, citing concerns over award size, performance triggers, and key person risk.", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/norways-wealth-fund-vote-against-elon-musks-55bn-tesla-paycheck-2024-6", "image": "https://i.insider.com/65e5da86ce7f1785b2e5ce40?width=1136&format=jpeg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 17:15:45", "author": "Cameron Manley", "authors": ["Cameron Manley"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.031}

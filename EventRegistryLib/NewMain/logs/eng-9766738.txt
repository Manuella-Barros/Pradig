Instead of looking at the number alone, it is also about the way you decide to get there. An obvious method for every country is to reduce debt, but borrowing is a must for a growing economy.

Specific projects in Bihar have been allocated \u20b958,900 crores, and in Andhra, Phase I of Polavaram Project alone will cost the Union Government (which is committed to bearing the entire expense of the Irrigation project) \u20b914,000 crore,\" he said.\n\n\"Several other projects have been announced without clear allocations, but the total funding commitments made by the Budget to the two states run into lakhs of crores on paper,\" he said.\n\nDespite these big commitments, Ramesh said a newspaper reported on July 29 that the financial package for Andhra Pradesh and Bihar may cost the exchequer only about \u20b920,000-30,000 crore this year.\n\n\"The Budget's expenditure numbers confirm the same. The 'Special Assistance under the demand - Transfers to States' is \u20b920,000 crore. Even if the whole corpus is allocated only to these two states, that leaves a funding gap of tens of thousands of crores,\" he said.\n\n\"The Finance Minister has pulled a fast one on NDA allies in Bihar and Andhra Pradesh. Most of these grand announcements in the Budget will not see the light of day for a few years, at best. And when the time comes to redeem the funds for these promised projects, this unstable Government will no longer be in power,\" Mr. Ramesh claimed.\n\n\"As Mahatma Gandhi said of the Cripps Mission in 1942, this is 'a post-dated cheque on a crashing bank',\" Mr. Ramesh said.\n\nRead Comments", "source": {"uri": "thehindu.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hindu"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_rupee", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indian rupee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crore", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Crore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andhra_Pradesh", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Andhra Pradesh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Andhra Pradesh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bihar", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bihar"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bihar"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Secretary_of_the_Chinese_Communist_Party", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Democratic_Alliance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Democratic Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nirmala_Sitharaman", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nirmala Sitharaman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jairam_Ramesh", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jairam Ramesh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_of_Finance_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minister of Finance (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indian National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polavaram_Project", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Polavaram Project"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irrigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Irrigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_India", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Government of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakh", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lakh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahatma_Gandhi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mahatma Gandhi"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 54}], "image": "https://th-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/htewrx/article68464073.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/PTI07_25_2024_000273A.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9766738", "eventUri": "eng-9766738", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-30", "textStart": 16, "textEnd": 23}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-29", "textStart": 1110, "textEnd": 1117}], "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 195, "relevance": 1}

The Act (Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act) requires the Centre to support (the state) in building its capital city and developing the backward regions,\" she explained.\n\n\"Several steps have been taken in the last 10 years and many other steps, as per the Act, which had to be taken have been taken. Yes, we will support the building of the new capital at Amaravati and the Polavaram irrigation project ... Polavaram should have been completed by now but there were some technical issues. The state government is seized of the matter,\" Sitharaman said.\n\nResponding particularly to the criticism by Congress President Mallikarjun Kharge, the Finance Minister said, \"To the point he raised - that I have not named many states and spoke only about two states... The Congress was in power for a long time. They presented many Budgets and should know that in every Budget, you don't get an opportunity to name every state of the country.\"\n\nSitharaman also said the Budget reflected Prime Minister Narendra Modi's wish to keep things simple, so that everyone, and not just subject experts, could understand India's finances.\n\n\"We present everything upfront. There is no fine print... We ensure that any changes made are communicated openly, based on feedback and transparent processes,\" she pointed out.\n\nThe Finance Minister also said that borrowing is a must for a growing economy to meet its needs and aspirations, but the focus of the Finance Ministry under her is to ensure that debt is reduced without affecting growth.\n\nShe added that fixing a number for the eventual fiscal deficit and working towards it with temporary solutions every year can be one way of going about things, but it is not the right way from a macroeconomic perspective.\n\n\"We have chosen a healthy option for getting the fiscal deficit closer to the number. Instead of looking at the number alone, it is also about the way you decide to get there. An obvious method for every country is to reduce debt, but borrowing is a must for a growing economy.

The question is how much are you borrowing and where it is being used,\" the Finance Minister noted.", "source": {"uri": "news18.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News18"}, "authors": [{"uri": "pragati_pal@news18.com", "name": "Pragati Pal", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_of_Finance_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minister of Finance (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andhra_Pradesh", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Andhra Pradesh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Andhra Pradesh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bihar", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bihar"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bihar"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Finance_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Finance (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goods_and_Services_Tax_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Goods and Services Tax (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nirmala_Sitharaman", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nirmala Sitharaman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_and_union_territories_of_India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "States and union territories of India"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value-added_tax", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Value-added tax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_governments_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "State governments of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDTV", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NDTV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diesel_fuel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Diesel fuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gasoline", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gasoline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_budget_balance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Government budget balance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Petroleum"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Accounting/Tax_Negotiation_and_Representation", "label": "dmoz/Business/Accounting/Tax Negotiation and Representation", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Tax_Preparation", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Tax Preparation", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Commercial_Lending", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Commercial Lending", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2024/07/nirmala-sitharaman-1-2024-07-c6b65e131599a5fdbd93b2a5927646a9-16x9.jpg?impolicy=website&width=1200&height=675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9766738", "eventUri": "eng-9766738", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3333333333333334, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

It includes Rs 12,000 crore towards financing the cost of J&K police, reported PTI.\n\n\"That's the burden we want to take on our shoulders,\" Sitharaman said.\n\n\"The National Commission on Farmers had recommended in 2006 that the Minimum Support Price should be at 50 per cent more than the weighted average cost of production. This was not accepted by the UPA government. The cabinet note, which was drafted in July 2007, said that MSP is recommended by the CACP based on objective criteria considering the variety of factors involved. Therefore, increasing by at least 50% on the cost may distort the market. In some cases, there may be a mechanical linkage between MSP and the cost of production per producer. After saying this, the UPA govt rejected the MS Swaminathan report in 2007...Congress Party can go on shedding crocodile tears about farmers, but no implementation was done in the last 10 years,\" she said.", "source": {"uri": "mid-day.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "mid-day"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Progressive_Alliance", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Progressive Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nirmala_Sitharaman", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nirmala Sitharaman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Parliament of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monsoon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Monsoon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_budget_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Union budget of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_Trust_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Press Trust of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_of_Finance_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minister of Finance (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lok_Sabha", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lok Sabha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jammu_and_Kashmir_(state)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jammu and Kashmir (state)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_rupee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indian rupee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crore", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Crore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andhra_Pradesh", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andhra Pradesh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Andhra Pradesh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bihar", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bihar"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bihar"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_support_price_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minimum support price (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_National_(Abu_Dhabi)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The National (Abu Dhabi)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M._S._Swaminathan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "M.

Instead of looking at the number alone, it is also about the way you decide to get there. An obvious method for every country is to reduce debt, but borrowing is a must for a growing economy. The question is how much are you borrowing and where it is being used.\"\n\n\"Are you using it for asset creation or to service or reduce the existing debt? If the growth in the debt is to be reduced, borrowing more to do this is not the right thing. So you borrow and create assets. We have studied the NK Singh Committee report (on fiscal responsibility), held discussions and decided that we won't look at the number alone but choose the right path to reduce debt without affecting your growth, desires and aspirations,\" she explained.\n\nAddressing other aspects of the Budget, the finance minister also said that its communication has become much simpler and the document now speaks for itself without needing an intermediary or expert to explain it.\n\n\"Each budget is a challenge for its contents but equally it is a challenge to craft the language of the budget. It has been a desire of the Prime Minister that the budget should be simple, you convey it simply and the language should be simple so that anyone can understand what you are saying. The other feature he has been clear about from the beginning is that the budget should say everything, without hiding anything,\" Ms Sitharaman said.\n\n\"We try to fine-tune it each time so that ultimately it should be a simple document. In my childhood, I remember the budget document was so complex, people would study and analyse it and simplify it...

In a post on X, he also shared a media report claiming that financial packages for Andhra Pradesh and Bihar are likely to cost the Centre Rs 20,000-30,000 crore.\n\n\"The non-biological PM's Kursi Bachao Budget makes critical promises to two states, Andhra Pradesh and Bihar. Specific projects in Bihar have been allocated Rs 58,900 crores, and in Andhra, Phase I of Polavaram Project alone will cost the Union Government (which is committed to bearing the entire expense of the Irrigation project) Rs 14,000 crore,\" he said.\n\nSeveral other projects have been announced without clear allocations, but the total funding commitments made by the Budget to the two states run into lakhs of crores on paper, he said.\n\nDespite these big commitments, Ramesh said a newspaper reported on Monday that the financial package for Andhra Pradesh and Bihar may cost the exchequer only about Rs 20,000-30,000 crore this year.\n\n\"The Budget's expenditure numbers confirm the same. The 'Special Assistance under the demand - Transfers to States' is Rs 20,000 crore.

Most of these grand announcements in the Budget will not see the light of day for a few years, at best. And when the time comes to redeem the funds for these promised projects, this unstable Government will no longer be in power,\" Ramesh claimed.\n\n\"As Mahatma Gandhi said of the Cripps Mission in 1942-- this is 'a post-dated cheque on a crashing bank',\" Ramesh said.

Does that mean that these states were bereft of funds?\" she asked.\n\nFlagging statements of Opposition leaders on cooperative federalism, she said that a deliberate attempt was made to delude and mislead the public at large.\n\nA misleading campaign is being run by the Opposition parties and as part of this gameplan, they are spreading canards and fake information. She added that they are trying to create fear in people's minds by distorting the facts.\n\nThe Finance Minister also shared details of various allocations and outlays in the current Budget for the states, which were not named in her speech.\n\n\"Talking about Railway projects alone, the one in Bihar, Bengal and Jharkhand has been allocated Rs 12,000 crore while the one in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh will entail a cost of Rs 770 crore,\" FM said, citing random figures.\n\n\"In terms of road highway projects, Kerala has been allocated Rs 9,600 crores while Jammu and Kashmir, Punjab, Haryana and Delhi together have been sanctioned Rs 18, 274 crores,\" she added.\n\nShe further lambasted the Congress-led Opposition for keeping mum on years of 'malpractice' (of not naming states in the Budget) and said that an unnecessary controversy has been created because a chaiwala turned Prime Minister is running an efficient administration.\n\nNotably, the INDIA bloc had raised questions over Budgetary allocations and also accused the Modi government of favouring two states Bihar and Andhra Pradesh, ruled by BJP and its allies.

The Minister rebutted the Opposition's claims of partiality, citing historical precedents from UPA budgets to support her arguments.\n\n\"The first issue I take up is members from the opening speakers talking about how there is a threat to cooperative federalism. Only a few states have been given the benefit in the budget,\" stated Sitharaman. She firmly rejected the notion that states not named in the budget speech would be deprived of funds. \"In a budget speech, if a state is not named, it doesn't mean that no money goes to them. Unfortunately, a lot of members did speak about this, which pains me.\"\n\nSitharaman referred to budgets from 2004-2005 to illustrate her point. \"The Budget of 2004-2005 did not mention 17 states. I would like to ask the members of the UPA government at that time -- did money not go to those 17 states? If they have stopped it, then they have every business to raise questions,\" she said. Sitharaman emphasised that multiple states were often not named in UPA-era budgets, yet funds were still allocated.\n\nHighlighting the inconsistencies in the Opposition's arguments, she remarked, \"Seventeen states were not named in 2004-5, 18 states in 2005-6, 13 states in 2006-7, and 16 states in 2007-8. Did money not go to them?\" She pointed out that the 2009-10 budget named only Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, \"ignoring\" 26 states, questioning if other states were denied funds then.\n\nAddressing the recent budget allocations, Sitharaman said, \"We are being blamed that only two states were named and other states are not getting anything. The 2009-10 budget had only two states, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. What does that mean? Then it's okay when you do it, but you blame the same thing on somebody else.\"\n\nSitharaman also noted the interim budget of 2014-15, which \"ignored\" 26 states. \"Was there a noise? Did people say you ignored those states, you didn't give them money?\" she asked, criticising the Opposition for attempting to \"distort\" data to create fear among the public. \"So you want to distort and create uproar to create a sense of fear among people, you can go about distorting data, but this stands here, sir. In the last few years now, each state we have ministers go and explain how much we have given to each of the states.\"\n\nProviding specific examples of financial support to various states, she mentioned, \"Bulk drug parks in Himachal Pradesh received Rs 1,900 crore. PM Mitra textile parks went to Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, and Telangana. Have they not received money for that? Rs 500 crores for Greenfield Park and Rs 200 crores for Brownfield Park.\"\n\nAddressing the issue of Minimum Support Price (MSP), Sitharaman cited the National Commission on Farmers' 2006 recommendation for MSP to be 50% more than the weighted average cost of production. \"This was not accepted by the UPA government. The cabinet note, drafted in July 2007, said MSP is recommended by the CACP on objective criteria considering various factors. The UPA government rejected the MS Swaminathan report in 2007,\" she stated, accusing the Congress Party of shedding \"crocodile tears\" for farmers.\n\nSitharaman reassured that no sector received lesser allocation compared to the previous year. She confirmed compliance with the fiscal deficit trajectory, aiming to bring it down to below 4.5% by 2025-26. Additionally, she highlighted the substantial financial support of Rs 17,000 crore provided to Jammu and Kashmir in the Union Budget, including Rs 12,000 crore for the Jammu and Kashmir Police, to give the region more flexibility for development activities.\n\n\"An additional central assistance of Rs 5,000 crores has also been provided,\" she added.", "source": {"uri": "news.abplive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "english"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Finance_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Finance (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nirmala_Sitharaman", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nirmala Sitharaman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lok_Sabha", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lok Sabha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Progressive_Alliance", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United Progressive Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sansad_TV", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sansad TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cooperative"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bihar", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bihar"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bihar"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uttar_Pradesh", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Uttar Pradesh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Uttar Pradesh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_rupee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indian rupee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_budget_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Union budget of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crore", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Crore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_support_price_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minimum support price (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jammu_and_Kashmir_(union_territory)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jammu and Kashmir (union territory)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M._S._Swaminathan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "M.

She set a record by presenting the budget seven times in a row. This budget, the first after the 2024 general elections, holds immense importance as it sets the financial direction for the next five years and indicates the political stability of the Modi government. The first Budget of Modi 3.0, a month after he was sworn in for the third time, showed generous support for Bihar and Andhra Pradesh, both governed by key allies, the Telugu Desam Party and the JD (U).\n\nThis move received criticism from the Opposition, who said it was a Budget driven by political needs and excluded states governed by the Opposition to please the BJP's allies. The stability of the NDA government relies on the TDP and JD(U), with 16 and 12 members in the Lok Sabha, respectively. Both parties have been pushing for special status or financial help to develop their states. Sitharaman outlined a series of financial aid and development projects for both states. The Congress viewed the budget, which brought substantial funding to the allies, as a strategic move. They saw it as an attempt to secure the stability of the Modi government by rewarding these two allies, thereby providing a clear insight into the political tactics at play. The TDP and JD(U) are pivotal in bolstering the BJP government. The NDA government's firm footing significantly hinges on them.\n\nTheir leaders have been lobbying for special financial help for their states in prebudget meetings with the Prime Minister and Union ministers. This 'special help' often refers to a higher share of Central funds or unique development projects. Both parties fervently advocate for this to foster the development of their states. The huge benefits for the two states were likely part of an agreement with the BJP for their support of the government. So, Modi has fulfilled the first part of the agreement to ensure their continued support.\n\nThe Finance Minister has announced several ambitious plans to transform Bihar in preparation for next year's Assembly polls. These plans, including the establishment of new airports, medical colleges, sports infrastructure, and a 2,400 MW power plant, are expected to significantly impact the political landscape and garner public support for the state's BJP-JD(U) coalition, thereby engaging the audience in the unfolding political dynamics. The Modi government's bonanza to Andhra Pradesh includes building its new capital, Amaravati. Ten years ago, the then Chief Minister, Chandrababu Naidu, set in motion plans to make the state's capital in Amaravati. However, he lost power, and his successor, Jagan Mohan Reddy, did not endorse the idea. Instead, he proposed three capital cities in the three regions of Andhra Pradesh.\n\nRecently, the court quashed this proposal, allowing Naidu to forge ahead with his dream project. The significant financial support, amounting to Rs 15,000 crore, will be routed through multilateral development agencies, with more funds to be mobilised later. Further, the government has unequivocally pledged to fulfil the obligations of the Andhra Pradesh Reorganization Act, including financing and completing the Polavaram Irrigation Project. Interestingly, the poll-bound states, including Maharashtra, Haryana, Jharkhand, and the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir, did not receive the same level of benefits. These states raised questions about the fairness of the budget allocation. Jammu and Kashmir will have Assembly polls later this year.\n\nThe BJP lost 14 seats in Maharashtra, five in Haryana, three in Jharkhand, and one in Jammu and Kashmir. On the other hand, the Congress gained 12 seats in Maharashtra, five in Haryana, and one in Jharkhand. To win back support, the BJP must strategise. As expected, the budget drew criticism from the Opposition. Congress President Mallikarjun Kharge commented that Bihar and Andhra Pradesh received 'pakoda and jalebi' in the budget. At the same time, Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) MP Manoj Jha said, \"The government has given shells in the nut.\" This criticism adds to the ongoing political discourse and keeps the audience engaged. Modi's critics thought he might find it challenging to adopt coalition dharma, but he has done it smoothly.\n\nThough he has fulfilled the financial aid part of his pact with the two allies, more demands may arise in future. This includes ensuring adequate representation as Modi expands his cabinet. He must keep these two allies in good humour until he gets his majority. He can only implement the BJP's main issues, such as introducing the Uniform Civil Code, and carrying out other economic reforms with the help of two allies. Observers say that, slowly, the party will attract members from different parties and increase its own numbers. For now, Nitish and Naidu have got their pound of flesh but must be prepared to lose their importance gradually. Overall, the 2024 budget was Bihar-Andhra, driven by coalition compulsions. Their demand for the particular package comes in place of special status.", "source": {"uri": "thestatesman.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Statesman"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Politics of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nirmala_Sitharaman", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nirmala Sitharaman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janata_Dal_(United)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Janata Dal (United)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telugu_Desam_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Telugu Desam Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_of_Finance_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minister of Finance (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andhra_Pradesh", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Andhra Pradesh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Andhra Pradesh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Democratic_Alliance", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Democratic Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bihar", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bihar"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bihar"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lok_Sabha", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lok Sabha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y._S._Jagan_Mohan_Reddy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Y.

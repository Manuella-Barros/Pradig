She said the Supreme Court of India has helped bolster the country\u2019s reputation as a favourable venue for dispute resolution by limiting judicial intervention and respecting arbitral awards. \u201cThis judicial philosophy complements legislative reforms and signifies India\u2019s ambition to become a global hub for arbitration,\u201d Justice Kohli said. She was addressing an event during the London International Disputes Week 2024: \u201cArbitration in India and the MENA Region: Roadmap to 2030\u201d organised by the International Arbitration & Mediation Centre, Hyderabad in collaboration with King & Spalding LLP. Justice Kohli said it was imperative to recognise that the essence of justice lies not only in honouring and enforcing arbitral awards but also in safeguarding fairness and equity for the stake holders. \u201cIt must be underscored that judicial intervention on grounds of patent illegality or public policy ought to be an exceptional measure to be deployed sparingly and with utmost caution. The Indian judiciary, guided by the principles of minimal interference, exercises prudence and restraint in interfering with arbitral awards,\u201d she said. Justice Kohli said as the landscape of arbitration evolves and new challenges emerge, the Indian judiciary has also adapted and responded to the changing needs of the hour and refined the contours of judicial intervention. \u201cAs we look ahead to 2030, India\u2019s path forward in arbitration necessitates a robust focus on institutional arbitration. To fully realise its potential, India must continue to enhance the operational effectiveness and global reputation of its arbitration institutions,\u201d she said. Justice Kohli said this involves not only improving the infrastructure, but also ensuring that these institutions can boast of experienced and upright arbitrators, supported by efficient administrative frameworks and constantly updated rules. She said by doing so, India can attract more international arbitration matters, which will, in turn, boost investor confidence and contribute to the country\u2019s economic growth. Justice Kohli said in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, the path forward involves harmonising arbitration practices across different jurisdictions to create a more predictable and investor-friendly environment. She said regional cooperation and dialogue are essential to achieving this harmonisation. Justice Kohli said both India and the MENA region must embrace technological advancements to enhance the efficiency and accessibility of arbitration. She said the COVID experience has resulted in a paradigm shift towards online dispute resolution mechanisms in the field of arbitration and mediation. \u201cDigitisation has improved the efficiency of the arbitration process and helped prevent loss or damage to important records. Availability of digital records also makes enforcement of arbitral awards more efficient and reduces the burden of evidentiary challenges for courts,\u201d Justice Kohli said. She said Indian courts have been quick to readjust to modern times by offering an option of virtual hearings to lawyers and litigants. \u201cIn the context of arbitration, this commitment ensures that it remains a reliable and preferred method for resolving commercial disputes in the digital era,\u201d she said, adding that this digital transformation will also make arbitration more accessible to parties from different geographical locations. Justice Kohli said by strengthening institutional frameworks, harmonising regional practices and embracing technological advancements, India and MENA must ensure that they are well-equipped to handle the complexities of modern commercial disputes. \u201cBy upholding the principles of fairness, efficiency, and minimal judicial intervention, India and the MENA region can build a robust arbitration ecosystem that meets global standards,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cTogether, let us work towards a future where arbitration is the cornerstone of dispute resolution\u201d.

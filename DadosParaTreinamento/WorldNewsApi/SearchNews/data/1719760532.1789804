The decision was arrived at during a meeting at Kitui town for all 2022 UDA aspirants and candidates from across the 40 wards of Kitui County. According to a joint statement read by Nzambani Ward MCA Joseph Musyoka, the delegates want a common voice to deliver the needs of the county residents to the Kenya Kwanza Government. Mbai, who was elected on a UDA Party ticket in 2022 and is serving his second term, has been a firm critic of the opposition. Speaking after the endorsement, Mbai unleashed a scathing attack on President William Ruto\u2019s appointees in Ukambani, accusing them of ignoring the region\u2019s needs and perpetuating a sense of isolation. Mbai lamented that despite President William Ruto having appointed a number of individuals in senior government positions, the community still feels abandoned. Mbai, who is President William Ruto\u2019s pointman in Kitui County, vehemently accused appointees for neglecting the region\u2019s pressing needs and failing to deliver on promises, threatening to rally the community to petition the president for their replacement. The firebrand MP drew parallels between the current administration and the previous government, where former cabinet ministers from the region like Mulu Mutisya and Nyenze solidified support for former President Daniel Moi by prioritizing the needs of the people. \u201cWe want to know what our people are getting out of these appointments,\u201d Mbai demanded. \u201cInstead of pushing development for our region, all we see is relief food being brought to us. It\u2019s time for change.\u201d", "summary": "<p>Kitui County United Democratic Alliance (UDA) party delegates have unanimously endorsed Kitui East MP Nimrod Mbai for the party&#8217;s Chairmanship position in the forthcoming grassroots elections.

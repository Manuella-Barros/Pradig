Manohar Parrikar, 'bhai' to Goans, remains the undisputed king of Panaji -- a turf which he has guarded fiercely since 1994, even when he moved to Delhi to handle the defence ministry for two-and-a-half years. So, when he returned to lead a post-poll coalition government of diverse parties with divergent views, it came as no surprise that he would finally opt for Panaji to get re-elected.\n\nBut what turned the bypoll into a no-contest for Parrikar was Atanasio Monserrate joining Goa Forward Party. \"What election? This time Babush isn't there. Congress has got some outsider to contest. There is nothing in the election,\" says a woman, who works as a household assistant.\n\nShe isn't the only one to believe that this election has lost its charm. Perception-wise, Parrikar has already won. Issues of infrastructure development, garbage management, traffic, parking, decent markets and public transport all continue to plague the capital city, and fingers are pointed towards Parrikar. But then, the general refrain is: \"He is the chief minister. He is not an ordinary candidate or some simple minister. Ultimately, we have to vote for the chief minister.\"\n\nThere have been criticisms -- from cobbling together a team to form the government \"unethically\" to making U-turns -- and Parrikar has been at the receiving end. But then none knows Goa better than Parrikar. With every election and every passing year, as Parrikar's stature grew, so did people's expectations.\n\n\"I don't see any challenge when it comes to winning the elections. But the challenge will be to fulfil people's expectations,\" says Parrikar.\n\nAnd the expectations keep rising. \"We have to choose a candidate who will be in power to resolve the issues,\" says a lady voter from Tonca, adding that the list of pending issues are long -- from garbage to roads to cleaning of St Inez creek.\n\n\"There is an undertone of disappointment with Parrikar. Except for a higher cost of living, things haven't changed for the original residents of Panaji,\" says a senior citizen, preferring to remain anonymous.\n\nParrikar knows it too well that what he has taken on isn't a simple task. Managing perceptions and coalition, pushing the state on the road of development and to quell the undercurrent against him, he will have to deliver. No wonder that 'Bhai' has addressed 114 meetings each attended by an average 25 persons in his 22,000-odd constituency and has promised to set up a committee headed by an IAS officer to find solutions for Panaji's woes. \"We decided to hold corner meetings because it was not possible to cover 8,500 houses in a short time. It is better to have a 30-minute interaction than a 30-second meet-and-greet session. We are confident of winning by a margin of 9,000 votes,\" says his one-time secretary-turned-campaign manager Sidharth Kuncalienkar, who vacated his seat for Parrikar.\n\nThe 9,000-vote margin math has baffled poll watchers. Congress candidate Girish Chodankar may be an import from Fatorda and has never tasted electoral victory, but he has been able to put up a resistance to the strongman from Panaji.\n\nThat Chodankar will not allow Parrikar to run away with the entire vote share was evident as BJP was quick to restrategise their campaign and are now leaving not a single vote to chance. \"BJP even identified the first time voters and called them to interact with Parrikar. That clearly shows that the party is leaving nothing to chance to ensure his margin doesn't come down,\" says a party watcher.\n\nFor Parrikar, who has won a record five times from Panaji, elections have been far from being a cakewalk except in 2012 and 1999, when he won comfortably. Even as the chief minister in 2002, when he dissolved the assembly and went for polls, he faced a similar situation. In a slightly smaller constituency of around 18,000 voters, Parrikar had won by 1,292 votes against then chairperson of erstwhile Panjim municipal council Ramesh Silimkhan. Since 2012, the size of the constituency grew to 22,000-plus voters.\n\nFor Congress, the only way to combat Parrikar's aura in his bastion is to keep hammering the fact that the capital city's woes have remained persistent throughout his 23-year reign. And that's exactly what they are doing.\n\n\"Chodankar's entry brought to an end the pre-fixing games that Panaji has seen over the years. He is a cadre person who would not compromise at the cost of the party,\" says a former Panaji block leader, adding people saw him as the candidate who would take Parrikar head on.\n\n\"They know Girish as the AICC secretary, as a clean man. When we started, we did not have a strong block but now we have a strong network,\" says North Goa district Congress president Amarnath Panjikar.\n\nIn politics, they say caste equations matter. Here, Chodankar belongs to Bhandari samaj, a adominant community in Panaji, having around 8,000 voters. Poll watchers, however, question whether Chodankar would be able to get their sizeable votes as many of them are with BJP. Congress may be also banking on minority votes which is around 8,000-plus.\n\nBut Congress veterans know they are up against Parrikar. \"If you want to win against Parrikar, then you have to win the Saraswat vote, which has not happened. There is BJP vote bank and then there is the Saraswat vote, which is Parrikar's strength,\" says a party veteran.\n\nWhat is perhaps working in Congress' mind is the withdrawal of AAP from the fray and its support to Congress. And then there is Goa Suraksha Manch, which has put up its president Anand Shirdokar. In the February polls, both AAP and GSM together polled 2,000-odd votes. But then there, too, Parrikar seems to have an advantage. A faction of GSM has taken a neutral stand and reckons they have put up a candidate just for the sake of contesting. \"I have decided to remain neutral,\" says Raju Sukerkar.\n\n\"Parrikar served the nation as the defence minister. He has such experience.

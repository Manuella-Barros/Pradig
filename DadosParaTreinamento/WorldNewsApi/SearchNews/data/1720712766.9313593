The Mirror Choice team has rounded up some of the best hampers and foodie gifts they\u2019ve tried and tested so whether your dad loves a tipple, has a sweet tooth or even just enjoys a brew, we\u2019ve got you covered with something to brighten his day.

READ MORE:Nine best men's aftershave and fragrance deals that are perfect gifts for Father's Day Imp and Maker Match Day breakfast hamper Price: From \u00a359 at Imp and Maker What you get: Everything you need for the ultimate breakfast sandwiches, just in time for the Euros hence the \u2018match day\u2019 branding, including bacon, sausages, ketchup, rolls, chilli nuts, crisps and chorizo thins (think a cross between crisps and beef jerky). Why we love it: Imagine the best bacon and sausages from the fancy farm shop down the road delivered direct to your door. That. There are bigger hampers out there but this one is all thriller no filler for the price. This is the most expensive gift on the list but of all the hampers I've tested over the years this is the one that my husband still talks about fondly and I'd absolutely buy it again as a gift for him. A minor quibble was the white bread rolls were perhaps a bit basic but with everything else so top notch right down to the deliciously tangy Tracklements ketchup perhaps it was a deliberate choice to avoid overshadowing the hero ingredients. Devon Hampers Cornish Pasty and Cream Tea Price:\u00a327.95 from Devon Hampers What you get: Two chunky steak-filled cornish pasties, two fresh-baked scones, four tea bags, two wrapped packs of shortbread fingers, strawberry jam and Rodda's iconic clotted cream. Why we loved it:This box of treats looks way more expensive than its price tag and comes with free delivery and a gift card included. Both the scones and pasties proved a big hit with our tester, although a minor quibble was the lack of fruit in the scone (sacrilege). Overall though was a solid showstopper. and the perfect option if you have a dad who loves both sweet and savoury. Stormtrooper Beer Thirst Aid Kit Price: \u00a326 from Moonpig.com although shoppers can currently get \u00a35 off using the code GIFT5 What you get: Five 330ml cans of the bestselling flavours from the intergalactic craft brewers along with a beer glass, four beer mats and a bag of snacks. Why we love it: Really nicely presented and a great sampler of the brand\u2019s core range. Sometimes novelty beers are all about the pun-laden names and flavour comes a distant second. Not so with Stormtrooper - although their pun game is strong too. Dad got one of these at sets for Christmas and loved a couple of the flavours so much, notably the SNIPA IPA and Galactic Pale Ale, he\u2019s been buying them directly ever since. The Dark Side has never looked so tempting. Snowdonia Cheese Quintessential hamper Price: \u00a345 from Snowdonia Cheese Company What you get:A classic black cord hamper packed with five truckles of cheese, two jars of chutney and a box of crackers. Why we love it: We\u2019ve all done it. You see something online that looks like a stunning gift but then you realise when you order it that it comes in a boring cardboard box unless you pay extra for a fancy hamper. Not here. This has real wow factor when it arrives included in the base price. While for some it might feel a bit samey having five different hard cheeses, you don\u2019t have to rush to eat them all at once. When we tested this at Christmas we were thrilled to see the lengthy use by dates meant we could get our cheese fix well into the new year. We\u2019d recommend starting with the smoked Beechwood cheddar and the Red Devil Red Leicester with Habanero chillies, both of which are incredible. Fitzbillies Chelsea buns Price: From \u00a318 at Fitzbillies.com What you get: Six gloriously sticky, home baked Chelsea buns. Why we love it: Fitzbillies have been selling Chelsea buns from their store in Cambridge since 1920 and clearly know their stuff. If your dad loves a classic then this is the perfect sweet to send over. We tried their Christmas tree shaped box of buns last year and their yeasty, fruit-filled goodness was popular with all ages and ripe for sharing. This is the traditionalist's choice, although we remain unconvinced by the pot of syrup you can use to make them even stickier - we'd be sprinkly extra sugar on the top instead. You can also add a 'happy Father's Day' biscuit for an extra fiver. Gluten free and bake at home options are also available. Bird and Blend Whisktea Price: From \u00a33.50 from Bird and Blend What you get: A brew unlike any you\u2019ve ever had before. This limited edition blend was developed in their Glasgow store and is a rooibos based tea with a delicious smoked and malty flavour with a ginger spice and underlying caramel sweetness that we just can't get enough of. Why we love it: Bird and Blend are basically to tea what Willy Wonka is to chocolate and we\u2019ve long been fans of their unusual flavours, which range from matcha and herbal blends to more traditional black tea options perfect for taking your cuppa to the next level. The Whisktea blend is perfect whether you're drinking it hot or iced in the warm weather as a cold brew and a great introduction to the brand although if you can\u2019t get to the store to buy it in person we recommend stocking up on a few extra flavours to get free P&P. Biscuiteers Papa Bear letterbox biscuit Price: \u00a312.95 for the bear on his own, or upgrade to the Negroni and bear gift box for \u00a322 What you get: A generously sized hand-iced chocolate biscuit beautifully presented in a gift box. Why we love it: Biscuiteers has a reputation for stunning biscuits made to a classic crispy recipe and intricately decorated with icing. Their themed presentation tins packed with biscuits are show-stoppingly brilliant gifts ideal for most recipients (and we\u2019ve got a couple of tins being used to store knick knacks around the house to prove it) but for us this cute bear is one of the best-value Father\u2019s Day gifts you can get delivered this year - and perfect for showing dad how cool you think he is.", "summary": "Whether your dad has a sweet tooth, hankers for something savoury or just doesn't like being given things he'd describe as clutter, there's plenty of great foodie gifts available to order before Father's Day.

{"id": 243233880, "title": "Kurtenbach: Instant reaction to the Sharks&#8217; No. 11 pick in the NHL Draft", "text": "The Sharks have their future No. 1 center. And now they have their future No. 1 defenseman, too. I\u2019m certain that the Sharks did not expect 6-foot-3, 205-pound blueliner Sam Dickinson to be on the board when they selected No. 11. After all, he was expected to be the third defenseman taken Friday \u2014 likely in the top seven. But when he was there at No. 11, with four defensemen already selected, the Sharks didn\u2019t hesitate to take him. It\u2019s a straightforward, logical pick that provides incredible value to the Sharks. A left-handed defenseman from the London Knights, Dickinson was a Memorial Cup runner-up, anchoring the best power play in the OHL with sweet passes and smooth skating, scoring 70 points this past season. Because of his uber-heavy shot and the connection to London, Dickinson has been compared to Oilers defensemen Evan Bouchard. There are certainly worse comparisons to pull. And I can see it on the offensive end, but it\u2019s selling the kid short on defense. He\u2019s shown an impressive knack for the little things that have a big impact in rush defense, and while he doesn\u2019t show much bite in the defensive zone, he certainly has the size to move forwards off their spot. I\u2019m fascinated to see how well he can play when he\u2019s not on the ice for 30-plus minutes a game, too. He had to have been pacing himself in London. He\u2019s not perfect. He, at times, seemed flummoxed while starting a breakout with the Knights, but after his age-17 season, it\u2019s not as if you\u2019re drafting a finished product anyway. The Sharks now have, arguably of course, the best prospect talent pool in the NHL with the addition of Celebrini and Dickinson. That said, this is a team that is still in need of top-paring-possible right-handed defensemen. Maybe that\u2019s for the team\u2019s two first-round picks in 2025. As of Friday, though, the Sharks\u2019 top blue-line prospects \u2014 Shakir Mukhamadullin, Henry Thrun, and Luca Cagnoni \u2014 are all left-handed shots, as is Dickinson. If that\u2019s a problem, we\u2019ll find out soon enough. In the meantime, few players in the NHL can move like Dickinson, much less at the defenseman\u2019s size it will give him an advantage the second he steps on the ice as a professional. Is the rest of his game ready for the NHL? I can imagine a world where he goes back and dominates the OHL next season. I can also see him playing a lot of minutes for the San Jose Barracuda of the AHL this next season, with the Sharks using the same development model for Dickinson as they used on Mukhamadullin, who played 67 games for the \u2018Cuda the past two seasons. Either way, in the not-too-distant future, the Sharks will expect Dickinson to be a linchpin player for this franchise. And all in all, with Celebrini \u2014 a future superstar \u2014 and now Dickinson \u2014 who just has \u201cunderrated winner\u201d written all over him \u2014 it was a hell of a day for the Sharks in Las Vegas. Here\u2019s to a few more of those in the years to come.", "summary": "NHL Draft: The Sharks selected defenseman Sam Dickinson No. 11 overall Friday.", "url": "https://www.mercurynews.com/2024/06/28/kurtenbach-instant-reaction-to-the-sharks-no-11-pick-in-the-nhl-draft/", "image": "https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/BNG-L-SHARKS-0629_fd0317.jpg?w=1024", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 01:06:49", "author": "Dieter Kurtenbach", "authors": ["Dieter Kurtenbach"], "language": "en", "catgory": "sports", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.062}

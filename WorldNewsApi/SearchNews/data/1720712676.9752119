{"id": 232070684, "title": "Brazil 3-2 Mexico (Jun 8, 2024) Game Analysis - ESPN", "text": "A 96th-minute game-winner from 17-year-old soon-to-be Real Madrid forward Endrick earned Brazil a 3-2 friendly victory against Mexico on Saturday in a preparation match for the 2024 Copa America. It was Endrick's third goal for Brazil, having also scored in high-profile friendlies against England and Spain in March. He will join Real Madrid from Palmeiras this summer. Held at Kyle Field in College Station, Texas, Saturday's match immediately showcased early pressure from Brazil after Arsenal's Gabrriel Martinelli nearly connected with a cross in Mexico's 18-yard box during the first 30 seconds. The South Americans maintained their pressure and quickly made it 1-0 when Fulham's Andreas Pereira easily slalomed past Mexico's backline and found the back of the net in the fifth minute. Mexico fought back with more attacking momentum as the first half progressed and, in the 20th minute, fullback Gerardo Arteaga tested opposition goalkeeper and captain Alisson with a dangerous shot from distance. Manager Jaime \"Jimmy\" Lozano and his men did well to keep the ball in Brazil's half, but also struggled with creating enough danger and connecting with star striker Santiago Gim\u00e9nez. Brazil then silenced Mexico's growing confidence with a goal in the 54th minute. Thanks to a great run and assist from short-range from Yan Couto, Martinelli was able to capitalize on his chance in the 18-yard box and make it 2-0 for Brazil. The match was briefly paused in the 59th minute as the majority-Mexico crowd again marred the game with an anti-gay chant that has become a regular occurrence at Mexico matches. When play resumed, Mexico clawed their way back with a goal sparked by the impact of second half substitute Alexis Vega. Vega launched a powerful cross from the right flank and Colombian-born Mexico international Juli\u00e1n Qui\u00f1ones did well to connect with the ball and score El Tri's first of the game. Additional personnel changes in the second half altered the friendly in dramatic fashion and Mexico substitute Guillermo Mart\u00ednez made it 2-2 in the 92nd minute after a scramble from a corner. But Endrick grabbed the win for Brazil as he continued his impressive start to his international career with a header off a cross from his new Real Madrid teammate Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior. Brazil have one additional U.S.-based preparation match with a friendly scheduled against the United States on June 12 in Orlando. Mexico will head to San Diego, where they'll take part in a pre-tournament training camp. At the Copa America, Brazil are placed into Group D with Costa Rica, Paraguay and Colombia. In Group B, Mexico will face Ecuador, Venezuela and Jamaica", "summary": "A 96th-minute game-winner from 17-year-old soon-to-be Real Madrid forward Endrick earned Brazil a 3-2 friendly victory against Mexico on Saturday in a preparation match for the 2024 Copa America.", "url": "https://www.espn.com/soccer/report/_/gameId/692533", "image": "https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/espn/misc_logos/500/soccer.png", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 16:27:36", "author": "Cesar Hernandez", "authors": ["Cesar Hernandez"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.34}

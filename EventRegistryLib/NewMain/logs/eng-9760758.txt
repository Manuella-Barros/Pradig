There were significant losses in some areas, they said.\n\nForest firefighters and others without self-contained breathing apparatuses were told to evacuate to the nearby town of Hinton, with structural firefighters staying behind.\n\nParks Canada spokesperson James Eastham told reporters outside Jasper that the town is filled with smoke and there \"has been structural loss,\" adding that \"significant loss has occurred within the townsite.\"\n\n\"At this point I can't confirm how many, locations or specific structures. The fire continues to burn,\" he said.\n\nThe park said in a statement that Wednesday \"has been an exceptionally difficult day for Jasperites, incident personnel and everyone who loves Jasper.\"\n\nStructural firefighters continue to work to save as many structures as possible and to protect critical infrastructure. Many more structural firefighters are en route to provide assistance.\n\nAs the pictures and videos circulating online show, significant loss has occurred within the townsite.\n\nParks Canada said firefighters are working to save \"as many structures as possible and to protect critical infrastructure, including the wastewater treatment plant, communications facilities, the Trans Mountain Pipeline and others.\"\n\nA few hours earlier, many first responders were ordered out of Jasper National Park for their safety.\n\nJasper is being menaced by fires from the north and south, and the town's 5,000 residents -- along with 20,000 more park visitors -- fled on short notice late Monday night when the fires flared up.\n\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau said they are \"mobilizing every necessary resource available.\" Alberta Premier Danielle Smith said she was \"heartbroken.\"\n\nA record number of wildfires in 2023 forced more than 235,000 people across Canada to evacuate and sent thick smoke into parts of the U.S., leading to hazy skies and health advisories in multiple U.S. cities.\n\nThe northern fire was spotted about 3 miles from Jasper earlier in the day. The southern fire had been reported about 5 miles away from the town, but Katie Ellsworth of Parks Canada said strong wind gusts swooping in behind it sent it racing.\n\nEverything that could go wrong did go wrong as fire perimeters changed minute by minute.\n\nEllsworth said bucketing efforts by helicopter failed. Crews using heavy equipment to build fireguards couldn't complete the work before having to pull back for safety. Water bombers couldn't help due to dangerous flying conditions.\n\nA last-ditch effort to use controlled burns to reroute the fire to natural barriers like Highway 16 and the Athabasca River failed due to \"unfavorable conditions.\"\n\nThe hope was that rain forecast overnight would bring some relief.\n\nEllsworth said the decision to relocate all first responders to Hinton, just outside the eastern edge of the park, \"has not been made lightly.\"\n\nShe said, \"Given the intensity of fire behavior being observed, the decision has been made to limit the number of responders exposed to this risk.\"\n\nJasper National Park is considered a national treasure. The United Nations designated the parks that make up the Canadian Rockies, including Jasper, a World Heritage Site in 1984 for its striking mountain landscape.\n\nIn 1953, Hollywood star Marilyn Monroe visited to make the movie \"River of No Return.\" More recently, the TV show \"The Bachelorette\" was filmed there.\n\nPark rangers in helicopters scoured the park earlier Wednesday, looking for stragglers still there despite a mass evacuation aimed at moving visitors and residents away. Searchers looking through the backcountry trails of Jasper National Park already had picked up 245 people, and they continued the search Wednesday in two helicopters, Ellsworth said.\n\nResidents and visitors streamed out by the thousands late Monday and Tuesday, and officials said Wednesday the evacuation of the town of Jasper was complete.\n\nEllsworth said park officials expected the evacuation of the park's backcountry areas to be completed later Wednesday. Reservations are required for the park, so authorities have an idea of where people are, though Ellsworth said she wasn't immediately sure how many people were left.\n\nAlberta has been baking under scorching temperatures that have already forced another 7,500 people out of remote communities. About 177 wildfires were burning across the province.\n\nJasper resident Leanne Maeva Joyeuse was relieved but exhausted after reaching the Grand Prairie evacuation center following 20 hours on the road with her grandmother, parents and younger brother.\n\n\"We're just waiting to go back home and see how many days we're going to be stuck here,\" Joyeuse said.", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com",

It is roughly eight kilometres away from the Town of Jasper, according to Incident Commander Katie Ellsworth.\n\nThe north fire, which is about five kilometres away from town, is still about 270 hectares.\n\nRain is forecasted for this evening and into Thursday morning. Ellsworth says commanders anticipate a reduction in fire activity if Jasper does receive precipitation, but gusty conditions mean the fire will likely grow before then.\n\nEllsworth confirmed to media that the town has not been impacted by fire. She added that there is no timeline for re-entry, including for temporary visits to gather items that evacuees left behind.\n\n\"We understand that this is stressful. We do ask for your patience, and we will provide you with a timeline (once) you are able to return to retrieve the items that you may have left behind,\" Ellsworth said.\n\nIn a Facebook post this afternoon, the Municipality of Jasper encouraged evacuees to prepare to stay elsewhere. They advise evacuees to make arrangements with friends or family if possible, or go to reception centres in Edmonton, Calgary, or Grande Prairie. Additionally, free camping for evacuees is available at Buck Lake in the County of Wetaskiwin, and at the Dr. Duncan Murray Recreation Centre Field in the Town of Hinton.\n\nThe Municipality also advises residents and business owners to call their insurance provider as soon as possible, and apply for Employment Insurance using their temporary address.\n\nThe status of structures outside of town - such as the Palisades Centre, Caribou Recovery Centre, and the HI Athabasca Falls Wilderness Hostel - is unknown at this time. Heavy smoke and aggressive fire behavior have made it unsafe for responders to access these structures, according to Ellsworth.\n\n\"In terms of the Palisades Centre, we can confirm that it has been impacted. Because of the fire behavior yesterday, we don't know the extent of those impacts,\" Ellsworth said. \"We are hoping to be able to confirm those impacts as soon as we can, so that we can share that information both to the public and the business owners. But we do ask for your continued patience.\"\n\nFirefighters are taking steps to protect the town's infrastructure in case the southern fire continues to move northward. This includes the installation of high-volume sprinklers on the south side of the Parks Canada compound, and around the southwest perimeter of town from Patricia Place to the entrance of Stone Mountain Village. Sprinklers will also be installed around Pyramid Bench from west to east. Additionally, firefighters are removing combustible material and dry vegetation from town today, Ellsworth added.\n\nEllsworth asks that the public look to Parks Canada, the Municipality of Jasper, and Alberta Wildfire for accurate information on the fire, rather than using other resources like NASA's MODIS and FIRMS satellite imagery.\n\n\"At this time due to heavy, thick smoke conditions in Jasper, we cannot confirm the MODIS or FIRMS hits that you can see if you're looking at the satellite imagery,\" she said. \"These satellites do indicate heat registers, and it's not uncommon after a fairly aggressive burning day when things calm down for that heat to sink back down to the surface and be registered as a fire point.\"\n\nAlert hiccups\n\nJasper Mayor Richard Ireland, who also attended the press conference, thanked Jasper residents and visitors for their cooperation during the evacuation. However, he said he received reports this morning that the alert system used by the municipality did not work as intended.\n\n\"We gave out an emergency alert on our system - we use something called Voyent,\" he told journalists. \"It has come to my attention that some subscribers to that service did not receive the messages that we thought that they had received.\"\n\nIreland added that the Alberta Emergency Alerts system worked as expected.\n\nThe glitch that caused the error has been fixed since the municipality learned of it earlier this morning, according to Ireland.\n\n\"All of these incidents undergo an after-action debrief. The whole system will be reviewed and we will see whether any corrections have to be made to prevent this happening, either in our location or other locations with the same sorts of mass alert systems,\" he said.\n\nHighway 16 partially cleared\n\nAccording to Drive BC, about 350 kilometres of Highway 16 has been cleared between Victoria Street and the B.C.-Alberta border, as of 11:01 a.m. today. There is still limited visibility due to smoke from 16 kilometres east of Tete Jaune to the Alberta border.\n\nHighway 16 eastbound is closed from the Mount Robson Visitor Centre to the Alberta border. The westbound lane is open only for evacuation purposes. Drive BC anticipates an update to Highway 16 at 4:30 p.m. today.\n\nUPDATE 12:25 p.m.\n\nFuelled by whipping winds, fires in Jasper National Park are edging closer from two directions to the historic Rocky Mountain townsite of Jasper.\n\nParks Canada says a wildfire to the north is five kilometres away while another approaching from the south is eight kilometres distant.\n\nNo critical infrastructure in Jasper has been damaged, and crews are scrambling to protect the homes of almost 5,000 residents by bulldozing a fireguard on the southern edge, clearing flammables house-by-house, and installing massive sprinkler systems.\n\nParks Canada official Katie Ellsworth says windy conditions are making things worse, and says the southern blaze has doubled in size to more than 100 square kilometres.\n\nOfficials say they can't accurately update what's happening to infrastructure outside the townsite, such as picnic areas or power lines, because of smoky conditions.\n\nAbout 25,000 people, including residents and visitors, were forced to flee Jasper National Park earlier this week ahead of the fires.\n\nThe Canadian Press\n\nORIGINAL 5:45 a.m.\n\nSome wildfire evacuees who were trapped in traffic for hours while leaving Jasper National Park say they are feeling relieved to have found safety.\n\nAddison McNeill, who is 24, says she felt stressed when she got an alert on Monday night to evacuate Jasper about two hours after she moved to the alpine town from Edmonton.\n\nWhen she got on the road, she says she saw many of Jasper's 4,700 residents exiting the town calmly along with visitors despite being trapped in gridlock and hot, smoky air for hours.\n\nEvacuees were initially ordered to go to British Columbia but were directed on Tuesday to make a wide U-turn as that province was dealing with its own wildfires.\n\nSince then, reception centres have been set up north of Jasper in Grande Prairie as well as in Calgary and Edmonton, where evacuees are

There were significant losses in some areas, they said.\n\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau said Thursday his government has approved Alberta's request for federal assistance, saying it is deploying military resources and evacuation support, as well as coordinating firefighting and airlift assistance.\n\n\"Alberta, we're with you,\" Trudeau posted on the social media platform X.\n\nForest firefighters and others without self-contained breathing apparatus were told to evacuate to the nearby town of Hinton, with structural firefighters staying behind.\n\nParks Canada spokesperson James Eastham told reporters outside Jasper that the town is filled with smoke and there \"has been structural loss.\"\n\n\"At this point I can't confirm how many, locations or specific structures. The fire continues to burn,\" he said.\n\nParks Canada said firefighters are working to save \"as many structures as possible and to protect critical infrastructure, including the wastewater treatment plant, communications facilities, the Trans Mountain Pipeline and others.\"\n\nOn X, the account for the Fairmont Jasper Park Lodge says the flames have reached the hotel's grounds, but the extent of damage, if any, is not yet known.\n\nA few hours earlier, many first responders were ordered out of Jasper National Park for their safety.\n\nJasper is being menaced by fires from the north and south, and the town's 5,000 residents -- along with 20,000 more park visitors -- fled on short notice late Monday night when the fires flared up.\n\nAlberta Premier Danielle Smith said she was \"heartbroken.\"\n\nA record number of wildfires in 2023 forced more than 235,000 people across Canada to evacuate and sent thick smoke into parts of the U.S., leading to hazy skies and health advisories in multiple U.S. cities.\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\nThe northern fire was spotted 5 kilometers (about 3 miles) from Jasper earlier in the day. The southern fire had been reported 8 kilometers (about 5 miles) away from the town, but Katie Ellsworth of Parks Canada said strong wind gusts swooping in behind it sent it racing.\n\nEverything that could go wrong did go wrong as fire perimeters changed minute by minute.\n\nEllsworth said bucketing efforts by helicopter failed. Crews using heavy equipment to build fireguards couldn't complete the work before having to pull back for safety. Water bombers couldn't help due to dangerous flying conditions.\n\nA last-ditch effort to use controlled burns to reroute the fire to natural barriers like Highway 16 and the Athabasca River failed due to \"unfavorable conditions.\"\n\nThe hope was that rain forecast overnight would bring some relief.\n\nEllsworth said the decision to relocate all first responders to Hinton, just outside the eastern edge of the park, \"has not been made lightly.\"\n\nShe said, \"Given the intensity of fire behavior being observed the decision has been made to limit the number of responders exposed to this risk.\"\n\nJasper National Park is considered a national treasure. The United Nations designated the parks that make up the Canadian Rockies, including Jasper, a World Heritage Site in 1984 for its striking mountain landscape.\n\nIn 1953, Hollywood star Marilyn Monroe visited to make the movie \"River of No Return.\" More recently, the TV show \"The Bachelorette\" was filmed there.\n\nResidents and visitors streamed out by the thousands late Monday and Tuesday, and officials said Wednesday the evacuation of the town of Jasper was complete.\n\nAlberta has been baking under scorching temperatures that have already forced another 7,500 people out of remote communities. About 177 wildfires were burning across the province.\n\nJasper resident Leanne Maeva Joyeuse was relieved but exhausted after reaching the Grand Prairie evacuation center following 20 hours on the road with her grandmother, parents and younger brother.\n\n\"We're just waiting to go back home and see how many days we're going to be stuck here,\" Joyeuse said.", "source": {"uri": "gazette.com",

It is roughly eight kilometres away from the Town of Jasper, according to Incident Commander Katie Ellsworth.\n\nThe north fire, which is about five kilometres away from town, is still about 270 hectares.\n\nRain is forecasted for this evening and into Thursday morning. Ellsworth says commanders anticipate a reduction in fire activity if Jasper does receive precipitation, but gusty conditions mean the fire will likely grow before then.\n\nEllsworth confirmed to media that the town has not been impacted by fire. She added that there is no timeline for re-entry, including for temporary visits to gather items that evacuees left behind.\n\n\"We understand that this is stressful. We do ask for your patience, and we will provide you with a timeline (once) you are able to return to retrieve the items that you may have left behind,\" Ellsworth said.\n\nIn a Facebook post this afternoon, the Municipality of Jasper encouraged evacuees to prepare to stay elsewhere. They advise evacuees to make arrangements with friends or family if possible, or go to reception centres in Edmonton, Calgary, or Grande Prairie. Additionally, free camping for evacuees is available at Buck Lake in the County of Wetaskiwin, and at the Dr. Duncan Murray Recreation Centre Field in the Town of Hinton.\n\nThe Municipality also advises residents and business owners to call their insurance provider as soon as possible, and apply for Employment Insurance using their temporary address.\n\nThe status of structures outside of town - such as the Palisades Centre, Caribou Recovery Centre, and the HI Athabasca Falls Wilderness Hostel - is unknown at this time. Heavy smoke and aggressive fire behavior have made it unsafe for responders to access these structures, according to Ellsworth.\n\n\"In terms of the Palisades Centre, we can confirm that it has been impacted. Because of the fire behavior yesterday, we don't know the extent of those impacts,\" Ellsworth said. \"We are hoping to be able to confirm those impacts as soon as we can, so that we can share that information both to the public and the business owners. But we do ask for your continued patience.\"\n\nFirefighters are taking steps to protect the town's infrastructure in case the southern fire continues to move northward. This includes the installation of high-volume sprinklers on the south side of the Parks Canada compound, and around the southwest perimeter of town from Patricia Place to the entrance of Stone Mountain Village. Sprinklers will also be installed around Pyramid Bench from west to east. Additionally, firefighters are removing combustible material and dry vegetation from town today, Ellsworth added.\n\nEllsworth asks that the public look to Parks Canada, the Municipality of Jasper, and Alberta Wildfire for accurate information on the fire, rather than using other resources like NASA's MODIS and FIRMS satellite imagery.\n\n\"At this time due to heavy, thick smoke conditions in Jasper, we cannot confirm the MODIS or FIRMS hits that you can see if you're looking at the satellite imagery,\" she said. \"These satellites do indicate heat registers, and it's not uncommon after a fairly aggressive burning day when things calm down for that heat to sink back down to the surface and be registered as a fire point.\"\n\nAlert hiccups\n\nJasper Mayor Richard Ireland, who also attended the press conference, thanked Jasper residents and visitors for their cooperation during the evacuation. However, he said he received reports this morning that the alert system used by the municipality did not work as intended.\n\n\"We gave out an emergency alert on our system - we use something called Voyent,\" he told journalists. \"It has come to my attention that some subscribers to that service did not receive the messages that we thought that they had received.\"\n\nIreland added that the Alberta Emergency Alerts system worked as expected.\n\nThe glitch that caused the error has been fixed since the municipality learned of it earlier this morning, according to Ireland.\n\n\"All of these incidents undergo an after-action debrief. The whole system will be reviewed and we will see whether any corrections have to be made to prevent this happening, either in our location or other locations with the same sorts of mass alert systems,\" he said.\n\nHighway 16 partially cleared\n\nAccording to Drive BC, about 350 kilometres of Highway 16 has been cleared between Victoria Street and the B.C.-Alberta border, as of 11:01 a.m. today. There is still limited visibility due to smoke from 16 kilometres east of Tete Jaune to the Alberta border.\n\nHighway 16 eastbound is closed from the Mount Robson Visitor Centre to the Alberta border. The westbound lane is open only for evacuation purposes. Drive BC anticipates an update to Highway 16 at 4:30 p.m. today.\n\nUPDATE 12:25 p.m.\n\nFuelled by whipping winds, fires in Jasper National Park are edging closer from two directions to the historic Rocky Mountain townsite of Jasper.\n\nParks Canada says a wildfire to the north is five kilometres away while another approaching from the south is eight kilometres distant.\n\nNo critical infrastructure in Jasper has been damaged, and crews are scrambling to protect the homes of almost 5,000 residents by bulldozing a fireguard on the southern edge, clearing flammables house-by-house, and installing massive sprinkler systems.\n\nParks Canada official Katie Ellsworth says windy conditions are making things worse, and says the southern blaze has doubled in size to more than 100 square kilometres.\n\nOfficials say they can't accurately update what's happening to infrastructure outside the townsite, such as picnic areas or power lines, because of smoky conditions.\n\nAbout 25,000 people, including residents and visitors, were forced to flee Jasper National Park earlier this week ahead of the fires.\n\nThe Canadian Press\n\nORIGINAL 5:45 a.m.\n\nSome wildfire evacuees who were trapped in traffic for hours while leaving Jasper National Park say they are feeling relieved to have found safety.\n\nAddison McNeill, who is 24, says she felt stressed when she got an alert on Monday night to evacuate Jasper about two hours after she moved to the alpine town from Edmonton.\n\nWhen she got on the road, she says she saw many of Jasper's 4,700 residents exiting the town calmly along with visitors despite being trapped in gridlock and hot, smoky air for hours.\n\nEvacuees were initially ordered to go to British Columbia but were directed on Tuesday to make a wide U-turn as that province was dealing with its own wildfires.\n\nSince then, reception centres have been set up north of Jasper in Grande Prairie as well as in Calgary and Edmonton, where evacuees are being helped with accommodations.\n\nJasper resident Leanne Maeva Joyeuse says she feels relieved to have made it to Grande Prairie after having been on the road for nearly 20 hours but she is worried about how the wildfires will affect her town.\n\nThe Canadian Press", "source": {"uri": "castanet.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Castanet"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Two, burning to the north and south, are threatening the town of Jasper.\n\nFuelled by parched conditions, the fires have moved closer to the scenic community and the flames continue to expand their reach.\n\nAs of Wednesday morning, the fire burning north of Jasper had moved within five kilometres of the townsite and had scorched at least 270 hectares.\n\nThe fire burning south of town is now eight kilometres from Jasper and has burned an estimated 10,800 hectares of forest. Both fires are expected to grow on Wednesday and emergency officials warn that the fire perimeters are changing minute by minute.\n\nAt least 10,000 residents and 15,000 visitors were forced out of the national park Monday night under an evacuation order as the fires flared after days of scorching heat.\n\nIn a news conference Wednesday morning, Parks Canada incident commander Katie Ellsworth said crews are facing another challenging day attempting to keep the flames away from homes and businesses.\n\nShe said aggressive fire behaviour is expected to continue.\n\nIt is still a very dynamic situation, Ellsworth said. \"We expect today that we're going to have strong winds continuing and we expect that this will increase our fire behaviour and fire growth on both sides and on all flanks.\n\nWinds in Jasper have been consistently high and gusty for the last several weeks and this has not changed in the last few days, and there was significant fire behaviour and fire spread. We do anticipate that conditions are going to be similar again today.\n\nAs of Tuesday evening, the wildfire to the south of Jasper had burned at least 6,750 hectares and drawn within 12 kilometres of the townsite.\n\nThe southern fire stretches from the Kerkeslin campground and follows the Icefields Parkway to the north. It has burned areas near Horseshoe Lake and Wabasso Lake.\n\nThe north wildfire, between the Jasper transfer station and the Jasper airstrip on both sides of Highway 16, had burned at least 270 hectares.\n\nCrews have been tracking the flames from the sky, but accurately mapping their spread has been stymied by thick columns of smoke filling the sky.\n\nThere is little relief in the forecast until Thursday evening when rain is expected in the area, Ellsworth said\n\nHowever, the rain doesn't count until it's on the ground and there isn't enough rain in this forecast to control the wildfire, she said. It is still burning out of control and very aggressively.\n\nShe said emergency officials believe some infrastructure along the Icefields Parkway has been damaged but conditions were too risky for crews to fully assess the losses.\n\nNo damage has been reported within the townsite, she said.\n\nEmergency officials, however, are preparing for the possibility that the flames could cross into the townsite. She said crews are patrolling neighbourhoods and safeguarding homes by installing sprinklers and removing flammable materials from properties.\n\nThe town has emptied out but in the backcountry, the evacuation is ongoing. Emergency officials remain concerned about hikers who may still be unaccounted for.\n\nJasper is the largest national park in the Canadian Rockies -- covering 11,228 square kilometres of extensive trails and mountain terrain -- and getting the message out to everyone on the trail has proven difficult.\n\nDuring Wednesday's news conference, Ellsworth said 245 hikers have either been picked up or helped to leave the park since the evacuation began.\n\nShe said helicopter crews are flying low along the trails, working to airlift stranded hikers out or direct them toward a safe trailhead, when possible.\n\nShe said the most dangerous backcountry areas have been cleared but the sweeps will continue Wednesday in lower-risk areas.\n\nAll hikers reported missing or in distress have been accounted for, but Albertans are encouraged to contact people who may be in the mountains and unaware of the fire danger.\n\nEllsworth said Tuesday she called for the evacuation orders to be issued as the fires flared dangerously Monday evening. Volatile conditions were driven weeks of relentless heat and strong gusting winds, she said.\n\nThese fires were exhibiting aggressive, aggressive fire behaviour, she said.\n\nUnfortunately due to the weather conditions at the time, and the gusting strong winds, it was really quickly very apparent that life safety needed to come first and we needed to evacuate immediately.\n\nAfter the order to leave, thousands of vehicles gridlocked roads leading to safety.\n\nWith wildfires cutting off highway access east to Edmonton and south along the Icefields Parkway, many were forced west into British Columbia. Evacuees were initially ordered west but were later redirected to Alberta.\n\nReception centres have since been set up in Grande Prairie, Calgary and Edmonton, where evacuees are being helped with accommodations.\n\nParks Canada is managing the firefighting efforts from a unified command centre but local, provincial and federal agencies are assisting in the response.\n\nCrews are dousing the flames from the sky and establishing fire guards around the community while sprinkler systems are being installed to protect critical infrastructure.\n\nThe degree of collaboration and co-operation is extremely high, Jasper Mayor Richard Ireland said in an interview Wednesday. Those jurisdictional boundaries are just forgotten. People are working as a team.\n\nThe town is now focused on providing critical services to first responders who have descended on the area, Ireland said.", "source": {"uri": "ici.radio-canada.ca",

They asked for patience, and said that the fire remains out of control despite a small amount of rain that fell overnight.\n\nOne of the fires had entered the southern edge of the community Wednesday evening and crews were battling structure fires and working to protect key infrastructure, park officials said.

and hot, smoky air for hours.\n\nEvacuees were initially ordered to go to British Columbia but were directed on Tuesday to make a wide U-turn as that province was dealing with its own wildfires.\n\nSince then, reception centres have been set up north of Jasper in Grande Prairie as well as in Calgary and Edmonton, where evacuees are being helped with accommodations.\n\nJasper resident Leanne Maeva Joyeuse says she feels relieved to have made it to Grande Prairie after having been on the road for nearly 20 hours but she is worried about how the wildfires will affect her

Five officials in bright neon yellow vests directed traffic. The only vehicle that was seen going through was a fire truck.\n\nJasper Mayor Richard Ireland, in an open letter to residents, urged them to stay strong.\n\n\"I write to you today with profound sorrow as we begin to come to terms with the devastating impact of last night's wildfire that has ravaged our beloved community,\" Ireland wrote.\n\n\"The destruction and loss that many of you are facing and feeling is beyond description and comprehension.\n\n\"Your resilience and strength have always been the backbone of our community. In the coming days and weeks, we will rally together, support one another, and begin the daunting process of recovery.\"\n\nPhoto: Woodlands County\n\nUPDATE 10:20 a.m.\n\nIn an update Thursday morning, Jasper National Park says there have been no reported injuries due to the wildfire that swept through Jasper fire overnight, and about 25,000 people were safely evacuated from the town and national park.\n\n\"All residents, visitors and responders are safe,\" the park posted to social media.\n\nAdditionally, the region received a \"small amount of rain\" overnight, which has \"helped reduce fire activity slightly.\" But park officials say it hasn't made meaningful impact on the overall fire situation.\n\n\"Significant structural firefighting reinforcements arrived throughout the night and have continued to assist with firefighting efforts in the community overnight and this morning,\" the update reads.\n\n\"We are thankful to all of our partners and municipal fire agencies who have sent resources to help protect our community and national park. We also wish to acknowledge and thank all the communities who have received everyone who has been displaced by this fire.\"\n\nNo information has been released about the extent of the damage or specific locations in the town that have been hit by the fire.\n\n\"While we understand people are desperate to know about the status of our community, homes, work places, businesses, and cherished places we will need some time to stabilize this incident as we access and assess structures. We appreciate your patience and the community of people who have come together to support the people of Jasper and Parks Canada family.\"\n\nAlberta Premier Danielle Smith is speaking Thursday morning about the situation in Jasper. She'll be joined by officials from Alberta Wildfire.\n\nUPDATE 9:05 a.m.\n\nAlberta's Jasper National Park and its townsite are under siege from two wind-whipped wildfires, one of which raced into the picturesque community on Wednesday night, causing extensive damage.\n\nParks Canada says the fire has caused significant losses within the town, and the social media account for Fairmont's famous Jasper Park Lodge says the flames had reached the hotel's grounds.\n\nAs the fire consumed more fuel, officials said the air quality dropped to dangerous levels, prompting fire crews without breathing apparatus to flee to the nearby community of Hinton.\n\nJasper, a postcard-perfect mountain town, is famous for hiking, skiing, kayaking and biking. It is also home to dozens of species such as elk, mountain goats, cougars, lynx, black bears and grizzly bears. The United Nations designated the parks that make up the Canadian Rockies, including Jasper, a World Heritage Site in 1984.\n\nPhotos on social media show lodges and other buildings wrapped in sheets of orange flame and devastation the following day.\n\n\"Structural firefighters remain in town and are working to save as many structures as possible,\" Parks Canada said in a statement.\n\nMeanwhile, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced on social media that Ottawa has approved Alberta's request for federal assistance. Alberta Forestry Minister Todd Loewen has asked for help from the Canadian military.\n\n\"We are requesting firefighting resources, aerial support to move wildfire crews and equipment and more,\" Loewen wrote on the social media platform X.\n\nEarlier in the day, all first responders were ordered out of Jasper National Park for their safety and to give fire crews more room to operate.\n\nThe fires are burning on the north and south sides of the town, which is home to 5,000 people. The residents have left, along with 20,000 park visitors.\n\nThe order to leave was issued around 10 p.m. Monday as fires cut off road access to Jasper. Residents and visitors fled west into British Columbia in a long, slow midnight procession through swirling smoke and ash.\n\nThe following day, evacuees in B.C. who didn't have a place to stay were directed to make the long drive around the fires back to Alberta to evacuation centres in Grande Prairie and Calgary.\n\nThe northern fire was spotted five kilometres from Jasper earlier Wednesday. The southern fire was farther away, but Parks Canada says strong winds sent it racing toward the town.\n\nThat forced crews using heavy equipment to pull back for safety. Water bombers were grounded due to dangerous flying conditions.\n\nAt the Grande Prairie evacuation centre, Addison McNeill recalled arriving in Jasper from Edmonton only to be told to get out.\n\n\"I moved there two hours before the evacuation notice,\" the 24-year-old said in an interview.\n\nMcNeill said she went to a nearby hotel, one of two meet-up points for those without transportation. She hopped in a recreational vehicle with others and headed out -- at a snail's pace.\n\n\"Every single person in town was beelining to one exit from about six different routes and so you get bottleneck, backups and congestion,\" she said.\n\nMcNeill said as she sat inside the vehicle, she felt so close to the wildfires that the windows seemed like they were going to shatter from the pressure of the hot, smoky air.\n\nShe saw acts of kindness amid the swirling ash: neighbours loaning their cars to those without; people knocking on doors to see if everyone inside was OK.\n\n\"It was far from a panic,\" she said.\n\nPhoto: Contributed Jasper's Maligne Lodge on fire\n\nORIGINAL 5:35 a.m.\n\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau announced on social media that Ottawa has approved Alberta's request for federal assistance after a fast-moving wildfire hit Jasper National Park and its townsite late Wednesday.\n\nThe park's social media account says the fire has caused significant loss within the townsite, but the specific locations or neighbourhoods affected are not being reported.\n\nOn the social media platform X, the account for Fairmont's Jasper Park Lodge says the flames have reached the hotel's grounds, but the extent of damage, if any, is not yet known.\n\nAs the flames consumed more fuel, officials say the air quality dropped to dangerous levels, prompting fire crews without breathing apparatus to evacuate to the nearby community of Hinton.\n\nStructural firefighters stayed behind in the Alberta mountain town in an effort to protect key infrastructure.\n\nPhoto: Kenneth Smith/Banff-Canmore Visitors\n\nEarlier, Alberta Premier Danielle Smith issued a statement on Facebook, saying her thoughts are with the evacuees and those still

Some residents of Jasper National Park who were trapped in traffic for hours while evacuating due to wildfires say they are feeling relieved they've found safety. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Jeff McIntosh\n\nUPDATE 4:15 p.m.\n\nThe south fire in Jasper National Park has grown over 4,000 hectares since yesterday evening, now totalling at least 10,800 hectares. It is roughly eight kilometres away from the Town of Jasper, according to Incident Commander Katie Ellsworth.\n\nThe north fire, which is about five kilometres away from town, is still about 270 hectares.\n\nRain is forecasted for this evening and into Thursday morning. Ellsworth says commanders anticipate a reduction in fire activity if Jasper does receive precipitation, but gusty conditions mean the fire will likely grow before then.\n\nEllsworth confirmed to media that the town has not been impacted by fire. She added that there is no timeline for re-entry, including for temporary visits to gather items that evacuees left behind.\n\n\"We understand that this is stressful. We do ask for your patience, and we will provide you with a timeline (once) you are able to return to retrieve the items that you may have left behind,\" Ellsworth said.\n\nIn a Facebook post this afternoon, the Municipality of Jasper encouraged evacuees to prepare to stay elsewhere. They advise evacuees to make arrangements with friends or family if possible, or go to reception centres in Edmonton, Calgary, or Grande Prairie. Additionally, free camping for evacuees is available at Buck Lake in the County of Wetaskiwin, and at the Dr. Duncan Murray Recreation Centre Field in the Town of Hinton.\n\nThe Municipality also advises residents and business owners to call their insurance provider as soon as possible, and apply for Employment Insurance using their temporary address.\n\nThe status of structures outside of town - such as the Palisades Centre, Caribou Recovery Centre, and the HI Athabasca Falls Wilderness Hostel - is unknown at this time. Heavy smoke and aggressive fire behavior have made it unsafe for responders to access these structures, according to Ellsworth.\n\n\"In terms of the Palisades Centre, we can confirm that it has been impacted. Because of the fire behavior yesterday, we don't know the extent of those impacts,\" Ellsworth said. \"We are hoping to be able to confirm those impacts as soon as we can, so that we can share that information both to the public and the business owners. But we do ask for your continued patience.\"\n\nFirefighters are taking steps to protect the town's infrastructure in case the southern fire continues to move northward. This includes the installation of high-volume sprinklers on the south side of the Parks Canada compound, and around the southwest perimeter of town from Patricia Place to the entrance of Stone Mountain Village. Sprinklers will also be installed around Pyramid Bench from west to east. Additionally, firefighters are removing combustible material and dry vegetation from town today, Ellsworth added.\n\nEllsworth asks that the public look to Parks Canada, the Municipality of Jasper, and Alberta Wildfire for accurate information on the fire, rather than using other resources like NASA's MODIS and FIRMS satellite imagery.\n\n\"At this time due to heavy, thick smoke conditions in Jasper, we cannot confirm the MODIS or FIRMS hits that you can see if you're looking at the satellite imagery,\" she said. \"These satellites do indicate heat registers, and it's not uncommon after a fairly aggressive burning day when things calm down for that heat to sink back down to the surface and be registered as a fire point.\"\n\nAlert hiccups\n\nJasper Mayor Richard Ireland, who also attended the press conference, thanked Jasper residents and visitors for their cooperation during the evacuation. However, he said he received reports this morning that the alert system used by the municipality did not work as intended.\n\n\"We gave out an emergency alert on our system - we use something called Voyent,\" he told journalists. \"It has come to my attention that some subscribers to that service did not receive the messages that we thought that they had received.\"\n\nIreland added that the Alberta Emergency Alerts system worked as expected.\n\nThe glitch that caused the error has been fixed since the municipality learned of it earlier this morning, according to Ireland.\n\n\"All of these incidents undergo an after-action debrief. The whole system will be reviewed and we will see whether any corrections have to be made to prevent this happening, either in our location or other locations with the same sorts of mass alert systems,\" he said.\n\nHighway 16 partially cleared\n\nAccording to Drive BC, about 350 kilometres of Highway 16 has been cleared between Victoria Street and the B.C.-Alberta border, as of 11:01 a.m. today. There is still limited visibility due to smoke from 16 kilometres east of Tete Jaune to the Alberta border.\n\nHighway 16 eastbound is closed from the Mount Robson Visitor Centre to the Alberta border. The westbound lane is open only for evacuation purposes. Drive BC anticipates an update to Highway 16 at 4:30 p.m. today.\n\nUPDATE 12:25 p.m.\n\nFuelled by whipping winds, fires in Jasper National Park are edging closer from two directions to the historic Rocky Mountain townsite of Jasper.\n\nParks Canada says a wildfire to the north is five kilometres away while another approaching from the south is eight kilometres distant.\n\nNo critical infrastructure in Jasper has been damaged, and crews are scrambling to protect the homes of almost 5,000 residents by bulldozing a fireguard on the southern edge, clearing flammables house-by-house, and installing massive sprinkler systems.\n\nParks Canada official Katie Ellsworth says windy conditions are making things worse, and says the southern blaze has doubled in size to more than 100 square kilometres.\n\nOfficials say they can't accurately update what's happening to infrastructure outside the townsite, such as picnic areas or power lines, because of smoky conditions.\n\nAbout 25,000 people, including residents and visitors, were forced to flee Jasper National Park earlier this week ahead of the fires.\n\nThe Canadian Press\n\nORIGINAL 5:45 a.m.\n\nSome wildfire evacuees who were trapped in traffic for hours while leaving Jasper National Park say they are feeling relieved to have found safety.\n\nAddison McNeill, who is 24, says she felt stressed when she got an alert on Monday night to evacuate Jasper about two hours after she moved to the alpine town from Edmonton.\n\nWhen she got on the road, she says she saw many of Jasper's 4,700 residents exiting the town calmly along with visitors despite being trapped in gridlock and hot, smoky air for hours.\n\nEvacuees were initially ordered to go to British Columbia but were directed on Tuesday to make a wide U-turn as that province was dealing with its own wildfires.\n\nSince then, reception centres have been set up north of Jasper in Grande Prairie as well as in Calgary and Edmonton, where evacuees are being helped with accommodations.\n\nJasper resident Leanne Maeva Joyeuse says she feels relieved to have made it to Grande Prairie after having been on the road for nearly 20 hours but she is worried about how the wildfires will affect her town.\n\nThe Canadian Press", "source": {"uri": "castanet.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Castanet"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The southern fire had been reported five miles away from the town, but Katie Ellsworth of Parks Canada said strong wind gusts sent it racing.\n\nShe said bucketing efforts by helicopter failed, crews using heavy equipment to build fireguards could not complete the work before having to pull out, and water bombers could not help due to dangerous flying conditions.\n\nA last-ditch effort to use controlled burns to reroute the fire to natural barriers like Highway 16 and the Athabasca River failed due to \"unfavourable conditions\".\n\nThe hope was that rain forecast overnight would bring some relief.\n\nMs Ellsworth said the decision to relocate all first responders to Hinton, just outside the eastern edge of the park, \"has not been made lightly\".\n\nShe said: \"Given the intensity of fire behaviour being observed the decision has been made to limit the number of responders exposed to this risk.\"Jasper National Park is considered a national treasure. The United Nations designated the parks that make up the Canadian Rockies a World Heritage Site in 1984 for the striking mountain landscape.\n\nIn 1953, Hollywood star Marilyn Monroe visited to make the movie River Of No Return. More recently, TV show The Bachelorette was filmed there.\n\nPark rangers in helicopters scoured the park earlier on Wednesday looking for stragglers still there despite a mass evacuation aimed at moving visitors and residents away.\n\nSearchers looking through the remote trails of Jasper National Park had already picked up 245 people, and they continued the search on Wednesday in two helicopters, Ms Ellsworth said.\n\nResidents and visitors streamed out by the thousands late on Monday and Tuesday, and officials said on Wednesday that the evacuation of the town of Jasper was complete.\n\nMs Ellsworth said park officials expected the evacuation of the park's backcountry areas to be completed later on Wednesday. Reservations are required for the park, so authorities have an idea where people are, but Ms Ellsworth said she was not sure how many people were left.\n\nAlberta has been baking in scorching temperatures that have already forced another 7,500 people out of remote communities.

The southern fire had been reported five miles away from the town, but Katie Ellsworth of Parks Canada said strong wind gusts sent it racing.\n\nShe said bucketing efforts by helicopter failed, crews using heavy equipment to build fireguards could not complete the work before having to pull out, and water bombers could not help due to dangerous flying conditions.\n\nA last-ditch effort to use controlled burns to reroute the fire to natural barriers like Highway 16 and the Athabasca River failed due to \"unfavourable conditions\".\n\nThe hope was that rain forecast overnight would bring some relief.\n\nMs Ellsworth said the decision to relocate all first responders to Hinton, just outside the eastern edge of the park, \"has not been made lightly\".\n\nShe said: \"Given the intensity of fire behaviour being observed the decision has been made to limit the number of responders exposed to this risk.\"Jasper National Park is considered a national treasure.

Five officials in bright neon yellow vests directed traffic. The only vehicle that was seen going through was a fire truck.\n\nJasper Mayor Richard Ireland, in an open letter to residents, urged them to stay strong.\n\n\"I write to you today with profound sorrow as we begin to come to terms with the devastating impact of last night's wildfire that has ravaged our beloved community,\" Ireland wrote.\n\n\"The destruction and loss that many of you are facing and feeling is beyond description and comprehension.\n\n\"Your resilience and strength have always been the backbone of our community.

We also wish to acknowledge and thank all the communities who have received everyone who has been displaced by this fire.\"\n\nNo information has been released about the extent of the damage or specific locations in the town that have been hit by the fire.\n\n\"While we understand people are desperate to know about the status of our community, homes, work places, businesses, and cherished places we will need some time to stabilize this incident as we access and assess structures. We appreciate your patience and the community of people who have come together to support the people of Jasper and Parks Canada family.\"\n\nAlberta Premier Danielle Smith is speaking Thursday morning about the situation in Jasper. She'll be joined by officials from Alberta Wildfire.\n\nUPDATE 9:05 a.m.\n\nAlberta's Jasper National Park and its townsite are under siege from two wind-whipped wildfires, one of which raced into the picturesque community on Wednesday night, causing extensive damage.\n\nParks Canada says the fire has caused significant losses within the town, and the social media account for Fairmont's famous Jasper Park Lodge says the flames had reached the hotel's grounds.\n\nAs the fire consumed more fuel, officials said the air quality dropped to dangerous levels, prompting fire crews without breathing apparatus to flee to the nearby community of Hinton.\n\nJasper, a postcard-perfect mountain town, is famous for hiking, skiing, kayaking and biking. It is also home to dozens of species such as elk, mountain goats, cougars, lynx, black bears and grizzly bears. The United Nations designated the parks that make up the Canadian Rockies, including Jasper, a World Heritage Site in 1984.\n\nPhotos on social media show lodges and other buildings wrapped in sheets of orange flame and devastation the following day.\n\n\"Structural firefighters remain in town and are working to save as many structures as possible,\" Parks Canada said in a statement.\n\nMeanwhile, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced on social media that Ottawa has approved Alberta's request for federal assistance. Alberta Forestry Minister Todd Loewen has asked for help from the Canadian military.\n\n\"We are requesting firefighting resources, aerial support to move wildfire crews and equipment and more,\" Loewen wrote on the social media platform X.\n\nEarlier in the day, all first responders were ordered out of Jasper National Park for their safety and to give fire crews more room to operate.\n\nThe fires are burning on the north and south sides of the town, which is home to 5,000 people. The residents have left, along with 20,000 park visitors.\n\nThe order to leave was issued around 10 p.m. Monday as fires cut off road access to Jasper. Residents and visitors fled west into British Columbia in a long, slow midnight procession through swirling smoke and ash.\n\nThe following day, evacuees in B.C. who didn't have a place to stay were directed to make the long drive around the fires back to Alberta to evacuation centres in Grande Prairie and Calgary.\n\nThe northern fire was spotted five kilometres from Jasper earlier Wednesday. The southern fire was farther away, but Parks Canada says strong winds sent it racing toward the town.\n\nThat forced crews using heavy equipment to pull back for safety. Water bombers were grounded due to dangerous flying conditions.\n\nAt the Grande Prairie evacuation centre, Addison McNeill recalled arriving in Jasper from Edmonton only to be told to get out.\n\n\"I moved there two hours before the evacuation notice,\" the 24-year-old said in an interview.\n\nMcNeill said she went to a nearby hotel, one of two meet-up points for those without transportation. She hopped in a recreational vehicle with others and headed out -- at a snail's pace.\n\n\"Every single person in town was beelining to one exit from about six different routes and so you get bottleneck, backups and congestion,\" she said.\n\nMcNeill said as she sat inside the vehicle, she felt so close to the wildfires that the windows seemed like they were going to shatter from the pressure of the hot, smoky air.\n\nShe saw acts of kindness amid the swirling ash: neighbours loaning their cars to those without; people knocking on doors to see if everyone inside was OK.\n\n\"It was far from a panic,\" she said.\n\nPhoto: Contributed Jasper's Maligne Lodge on fire\n\nORIGINAL 5:35 a.m.\n\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau announced on social media that Ottawa has approved Alberta's request for federal assistance after a fast-moving wildfire hit Jasper National Park and its townsite late Wednesday.\n\nThe park's social media account says the fire has caused significant loss within the townsite, but the specific locations or neighbourhoods affected are not being reported.\n\nOn the social media platform X, the account for Fairmont's Jasper Park Lodge says the flames have reached the hotel's grounds, but the extent of damage, if any, is not yet known.\n\nAs the flames consumed more fuel, officials say the air quality dropped to dangerous levels, prompting fire crews without breathing apparatus to evacuate to the nearby community of Hinton.\n\nStructural firefighters stayed behind in the Alberta mountain town in an effort to protect key infrastructure.\n\nPhoto: Kenneth Smith/Banff-Canmore Visitors\n\nEarlier, Alberta Premier Danielle Smith issued a statement on Facebook, saying her thoughts are with the evacuees and those still fighting the fire.", "source": {"uri": "castanet.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Castanet"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jasper_National_Park", "type":

We also wish to acknowledge and thank all the communities who have received everyone who has been displaced by this fire.\"\n\nNo information has been released about the extent of the damage or specific locations in the town that have been hit by the fire.\n\n\"While we understand people are desperate to know about the status of our community, homes, work places, businesses, and cherished places we will need some time to stabilize this incident as we access and assess structures. We appreciate your patience and the community of people who have come together to support the people of Jasper and Parks Canada family.\"\n\nAlberta Premier Danielle Smith is speaking Thursday morning about the situation in Jasper. She'll be joined by officials from Alberta Wildfire.\n\nUPDATE 9:05 a.m.\n\nAlberta's Jasper National Park and its townsite are under siege from two wind-whipped wildfires, one of which raced into the picturesque community on Wednesday night, causing extensive damage.\n\nParks Canada says the fire has caused significant losses within the town, and the social media account for Fairmont's famous Jasper Park Lodge says the flames had reached the hotel's grounds.\n\nAs the fire consumed more fuel, officials said the air quality dropped to dangerous levels, prompting fire crews without breathing apparatus to flee to the nearby community of Hinton.\n\nJasper, a postcard-perfect mountain town, is famous for hiking, skiing, kayaking and biking. It is also home to dozens of species such as elk, mountain goats, cougars, lynx, black bears and grizzly bears. The United Nations designated the parks that make up the Canadian Rockies, including Jasper, a World Heritage Site in 1984.\n\nPhotos on social media show lodges and other buildings wrapped in sheets of orange flame and devastation the following day.\n\n\"Structural firefighters remain in town and are working to save as many structures as possible,\" Parks Canada said in a statement.\n\nMeanwhile, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced on social media that Ottawa has approved Alberta's request for federal assistance. Alberta Forestry Minister Todd Loewen has asked for help from the Canadian military.\n\n\"We are requesting firefighting resources, aerial support to move wildfire crews and equipment and more,\" Loewen wrote on the social media platform X.\n\nEarlier in the day, all first responders were ordered out of Jasper National Park for their safety and to give fire crews more room to operate.\n\nThe fires are burning on the north and south sides of the town, which is home to 5,000 people. The residents have left, along with 20,000 park visitors.\n\nThe order to leave was issued around 10 p.m. Monday as fires cut off road access to Jasper. Residents and visitors fled west into British Columbia in a long, slow midnight procession through swirling smoke and ash.\n\nThe following day, evacuees in B.C. who didn't have a place to stay were directed to make the long drive around the fires back to Alberta to evacuation centres in Grande Prairie and Calgary.\n\nThe northern fire was spotted five kilometres from Jasper earlier Wednesday. The southern fire was farther away, but Parks Canada says strong winds sent it racing toward the town.\n\nThat forced crews using heavy equipment to pull back for safety. Water bombers were grounded due to dangerous flying conditions.\n\nAt the Grande Prairie evacuation centre, Addison McNeill recalled arriving in Jasper from Edmonton only to be told to get out.\n\n\"I moved there two hours before the evacuation notice,\" the 24-year-old said in an interview.\n\nMcNeill said she went to a nearby hotel, one of two meet-up points for those without transportation. She hopped in a recreational vehicle with others and headed out -- at a snail's pace.\n\n\"Every single person in town was beelining to one exit from about six different routes and so you get bottleneck, backups and congestion,\" she said.\n\nMcNeill said as she sat inside the vehicle, she felt so close to the wildfires that the windows seemed like they were going to shatter from the pressure of the hot, smoky air.\n\nShe saw acts of kindness amid the swirling ash: neighbours loaning their cars to those without; people knocking on doors to see if everyone inside was OK.\n\n\"It was far from a panic,\" she said.\n\nPhoto: Contributed Jasper's Maligne Lodge on fire\n\nORIGINAL 5:35 a.m.\n\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau announced on social media that Ottawa has approved Alberta's request for federal assistance after a fast-moving wildfire hit Jasper National Park and its townsite late Wednesday.\n\nThe park's social media account says the fire has caused significant loss within the townsite, but the specific locations or neighbourhoods affected are not being reported.\n\nOn the social media platform X, the account for Fairmont's Jasper Park Lodge says the flames have reached the hotel's grounds, but the extent of damage, if any, is not yet known.\n\nAs the flames consumed more fuel, officials say the air quality dropped to dangerous levels, prompting fire crews without breathing apparatus to evacuate to the nearby community of Hinton.\n\nStructural firefighters stayed behind in the Alberta mountain town in an effort to protect key infrastructure.\n\nPhoto: Kenneth Smith/Banff-Canmore Visitors\n\nEarlier, Alberta Premier Danielle Smith issued a statement on Facebook, saying her thoughts are with the evacuees and those still fighting the fire.", "source": {"uri": "castanet.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Castanet"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jasper_National_Park", "type":

Crews using heavy equipment to build fireguards couldn't complete their work in time and controlled burns failed.\n\nOne of two raging wildfires menacing the town of Jasper in the Canadian Rockies' largest national park roared into town Wednesday and began burning buildings.\n\nJasper National Park officials said the fire entered the southern edge of the community Wednesday evening and crews were battling multiple structural fires and working to protect key infrastructure. There were significant losses in some areas, they said.\n\nForest firefighters and others without self-contained breathing apparatuses were told to evacuate to the nearby town of Hinton, with structural firefighters staying behind.\n\nFBI OFFERING $10,000 REWARD FOR INFO LEADING TO ARREST OF SUSPECTS IN DEADLY NEW MEXICO WILDFIRES\n\nParks Canada spokesperson James Eastham told reporters outside Jasper that the town is filled with smoke and there \"has been structural loss.\"\n\n\"At this point I can't confirm how many, locations or specific structures. The fire continues to burn,\" he said.\n\nParks Canada said firefighters are working to save \"as many structures as possible and to protect critical infrastructure, including the wastewater treatment plant, communications facilities, the Trans Mountain Pipeline and others.\"\n\nA few hours earlier, many first responders were ordered out of Jasper National Park for their safety.\n\nJasper is being menaced by fires from the north and south, and the town's 5,000 residents -- along with 20,000 more park visitors -- fled on short notice late Monday night when the fires flared up.\n\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau said they are \"mobilizing every necessary resource available.\" Alberta Premier Danielle Smith said she was \"heartbroken.\"\n\nA record number of wildfires in 2023 forced more than 235,000 people across Canada to evacuate and sent thick smoke into parts of the U.S., leading to hazy skies and health advisories in multiple U.S. cities.\n\nThe northern fire was spotted about 3 miles from Jasper earlier in the day. The southern fire had been reported about 5 miles away from the town, but Katie Ellsworth of Parks Canada said strong wind gusts swooping in behind it sent it racing.\n\nEverything that could go wrong did go wrong as fire perimeters changed minute by minute.\n\nEllsworth said bucketing efforts by helicopter failed. Crews using heavy equipment to build fireguards couldn't complete the work before having to pull back for safety. Water bombers couldn't help due to dangerous flying conditions.\n\nA last-ditch effort to use controlled burns to reroute the fire to natural barriers like Highway 16 and the Athabasca River failed due to \"unfavorable conditions.\"\n\nThe hope was that rain forecast overnight would bring some relief.\n\nEllsworth said the decision to relocate all first responders to Hinton, just outside the eastern edge of the park, \"has not been made lightly.\"\n\nShe said, \"Given the intensity of fire behavior being observed the decision has been made to limit the number of responders exposed to this risk.\"\n\nJasper National Park is considered a national treasure. The United Nations designated the parks that make up the Canadian Rockies, including Jasper, a World Heritage Site in 1984 for its striking mountain landscape.\n\nIn 1953, Hollywood star Marilyn Monroe visited to make the movie \"River of No Return.\" More recently, the TV show \"The Bachelorette\" was filmed there.\n\nPark rangers in helicopters scoured the park earlier Wednesday, looking for stragglers still there despite a mass evacuation aimed at moving visitors and residents away. Searchers looking through the backcountry trails of Jasper National Park already had picked up 245 people, and they continued the search Wednesday in two helicopters, Ellsworth said.\n\nResidents and visitors streamed out by the thousands late Monday and Tuesday, and officials said Wednesday the evacuation of the town of Jasper was complete.\n\nEllsworth said park officials expected the evacuation of the park's backcountry areas to be completed later Wednesday. Reservations are required for the park, so authorities have an idea of where people are, though Ellsworth said she wasn't immediately sure how many people were left.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAlberta has been baking under scorching temperatures that have already forced another 7,500 people out of remote communities. About 177 wildfires were burning across the province.\n\nJasper resident Leanne Maeva Joyeuse was relieved but exhausted after reaching the Grand Prairie evacuation center following 20 hours on the road with her grandmother, parents and younger brother.\n\n\"We're just waiting to go back home and see how many days we're going to be stuck here,\" Joyeuse said.", "source": {"uri": "wfin.com",

He said he was writing with \"profound sorrow as we being to come to terms with the devastating impact.\"\n\nDanielle Smith, the premier of Alberta province, said from 30% to 50% of the town's structures are potentially damaged. \"We don't know which structures have been damaged and which ones are destroyed, but that's going to be a significant rebuild and significant displacement,\" Smith said.\n\nSmith teared up talking about the beauty of Jasper, noting that many families from the province regularly visit.\n\nA postcard-perfect mountain town, Jasper is famous for hiking, skiing, kayaking and biking. It is also home to dozens of species such as elk, mountain goats, cougars, lynx, black bears and grizzly bears.\n\n\"We share the sense of loss with all who live in town,\" Smith said at a news conference in Edmonton, Alberta. \"Alberta's government will provide the support needed to families and communities to recover and rebuild.\"\n\nJasper and the neighboring Jasper National Park had been menaced by fires from both the north and south, and the town's 5,000 full-time residents -- along with 20,000 visitors -- fled on short notice late Monday and Tuesday when the fires flared up. One of the fires entered the southern edge of the community Wednesday evening.\n\nAlberta Public Safety Minister Mike Ellis said a wind gust moved the wildfire about 5 kilometers (about 3 miles) in probably less than 30 minutes toward the town with a wall of fire that he estimated was 100 meters high.\n\n\"People need to picture what those wildfire folks were experiencing at that time. Any firefighter will tell you there is little to nothing you can do when a wall of fire like that is coming at you,\" Ellis said. \"Nobody anticipated the fire to come so fast, so large.\"\n\nParks Canada said in a post on X that there had been \"no reported injuries as the result of the Jasper Complex Wildfire. Approximately 25,000 people were safely evacuated from the town of Jasper and Jasper National Park. All residents, visitors and responders are safe.\"\n\nPark officials said efforts to fight the fire were continuing and that it was not immediately possible to give details of the damage. They asked for patience, and said that the fire remains out of control despite a small amount of rain that fell overnight.\n\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau said his administration has approved Alberta's request for federal assistance, including military resources.\n\nOn X, the account for the Fairmont Jasper Park Lodge said the flames had reached the hotel's grounds, but the extent of damage, if any, wasn't immediately known.\n\nJasper National Park is considered a national treasure. The United Nations designated the parks that make up the Canadian Rockies, including Jasper, a World Heritage Site in 1984 for its striking mountain landscape.\n\nAlberta has been baking under scorching temperatures that have already forced another 7,500 people out of remote communities. About 176 wildfires were burning across the province, including 54 that are burning out of control.\n\nAlberta Forestry and Parks Minister Todd Loewen said many of the fires are caused by lightning, and Alberta Wildfire spokesperson Christie Tucker said firefighters expect winds will raise the danger.\n\nTucker said hundreds firefighters from Australia, Mexico, New Zealand and South Africa are arriving to help fight the wildfires throughout the province.\n\nA record number of wildfires in 2023 forced more than 235,000 people across Canada to evacuate and sent thick smoke into parts of the U.S., leading to hazy skies and health advisories in multiple U.S. cities.", "source": {"uri": "npr.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "NPR"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Before the night was over, the entire town and park was ordered to evacuate as crews struggled to combat the flames being whipped by high winds and dry conditions.\n\nAbout 25,000 people were evacuated from the park, including roughly 5,000 residents of the town.\n\nBy Wednesday evening, both wildfires had encroached on the town.\n\nHere's a timeline of how the situation unfolded. All times are local.\n\n7 p.m.: The first wildfire burning to the northeast of the town of Jasper is reported to Parks Canada. A second fire to the south is reported shortly after.\n\n8:35 p.m.: The Municipality of Jasper and Jasper National Park issue a \"preventative\" evacuation alert, warning of \"multiple wildfires\" burning in the park.\n\n10 p.m.: A wildfire alert and evacuation order are issued for Jasper National Park, including the townsite, for the wildfire south of town. An updated alert incorrectly states the fire is expected to reach the town in five hours, but is corrected nearly an hour later to say the area should be evacuated within that time.\n\nEvacuees are forced to travel west into British Columbia, then turn around and head to reception centres set up in Calgary, Edmonton and Grande Prairie. Parks Canada later says \"thousands\" of people evacuated overnight, facing \"wall-to-wall\" traffic on Highway 16.\n\n10 a.m.: Alberta Public Safety and Emergency Services Minister Mike Ellis says during a provincial wildfire update that the fire burning south of Jasper is about 12 km from the town on both sides of the Athabasca River. He warned wind \"may exacerbate the situation.\"\n\n4:30 p.m.: Parks Canada says evacuation of the Municipality of Jasper is complete, \"and the evacuation of hikers in the backcountry is ongoing.\" Campsites within the park boundary are also being cleared.\n\n6 p.m.: Fire officials with Parks Canada say the \"north wildfire\" is estimated to be at least 270 hectares in size, burning between the Jasper transfer station and the Jasper air strip, on both sides of Highway 16.\n\nThe \"south wildfire\" is estimated to be 6,750 hectares in size and is burning further away from the town, down the Icefields Parkway.\n\nParks Canada incident commander Katie Ellsworth says during a media briefing that heavy smoke is making it difficult to properly assess the size of the fires. She says crews are using aerial suppression efforts, including water bucketing from helicopters, as well as ground water lines and other measures to try and control the flames.\n\n11:10 a.m.: Ellsworth with Parks Canada says the size of the southern fire is now estimated to have grown 60 per cent overnight to 10,800 hectares, and is about eight km from the town of Jasper. The north wildfire is five km from the town and remains at roughly 270 hectares in size.\n\nShe says the \"aggressive fire behaviour\" seen throughout Tuesday continued overnight, with consistently high and gusty winds that are expected to last through Wednesday and further grow both fires. Crews are installing high-pressure sprinkler lines in key areas and continuing suppression efforts.\n\nEllsworth notes crews are already preparing for the possibility of fire reaching the town. Some structures outside the town have already been impacted.\n\n1 p.m.: Parks Canada says evacuations in the backcountry are ongoing but have been completed in \"high priority areas.\" The frontcountry areas of Jasper National Park have also been fully evacuated.\n\n4:20 p.m.: Ellis, the provincial public safety and emergencies minister, says Alberta has asked the federal government for assistance, including resources from the Canadian Armed Forces.\n\n5:30 p.m.: First responders working in Jasper National Park will be relocated to the nearby town of Hinton, Alta., about 50 km away, due to \"significant fire activity and forecasted strong winds,\" Parks Canada says. Firefighting personnel, aircraft and a reduced incident command staff remain in Jasper to try and protect the town.\n\n6 p.m.: Portions of the south wildfire reach the outskirts of the town of Jasper. Parks Canada says suppression efforts by helicopter bucketing \"proved ineffective,\" and water bombers could not assist due to dangerous flying conditions. Conditions also prevented other fire control efforts.\n\n6:40 p.m.: Parks Canada says \"wildfire reached the Jasper townsite.\"\n\n7:20 p.m.: Global News receives a picture of what's later confirmed to be the Maligne Lodge, a hotel at the southwest end of town operated since 1961, completely engulfed in flames. The family operators of the hotel later confirm it was destroyed.\n\n8:30 p.m.: Parks Canada says wildland firefighters and others without self-contained breathing apparatuses are being evacuated to Hinton due to deteriorating air quality. Structural firefighters remain in town to try and protect critical infrastructure and save as many structures as possible.\n\n9:30 p.m. Fairmont Hotels and Resorts confirms to Global News that the fire reached the grounds of the historic Jasper Park Lodge, one of the most-well known and storied resorts in the area.\n\n10 p.m.: In its final update of the night, Parks Canada says \"significant loss has occurred within the townsite.\" Fire information officer James Eastham tells Global News crews witnessed \"300- to 400-foot flames\" that swept into town at a rate of 15 metres per minute.\n\n10:30 p.m.: Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says his government has approved Alberta's request for federal assistance, and will deploy military resources and other emergency supports \"immediately.\"\n\n\"Alberta, we're with you,\" Trudeau says on social media.\n\n10:30 a.m.: Parks Canada says despite a small amount of rain overnight, the Jasper wildfire remains out of control. Officials add that \"significant structural firefighting reinforcements arrived throughout the night and have continued to assist with firefighting efforts.\"\n\nConditions on the ground are making it impossible for crews to provide details about the status of specific buildings and sites, Parks Canada adds, as the focus remains on the \"response effort.\"\n\nImages shared with Global News show a wide swath of blackened, charred homes and buildings razed to their foundations.\n\n12 p.m.: Alberta Premier Danielle Smith tells reporters at an emotional news conference that initial estimates are between 30 to 50 per cent of structures within Jasper townsite were destroyed overnight. She said the town faces a \"significant rebuild.\"", "source": {"uri": "globalnews.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "Global News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Firefighting efforts have prevented significant damage to much of the infrastructure in the east end of town. Our priority remains protecting structures that have not yet been impacted by fire.\"\n\nAdditionally, a number of bridges in the town and through the national park have been damaged, including the Moberly Bridge and the Old Fort Point Bridge.\n\nWinds in Jasper whipped up to 100 km/h Wednesday, forcing the spread of the fires that were north and south of the town, causing their eventual merging.\n\n\"With today's rain and cooler temperatures, fire activity is significantly subdued. However, it is important to note that the fire is still out of control and significant work remains before conditions are safe enough to allow for limited re-entry into the park,\" the park says in its recent update.\n\n\"Crews are taking advantage of today's conditions to make progress on containing the fire and the community, before conditions return to hot and dry.\"\n\nCanada Task Force 2 of the Canadian Armed Forces has now arrived in Jasper to assist in the response to the fire and with the town's eventual recovery.\n\nJasper National Park says they'll provide another update on the situation by 10 p.m. local time.\n\nUPDATE: 12 p.m.\n\nAlberta Premier Danielle Smith says early reports indicate a third and perhaps up to half of all buildings in the historic Rocky Mountain resort town of Jasper have been destroyed in a wildfire.\n\nSmith says she's waiting for specifics but says there is no doubt the town is in for what she calls a \"significant rebuild.\"\n\nSmith made the comments after fighting back tears at a news conference as she sought to console residents who were evacuated from the townsite and now face significant hardship when they return.\n\nImages on social media depict blocks of homes and businesses burned to charred foundations, and vehicles torched to their hubcaps.\n\nParks Canada says it will provide details when it can but says crews continue to battle a swift and dynamic fire in Jasper National Park.\n\nAbout 20,000 park visitors and the 5,000 residents of Jasper had to flee on a moment's notice Monday night ahead of two wildfires.\n\nUPDATE: 11:10 a.m.\n\nAlberta Premier Danielle Smith fought back tears Thursday as she sought to console Jasper residents coming to terms with a community devastated by wildfire.\n\n\"The feelings of loss and fear and loneliness must be overwhelming,\" Smith said at a fire update in Edmonton.\n\n\"We share the sense of loss with all of those who live in the town, who care for it, and who have helped build it.\"\n\nSpecifics on what has been destroyed in the Rocky Mountain resort town of 5,000 remained sketchy.\n\nJasper Park officials, in a statement, said the firefighting situation remains dynamic.\n\nPhotos shared on social media Wednesday night depicted Jasper structures wrapped in sheets of flame.\n\nA video Thursday morning showed rain-slicked streets, cloudy skies and a wide swath of blackened, charred homes and buildings razed to their foundations.\n\n\"The images we're seeing out of Jasper are devastating,\" said Forestry Minister Todd Loewen.\n\nThe province has asked for help from the Canadian Armed Forces, and the federal government has said aid is on the way.\n\nCalgary, along with fire crews from Edmonton and Sherwood Park, said they were sending resources to the fire scene.\n\nThe staging area was the town of Hinton, on the eastern outskirts of Jasper National Park.\n\nIn Hinton Thursday morning, rain fell and wood smoke hung in the air at the roadblock preventing vehicles from entering the park. Five officials in bright neon yellow vests directed traffic. The only vehicle that was seen going through was a fire truck.\n\nJasper Mayor Richard Ireland, in an open letter to residents, urged them to stay strong.\n\n\"I write to you today with profound sorrow as we begin to come to terms with the devastating impact of last night's wildfire that has ravaged our beloved community,\" Ireland wrote.\n\n\"The destruction and loss that many of you are facing and feeling is beyond description and comprehension.\n\n\"Your resilience and strength have always been the backbone of our community. In the coming days and weeks, we will rally together, support one another, and begin the daunting process of recovery.\"\n\nPhoto: Woodlands County\n\nUPDATE 10:20 a.m.\n\nIn an update Thursday morning, Jasper National Park says there have been no reported injuries due to the wildfire that swept through Jasper fire overnight, and about 25,000 people were safely evacuated from the town and national park.\n\n\"All residents, visitors and responders are safe,\" the park posted to social media.\n\nAdditionally, the region received a \"small amount of rain\" overnight, which has \"helped reduce fire activity slightly.\" But park officials say it hasn't made meaningful impact on the overall fire situation.\n\n\"Significant structural firefighting reinforcements arrived throughout the night and have continued to assist with firefighting efforts in the community overnight and this morning,\" the update reads.\n\n\"We are thankful to all of our partners and municipal fire agencies who have sent resources to help protect our community and national park. We also wish to acknowledge and thank all the communities who have received everyone who has been displaced by this fire.\"\n\nNo information has been released about the extent of the damage or specific locations in the town that have been hit by the fire.\n\n\"While we understand people are desperate to know about the status of our community, homes, work places, businesses, and cherished places we will need some time to stabilize this incident as we access and assess structures. We appreciate your patience and the community of people who have come together to support the people of Jasper and Parks Canada family.\"\n\nAlberta Premier Danielle Smith is speaking Thursday morning about the situation in Jasper. She'll be joined by officials from Alberta Wildfire.\n\nUPDATE 9:05 a.m.\n\nAlberta's Jasper National Park and its townsite are under siege from two wind-whipped wildfires, one of which raced into the picturesque community on Wednesday night, causing extensive damage.\n\nParks Canada says the fire has caused significant losses within the town, and the social media account for Fairmont's famous Jasper Park Lodge says the flames had reached the hotel's grounds.\n\nAs the fire consumed more fuel, officials said the air quality dropped to dangerous levels, prompting fire crews without breathing apparatus to flee to the nearby community of Hinton.\n\nJasper, a postcard-perfect mountain town, is famous for hiking, skiing, kayaking and biking. It is also home to dozens of species such as elk, mountain goats, cougars, lynx, black bears and grizzly bears. The United Nations designated the parks that make up the Canadian Rockies, including Jasper, a World Heritage Site in 1984.\n\nPhotos on social media show lodges and other buildings wrapped in sheets of orange flame and devastation the following day.\n\n\"Structural firefighters remain in town and are working to save as many structures as possible,\" Parks Canada said in a statement.\n\nMeanwhile, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced on social media that Ottawa has approved Alberta's request for federal assistance. Alberta Forestry Minister Todd Loewen has asked for help from the Canadian military.\n\n\"We are requesting firefighting resources, aerial support to move wildfire crews and equipment and more,\" Loewen wrote on the social media platform X.\n\nEarlier in the day, all first responders were ordered out of Jasper National Park for their safety and to give fire crews more room to operate.\n\nThe fires are burning on the north and south sides of the town, which is home to 5,000 people. The residents have left, along with 20,000 park visitors.\n\nThe order to leave was issued around 10 p.m. Monday as fires cut off road access to Jasper. Residents and visitors fled west into British Columbia in a long, slow midnight procession through swirling smoke and ash.\n\nThe following day, evacuees in B.C. who didn't have a place to stay were directed to make the long drive around the fires back to Alberta to evacuation centres in Grande Prairie and Calgary.\n\nThe northern fire was spotted five kilometres from Jasper earlier Wednesday. The southern fire was farther away, but Parks Canada says strong winds sent it racing toward the town.\n\nThat forced crews using heavy equipment to pull back for safety. Water bombers were grounded due to dangerous flying conditions.\n\nAt the Grande Prairie evacuation centre, Addison McNeill recalled arriving in Jasper from Edmonton only to be told to get out.\n\n\"I moved there two hours before the evacuation notice,\" the 24-year-old said in an interview.\n\nMcNeill said she went to a nearby hotel, one of two meet-up points for those without transportation. She hopped in a recreational vehicle with others and headed out -- at a snail's pace.\n\n\"Every single person in town was beelining to one exit from about six different routes and so you get bottleneck, backups and congestion,\" she said.\n\nMcNeill said as she sat inside the vehicle, she felt so close to the wildfires that the windows seemed like they were going to shatter from the pressure of the hot, smoky air.\n\nShe saw acts of kindness amid the swirling ash: neighbours loaning their cars to those without; people knocking on doors to see if everyone inside was OK.\n\n\"It was far from a panic,\" she said.\n\nPhoto: Contributed Jasper's Maligne Lodge on fire\n\nORIGINAL 5:35 a.m.\n\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau announced on social media that Ottawa has approved Alberta's request for federal assistance after a fast-moving wildfire hit Jasper National Park and its townsite late Wednesday.\n\nThe park's social media account says the fire has caused significant loss within the townsite, but the specific locations or neighbourhoods affected are not being reported.\n\nOn the social media platform X, the account for Fairmont's Jasper Park Lodge says the flames have reached the hotel's grounds, but the extent of damage, if any, is not yet known.\n\nAs the flames consumed more fuel, officials say the air quality dropped to dangerous levels, prompting fire crews without breathing apparatus to evacuate to the nearby community of Hinton.\n\nStructural firefighters stayed behind in the Alberta mountain town in an effort to protect key infrastructure.\n\nPhoto: Kenneth Smith/Banff-Canmore Visitors\n\nEarlier, Alberta Premier Danielle Smith issued a statement on Facebook, saying her thoughts are with the evacuees and those still fighting the fire.", "source": {"uri": "castanet.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Castanet"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jasper_National_Park", "type":

(Credit: gelo__25 /TMX)\n\nOne of two raging wildfires menacing the town of Jasper in the Canadian Rockies\u00e2\u0080\u0099 largest national park roared into town Wednesday and began burning buildings.\n\nJasper National Park officials said the fire entered the southern edge of the community Wednesday evening and crews were battling multiple structural fires and working to protect key infrastructure. There were significant losses in some areas, they said.\n\nForest firefighters and others without self-contained breathing apparatuses were told to evacuate to the nearby town of Hinton, with structural firefighters staying behind.\n\nFBI OFFERING $10,000 REWARD FOR INFO LEADING TO ARREST OF SUSPECTS IN DEADLY NEW MEXICO WILDFIRES\n\nParks Canada spokesperson James Eastham told reporters outside Jasper that the town is filled with smoke and there \"has been structural loss.\"\n\n\"At this point I can't confirm how many, locations or specific structures. The fire continues to burn,\" he said.\n\nParks Canada said firefighters are working to save \"as many structures as possible and to protect critical infrastructure, including the wastewater treatment plant, communications facilities, the Trans Mountain Pipeline and others.\"\n\nA few hours earlier, many first responders were ordered out of Jasper National Park for their safety.\n\nJasper is being menaced by fires from the north and south, and the town\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 5,000 residents -- along with 20,000 more park visitors -- fled on short notice late Monday night when the fires flared up.\n\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau said they are \"mobilizing every necessary resource available.\" Alberta Premier Danielle Smith said she was \"heartbroken.\"\n\nA record number of wildfires in 2023 forced more than 235,000 people across Canada to evacuate and sent thick smoke into parts of the U.S., leading to hazy skies and health advisories in multiple U.S. cities.\n\nThe northern fire was spotted about 3 miles from Jasper earlier in the day. The southern fire had been reported about 5 miles away from the town, but Katie Ellsworth of Parks Canada said strong wind gusts swooping in behind it sent it racing.\n\nEverything that could go wrong did go wrong as fire perimeters changed minute by minute.\n\nEllsworth said bucketing efforts by helicopter failed. Crews using heavy equipment to build fireguards couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t complete the work before having to pull back for safety. Water bombers couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t help due to dangerous flying conditions.\n\nA last-ditch effort to use controlled burns to reroute the fire to natural barriers like Highway 16 and the Athabasca River failed due to \"unfavorable conditions.\"\n\nThe hope was that rain forecast overnight would bring some relief.\n\nEllsworth said the decision to relocate all first responders to Hinton, just outside the eastern edge of the park, \"has not been made lightly.\"\n\nShe said, \"Given the intensity of fire behavior being observed the decision has been made to limit the number of responders exposed to this risk.\"\n\nJasper National Park is considered a national treasure. The United Nations designated the parks that make up the Canadian Rockies, including Jasper, a World Heritage Site in 1984 for its striking mountain landscape.\n\nIn 1953, Hollywood star Marilyn Monroe visited to make the movie \"River of No Return.\" More recently, the TV show \"The Bachelorette\" was filmed there.\n\nPark rangers in helicopters scoured the park earlier Wednesday, looking for stragglers still there despite a mass evacuation aimed at moving visitors and residents away. Searchers looking through the backcountry trails of Jasper National Park already had picked up 245 people, and they continued the search Wednesday in two helicopters, Ellsworth said.\n\nResidents and visitors streamed out by the thousands late Monday and Tuesday, and officials said Wednesday the evacuation of the town of Jasper was complete.\n\nEllsworth said park officials expected the evacuation of the park's backcountry areas to be completed later Wednesday. Reservations are required for the park, so authorities have an idea of where people are, though Ellsworth said she wasn't immediately sure how many people were left.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAlberta has been baking under scorching temperatures that have already forced another 7,500 people out of remote communities. About 177 wildfires were burning across the province.\n\nJasper resident Leanne Maeva Joyeuse was relieved but exhausted after reaching the Grand Prairie evacuation center following 20 hours on the

The fire continues to burn,\" he said.\n\nThe pipeline operator did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment, but said earlier it was safely operating the pipeline and had deployed sprinkler protection as a preventive measure.\n\nJasper National Park said it could not report on the extent of damage to specific locations or neighbourhoods, and that it would provide further updates on Thursday.\n\nJasper is being menaced by fires from the north and south.\n\nThe northern fire was spotted five kilometres from Jasper earlier in the day.\n\nThe southern fire had been reported eight kilometres away from the town, but Katie Ellsworth of Parks Canada said strong wind gusts swooping in behind it sent it racing.\n\nEverything that could go wrong did go wrong as fire perimeters changed minute to minute.\n\nMs Ellsworth said bucketing efforts by helicopter failed.\n\nCrews using heavy equipment to build fireguards couldn't complete the work before having to pull back for safety.\n\nWater bombers couldn't help due to dangerous flying conditions.\n\nA last-ditch effort to use controlled burns to reroute the fire to natural barriers like Highway 16 and the Athabasca River failed due to \"unfavourable conditions\".\n\nAbout 25,000 people were forced to evacuate the town on Monday night, including 15,000 visitors to Jasper National Park.\n\nThe park draws around two million tourists per year and is considered a national treasure.\n\nThe United Nations designated the parks that make up the Canadian Rockies, including Jasper, a World Heritage Site in 1984 for its striking mountain landscape.\n\nIn 1953, Hollywood star Marilyn Monroe visited to make the movie River of No Return.\n\nMore recently, the TV show The Bachelorette was filmed there.\n\nRangers in helicopters scoured the park earlier on Wednesday, looking for stragglers still there despite Monday night's mass evacuation.\n\nSearchers looking through the back-country trails of Jasper National Park already had picked up 245 people and they continued the search on Wednesday in two helicopters, Ms Ellsworth said.\n\nLater on Wednesday, officials said the evacuation of the town of Jasper was complete.\n\nJasper resident Leanne Maeva Joyeuse said she was relieved but exhausted after reaching the Grand Prairie evacuation centre following 20 hours on the road with her grandmother, parents and younger brother.\n\nDeteriorating air quality forced firefighters and others lacking breathing equipment to evacuate to the town of Hinton about 100 kilometres away, park authorities said on Facebook on Wednesday evening.\n\nMs Ellsworth said the decision to relocate all first responders to Hinton just outside the eastern edge of the park had \"not been made lightly\".\n\n\"Given the intensity of fire behaviour being observed the decision has been made to limit the number of responders exposed to this risk,\" she said.\n\nOfficials of Parks Canada earlier said they expected rain to arrive overnight.\n\nThe fire marks one of hundreds ravaging the western provinces of Alberta and British Columbia.\n\nAlberta has been baking under scorching temperatures that have already forced another 7,500 people out of remote communities.\n\nWildfires burning uncontrolled across the region include 433 in British Columbia and 176 in Alberta, more than a dozen in the oil sands hub of Fort McMurray.\n\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau said the Canadian government was \"mobilising every necessary resource available\" to contain the fires.\n\n\"We're deploying Canadian Armed Forces resources, evacuations support, and more emergency wildfire resources to the province immediately -- and we're coordinating firefighting and airlift assistance. Alberta, we're with you.\"\n\nAlberta Premier Danielle Smith said she was \"heartbroken\" by the damage.\n\nIn Canada, authorities issued an air quality advisory for Calgary due to the wildfire smoke.\n\nA government agency called it high risk and said children and the elderly should avoid outdoor physical exertion.\n\nAir quality warnings have also been sent across the western United States.\n\nA record number of wildfires in 2023 forced more than 235,000 people across Canada to evacuate and sent thick smoke into parts of the US, leading to hazy skies and health advisories in multiple US cities.\n\nWildfire smoke can cause unhealthy air quality in areas many kilometres away from fires.", "source": {"uri": "abc.net.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "Australian Broadcasting

I didn't get a chance to grab any of my belongings.\"\n\nJasper Mayor Richard Ireland said the town was beginning to come to terms with \"the devastating impact\" of the fire.\n\n\"Last night's wildfires have simply ravaged our small tight-knit mountain community, the destruction and the loss that so many of our residents are facing simply defies description,\" he told a press conference, his voice breaking. One major concern for responders is if the fire damages the Trans Mountain oil pipeline, which can carry 890,000 barrels per day (bpd) of oil from Edmonton to Vancouver.\n\n\"At this time there is no indication of damage to our infrastructure, and the pipelines continue to operate safely,\" pipeline operator Trans Mountain said in a statement.\n\nCN Rail said it suspended rail operations through the town on Wednesday afternoon as the wildfire conditions worsened.\n\nThe Port of Vancouver, Canada's largest, said it expected to see delays to the movement of goods through the port in the coming days due to the events in Jasper.\n\nThe federal government and other cities in Alberta are sending emergency crews. In addition, a total of 400 firefighters from Mexico, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand are due to arrive in the coming days.\n\n'WALL OF FLAMES'\n\nThere are currently 176 wildfires burning in Alberta, more than 50 of which are out of control. Around 10 of those blazes are close to the border with British Columbia, where there are 423 wildfires burning and dozens of evacuation orders and alerts.\n\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Thursday afternoon he had convened a meeting of the Incident Response Group to discuss the Alberta wildfires.\n\n\"Every federal agency is coordinated, sending resources to Jasper, deploying evacuations support to the area, and reinforcing firefighting efforts on the ground,\" Trudeau said in a post on X.\n\nThe federal government said in April that high temperatures and tinder-dry forests meant this could be a catastrophic year for wildfires in Canada.\n\nThe Jasper fire was caused by a lightning strike on Monday afternoon and fuelled by strong winds, according to Parks Canada.\n\nFlames from the blaze rose 100 meters (328 feet) high, and strong wind gusts on Wednesday afternoon pushed the fire 5 km(3 miles ) in less than 30 minutes, said Alberta Public Safety and Emergency Services Minister Mike Ellis.\n\n\"Any firefighter will tell you there's little to nothing you can do when you have a wall of flames coming at you like that,\" Ellis said.\n\nEnvironment Canada is forecasting 10 mm to 20 mm (0.4 to 0.8 inch) of rain for Thursday, which might help firefighters.\n\nThe Jasper Park Lodge, one of the largest hotels in town, said the fire had reached its grounds. The 400-room residence is run by Fairmont, a group owned by France's Accor.\n\nThe Jasper fire could be one of the most damaging in Alberta since a 2016 conflagration that hit the oil town of Fort McMurray, forcing the evacuation of all 90,000 residents and destroying 10% of all structures in the city.", "source": {"uri": "staradvertiser.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Honolulu Star

He said he was writing with \"profound sorrow as we being to come to terms with the devastating impact.\"\n\nDanielle Smith, the premier of Alberta province, said from 30% to 50% of the town's structures are potentially damaged. \"We don't know which structures have been damaged and which ones are destroyed, but that's going to be a significant rebuild and significant displacement,\" Smith said.\n\nSmith teared up talking about the beauty of Jasper, noting that many families from the province regularly visit.\n\nA postcard-perfect mountain town, Jasper is famous for hiking, skiing, kayaking and biking. It is also home to dozens of species such as elk, mountain goats, cougars, lynx, black bears and grizzly bears.\n\n\"We share the sense of loss with all who live in town,\" Smith said at a news conference in Edmonton, Alberta. \"Alberta's government will provide the support needed to families and communities to recover and rebuild.\"\n\nJasper and the neighboring Jasper National Park had been menaced by fires from both the north and south, and the town's 5,000 full-time residents -- along with 20,000 visitors -- fled on short notice late Monday and Tuesday when the fires flared up.\n\nOne of the fires raced into the southern edge of the community Wednesday evening as firefighters tried to limit the damage.\n\nAlberta Public Safety Minister Mike Ellis said a wind gust moved the wildfire about 5 kilometers (about 3 miles) in probably less than 30 minutes toward the town with a wall of fire that he estimated was 100 meters high.\n\n\"People need to picture what those wildfire folks were experiencing at that time. Any firefighter will tell you there is little to nothing you can do when a wall of fire like that is coming at you,\" Ellis said. \"Nobody anticipated the fire to come so fast, so large.\"\n\nPierre Martel, director of fire management at Parks Canada, said lightning, winds and drought made the fire grow rapidly on Monday and that flames were above the treetops when it entered the town Wednesday. He also estimated they were about 100 meters (300 feet) tall.\n\n\"It's just a monster at that point. There are no tools we have in our tool box to deal with that at that point. You get out of the way, you retreat,\" he said.\n\nParks Canada said in a post on X that there had been \"no reported injuries,\" adding that \"Approximately 25,000 people were safely evacuated from the town of Jasper and Jasper National Park. All residents, visitors and responders are safe.\"\n\nPark officials said efforts to fight the fire were continuing and that it was not immediately possible to give details of the damage. They asked for patience, and said that the fire remains out of control despite a small amount of rain that fell overnight.\n\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau said his administration has approved Alberta's request for federal assistance, including military resources.\n\nOn X, the account for the Fairmont Jasper Park Lodge said the flames had reached the hotel's grounds, but the extent of damage wasn't immediately known.\n\nJasper National Park is considered a national treasure.

Another fire roaring up from the south forced the closure of the north-south Icefields Parkway. That left one route open, going west to British Columbia.\n\nBut Alberta fire officials said British Columbia had its hands full with its own evacuations. Alberta Public Safety Minister Mike Ellis said reception centers were instead being set up in Grande Prairie and Calgary in Alberta, requiring long detours through British Columbia by the drivers fleeing Jasper.\n\nAlberta has been baking under scorching temperatures that have already forced another 7,500 people out of remote communities. About 170 wildfires were burning across the province.\n\nEllsworth said the north fire, spanning about 272 hectares, is about 5 kilometers (3 miles) from Jasper. She said the south fire, about 10,800 hectares, is about 8 kilometers (about 5 miles) from the town.\n\nCrews scrambled Wednesday to protect homes in Jasper.\n\nThey began work to bulldoze a fireguard on the town's southern edge.

The fire continues to burn,\" he said.\n\nParks Canada said firefighters are working to save \"as many structures as possible and to protect critical infrastructure, including the wastewater treatment plant, communications facilities, the Trans Mountain Pipeline and others\".\n\nA few hours earlier, many first responders were ordered out of Jasper National Park for their safety.\n\nJasper is being threatened by fires from the north and south, and the town's 5,000 residents - along with 20,000 park visitors - fled on short notice late on Monday when the fires flared up.\n\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau said officials are \"mobilising every necessary resource available\". Alberta premier Danielle Smith said she was \"heartbroken\".\n\nA record number of wildfires last year forced more than 235,000 people across Canada to evacuate and sent thick smoke into parts of the US, leading to hazy skies and health advisories in multiple US cities.\n\nThe northern fire was spotted three miles from Jasper earlier in the day. The southern fire had been reported five miles away from the town, but Katie Ellsworth of Parks Canada said strong wind gusts sent it racing.\n\nShe said bucketing efforts by helicopter failed, crews using heavy equipment to build fireguards could not complete the work before having to pull out, and water bombers could not help due to dangerous flying conditions.\n\nA last-ditch effort to use controlled burns to reroute the fire to natural barriers like Highway 16 and the Athabasca River failed due to \"unfavourable conditions\".\n\nThe hope was that rain forecast overnight would bring some relief.\n\nMs Ellsworth said the decision to relocate all first responders to Hinton, just outside the eastern edge of the park, \"has not been made lightly\".\n\nIn 1953, Hollywood star Marilyn Monroe visited to make the movie River Of No Return. More recently, TV show The Bachelorette was filmed there.\n\nPark rangers in helicopters scoured the park earlier on Wednesday looking for stragglers still there despite a mass evacuation aimed at moving visitors and residents away.\n\nSearchers looking through the remote trails of Jasper National Park had already picked up 245 people, and they continued the search on Wednesday in two helicopters, Ms Ellsworth said.\n\nResidents and visitors streamed out by the thousands late on Monday and Tuesday, and officials said on Wednesday that the evacuation of the town of Jasper was complete.\n\nMs Ellsworth said park officials expected the evacuation of the park's backcountry areas to be completed later on Wednesday. Reservations are required for the park, so authorities have an idea where people are, but Ms Ellsworth said she was not sure how many people were left.\n\nAlberta has been baking in scorching temperatures that have already forced another 7,500 people out of remote communities.

Spotting - embers carried by the wind - allowed the blaze to move five kilometres in less than one hour.\n\n\"It's just a monster at that point. There is (sic) no tools we have in our toolbox to deal with that at that point. You get out of the way, you retreat, and you do what you can to protect communities and infrastructure as best as you can.\"\n\nMartel's team has not been able to better assess the size of the fire, which he said is in the \"tens of thousands of hectares\" likely.\n\nMore structural firefighters are on their way to the town to assist those already there.\n\nWildland firefighters, who left Jasper Wednesday evening because they did not have the respiratory equipment to stay while structures were burning, have returned to the front lines.\n\nIn total, 20,000 people - the majority of whom were visitors - safely left Jasper and Jasper National Park by Wednesday.\n\n11:30 a.m. MT: Premier and Alberta Wildfire update\n\nThere are 176 wildfires burning in Alberta's protected forests currently, 54 of which are burning out of control, Alberta Wildfire reported in a Thursday morning news conference.\n\nThat number does not include mutual aid fires such as the two near Jasper in which another agency - Parks Canada, in this case - is leading the fire response.\n\nAccording to Alberta Wildfire public information officer Christie Tucker, 400 firefighters from Mexico, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand are due to arrive in Alberta between Thursday and Monday.\n\nThey, as well as military resources, will be deployed where they are needed most, Tucker said.\n\nSpeaking about the winds that quickly pushed the fires in Jasper National Park toward the townsite on Wednesday, Tucker said, \"We're expecting more of those winds in the province today, which will raise the fire danger for those areas particularly that didn't get much rain.\"\n\nRain in parts of northern Alberta reduced \"some\" of the wildfire danger, she said, but it remains extreme in the northeast and south parts of the province.\n\nFighting tears, Alberta Premier Danielle Smith told those listening to the press conference how she, like many Albertans, grew up going to Jasper with family.\n\n\"To those in Alberta and around the world who have experience the magic of Jasper, the magic is not lost and it never will be. Alberta's government will provide the support needed to families and community to recover and rebuild stronger so that future generations can continue to experience this one of a kind community and feel the magic of being able to come home.\"\n\nShe estimated the townsite had suffered \"potentially 30 to 50 per cent structural damage.\"\n\nSmith also told reporters she and her ministers would be speaking with their federal counterparts Thursday, including a call with the prime minister in the afternoon and a meeting with the federal minister of emergency preparedness in person in Edmonton.\n\n8:30 a.m. MT: Update from Jasper mayor\n\n\"It's been a sleepless night, as I'm sure it has been for all of our evacuated residents,\" Jasper's mayor, Richard Ireland, told CTV Edmonton Morning Live.\n\nHe said support from people across Canada has helped him come to terms with the devastating news of at least some destruction.\n\n\"It is gratifying to know that people appreciate our community and are fully prepared to step up to help us rebuild,\" Ireland said.\n\nSpeaking about the toll the COVID-19 pandemic took on Jasper, he added, \"We've learned to come together and work our way through that and that hopefully has prepared us to come together once again ... as we start to face the really daunting prospect of rebuilding an entire community, perhaps.\"\n\n7:10 a.m. MT: First government update\n\nOfficials are waiting to learn Thursday morning the extent of wildfire damage in the Jasper townsite of Jasper National Park, which flames began to eat away at the night before.\n\nFirefighters that remained in Jasper overnight were working to save what buildings they could.\n\nAlberta's forestry and parks minister said the government has not received any more information overnight but was expecting an update from Parks Canada later in the day.\n\n\"Obviously, it's a pretty dire situation over there, but still no extra information,\" Todd Loewen said.\n\nIn its last update Wednesday evening, Parks Canada said \"significant loss\" had occurred in the townsite.\n\nPictures on social media showed flames engulfing Maligne Lodge and encroaching on other buildings in the Canadian Rockies town.\n\nManagement at Fairmont's famous Jasper Park Lodge confirmed fire had reached that hotel's grounds, too, but did not know Wednesday evening what kind of damage had been caused.\n\n\"Our hearts go out to them. I can't imagine the trauma that it causes seeing something like that and those pictures,\" Loewen said.\n\n\"We don't know exactly what's been lost, but hopefully it's better than what we're thinking right now anyways.\"\n\nThe federal government has approved Alberta's request for military help.\n\nMunicipalities around the province are also sending crews and resources to Jasper.", "source":

We will share more information as soon as we are able to ensure its accuracy.\"\n\nPhotos shared on social media Wednesday night depicted Jasper structures wrapped in sheets of flame.\n\nA video Thursday morning showed rain-slicked streets, cloudy skies and a wide swath of blackened, charred homes and buildings razed to their foundations.\n\n\"The images we're seeing out of Jasper are devastating,\" said Forestry Minister Todd Loewen.\n\nThe province has asked for help from the Canadian Armed Forces, and the federal government has said aid is on the way.\n\nCalgary, along with fire crews from Edmonton and Sherwood Park, said they were sending resources to the fire scene.\n\nThe staging area was the town of Hinton, on the eastern outskirts of Jasper National Park.\n\nIn Hinton Thursday morning, rain fell and wood smoke hung in the air at the roadblock preventing vehicles from entering the park. Five officials in bright neon yellow vests directed traffic. The only vehicle that was seen going through was a fire truck.\n\nCritical infrastructure has been affected by the wildfires that have raged through Jasper National Park, Alta. and into the picturesque townsite itself.\n\nTelus Corp. confirmed Thursday that some of its infrastructure in the Jasper area was damaged Wednesday in the blaze.\n\nA Telus spokeswoman said some home phone and mobility services in the area are down, and technicians are working hard to restore service.\n\nPriority is being given to restoring the ability to make voice calls, including those to 911, emergency services and hospital communication, said spokeswoman Brandi Merker in an email.\n\nShe said the company is securing helicopters to refuel critical cell tower sites and has also brought in backup generators to ensure the company can maintain wireless coverage for first responders.\n\n\"We know this is a difficult time and we are doing all we can to support our customers and team members who have been impacted, including supplying resources to the evacuation centre in Hinton, Alberta,\" Merker said.\n\nTelus said Thursday it is committing $100,000 to support rebuilding efforts in Jasper.\n\nCanadian National Railway Co., whose main line runs through Jasper, suspended operations in the area Wednesday afternoon as conditions worsened.\n\nCN first suspended rail service through Jasper on Tuesday but restarted it briefly Wednesday before shutting it down again a few hours later.\n\n\"Early reports indicate the wildfires caused significant damage to the town. We stand in support and solidarity with the community, home to many of our CN team members and their families,\" said CN spokeswoman Ashley Michnowski in an email.\n\nJasper Mayor Richard Ireland, in an open letter to residents, urged them to stay strong.\n\n\"I write to you today with profound sorrow as we begin to come to terms with the devastating impact of last night's wildfire that has ravaged our beloved community,\" Ireland wrote.\n\n\"The destruction and loss that many of you are facing and feeling is beyond description and comprehension.\n\n\"Your resilience and strength have always been the backbone of our community. In the coming days and weeks, we will rally together, support one another, and begin the daunting process of recovery.\"\n\nAbout 25,000 people, including about 5,000 residents in the Jasper townsite, were forced to flee west at a moment's notice late Monday night as twin wildfires from the south and north roared up and cut off access to the east and south.\n\nA day later they were directed to loop back to Alberta as British Columbia, dealing with its own fires, did not have the capacity to assist.\n\nOn Wednesday, efforts to contain the fires -- include buckets and fire guards and a last-ditch effort to burn a path from the southern fire to the river and highway -- were foiled by raging, gusting winds.\n\nAround 6 p.m. Wednesday, the fire roared in and began torching structures.\n\nJasper, a postcard-perfect mountain town, is famous for hiking, skiing, kayaking and biking. It is also home to dozens of species such as elk, mountain goats, cougars, lynx, black bears and grizzly bears. The United Nations designated the parks that make up the Canadian Rockies, including Jasper, a World Heritage Site in 1984.\n\nREAD ALSO: Jasper wildfire evacuees find relief after long journey to

But firefighters stayed.\n\n\"Firefighters remain in town combating multiple structural fires and are working to protect critical infrastructure,\" Parks Canada said in a post on X.\n\nTwo fires whipped by strong winds are bearing down on the town of Jasper, from the north and the south.\n\nThe northern fire was spotted 5 kilometers (about 3 miles) from Jasper earlier in the day.\n\nThe southern fire had been reported 8 kilometers (about 5 miles) away from the town, but Katie Ellsworth of Parks Canada said strong wind gusts swooping in behind it sent it racing.\n\nEverything that could go wrong did go wrong as fire perimeters changed minute by minute.\n\nEllsworth said bucketing efforts by helicopter failed. Crews using heavy equipment to build fireguards couldn't complete the work before having to pull back for safety. Water bombers couldn't help due to dangerous flying conditions.\n\nA last-ditch effort to use controlled burns to reroute the fire to natural barriers like Highway 16 and the Athabasca River failed due to \"unfavorable conditions.\"\n\nThe hope was that some rain, forecast to begin falling in the area later Wednesday night, would bring some relief.\n\nEllsworth said the decision to relocate all first responders to the town of Hinton, Alberta just outside the eastern edge of the park, \"has not been made lightly.\"\n\nShe said, \"Given the intensity of fire behavior being observed the decision has been made to limit the number of responders exposed to this risk.\"\n\nJasper National Park is considered a national treasure.

Reservations are required for the park, so authorities have an idea of where people are, though Ellsworth said she wasn't immediately sure how many people were left.\n\nAlberta has been baking under scorching temperatures that have already forced another 7,500 people out of remote communities. About 177 wildfires were burning across the province.\n\nAlberta Public Safety Minister Mike Ellis, in a late afternoon post on the social media site X, said he has \"requested assistance from the Canadian Armed Forces to ensure all resources are brought to bear on this situation.\"\n\nJasper resident Leanne Maeva Joyeuse was relieved but exhausted after reaching the Grand Prairie evacuation

A postcard-perfect mountain town, Jasper is famous for hiking, skiing, kayaking and biking. It is also home to dozens of species such as elk, mountain goats, cougars, lynx, black bears and grizzly bears.\n\n\"We share the sense of loss with all who live in town,\" Smith said at a news conference in Edmonton, Alberta, while pledging her government's support for the community to rebuild.\n\nParks Canada officials later said all critical infrastructure was protected including the hospital, schools and the wastewater treatment plant. They said the most significant structural damage is concentrated on the west side of town. Some bridges around town and throughout the park were damaged.\n\nJasper and the neighboring Jasper National Park had been menaced by fires from both the north and south, and the town's 5,000 full-time residents -- along with 20,000 visitors -- fled on short notice late Monday and Tuesday when the fires flared up.\n\nOne of the fires raced into the southern edge of the community Wednesday evening as firefighters tried to limit the damage.\n\nAlberta Public Safety Minister Mike Ellis said a wind gust moved the wildfire about 5 kilometers (about 3 miles) in probably less than 30 minutes toward the town with a wall of fire that he estimated was 100 meters high.\n\n\"People need to picture what those wildfire folks were experiencing at that time. Any firefighter will tell you there is little to nothing you can do when a wall of fire like that is coming at you,\" Ellis said. \"Nobody anticipated the fire to come so fast, so large.\"\n\nPierre Martel, director of fire management at Parks Canada, said lightning, winds and drought made the fire grow rapidly on Monday and that flames were above the treetops when it entered the town Wednesday.\n\n\"It's just a monster at that point. There are no tools we have in our tool box to deal with that at that point. You get out of the way, you retreat,\" he said.\n\nParks Canada said in a post on X that there had been \"no reported injuries,\" adding that \"Approximately 25,000 people were safely evacuated from the town of Jasper and Jasper National Park. All residents, visitors and responders are safe.\"\n\nAnnelies Lagger, who has owned and lived in the Austrian Haven B&B for 30 years, said she's waiting to hear if it's been destroyed but isn't optimistic because all the houses nearby are gone. She said she fled with her 13 cats and dog.\n\n\"I have no clue where I go now. Heaven or hell. It was my life. You can imagine how much work it was,\" she said. \"I'm think I'm in shock.\"\n\nShe said relatives including her daughter and son-in-law had their homes destroyed. \"It was the heat that dried everything out. And now the town is gone,\" she said.\n\nLagger was sheltering with a kind stranger in Valemount, British Columbia, but said she eventually will need to find new homes for her family members and \"for my critters.\"\n\n\"I'm a very tough women. Whatever happens I start again even though I'm 82 years old,\" she said.\n\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau said his administration has approved Alberta's request for federal assistance, including military resources.\n\nJasper National Park is considered a national treasure.

I didn't get a chance to grab any of my belongings.\"\n\nJasper mayor Richard Ireland said the town was beginning to come to terms with \"the devastating impact\" of the fire.\n\n\"Last night's wildfires have simply ravaged our small tight-knit mountain community, the destruction and the loss that so many of our residents are facing simply defies description,\" he told a press conference, his voice breaking.\n\nOne major concern for responders is if the fire damages the Trans Mountain oil pipeline, which can carry 890,000 barrels per day (bpd) of oil from Edmonton to Vancouver.\n\n\"At this time there is no indication of damage to our infrastructure, and the pipelines continue to operate safely,\" pipeline operator Trans Mountain said in a statement.\n\nCN Rail said it suspended rail operations through the town on Wednesday afternoon as the wildfire conditions worsened.\n\nThe federal government and other cities in Alberta are sending emergency crews. In addition, a total of 400 firefighters from Mexico, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand are due to arrive in the coming days.\n\nThere are currently 176 wildfires burning in Alberta, more than 50 of which are out of control. Around 10 of those blazes are close to the border with British Columbia, where there 423 wildfires burning and dozens of evacuation orders and alerts.\n\nThe federal government said in April that high temperatures and tinder dry forests meant this could be a catastrophic year for wildfires in Canada. The Jasper fire was caused by a lightning strike on Monday afternoon and fuelled by strong winds, according to Parks Canada.\n\nFlames from the blaze rose 100 metres high, and strong wind gusts on Wednesday afternoon pushed the fire 5 kilometres in less than 30 minutes, said Alberta public safety minister Mike Ellis.\n\n\"Any firefighter will tell you there's little to nothing you can do when you have a wall of flames coming at you like that,\" Ellis said.\n\nEnvironment Canada is forecasting 10mm to 20mm of rain for Thursday (local time), which might help firefighters.\n\nThe Jasper Park Lodge, one of the largest hotels in town, said the fire had reached its grounds. The 400-room residence is run by Fairmont, a group owned by France's Accor.\n\nThe Jasper fire could be one of the most damaging in Alberta since a 2016 conflagration that hit the oil town of Fort McMurray, forcing the evacuation of all 90,000 residents and destroying 10 percent of all structures in the city.", "source": {"uri": "rnz.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "RNZ"}, "authors": [],

THE CANADIAN PRESS/HO, Facebook, Jasper National Park *MANDATORY CREDIT*EDMONTON - Alberta Premier Danielle Smith says early reports indicate a third and perhaps up to half of all buildings in the historic Rocky Mountain resort town of Jasper have burned in a wildfire. \"You've seen the images as I have,\"\u009d Smith said Thursday. \"We're seeing potentially 30 to 50 per cent structural damage to give you some idea. \"We don't know which structures have been damaged and which ones have been destroyed, but that's going to be a significant rebuild.\" Smith made the comments after fighting back tears at a news conference as she sought to console residents who were evacuated from the townsite and now face significant hardship when they return. \"We share the sense of loss with all of those who live in the town, who care for it, and who have helped build it,\"\u009d Smith said. \"And to those in Alberta and around the world who have experienced the magic of Jasper: The magic is not lost, and it never will be.\"\u009d Parks Canada, in a statement said it will provide details on lost structures when it can accurately and responsibly confirm what burned. But it says crews continue to battle a swift and dynamic fire in Jasper National Park. \"Jasper National Park received a small amount of rain overnight,\"\u009d said the statement. \"While the rain helped reduce fire activity slightly, it is not enough to have made a meaningful impact to the overall wildfire situation, which remains out of control.\"\u009d Images surfacing on social media depicted blocks of homes and businesses burned to charred foundations and vehicles torched to the hubcaps. Calgary, along with fire crews from Edmonton and Sherwood Park dispatched resources to the fire scene. The province has asked for help from the Canadian Armed Forces, and the federal government has said aid is on the way. The staging area was the town of Hinton, on the eastern outskirts of Jasper National Park. In Hinton Thursday rain fell and wood smoke hung in the air at the roadblock preventing vehicles from entering the park. Five officials in bright neon yellow vests directed traffic. The only vehicle that was seen going through was a fire truck. Jasper Mayor Richard Ireland, in an open letter to residents, said, \"In the coming days and weeks, we will rally together, support one another and begin the daunting process of recovery.\"\u009d About 20,000 park visitors and the 5,000 residents of the Jasper municipality had to flee on a moment's notice Monday night ahead of two wildfires that cut off road access everywhere but west to British Columbia. A day later they were directed to loop back to Alberta as British Columbia, dealing with its own fires, did not have the capacity to assist. Those without a place to stay have been directed to evacuation centres in Grande Prairie and Calgary. Crews lost the fight to save Jasper Wednesday just after 6 p.m., as waves of orange and red breached the southern outskirts and began devouring homes and livelihoods. Frantic efforts to contain the fires -- including buckets and fire guards and a last-ditch effort to burn a path from the southern fire to the river and highway -- were foiled by high winds. \"That wind gust moved that fire five kilometres in probably less than 30 minutes, with a wall of fire that was about 100 metres high,\"\u009d said Alberta Public Safety Minister Mike Ellis. \"There is little to nothing you can do when you have a wall of flames coming at you like that.\"\u009d \"Nobody anticipated that fire to come so fast, so large and so quickly.\"\u009d Pierre Martel, who oversees fire management with Parks Canada, echoed Ellis. \"There are no tools we have in our toolbox to deal with that,\"\u009d Martel told an online news conference. \"It's just a monster at that point.\"\u009d This report by The Canadian Press was first published July 25, 2024. -- with files from Jeremy Simes in Regina and Fakiha Baig in Hinton", "source": {"uri": "medicinehatnews.com",

The town and the park, which draw more than 2 million tourists a year, were evacuated on Monday, when officials estimated there were up to 10,000 people in the town and a further 15,000 visitors in the park.\n\n\"There is no denying that this is the worst nightmare for any community,\" Alberta premier Danielle Smith told reporters, while choking back tears.\n\n\"We're seeing potentially 30% to 50% structural damage ... that's going to be a significant rebuild,\" she said, adding the fire was still out of control.\n\nParks Canada said there had been a \"significant loss\" of buildings inside the town but added it could not give specific details of the damage, or which areas had been hit and it urged residents not to return.\n\nVideo from the town showed vehicles and entire blocks burned to the ground, including a historic Anglican church.\n\nJasper resident Eva Korduliakova heard the news that her home was burning from thousands of kilometers away Thursday morning, while visiting family in the Czech Republic with her seven-year-old son.\n\n\"I am single mum who became homeless and jobless overnight,\" she wrote in an email. \"Our house is gone. I didn't get a chance to grab any of my belongings.\"\n\nJasper mayor Richard Ireland said the town was beginning to come to terms with \"the devastating impact\" of the fire.\n\n\"Last night's wildfires have simply ravaged our small tight-knit mountain community, the destruction and the loss that so many of our residents are facing simply defies description,\" he told a press conference, his voice breaking.\n\nOne major concern for responders is if the fire damages the Trans Mountain oil pipeline, which can carry 890,000 barrels per day (bpd) of oil from Edmonton to Vancouver.\n\n\"At this time there is no indication of damage to our infrastructure, and the pipelines continue to operate safely,\" pipeline operator Trans Mountain said in a statement.\n\nCN Rail said it suspended rail operations through the town on Wednesday afternoon as the wildfire conditions worsened.\n\nThe federal government and other cities in Alberta are sending emergency crews. In addition, a total of 400 firefighters from Mexico, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand are due to arrive in the coming days.\n\nThere are currently 176 wildfires burning in Alberta, more than 50 of which are out of control. Around 10 of those blazes are close to the border with British Columbia, where there 423 wildfires burning and dozens of evacuation orders and alerts.\n\nThe federal government said in April that high temperatures and tinder dry forests meant this could be a catastrophic year for wildfires in Canada.\n\nThe Jasper fire was caused by a lightning strike on Monday afternoon and fuelled by strong winds, according to Parks Canada.\n\nFlames from the blaze rose 100 meters high (328 feet), and strong wind gusts on Wednesday afternoon pushed the fire 5 kilometers (3 miles) in less than 30 minutes, said Alberta public safety minister Mike Ellis.\n\n\"Any firefighter will tell you there's little to nothing you can do when you have a wall of flames coming at you like that,\" Ellis said.\n\nEnvironment Canada is forecasting 10 mm (0.4 inches) to 20 mm of rain for Thursday, which might help firefighters.\n\nThe Jasper Park Lodge, one of the largest hotels in town, said the fire had reached its grounds. The 400-room residence is run by Fairmont, a group owned by France's Accor.\n\nThe Jasper fire could be one of the most damaging in Alberta since a 2016 conflagration that hit the oil town of Fort McMurray, forcing the evacuation of all 90,000 residents and destroying 10% of all structures in the city.

Everyone else was reminded to get out.\n\n\"If you have not yet evacuated town you must leave now,\" Katie Ellsworth, with Parks Canada, said in a statement posted on Facebook.\n\n\"Our hearts go out to all of the affected community members, their families and their friends, many of which include our local first responders.\"\n\nThe northern fire was spotted five kilometres from Jasper earlier in the day.\n\nThe southern fire had been reported eight kilometres distant from the town, but Ellsworth said strong wind gusts swooping in behind it sent it racing.\n\nEverything that could go wrong did go wrong as fire perimeters changed minute by minute.\n\nEllsworth said bucketing efforts by helicopter failed.\n\nCrews using heavy equipment to build fireguards couldn't complete the work before having to pull back for safety.\n\nWater bombers couldn't help due to dangerous flying conditions.\n\nA last-ditch effort to use controlled burns to reroute the fire to natural barriers like Highway 16 and the Athabasca River failed due to \"unfavourable conditions.\"\n\nThe hope was that up to 20 mm of rain, forecast to begin falling in the area later Wednesday night, would bring some relief.\n\nEllsworth said the decision to relocate all first responders to the town of Hinton, just outside the eastern edge of the park, \"has not been made lightly.\"\n\nShe said, \"Given the intensity of fire behaviour being observed the decision has been made to limit the number of responders exposed to this risk.\"\n\nAlberta Forestry Minister Todd Loewen asked the Canadian Armed Forces for help.\n\n\"We are requesting firefighting resources, aerial support to move wildfire crews and equipment and more,\" Loewen wrote on the social media platform X.\n\nAbout 5,000 people live in Jasper. They, along with about 20,000 park visitors had to flee on a moment's notice Monday night when the fires flared up.\n\nThe order to go went out around 10 p.m. Monday as fires cut off road access to the Jasper townsite from the east and the south, forcing evacuees to drive west into British Columbia in a long, slow midnight cavalcade through swirling smoke, soot and ash.\n\nThe following day, evacuees in B.C. who didn't have a place to stay were directed to make a long, looping U-turn around the fires back to Alberta to evacuation centres in Grande Prairie and Calgary.\n\nB.C., dealing with its own multiple wildfires and evacuees, did not have the capacity to help Alberta, officials said.\n\nAt the Grande Prairie evacuation centre, Addison McNeill recalled literally just arriving in Jasper when she was told to get out.\n\nMcNeill said she had just put her bags down after moving from Edmonton for her new job as a line cook when she got an alert on her phone that she needed to leave immediately.\n\n\"I moved there two hours before the evacuation notice,\" said the 24-year-old in an interview.\n\nMcNeill said went to a nearby hotel, one of two meet-up points for those without transportation. She hopped in a recreational vehicle with others and headed out -- at a snail's pace.\n\n\"Every single person in town was beelining to one exit from about six different routes and so you get bottleneck, backups and congestion,\" she said.\n\nMcNeill said as she sat inside the vehicle, she felt so close to the wildfires that the windows seemed like they were going to shatter from the pressure of the red, hot, smoky air.\n\nShe saw acts of kindness amid the swirling ash: neighbours loaning their cars to those without; people knocking on doors to see if everyone inside was OK.\n\n\"It was far from a panic,\" she said.\n\nJasper National Park, the largest in the Canadian Rockies, is considered a national and international treasure.\n\nThe United Nations designated the parks that make up the Canadian Rockies, including Jasper, a World Heritage Site in 1984 for its striking mountain landscape.\n\nIt has hosted glitz and glitter. In 1953, Hollywood star Marilyn Monroe visited to make the movie \"River of No Return.\" More recently, the TV show \"The Bachelorette\" was filmed there.\n\nJasper is famous for hiking, skiing, kayaking and biking.\n\nIt is also home to dozens of species such as elk, mountain goats, cougars, lynx, black bears and grizzly bears.\n\nUPDATE 6:30 p.m.\n\nParks officials say one of two wildfires bearing down on the Jasper, Alta., townsite has reached the community.\n\nAll first responders have been ordered out of Jasper National Park for their safety and to give fire crews more room to operate.\n\nTwo fires whipped by strong winds are bearing down on the town, from the north and the south.\n\nKatie Ellsworth, with Parks Canada, said the southern one reached the outskirts of the townsite just before 6 p.m.\n\n\"Firefighters remain in town combating multiple structural fires and are working to protect critical infrastructure,\" said Parks Canada on X.\n\nA last-ditch effort to reroute the fire to natural barriers like Highway 16 and the Athabasca River failed.\n\nAbout 5,000 live in Jasper, and they, along with about 20,000 visitors, had to flee at a moment's notice Monday night when the fires flared up.\n\nUPDATE 4:15 p.m.\n\nAbigail Popple, Local Journalism Initiative Reporter / The Rocky Mountain Goat\n\nThe south fire in Jasper National Park has grown over 4,000 hectares since yesterday evening, now totalling at least 10,800 hectares. It is roughly eight kilometres away from the Town of Jasper, according to Incident Commander Katie Ellsworth.\n\nThe north fire, which is about five kilometres away from town, is still about 270 hectares.\n\nRain is forecasted for this evening and into Thursday morning. Ellsworth says commanders anticipate a reduction in fire activity if Jasper does receive precipitation, but gusty conditions mean the fire will likely grow before then.\n\nEllsworth confirmed to media that the town has not been impacted by fire. She added that there is no timeline for re-entry, including for temporary visits to gather items that evacuees left behind.\n\n\"We understand that this is stressful. We do ask for your patience, and we will provide you with a timeline (once) you are able to return to retrieve the items that you may have left behind,\" Ellsworth said.\n\nIn a Facebook post this afternoon, the Municipality of Jasper encouraged evacuees to prepare to stay elsewhere. They advise evacuees to make arrangements with friends or family if possible, or go to reception centres in Edmonton, Calgary, or Grande Prairie. Additionally, free camping for evacuees is available at Buck Lake in the County of Wetaskiwin, and at the Dr. Duncan Murray Recreation Centre Field in the Town of Hinton.\n\nThe Municipality also advises residents and business owners to call their insurance provider as soon as possible, and apply for Employment Insurance using their temporary address.\n\nThe status of structures outside of town - such as the Palisades Centre, Caribou Recovery Centre, and the HI Athabasca Falls Wilderness Hostel - is unknown at this time. Heavy smoke and aggressive fire behavior have made it unsafe for responders to access these structures, according to Ellsworth.\n\n\"In terms of the Palisades Centre, we can confirm that it has been impacted. Because of the fire behavior yesterday, we don't know the extent of those impacts,\" Ellsworth said. \"We are hoping to be able to confirm those impacts as soon as we can, so that we can share that information both to the public and the business owners. But we do ask for your continued patience.\"\n\nFirefighters are taking steps to protect the town's infrastructure in case the southern fire continues to move northward. This includes the installation of high-volume sprinklers on the south side of the Parks Canada compound, and around the southwest perimeter of town from Patricia Place to the entrance of Stone Mountain Village. Sprinklers will also be installed around Pyramid Bench from west to east. Additionally, firefighters are removing combustible material and dry vegetation from town today, Ellsworth added.\n\nEllsworth asks that the public look to Parks Canada, the Municipality of Jasper, and Alberta Wildfire for accurate information on the fire, rather than using other resources like NASA's MODIS and FIRMS satellite imagery.\n\n\"At this time due to heavy, thick smoke conditions in Jasper, we cannot confirm the MODIS or FIRMS hits that you can see if you're looking at the satellite imagery,\" she said. \"These satellites do indicate heat registers, and it's not uncommon after a fairly aggressive burning day when things calm down for that heat to sink back down to the surface and be registered as a fire point.\"\n\nAlert hiccups\n\nJasper Mayor Richard Ireland, who also attended the press conference, thanked Jasper residents and visitors for their cooperation during the evacuation. However, he said he received reports this morning that the alert system used by the municipality did not work as intended.\n\n\"We gave out an emergency alert on our system - we use something called Voyent,\" he told journalists. \"It has come to my attention that some subscribers to that service did not receive the messages that we thought that they had received.\"\n\nIreland added that the Alberta Emergency Alerts system worked as expected.\n\nThe glitch that caused the error has been fixed since the municipality learned of it earlier this morning, according to Ireland.\n\n\"All of these incidents undergo an after-action debrief. The whole system will be reviewed and we will see whether any corrections have to be made to prevent this happening, either in our location or other locations with the same sorts of mass alert systems,\" he said.\n\nHighway 16 partially cleared\n\nAccording to Drive BC, about 350 kilometres of Highway 16 has been cleared between Victoria Street and the B.C.-Alberta border, as of 11:01 a.m. today. There is still limited visibility due to smoke from 16 kilometres east of Tete Jaune to the Alberta border.\n\nHighway 16 eastbound is closed from the Mount Robson Visitor Centre to the Alberta border. The westbound lane is open only for evacuation purposes. Drive BC anticipates an update to Highway 16 at 4:30 p.m. today.\n\nUPDATE 12:25 p.m.\n\nFuelled by whipping winds, fires in Jasper National Park are edging closer from two directions to the historic Rocky Mountain townsite of Jasper.\n\nParks Canada says a wildfire to the north is five kilometres away while another approaching from the south is eight kilometres distant.\n\nNo critical infrastructure in Jasper has been damaged, and crews are scrambling to protect the homes of almost 5,000 residents by bulldozing a fireguard on the southern edge, clearing flammables house-by-house, and installing massive sprinkler systems.\n\nParks Canada official Katie Ellsworth says windy conditions are making things worse, and says the southern blaze has doubled in size to more than 100 square kilometres.\n\nOfficials say they can't accurately update what's happening to infrastructure outside the townsite, such as picnic areas or power lines, because of smoky conditions.\n\nAbout 25,000 people, including residents and visitors, were forced to flee Jasper National Park earlier this week ahead of the fires.\n\nThe Canadian Press\n\nORIGINAL 5:45 a.m.\n\nSome wildfire evacuees who were trapped in traffic for hours while leaving Jasper National Park say they are feeling relieved to have found safety.\n\nAddison McNeill, who is 24, says she felt stressed when she got an alert on Monday night to evacuate Jasper about two hours after she moved to the alpine town from Edmonton.\n\nWhen she got on the road, she says she saw many of Jasper's 4,700 residents exiting the town calmly along with visitors despite being trapped in gridlock and hot, smoky air for hours.\n\nEvacuees were initially ordered to go to British Columbia but were directed on Tuesday to make a wide U-turn as that province was dealing with its own wildfires.\n\nSince then, reception centres have been set up north of Jasper in Grande Prairie as well as in Calgary and Edmonton, where evacuees are being helped with accommodations.\n\nJasper resident Leanne Maeva Joyeuse says she feels relieved to have made it to Grande Prairie after having been on the road for nearly 20 hours but she is worried about how the wildfires will affect her town.\n\nThe Canadian Press", "source": {"uri": "castanet.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Castanet"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

All first responders have been ordered out of Jasper National Park for their safety and to give fire crews more room to operate.

Residents and visitors streamed out by the thousands late Monday and Tuesday, and officials said Wednesday the evacuation of Jasper was complete.\n\nEllsworth said park officials expected the evacuation of the park's backcountry areas to be completed later Wednesday. Reservations are required for the park, so authorities have an idea of where people are, though Ellsworth said she wasn't immediately sure how many people were left.\n\nImages shared on social media showed long lines of vehicles, their headlights glowing, inching through swirling tendrils of smoke.\n\nAddison McNeill, 24, said she had just moved to Jasper from the Alberta capital of Edmonton when she got the stressful alert Monday night to evacuate. Thousands of Jasper's 4,700 full-time residents left in vehicles but were trapped in gridlock and hot, smoky air for hours.\n\nA reception centre is readied for wildfire evacuees forced from Jasper National Park in Calgary, Alta., Tuesday, July 23, 2024.

Another fire roaring up from the south forced the closure of the north-south Icefields Parkway. That left one route open, going west to British Columbia.\n\nBut Alberta fire officials said British Columbia had its hands full with its own evacuations. Alberta Public Safety Minister Mike Ellis said reception centers were instead being set up in Grande Prairie and Calgary in Alberta, requiring long detours through British Columbia by the drivers fleeing Jasper.\n\nAlberta has been baking under scorching temperatures that have already forced another 7,500 people out of remote communities. About 170 wildfires were burning across the province.\n\nEllsworth said the north fire, spanning about 272 hectares, is about 5 kilometers (3 miles) from Jasper. She said the south fire, about 10,800 hectares, is about 8 kilometers (about 5 miles) from the town.\n\nRain was expected into Thursday but not enough to control the fires, with no word yet on when people could return, Ellsworth said.\n\nJasper resident Leanne Maeva Joyeuse was relieved but exhausted after reaching the Grand Prairie evacuation center following 20 hours on the road with her grandmother, parents and younger brother.\n\n\"We\u00b4re just waiting to go back home and see how many days we\u00b4re going to be stuck here,\" Joyeuse said.\n\nA record number of wildfires in 2023 forced more than 235,000 people across Canada to evacuate and sent thick smoke into parts of the U.S., leading to hazy skies and health advisories in multiple U.S. cities.\n\nThis photo provided by Carolyn Campbell shows cars clogging the highway as people evacuate because of wildfires early Tuesday, July 23, 2024, in Jasper, Alberta.

They went house to house in Jasper clearing flammables. Massive sprinklers were being set up.\n\nParks Canada official Katie Ellsworth said the southern blaze had doubled in size to more than 100 square kilometres.\n\n\"All our efforts are focused on controlling further fire spread and protecting our community,\" Ellsworth told reporters.\n\n\"We expect today that we're going to have strong winds continuing, and we expect that this will increase our fire behaviour and fire growth on both fires on all flanks.\"\n\nOfficials could not accurately update what was happening to infrastructure outside the townsite along the Icefields Parkway and Highway 16, such as picnic areas or power lines, because of smoky conditions.\n\nWith fire perimeters changing minute-by-minute, Ellsworth said the flames were about 2.5 kilometres from the Valley of the Five Lakes, a popular hiking spot.\n\nThe fires cut off road access to the Jasper townsite from the east and the south on Monday night, forcing evacuees to drive west into British Columbia in a long, slow midnight cavalcade through swirling smoke, soot and ash.\n\nEllsworth has said that it only took two hours between the first reports of fires starting in the area on Monday until they had become huge enough to spark the need for the overnight evacuation.\n\nThe following day, evacuees in B.C. who didn't have a place to stay were directed to make a long, looping U-turn around the fires back to Alberta to evacuation centres in Grande Prairie and Calgary.\n\nB.C., dealing with its own multiple wildfires and evacuees, did not have the capacity to help Alberta, officials said.\n\nAt the Grande Prairie evacuation centre, Addison McNeill recalled literally just arriving in Jasper when she was told to get out.\n\nMcNeill said she had just put her bags down after moving from Edmonton for her new job as a line cook when she got an alert on her phone that she needed to leave immediately.\n\n\"I moved there two hours before the evacuation notice,\" said the 24-year-old in an interview.\n\nMcNeill said went to a nearby hotel, one of two meet-up points for those without transportation. She hopped in a recreational vehicle with others and headed out -- at a snail's pace.\n\n\"Every single person in town was beelining to one exit from about six different routes and so you get bottleneck, backups and congestion,\" she said.\n\nMcNeill said as she sat inside the vehicle, she felt so close to the wildfires that the windows seemed like they were going to shatter from the pressure of the red, hot, smoky air.\n\nShe saw acts of kindness amid the swirling ash: neighbours loaning their cars to those without; people knocking on doors to see if everyone inside was OK.\n\n\"It was far from a panic,\" she said.\n\nMcNeill didn't reach Grand Prairie until Tuesday evening.\n\nThe centre has helped 50 evacuees since Monday night and 20 of them were staying in hotels, said Dan Lemieux, with the City of Grande Prairie.\n\n\"In addition to the evacuees from Jasper, we have several evacuees here from the First Nations that are further north in Alberta that have been evacuated,\" he said.\n\nJasper resident Leanne Maeva Joyeuse said she felt relieved to have made it to Grande Prairie after 20 hours on the road with her grandmother, parents and younger brother.\n\nShe said she was anxious about how the wildfires would affect her town, but laughed as she recalled that her grandmother had just arrived from Mauritius to visit a few days before the wildfires began.\n\nShe recalled turning to her grandmother as they fled to say, \"Welcome to Alberta.\"\n\nREAD ALSO: Town of Jasper, national park under evacuation alert due to wildfire", "source":

They went house to house in Jasper clearing flammables. Massive sprinklers were being set up.\n\nParks Canada official Katie Ellsworth said the southern blaze had doubled in size to more than 100 square kilometres.\n\n\"All our efforts are focused on controlling further fire spread and protecting our community,\" Ellsworth told reporters.\n\n\"We expect today that we're going to have strong winds continuing, and we expect that this will increase our fire behaviour and fire growth on both fires on all flanks.\"\n\nOfficials could not accurately update what was happening to infrastructure outside the townsite along the Icefields Parkway and Highway 16, such as picnic areas or power lines, because of smoky conditions.\n\nWith fire perimeters changing minute-by-minute, Ellsworth said the flames were about 2.5 kilometres from the Valley of the Five Lakes, a popular hiking spot.\n\nThe fires cut off road access to the Jasper townsite from the east and the south on Monday night, forcing evacuees to drive west into British Columbia in a long, slow midnight cavalcade through swirling smoke, soot and ash.\n\nEllsworth has said that it only took two hours between the first reports of fires starting in the area on Monday until they had become huge enough to spark the need for the overnight evacuation.\n\nThe following day, evacuees in B.C. who didn't have a place to stay were directed to make a long, looping U-turn around the fires back to Alberta to evacuation centres in Grande Prairie and Calgary.\n\nB.C., dealing with its own multiple wildfires and evacuees, did not have the capacity to help Alberta, officials said.\n\nAt the Grande Prairie evacuation centre, Addison McNeill recalled literally just arriving in Jasper when she was told to get out.\n\nMcNeill said she had just put her bags down after moving from Edmonton for her new job as a line cook when she got an alert on her phone that she needed to leave immediately.\n\n\"I moved there two hours before the evacuation notice,\" said the 24-year-old in an interview.\n\nMcNeill said went to a nearby hotel, one of two meet-up points for those without transportation. She hopped in a recreational vehicle with others and headed out -- at a snail's pace.\n\n\"Every single person in town was beelining to one exit from about six different routes and so you get bottleneck, backups and congestion,\" she said.\n\nMcNeill said as she sat inside the vehicle, she felt so close to the wildfires that the windows seemed like they were going to shatter from the pressure of the red, hot, smoky air.\n\nShe saw acts of kindness amid the swirling ash: neighbours loaning their cars to those without; people knocking on doors to see if everyone inside was OK.\n\n\"It was far from a panic,\" she said.\n\nMcNeill didn't reach Grand Prairie until Tuesday evening.\n\nThe centre has helped 50 evacuees since Monday night and 20 of them were staying in hotels, said Dan Lemieux, with the City of Grande Prairie.\n\n\"In addition to the evacuees from Jasper, we have several evacuees here from the First Nations that are further north in Alberta that have been evacuated,\" he said.\n\nJasper resident Leanne Maeva Joyeuse said she felt relieved to have made it to Grande Prairie after 20 hours on the road with her grandmother, parents and younger brother.\n\nShe said she was anxious about how the wildfires would affect her town, but laughed as she recalled that her grandmother had just arrived from Mauritius to visit a few days before the wildfires began.\n\nShe recalled turning to her grandmother as they fled to say, \"Welcome to Alberta.\"", "source": {"uri": "edmonton.ctvnews.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "CTV Newsnet

Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nPreliminary reports indicate a third and possibly up to half the structures in the town of Jasper have been destroyed in a wildfire, Alberta Premier Danielle Smith said in an update on Thursday afternoon.\n\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau posted on X Thursday afternoon that more than 400 firefighters from Australia, New Zealand, Mexico and South Africa are en route to Alberta to help quell the flames. The additional support is expected to arrive this weekend.\n\nHe later convened the Incident Response Group -- a committee of ministers and senior government officials who co-ordinate the federal government's response in emergency situations -- with Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland, Emergency Preparedness Minister Harjit Sajjan, Treasury Board President Anita Anand, Defence Minister Bill Blair, Public Safety Minister Dominic LeBlanc, and Citizens' Services Minister Terry Beech.\n\nFollowing the meeting, Sajjan, who travelled to Edmonton Thursday, held a press conference with his Alberta counterpart Mike Ellis, who said no number of firefighters could have tamed the growing walls of flame that were travelling at rapid speeds.\n\nIn a show of cross-jurisdictional unity, Ellis commended Sajjan and Trudeau for their responsiveness, saying the prime minister had been \"engaged\" and ensured all fires in the province -- not just Jasper -- received the necessary resources. The federal government has already approved the Alberta government's request for military aid.\n\nAlberta government to provide daily updates on Jasper fire\n\n\"The feelings of loss and fear and loneliness must be overwhelming,\" Smith said, holding back tears, at a press conference in Edmonton.\n\n\"We share the sense of loss with all of those who live in the town, who care for it, and who have helped build it.\"\n\nStrong winds are expected to raise the fire risk in the northeast and south of the province, where danger from the wildfires is still \"extreme,\" Alberta Wildfire information unit manager Christie Tucker said.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nAlberta currently has 176 active wildfires, with 54 classified as \"out of control,\" Tucker said.\n\nCanada In photos: Tragic scenes from Jasper unfold as wildfire leaves trail of destruction\n\nThe fire reached Jasper on Wednesday evening and has begun ravaging the town, with a third of it destroyed.\n\nSmith said her government will move to providing daily updates with the province's minister of forestry and parks and its minister of public safety.\n\n\"Alberta stands ready to assist in every way that we can,\" Smith said, adding that she had asked LeBlanc to establish a \"unified command structure\" to co-ordinate the response to the wildfire.\n\n\"Alberta's government will provide the support needed to families and communities to recover and to rebuild stronger than ever, so that future generations can continue to experience this one-of-a-kind community.\"\n\nDamage to Jasper National Park still unknown\n\nThe damage to homes and infrastructure from the wildfires is still being evaluated, Jasper National Parks officials said in a statement posted to X.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"While we understand people are desperate to know about the status of our community, homes, work places, businesses, and cherished places we will need some time to stabilize this incident as we access and assess structures,\" officials wrote, adding that no injuries have been reported as a result of the Jasper wildfire.\n\nThe park received a small amount of rain overnight on Wednesday, but it was \"not enough to have made a meaningful impact to the overall wildfire situation, which remains out of control.\"\n\nHome phone and mobility services in the area were also impacted by the fires, Telus Corp. confirmed to The Canadian Press on Thursday. Priority was being given to restoring voice calls, including those to emergency services.\n\nCanadian National Railway Co., whose main line runs through Jasper, suspended its operations in the area on Wednesday.\n\nWildfire in Jasper prompts evacuations\n\nAbout 25,000 people have been forced to flee from Jasper, Alta. as wildfires have torn through the iconic town known for its hiking, skiing, kayaking and biking.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"I write to you today with profound sorrow as we begin to come to terms with the devastating impact of last night's wildfire that has ravaged our beloved community,\" Jasper Mayor Richard Ireland wrote in a post to Facebook on Thursday. \"The destruction and loss that many of you are facing and feeling is beyond description and comprehension; my deepest sympathies go out to each of you.\"\n\n\"This experience is tremendously traumatic for each of us and for the community. I encourage you to reach out to your neighbours, colleagues and friends: share your grief; share your pain; stay connected,\" he added. \"Offer a helping hand, a listening ear, a supportive word where you can, and know that we are all in this together.\"\n\nEveryone in Jasper National Park, including tourists, hikers and residents, were ordered to leave the area late Monday evening as wildfires overtook escape routes to the east and south. Pictures posted to social media showed long, snaking lines of cars and trucks heading westward to B.C.\n\nEvacuees were then directed to make a U-turn as B.C. grapples with wildfires and evacuations of its own.\n\n\"(B.C.) had no capacity to house Albertans,\" Stephen Lacroix, managing director of the Alberta Emergency Management Agency, said on Tuesday.\n\nAt 7:10 p.m. (MT) on Wednesday evening, portions of the southern fire in Jasper reached the townsite, according to Jasper National Park's updates. Nearly an hour later, air quality had deteriorated to the point that wildland firefighters and others \"without self-contained breathing apparatuses\" had to leave Jasper for the nearby town of Hinton.\n\nVideos posted to social media showed charred streets and homes, covered in black soot and swirling smoke.\n\nWith files from The Canadian Press.", "source": {"uri": "thestar.com",

THE CANADIAN PRESS/HO, Facebook, Jasper National Park *MANDATORY CREDIT*JASPER, ALTA. - Alberta Premier Danielle Smith fought back tears Thursday as she sought to console Jasper residents coming to terms with a community devastated by wildfire. \"The feelings of loss and fear and loneliness must be overwhelming,\"\u009d Smith said at a fire update in Edmonton. \"We share the sense of loss with all of those who live in the town, who care for it, and who have helped build it.\"\u009d Specifics on what has been destroyed in the Rocky Mountain resort town of 5,000 remained sketchy. Jasper Park officials, in a statement, said the firefighting situation remains dynamic. \"Due to the ongoing fire conditions and our focus on the response effort, it is impossible to share information about specific locations and the extent of damage at this time,\"\u009d said the statement. \"The accuracy of this information is critical because it has a direct impact on members of the community. We will share more information as soon as we are able to ensure its accuracy.\"\u009d Photos shared on social media Wednesday night depicted Jasper structures wrapped in sheets of flame. A video Thursday morning showed rain-slicked streets, cloudy skies and a wide swath of blackened, charred homes and buildings razed to their foundations. \"The images we're seeing out of Jasper are devastating,\"\u009d said Forestry Minister Todd Loewen. The province has asked for help from the Canadian Armed Forces, and the federal government has said aid is on the way. Calgary, along with fire crews from Edmonton and Sherwood Park, said they were sending resources to the fire scene. The staging area was the town of Hinton, on the eastern outskirts of Jasper National Park. In Hinton Thursday morning, rain fell and wood smoke hung in the air at the roadblock preventing vehicles from entering the park. Five officials in bright neon yellow vests directed traffic. The only vehicle that was seen going through was a fire truck. Jasper Mayor Richard Ireland, in an open letter to residents, urged them to stay strong. \"I write to you today with profound sorrow as we begin to come to terms with the devastating impact of last night's wildfire that has ravaged our beloved community,\"\u009d Ireland wrote. \"The destruction and loss that many of you are facing and feeling is beyond description and comprehension. \"Your resilience and strength have always been the backbone of our community. In the coming days and weeks, we will rally together, support one another, and begin the daunting process of recovery.\"\u009d About 25,000 people, including about 5,000 residents in the Jasper townsite, were forced to flee west at a moment's notice late Monday night as twin wildfires from the south and north roared up and cut off access to the east and south. A day later they were directed to loop back to Alberta as British Columbia, dealing with its own fires, did not have the capacity to assist. On Wednesday, efforts to contain the fires -- include buckets and fire guards and a last-ditch effort to burn a path from the southern fire to the river and highway -- were foiled by raging, gusting winds. Around 6 p.m. Wednesday, the fire roared in and began torching structures. Jasper, a postcard-perfect mountain town, is famous for hiking, skiing, kayaking and biking. It is also home to dozens of species such as elk, mountain goats, cougars, lynx, black bears and grizzly bears. The United Nations designated the parks that make up the Canadian Rockies, including Jasper, a World Heritage Site in 1984.

But it says crews continue to battle a swift and dynamic fire in Jasper National Park.\n\n\"Jasper National Park received a small amount of rain overnight,\" said the statement.\n\n\"While the rain helped reduce fire activity slightly, it is not enough to have made a meaningful impact to the overall wildfire situation, which remains out of control.\"\n\nImages surfacing on social media depicted blocks of homes and businesses burned to charred foundations and vehicles torched to the hubcaps.\n\nCalgary, along with fire crews from Edmonton and Sherwood Park dispatched resources to the fire scene.\n\nThe province has asked for help from the Canadian Armed Forces, and the federal government has said aid is on the way.\n\nThe staging area was the town of Hinton, on the eastern outskirts of Jasper National Park.\n\nIn Hinton Thursday rain fell and wood smoke hung in the air at the roadblock preventing vehicles from entering the park. Five officials in bright neon yellow vests directed traffic. The only vehicle that was seen going through was a fire truck.\n\nJasper Mayor Richard Ireland, in an open letter to residents, said, \"In the coming days and weeks, we will rally together, support one another and begin the daunting process of recovery.\"\n\nAbout 20,000 park visitors and the 5,000 residents of the Jasper municipality had to flee on a moment's notice Monday night ahead of two wildfires that cut off road access everywhere but west to British Columbia.\n\nA day later they were directed to loop back to Alberta as British Columbia, dealing with its own fires, did not have the capacity to assist.\n\nThose without a place to stay have been directed to evacuation centres in Grande Prairie and Calgary.\n\nCrews lost the fight to save Jasper Wednesday just after 6 p.m., as waves of orange and red breached the southern outskirts and began devouring homes and livelihoods.\n\nFrantic efforts to contain the fires -- including buckets and fire guards and a last-ditch effort to burn a path from the southern fire to the river and highway -- were foiled by high winds.\n\n\"That wind gust moved that fire five kilometres in probably less than 30 minutes, with a wall of fire that was about 100 metres high,\" said Alberta Public Safety Minister Mike Ellis.\n\n\"There is little to nothing you can do when you have a wall of flames coming at you like that.\"\n\n\"Nobody anticipated that fire to come so fast, so large and so quickly.\"\n\nPierre Martel, who oversees fire management with Parks Canada, echoed Ellis.\n\n\"There are no tools we have in our toolbox to deal with that,\" Martel told an online news conference.\n\n\"It's just a monster at that point.\"\n\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published July 25, 2024.", "source": {"uri": "cp24.com",

It is also home to dozens of species such as elk, mountain goats, cougars, lynx, black bears and grizzly bears. The United Nations designated the parks that make up the Canadian Rockies, including Jasper, a World Heritage Site in 1984.\n\nPhotos on social media show lodges and other buildings wrapped in sheets of orange flame.\n\n\"Structural firefighters remain in town and are working to save as many structures as possible,\" Parks Canada said in a statement.\n\nMeanwhile, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced on social media that Ottawa has approved Alberta's request for federal assistance. Alberta Forestry Minister Todd Loewen has asked for help from the Canadian military.\n\n\"We are requesting firefighting resources, aerial support to move wildfire crews and equipment and more,\" Loewen wrote on the social media platform X.\n\nEarlier in the day, all first responders were ordered out of Jasper National Park for their safety and to give fire crews more room to operate.\n\nThe fires are burning on the north and south sides of the town, which is home to 5,000 people. The residents have left, along with 20,000 park visitors.\n\nThe order to leave was issued around 10 p.m. Monday as fires cut off road access to Jasper. Residents and visitors fled west into British Columbia in a long, slow midnight procession through swirling smoke and ash.\n\nThe following day, evacuees in B.C. who didn't have a place to stay were directed to make the long drive around the fires back to Alberta to evacuation centres in Grande Prairie and Calgary.\n\nThe northern fire was spotted five kilometres from Jasper earlier Wednesday. The southern fire was farther away, but Parks Canada says strong winds sent it racing toward the town.\n\nThat forced crews using heavy equipment to pull back for safety. Water bombers were grounded due to dangerous flying conditions.\n\nAt the Grande Prairie evacuation centre, Addison McNeill recalled arriving in Jasper from Edmonton only to be told to get out.\n\n\"I moved there two hours before the evacuation notice,\" the 24-year-old said in an interview.\n\nMcNeill said she went to a nearby hotel, one of two meet-up points for those without transportation. She hopped in a recreational vehicle with others and headed out -- at a snail's pace.\n\n\"Every single person in town was beelining to one exit from about six different routes and so you get bottleneck, backups and congestion,\" she said.\n\nMcNeill said as she sat inside the vehicle, she felt so close to the wildfires that the windows seemed like they were going to shatter from the pressure of the hot, smoky air.\n\nShe saw acts of kindness amid the swirling ash: neighbours loaning their cars to those without; people knocking on doors to see if everyone inside was OK.\n\n\"It was far from a panic,\" she said.", "source": {"uri": "cheknews.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "CHEK"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jasper_National_Park",

A 270-hectare fire five kilometres north of the mountain town is also still classified as out-of-control, but has not grown since Tuesday.\n\n\u00d7\n\nAlready a Subscriber? Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nA perfect storm of a lightning outbreak Monday night that is believed to have ignited the fires, exceptional heat and dryness, and high winds led to what wildfire officials are calling \"aggressive, blow-up fire behaviour.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"We did see some aggressive fire behaviour during the day [Tuesday] and that fire behaviour did continue throughout the night,\" said Katie Ellsworth, a fire management officer with the Jasper field unit.\n\nAbout 260 firefighters, two water tankers, one off-road water supply, 13 fire trucks and nine aircraft have kept fires from touching the townsite but Parks Canada has confirmed damage to infrastructure along the Icefield Parkway, otherwise known as Highway 93.\n\nExtent of the damage is still being assessed as heavy smoke clears.\n\n\"Once we are able to access the area safely, either from the air or from the ground, we will provide further information on structural loss once those impact assessments are complete,\" said Ellsworth.\n\n\"We can confirm that there is infrastructure down there that consists of Parks Canada facilities, campgrounds, day-use areas, washroom facilities, picnic areas, as well as power lines. But again, we can't confirm at this time what's been impinged or impacted and the level or extent of those impacts.\"\n\nParks Canada said so far 245 people in the backcountry have been flown out by helicopter and evacuations are progressing. Parks also confirmed in a Tuesday update that everyone had been evacuated from the Jasper townsite, however, there are still some remaining who are not responding to wildfires.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nJasper Mayor Ken Ireland said those people include a well-known local caterer - Glenda the Great Catering Ltd. - helping to feed first responders, as well as municipal staff dealing with infrastructure needs.\n\n\"I can't give you an entire list, but you get the picture; it's a select, small number and they are doing the work that needs to be done to support the first responders and others who have remained in the community for essential work,\" he said.\n\nThe wildfire north of the townsite is located between the transfer station and Jasper airstrip, and is burning on both sides of Highway 16. The south wildfire is located near Kerkeslin Campground and follows Highway 93 north to Horseshoe Lake.\n\n\"This wildfire crosses Highway 93 a few kilometres south of Wabasso Campground and the northeast extent of this wildfire is near Wabasso Lake,\" said Ellsworth, who noted Parks is working hard to keep fires from reaching the townsite.\n\nThe federal agency currently has its incident management team fighting the fires, with support from Alberta Wildfire and the Alberta Emergency Management Agency.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nFire crews are removing flammable vegetation within the boundary of the Jasper community, with officials also removing and cleaning properties of combustibles such as propane tanks.\n\nA high-volume 12-inch sprinkler system is also being deployed at the southern part of the townsite. Parks is assessing where to create fireguards using heavy equipment.\n\n\"Fire specialists are currently planning those lines out. I anticipate those plans will be ready by the end of this afternoon, so that we can start putting in those containment features to the southern flank or wherever they get planned - most likely in the southern portion of the community,\" said Ellsworth.\n\n\"We are also planning other sprinkler lines up towards the western flank of our community, near the Pyramid Bench area. That's going to extend from west to east to protect the properties and the infrastructure up there.\"\n\nCritical infrastructure, including water and wasterwater facilities, backup generators, the 911 dispatch centre, as well as locations for the Parks Canada's incident command staff are already protected with sprinkler systems.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nParks is also working with CN Rail to patrol tracks north of the townsite with specialized water traincars, extinguishing spot fires and cooling down areas along the tracks so the company can continue rail operations.\n\n\"This is a dynamic and evolving situation. Things are changing minute-to-minute,\" said Ellsworth.\n\nParks Canada said its evacuation team, which has one to two helicopters at its disposal, will continue to evacuate backcountry visitors throughout the day Wednesday (July 24).\n\nEllsworth could not confirm how many registered backcountry users were still in the national park, but said that information is known to the evacuation team. She noted rescuers are now directing attention to lower priority areas such as the Brazeau, and north and south boundary trails, which are lower priority due to distance from the active wildfire area.\n\nAs the situation progresses, those remaining in the townsite not responding to the wildfires will also continue to be kept informed of fire danger and encouraged to evacuate if risk to safety increases.\n\nThe Municipality of Jasper said an after-action review of how evacuations were handled will also take place once there is capacity. It was reported that some who were subscribed to the alert system used - Voyent Alert - did not receive notification to evacuate.\n\nThere was also mixed messaging Monday (July 22), at the time of the evacuation alert, around 10 p.m., about how soon the fire was expected to reach the Jasper townsite.\n\nIt was first reported via an Alberta Emergency Alert that fire would encroach on the town within five hours. This was corrected about 45 minutes later to state residents had five hours to evacuate.\n\nIreland said it is not yet known how the miscommunication happened.\n\n\"The short answer is, we don't yet know how that error occurred. We do know that, as soon as it was identified, it was corrected,\" he said.\n\n\"For a mistake of that nature, although in the long run, it may have increased levels of anxiety of people, it did not negatively impact the evacuation of the town.\"\n\nParks Canada wildfire officials noted this is one of the largest wildfire events in Jasper National Park's recorded history at over 10,000 hectares burned, so far. The Chetamon wildfire of 2022 burned about 6,000 hectares.", "source": {"uri": "thepeterboroughexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "thepeterboroughexaminer.com"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The town and the park, which draw more than 2 million tourists a year, were evacuated on Monday, when officials estimated there were 15,000 visitors in the park.\n\n\"There is no denying that this is the worst nightmare for any community,\" Alberta premier Danielle Smith told reporters, saying the fire was still out of control.\n\n\"We're seeing potentially 30% to 50% structural damage ... that's going to be a significant rebuild.\"\n\nParks Canada said there had been a \"significant loss\" of buildings inside the town but added it could not give specific details of the damage or which areas had been hit.\n\nVideo from the town showed entire blocks had burned to the ground, including a church.\n\nJasper mayor Richard Ireland said the town was beginning to come to terms with \"the devastating impact\" of a fire that had ravaged the community.\n\n\"The destruction and loss that many of you are facing and feeling is beyond description and comprehension,\" he said in a letter to residents.\n\nOne major concern for responders is if the fire reaches the Trans Mountain oil pipeline, which can carry 890,000 barrels per day (bpd) of oil from Edmonton to Vancouver.\n\n\"At this time there is no indication of damage to our infrastructure, and the pipelines continue to operate safely,\" pipeline operator Trans Mountain said in a statement.\n\nThe federal government and other cities in Alberta are sending emergency crews. In addition, a total of 400 firefighters from Mexico, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand are due to arrive in the coming days.\n\n'END OF AN ERA'\n\nThere are currently 176 wildfires burning in Alberta, more than 50 of which are out of control. Around 10 of those blazes are close to the border with British Columbia, where dozens of fires are also out of control.\n\n\"Many of the wildfires we're seeing at this time of year are lightning caused and we unfortunately can't control the weather,\" said Alberta forestry minister Todd Loewen.\n\nThe federal government said in April that high temperatures and tinder dry forests meant this could be one of the worst years ever for fires in Canada.\n\nOfficials said that at one point on Wednesday the flames had reached a height of 400 feet and were moving at 15 meters (50 feet) a minute.\n\nAshley Kliewer, co-owner of a restaurant in the middle of Jasper, told the Canadian Broadcasting crop she was devastated.\n\n\"I don't think anyone will be returning to Jasper any time soon and life is not going to be anywhere near what it was - it really is the end of an era,\" she said.\n\nEnvironment Canada is forecasting 10 mm (0.4 inches) to 20 mm of rain for Thursday, which might help firefighters.\n\nThe Jasper Park Lodge, one of the largest hotels in town, said the fire had reached its grounds. The 400-room residence is run by Fairmont, a group owned by France's Accor.\n\nThe Jasper fire could be one of the most damaging in Alberta since a 2016 conflagration that hit the oil town of Fort McMurray, forcing the evacuation of all 90,000 residents. The blaze destroyed 10% of all structures in the city and shut in more than a million barrels per day of oil output.\n\nFort McMurray is forecast to receive up to 65 mm of rain in the next day,

The famous Rockies resort town of Jasper has about 5,000 residents, but the park had almost 2.5 million visitors last year.\n\nHundreds of firefighters are flying in to help with the efforts, including 100 firefighters from Jalisco, Mexico, 200 from South Africa and 100 from Australia and New Zealand.\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau turned to social media to thank first responders for their response to the wildfires.\n\n\"As the heartbreaking images from Jasper emerge, I want to thank the brave first responders who are in Alberta right now, fighting to save every home and every community they can,\" he posted.\n\nPierre Martel, director for the national fire management programme at Parks Canada, said the fire was started by a lightning storm and escalated on Wednesday, fanned by powerful wind gusts.\n\n\"It [was] just a monster at that point,\" Mr Martel said. \"There are no tools we have in our tool box to deal with it\"\n\nThe fire reached 100m (328ft) high, covering \"an inordinate amount of space in a very little amount of time,\" one official said.\n\nMike Ellis, Alberta's minister for public safety, said the fire was 5km (3 miles) outside of Jasper when it was pushed by a powerful wind gust to the town in \"less than 30 minutes\".\n\n\"Any firefighter will tell you there is little to nothing you can do when you have a wall of flames coming at you like that,\" he said.\n\n\"Nobody anticipated that fire to come so fast, so large and so quickly.\"\n\nBBC journalist Wendy Hurrell was in Jasper National park with her husband and daughter when the fires began to burn on Monday.\n\nShe drove through the night in a rush to leave town.\n\n\"The storm was ferocious - the skies went dark red and there were whipping winds, fierce rain and lightning,\" she said.\n\n\"We are some of the last travellers to see Jasper in its full beauty - it will be a very long time before it will recover. It's utterly devastating for them all and my heart is breaking.\"\n\nEnvironment Canada said there might soon be a reprieve from the hot and dry weather, which allowed the fire to grow, as 1cm to 2cm (0.4in to 0.8in) of rain is expected on Thursday.\n\nThis marks another year of difficult fire conditions for the province. Last year, some 2.2 million hectares burned in Alberta between 1 March and 31 October.\n\nThe area burned during those wildfires was record breaking, officials said.\n\nOutside Alberta, fires are burning in California and Utah.\n\nScientists have longed pointed to human-led climate change as the cause of worsening natural disasters including wildfires.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com",

A postcard-perfect mountain town, Jasper is famous for hiking, skiing, kayaking and biking. It is also home to dozens of species such as elk, mountain goat, puma, lynx, black bear and grizzly bear.\n\nWe share the sense of loss with everyone who lives in the city, Smith told a news conference in Edmonton, Alberta, as she pledged her government's support for the community to rebuild.\n\nJasper and neighboring Jasper National Park were threatened by fires from both the north and south, and the towns of 5,000 full-time residents -- along with 20,000 visitors -- were evacuated on short notice late Monday and Tuesday when the fires lit up.\n\nOne of the fires spread to the south end of the community Wednesday evening as firefighters tried to contain the damage.\n\nAlberta Public Safety Minister Mike Ellis said a wind carried the fire about 5 kilometers (about 3 miles) in perhaps less than 30 minutes toward the city with a wall of fire he estimated to be 100 meters high.\n\nPeople have to imagine what those fire people were experiencing at that time. Any firefighter will tell you there's little or nothing you can do when a wall of fire like that is coming your way, Ellis said. No one expected the fire to come so fast, so big.\n\nPierre Martel, director of fire management at Parks Canada, said lightning, winds and drought caused the fire to grow rapidly on Monday and that flames were above the treetops when he entered the city on Wednesday.\n\nIt's just a monster at that point. There are no tools we have in our toolbox to deal with that at that point. You get out of the way, you pull over, he said.\n\nParks Canada said in a post on X that there were no reported injuries, adding that \"Approximately 25,000 people were safely evacuated from the City of Jasper and Jasper National Park. All residents, visitors and responders are safe.\"\n\nPark officials said efforts to fight the fire were continuing and that it was too early to give details of the damage. They asked for patience and said the fire remains out of control despite a small amount of rain that fell overnight.\n\nAnnelies Lagger, who has owned and lived in the Austrian Haven B&B for 30 years, said she is waiting to hear if it has been destroyed, but is not optimistic because all the nearby houses are gone. She said she ran away with her 13 cats and dog.\n\nI have no idea where to go now. Heaven or hell. It was my life. You can imagine how much work it was, she said. I think I'm in shock.\"\n\nShe said that relatives, including her daughter and son-in-law, had their houses destroyed. It was the heat that dried everything. And now the city is gone, she said.\n\nLagger had taken up with a kind stranger in Valemount, British Columbia, but said she will eventually have to find new homes for her family members and my pets.\n\nI am a very tough woman. Whatever happens, I start again even though I am 82 years old, she said.\n\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau said his administration has approved Alberta's request for federal assistance, including military resources.\n\nJasper National Park is considered a national treasure. The United Nations designated the parks that make up the Canadian Rockies, including Jasper, a World Heritage Site in 1984 for its magnificent mountain scenery.\n\nAlberta has been baking under scorching temperatures that have already forced another 7,500 people to flee remote communities. About 176 fires are burning across the province, including 54 that are burning out of control.\n\nAlberta Forests and Parks Minister Todd Loewen said many of the fires were caused by lightning, and Alberta Fire spokeswoman Christie Tucker said firefighters expect winds to increase the danger.\n\nTucker said hundreds of firefighters from Australia, Mexico, New Zealand and South Africa are arriving to help fight fires across the province.\n\nA record number of wildfires in 2023 forced more than 235,000 people across Canada to evacuate and sent thick smoke into parts of the US, leading to hazy skies and health advisories in numerous US cities.", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Five officials in bright neon yellow vests directed traffic.

Everyone else was reminded to get out.\n\n\"If you have not yet evacuated town you must leave now,\" Katie Ellsworth, with Parks Canada, said in a statement posted on Facebook.\n\n\"Our hearts go out to all of the affected community members, their families and their friends, many of which include our local first responders.\"\n\nThe northern fire was spotted five kilometres from Jasper earlier in the day.\n\nThe southern fire had been reported eight kilometres distant from the town, but Ellsworth said strong wind gusts swooping in behind it sent it racing.\n\nEverything that could go wrong did go wrong as fire perimeters changed minute by minute.\n\nEllsworth said bucketing efforts by helicopter failed.\n\nCrews using heavy equipment to build fireguards couldn't complete the work before having to pull back for safety.\n\nWater bombers couldn't help due to dangerous flying conditions.\n\nA last-ditch effort to use controlled burns to reroute the fire to natural barriers like Highway 16 and the Athabasca River failed due to \"unfavourable conditions.\"\n\nThe hope was that up to 20 mm of rain, forecast to begin falling in the area later Wednesday night, would bring some relief.\n\nEllsworth said the decision to relocate all first responders to the town of Hinton, just outside the eastern edge of the park, \"has not been made lightly.\"\n\nShe said, \"Given the intensity of fire behaviour being observed the decision has been made to limit the number of responders exposed to this risk.\"\n\nAlberta Forestry Minister Todd Loewen asked the Canadian Armed Forces for help.\n\n\"We are requesting firefighting resources, aerial support to move wildfire crews and equipment and more,\" Loewen wrote on the social media platform X.\n\nAbout 5,000 people live in Jasper. They, along with about 20,000 park visitors had to flee on a moment's notice Monday night when the fires flared up.\n\nThe order to go went out around 10 p.m. Monday as fires cut off road access to the Jasper townsite from the east and the south, forcing evacuees to drive west into British Columbia in a long, slow midnight cavalcade through swirling smoke, soot and ash.\n\nThe following day, evacuees in B.C. who didn't have a place to stay were directed to make a long, looping U-turn around the fires back to Alberta to evacuation centres in Grande Prairie and Calgary.\n\nB.C., dealing with its own multiple wildfires and evacuees, did not have the capacity to help Alberta, officials said.\n\nAt the Grande Prairie evacuation centre, Addison McNeill recalled literally just arriving in Jasper when she was told to get out.\n\nMcNeill said she had just put her bags down after moving from Edmonton for her new job as a line cook when she got an alert on her phone that she needed to leave immediately.\n\n\"I moved there two hours before the evacuation notice,\" said the 24-year-old in an interview.\n\nMcNeill said went to a nearby hotel, one of two meet-up points for those without transportation. She hopped in a recreational vehicle with others and headed out -- at a snail's pace.\n\n\"Every single person in town was beelining to one exit from about six different routes and so you get bottleneck, backups and congestion,\" she said.\n\nMcNeill said as she sat inside the vehicle, she felt so close to the wildfires that the windows seemed like they were going to shatter from the pressure of the red, hot, smoky air.\n\nShe saw acts of kindness amid the swirling ash: neighbours loaning their cars to those without; people knocking on doors to see if everyone inside was OK.\n\n\"It was far from a panic,\" she said.\n\nJasper National Park, the largest in the Canadian Rockies, is considered a national and international treasure.\n\nThe United Nations designated the parks that make up the Canadian Rockies, including Jasper, a World Heritage Site in 1984 for its striking mountain landscape.\n\nIt has hosted glitz and glitter. In 1953, Hollywood star Marilyn Monroe visited to make the movie \"River of No Return.\" More recently, the TV show \"The Bachelor\" was filmed there.\n\nJasper is famous for hiking, skiing, kayaking, and biking.\n\nIt is also home to dozens of species such as elk, mountain goats, cougars, lynx, black bears, and grizzly bears.", "source": {"uri": "theepochtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Around 25,000 people had been evacuated as of Thursday, according to government agencies. The Jasper fire, dubbed Utopia, was reported a week ago and is believed to have started from a lightning strike.\n\nHigh temperatures, dry conditions and lightning storms have been plaguing much of western North America this month, causing numerous wildfires including in the Western Canadian provinces of British Columbia and Alberta.\n\nJasper is at the heart of a huge national park in the Canadian Rockies that shares its name and at the northern end of the Icefields Parkway, a highway that connects the wilderness area to Banff National Park in the south. The town of 4,100 residents is prime tourist spot and is known for its natural beauty and wildlife, including grizzly bears, elk and moose. Almost 2.5 million people visited Jasper last year, according to Parks Canada.\n\n\"Multiple structures, including a number of businesses and homes, in and around the Town of Jasper have been lost,\" Parks Canada said in a Thursday statement. \"Structural firefighters remain in the town and are working to save as many structures as possible and to protect critical infrastructure.\"\n\nCanadian National Railway Co., whose rail link between the country's interior and the Pacific coast passes through Jasper, suspended rail operations in what it described a \"dynamic and fluid\" wildfire situation in the area, according to an emailed statement.\n\n\"Early reports indicate the wildfires caused significant damage to the town,\" Canada's largest rail company said Thursday, adding that the community is home to many employees and their families.\n\nThe newly expanded Trans Mountain oil pipeline passes through Jasper. The wildfires have not damaged Trans Mountain's infrastructure and pipeline operations continue to operate, the company said in a Thursday statement. The operator is using its own firefighting equipment in Jasper and has deployed a sprinkler system to protect its facilities.\n\nSome evacuees have ended up in Hinton, a town northeast of Jasper, that is serving as a crisis center and temporary base for the municipality of Jasper.\n\n\"There's been fire trucks coming down the highway from communities all across the province,\" Hinton Mayor Nicholas Nissen said in an interview. \"I can see the lights go as they rip through town, headed quickly toward Jasper.\"\n\nA July heat wave has sparked wildfires across Western Canada. In Alberta alone, 176 wildfires were burning Thursday and 54 are out of control, according to provincial government agency Alberta Wildfire. Cooler temperatures and potential rain is expected to bring some relief in the next several days in the northern part of the province, the agency said.\n\nSome 1,900 firefighters, contractors and support staff are fighting the Alberta blazes, according to Christie Tucker, a spokesperson for Alberta Wildfire. About 400 firefighters from Mexico, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand are joining the local crews, according to Alberta's premier.\n\nThe fires have cause deteriorating air quality across Western Canada, with nearby financial hubs Edmonton and Calgary facing unhealthy conditions, according to AirNow.gov.\n\nOil Sands\n\nThe blazes have prompted the curtailment of oil and gas facilities including Suncor Energy Inc.'s Firebag oil sands site, which produced more than 230,000 barrels a day of crude in June, according to Alberta Energy Regulator data. Other companies including Imperial Oil Ltd., Cenovus Energy Inc. and MEG Energy Corp. have evacuated some workers from oil sands sites. Alberta's oil sands are the world's third-largest crude reserves.\n\nThe equivalent of about 389,000 barrels a day of oil and more than 19,000 barrels a day of gas production was within 10 kilometers (6.2 miles) of one or more wildfires that were larger than 10 hectares (25 acres) as of early Thursday, according to Alberta Energy Regulator and Alberta Wildfire data.\n\nFor several years, major fires have burned large swaths of Western Canada, razing communities and sending residents fleeing while ruining air quality across the country and into the US.\n\n(Adds comments from Alberta premier,

But it says crews continue to battle a swift and dynamic fire.\n\n\"Jasper National Park received a small amount of rain overnight,\" said the statement.\n\n\"While the rain helped reduce fire activity slightly, it is not enough to have made a meaningful impact to the overall wildfire situation, which remains out of control.\"\n\nImages and video surfacing on social media depict blocks of homes and businesses burned to charred foundations and vehicles torched to the hubcaps.\n\nOn the social media platform X, the account for Fairmont's Jasper Park Lodge said the flames had reached the hotel's grounds but the extent of damage, if any, was not known.\n\nAlberta was getting fire crews and help from 32 municipalities across the province. The province has asked for help from the Canadian Armed Forces, and the federal government has promised aid is on the way.\n\nCrews worked to preserve critical infrastructure like Jasper's wastewater treatment plant and the Trans Mountain pipeline.\n\nTelus reported some landline and cellphone services were down due to wildfire damage.\n\nThe company said it was securing helicopters to get cell towers operating, with the priority on restoring voice calls, including those to 9-1-1 and emergency services.\n\nThe firefighting staging area was the town of Hinton, on the eastern outskirts of Jasper National Park.\n\nIn Hinton Thursday, rain fell and wood smoke hung in the air at the roadblock preventing vehicles from entering the park. Officials in bright neon yellow vests directed traffic.\n\nJasper Mayor Richard Ireland, in an open letter to residents, said, \"In the coming days and weeks, we will rally together, support one another and begin the daunting process of recovery.\"\n\nAbout 20,000 park visitors and the 5,000 residents of the Jasper municipality had to flee on a moment's notice Monday night ahead of two wildfires that cut off road access everywhere but west to British Columbia.\n\nA day later they were directed to loop back to Alberta as British Columbia, dealing with its own fires, did not have the capacity to assist.\n\nThose without a place to stay have been directed to evacuation centres in Grande Prairie and Calgary.\n\nCrews lost the fight to save Jasper Wednesday just after 6 p.m., as waves of orange and red breached the southern outskirts and began devouring homes and livelihoods.\n\nFrantic efforts to contain the fires -- including buckets and fire guards and a last-ditch effort to burn a path from the southern fire to the river and highway -- were foiled by high winds.\n\n\"That wind gust moved that fire five kilometres in probably less than 30 minutes, with a wall of fire that was about 100 metres high,\" said Alberta Public Safety Minister Mike Ellis.\n\n\"There is little to nothing you can do when you have a wall of flames coming at you like that.\"\n\nPierre Martel, who oversees fire management with Parks Canada, echoed Ellis.\n\n\"There are no tools we have in our tool box to deal with that,\" Martel told an online news conference.\n\n\"It's just a monster at that point.\"\n\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published July 25, 2024.\n\n-- with files from Jeremy Simes in Regina and Fakiha Baig in Hinton\n\nLisa Johnson, The Canadian Press",

The town and the park, which draws more than 2 million tourists a year, were evacuated on Monday, when officials estimated there were 15,000 visitors in the park.\n\n\"As the pictures and videos circulating online show, significant loss has occurred within the town site,\" Parks Canada said in a statement, but gave no details.\n\nOfficials said that at one point on Wednesday the flames in Jasper had reached a height of 400 feet and were moving at 15 meters (50 feet) a minute.\n\nAshley Kliewer, co-owner of a restaurant in the middle of Jasper, said she had been informed the entire east end of the town had burned down.\n\n\"I am absolutely devastated. ... I don't think anyone will be returning to Jasper any time soon and life is not going to be anywhere near what it was - it really is the end of an era,\" she told the Canadian Broadcasting Corp.\n\nThe Alberta government is due to brief media at 11 am local time (1700 GMT).\n\nEnvironment Canada is forecasting 10 mm (0.4 inches) to 20 mm of rain for Thursday, which might help firefighters.\n\nThere are currently 175 wildfires burning in Alberta, more than 50 of which are out of control. Around 10 of those blazes are close to the border with British Columbia, where dozens of fires are also out of control.\n\nThe federal government said in April that high temperatures and tinder dry forests meant this could be one of the worst years ever for fires in Canada.\n\nThe Jasper Park Lodge, one of the largest hotels in town, said the fire had reached its grounds. The 400-room residence is run by Fairmont, a group owned by France's Accor.\n\nThe federal government and other cities in Alberta are sending emergency crews. One major concern for responders is if the fire reaches the Trans Mountain oil pipeline, which can carry 890,000 barrels per day (bpd) of oil from Edmonton to Vancouver.\n\n\"Losing structures, community, is like losing a close friend ... (but) the people have been saved and that is significant. We can find a way to rebuild,\" Jasper mayor Richard Ireland told the CBC.\n\nThe Jasper fire could be one of the most damaging in Alberta since a 2016 conflagration that hit the oil center of Fort McMurray, forcing the evacuation of all 90,000 residents. The blaze destroyed 10% of all structures in the city and shut in more than a million barrels per day of oil output.\n\nFort McMurray is forecast to receive up to 65 mm of rain in the next day, according to Environment Canada.

She hopped in a recreational vehicle with others and headed out -- at a snail's pace.\n\n\"Every single person in town was beelining to one exit from about six different routes and so you get bottleneck, backups and congestion,\" she said.\n\nMcNeill said as she sat inside the vehicle, she felt so close to the wildfires that the windows seemed like they were going to shatter from the pressure of the red, hot, smoky air.\n\nShe saw acts of kindness amid the swirling ash: neighbours loaning their cars to those without; people knocking on doors to see if everyone inside was OK.\n\n\"It was far from a panic,\" she said.\n\nJasper National Park, the largest in the Canadian Rockies, is considered a national and international treasure.\n\nThe United Nations designated the parks that make up the Canadian Rockies, including Jasper, a World Heritage Site in 1984 for its striking mountain landscape.\n\nIt has hosted glitz and glitter. In 1953, Hollywood star Marilyn Monroe visited to make the movie \"River of No Return.\" More recently, the TV show \"The Bachelor\" was filmed there.\n\nJasper is famous for hiking, skiing, kayaking and biking.\n\nIt is also home to dozens of species such as elk, mountain goats, cougars, lynx, black bears and grizzly bears.\n\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published July 24, 2024.",

Around 25,000 people had been evacuated as of Thursday, according to government agencies. The Jasper fire, dubbed Utopia, was reported a week ago and is believed to have started from a lightning strike.\n\nHigh temperatures, dry conditions and lightning storms have been plaguing much of western North America this month, causing numerous wildfires including in the Western Canadian provinces of British Columbia and Alberta.\n\nJasper is at the heart of a huge national park in the Canadian Rockies that shares its name and at the northern end of the Icefields Parkway, a highway that connects the wilderness area to Banff National Park in the south. The town of 4,100 residents is prime tourist spot and is known for its natural beauty and wildlife, including grizzly bears, elk and moose. Almost 2.5 million people visited Jasper last year, according to Parks Canada.\n\n\"Multiple structures, including a number of businesses and homes, in and around the Town of Jasper have been lost,\" Parks Canada said in a Thursday statement. \"Structural firefighters remain in the town and are working to save as many structures as possible and to protect critical infrastructure.\"\n\nCanadian National Railway Co., whose rail link between the country's interior and the Pacific coast passes through Jasper, suspended rail operations in what it described a \"dynamic and fluid\" wildfire situation in the area, according to an emailed statement.\n\n\"Early reports indicate the wildfires caused significant damage to the town,\" Canada's largest rail company said Thursday, adding that the community is home to many employees and their families.\n\nThe newly expanded Trans Mountain oil pipeline passes through Jasper. The wildfires have not damaged Trans Mountain's infrastructure and pipeline operations continue to operate, the company said in a Thursday statement. The operator is using its own firefighting equipment in Jasper and has deployed a sprinkler system to protect its facilities.\n\nSome evacuees have ended up in Hinton, a town northeast of Jasper, that is serving as a crisis center and temporary base for the municipality of Jasper.\n\n\"There's been fire trucks coming down the highway from communities all across the province,\" Hinton Mayor Nicholas Nissen said in an interview. \"I can see the lights go as they rip through town, headed quickly toward Jasper.\"\n\nA July heat wave has sparked wildfires across Western Canada. In Alberta alone, 176 wildfires were burning Thursday and 54 are out of control, according to provincial government agency Alberta Wildfire. Cooler temperatures and potential rain is expected to bring some relief in the next several days in the northern part of the province, the agency said.\n\nSome 1,900 firefighters, contractors and support staff are fighting the Alberta blazes, according to Christie Tucker, a spokesperson for Alberta Wildfire. About 400 firefighters from Mexico, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand are joining the local crews, according to Alberta's premier.\n\nThe fires have cause deteriorating air quality across Western Canada, with nearby financial hubs Edmonton and Calgary facing unhealthy conditions, according to AirNow.gov.\n\nOil Sands\n\nThe blazes have prompted the curtailment of oil and gas facilities including Suncor Energy Inc.'s Firebag oil sands site, which produced more than 230,000 barrels a day of crude in June, according to Alberta Energy Regulator data. Other companies including Imperial Oil Ltd., Cenovus Energy Inc. and MEG Energy Corp. have evacuated some workers from oil sands sites. Alberta's oil sands are the world's third-largest crude reserves.\n\nThe equivalent of about 389,000 barrels a day of oil and more than 19,000 barrels a day of gas production was within 10 kilometers (6.2 miles) of one or more wildfires that were larger than 10 hectares (25 acres) as of early Thursday, according to Alberta Energy Regulator and Alberta Wildfire data.\n\nFor several years, major fires have burned large swaths of Western Canada, razing communities and sending residents fleeing while ruining air quality across the country and into the US.", "source": {"uri":

She hopped in a recreational vehicle with others and headed out -- at a snail's pace.\n\n\"Every single person in town was beelining to one exit from about six different routes and so you get bottleneck, backups and congestion,\" she said.\n\nMcNeill said as she sat inside the vehicle, she felt so close to the wildfires that the windows seemed like they were going to shatter from the pressure of the red, hot, smoky air.\n\nShe saw acts of kindness amid the swirling ash: neighbours loaning their cars to those without; people knocking on doors to see if everyone inside was OK.\n\n\"It was far from a panic,\" she said.\n\nJasper National Park, the largest in the Canadian Rockies, is considered a national and international treasure.\n\nThe United Nations designated the parks that make up the Canadian Rockies, including Jasper, a World Heritage Site in 1984 for its striking mountain landscape.\n\nIt has hosted glitz and glitter. In 1953, Hollywood star Marilyn Monroe visited to make the movie \"River of No Return.\" More recently, the TV show \"The Bachelor\" was filmed there.\n\nJasper is famous for hiking, skiing, kayaking and biking.\n\nIt is also home to dozens of species such as elk, mountain goats, cougars, lynx, black bears and grizzly bears.\n\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published July 24,

The town and the park, which draw more than 2 million tourists a year, were evacuated on Monday, when officials estimated there were up to 10,000 people in the town and a further 15,000 visitors in the park.\n\n\"There is no denying that this is the worst nightmare for any community,\" Alberta premier Danielle Smith told reporters, while choking back tears.\n\n\"We're seeing potentially 30% to 50% structural damage ... that's going to be a significant rebuild,\" she said, adding the fire was still out of control.\n\nParks Canada said there had been a \"significant loss\" of buildings inside the town but added it could not give specific details of the damage, or which areas had been hit and it urged residents not to return.\n\nVideo from the town showed vehicles and entire blocks burned to the ground, including a historic Anglican church.\n\nJasper resident Eva Korduliakova heard the news that her home was burning from thousands of kilometers away Thursday morning, while visiting family in the Czech Republic with her seven-year-old son.\n\n\"I am single mum who became homeless and jobless overnight,\" she wrote in an email. \"Our house is gone. I didn't get a chance to grab any of my belongings.\"\n\nJasper mayor Richard Ireland said the town was beginning to come to terms with \"the devastating impact\" of the fire.\n\n\"Last night's wildfires have simply ravaged our small tight-knit mountain community, the destruction and the loss that so many of our residents are facing simply defies description,\" he told a press conference, his voice breaking.\n\nOne major concern for responders is if the fire damages the Trans Mountain oil pipeline, which can carry 890,000 barrels per day (bpd) of oil from Edmonton to Vancouver.\n\n\"At this time there is no indication of damage to our infrastructure, and the pipelines continue to operate safely,\" pipeline operator Trans Mountain said in a statement.\n\nCN Rail said it suspended rail operations through the town on Wednesday afternoon as the wildfire conditions worsened.\n\nThe federal government and other cities in Alberta are sending emergency crews. In addition, a total of 400 firefighters from Mexico, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand are due to arrive in the coming days.\n\n'WALL OF FLAMES'\n\nThere are currently 176 wildfires burning in Alberta, more than 50 of which are out of control. Around 10 of those blazes are close to the border with British Columbia, where there 423 wildfires burning and dozens of evacuation orders and alerts.\n\nThe federal government said in April that high temperatures and tinder dry forests meant this could be a catastrophic year for wildfires in Canada.\n\nThe Jasper fire was caused by a lightning strike on Monday afternoon and fuelled by strong winds, according to Parks Canada.\n\nFlames from the blaze rose 100 meters high (3 feet), and strong wind gusts on Wednesday afternoon pushed the fire 5 kilometers (3 miles) in less than 30 minutes, said Alberta public safety minister Mike Ellis.\n\n\"Any firefighter will tell you there's little to nothing you can do when you have a wall of flames coming at you like that,\" Ellis said.\n\nEnvironment Canada is forecasting 10 mm (0.4 inches) to 20 mm of rain for Thursday, which might help firefighters.\n\nThe Jasper Park Lodge, one of the largest hotels in town, said the fire had reached its grounds. The 400-room residence is run by Fairmont, a group owned by France's Accor.\n\nThe Jasper fire could be one of the most damaging in Alberta since a 2016 conflagration that hit the oil town of Fort McMurray, forcing the evacuation of all 90,000 residents and destroying 10% of all structures in the city.\n\n(Reporting by David Ljunggren in Ottawa, Nia Williams in British Columbia and Anna Mehler

It's also 2.5 kilometres from the Valley of the Five, a popular hiking trail.\n\nA north wildfire sits at around 270 hectares and is five kilometres from the town.\n\nJasper, which is nearly a four-hour, 365-kilometre drive west of Edmonton, is located within the Jasper National Park. It is the largest national park in the Canadian Rockies. It's also just east of the British Columbia border.\n\nAn extensive network of trails and green spaces mixed with opportunities for rafting, skiing and cruising on the water make the region an in-demand spot for visitors throughout the year.\n\nAn evacuation order for Jasper was issued Monday night. In the update on Wednesday, officials said the evacuation of the town was completed and efforts were underway to evacuate backcountry campers.\n\n\"Our priority is to protect the town and community of Jasper, limiting wildfire growth towards the town, Highway 16, and critical infrastructure,\" an update on Wednesday said.\n\n\"Jasper National Park and the Town of Jasper have mobilized all available resources, with federal, provincial, and municipal agencies all dedicated to supporting firefighting and protecting the town.\"\n\nIn response to the fire, Parks Canada shut down Jasper National Park to residents and visitors until Aug. 6. The federal agency is cancelling and refunding any reservations for the park until that time.\n\nParks Canada staff said there will be updates in the future about reopening the park. There could also be additional closures. Pending further announcements, officials said any reservation cancellations after Aug. 6 will face cancellation fees.\n\nVia Rail operates train services in Jasper. The Canadian, which runs between Toronto and Vancouver, stops in the town. The Crown corporation issued a warning.\n\n\"Via Rail wishes to inform its passengers that in the event that we cannot guarantee safe operation, trains travelling in that region might be cancelled prior to their departure or while en route, without offer of alternate transportation. Trains may also incur delays and air quality may be impacted,\" a statement on Wednesday said.\n\nJasper also has trains with service to or from Prince George and Prince Rupert. Train service out of the town has been cancelled until the end of Saturday at least.\n\nCityNews asked Via Rail about service impacts. In a statement, a spokesperson said it was an \"unfortunate situation\" that is \"beyond\" Via Rail's control.\n\n\"Passengers are being contacted directly if their train is impacted and will receive a full refund, or a refund for the segment of the trip they could not complete,\" the spokesperson wrote.\n\n\"VIA Rail is closely monitoring the situation and will resume regular service once it will be possible to safely operate trains in the area.\"\n\nCityNews contacted the four major airlines in Canada (Air Canada, Flair, Porter and WestJet) to ask how each one is responding to the wildfire situation in Jasper and other parts of western Canada.\n\nAir Canada\n\nAn Air Canada spokesperson told CityNews on Wednesday the airline has enacted its \"goodwill policy\" to make flight rebooking options more flexible due to wildfires in Alberta. The update on the website posted on Tuesday said it only applies to flights in Grand Prairie (roughly 400 kilometres north of Jasper) and Fort McMurray.\n\n\"Customers currently visiting Jasper who are affected by the Jasper evacuations and who are now away from their planned departure airport may contact Air Canada's call centres for assistance to rebook from another AB/BC airport without additional fees,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nWhen asked if there are plans to increase the number of flights in the region, the spokesperson said there were \"no immediate plans\" to do so.\n\nFlair Airlines\n\nA Flair Airlines spokesperson said in a statement the company hasn't seen a \"bump in flights or queries\" from the area airports the airline serves.\n\n\"If that changes, we will see how best we can help. As of right now, none of our airports are close to affected areas, so we have not seen a swell in needs from passengers or requests for cancellations/changes. We are monitoring this constantly and will change course if needed,\" the statement said.\n\nAn executive with the airline said in the statement that Flair Airlines \"will protect against surge pricing in this case, as we do in all cases\" when asked about potential price jumps should there be a surge in demand among evacuees.\n\nThe statement noted the airline is currently working to arrange dedicated charters for firefighters who might be flown in to assist with firefighting efforts.\n\nPorter Airlines\n\nWhen asked about the wildfires, a Porter Airlines spokesperson said in a statement the airline \"typically provide(s) passengers with the opportunity to postpone trips and rebook flights, or receive refunds, even if this isn't normally available within their fare category.\"\n\nThe spokesperson said the airline is operating a normal schedule with some current seat availability on its Edmonton routes, adding pricing \"is being managed in the standard manner.\"\n\nWestjet\n\nA Westjet spokesperson said flexible change and cancellations guidelines have been put in place for passengers travelling to and from airports in Grand Prairie and Fort McMurray for travel until July 28.\n\n\"To ensure guests evacuating are able to do affordably, WestJet has proactively adjusted fares to avoid price escalation for all flights serving Fort McMurray and Grande Prairie,\" the statement said.\n\nThe spokesperson said there haven't been any additional flights added as there is still \"open capacity\" across the airline's network.\n\n\"We continue to monitor the situation closely and will make operational changes in the name of safety as necessary. All guests currently in regions affected by wildfires are advised to follow all response instructions provided by local authorities,\" they wrote.\n\nG\u00e1bor Luk\u00e1cs, the president of the advocacy organization Air Passenger Rights, said the exact nature of the flight cancellation will dictate refunds.\n\nIf the flight is still operating to the destination near a region affected by natural emergencies such as wildfires, there isn't a strict obligation to provide a refund. Should the airline not offer a satisfactory result under this situation, it could be the subject of an insurance claim.\n\nHowever, if weather or safety issues prompt a flight cancellation, Luk\u00e1cs said that's different.\n\n\"You are owed a refund in the original form of payment -- not vouchers, not future credit, but actual cash back or the actual original form of payment,\" he said.\n\nFor those who still want to travel, Luk\u00e1cs added the airline has to rebook on the same network within 48 hours. If the airline can't accommodate the passenger on one of its planes, the company must try to get you a ticket on a competing airline.\n\n\"Do not ask or accept a refund if you still want to travel. You want to ensure that you hold their airline's feet to the fire and don't let them off the responsibility to transport,\" Luk\u00e1cs said.\n\nWhen it comes to bookings, there could be additional government protections depending on where you live.\n\nThe Travel Industry Council of Ontario (TICO), the province's travel regulator, offers a backstop in certain instances for residents of Ontario.\n\nIf someone booked a packaged tour through a TICO-registered travel agency or website and that same tour is through a TICO-registered tour company, the person must be offered a refund, an alternative option or a travel voucher for the future.\n\nTICO staff encouraged people to contact their travel insurance provider to discuss potential options if travel to an affected area is happening soon. There could be coverage through the credit card used to book or other group benefit programs.\n\n\"This is a very unfortunate and quickly evolving situation and we encourage travellers to explore their options through both the companies they booked with and their travel insurance providers,\" TICO CEO Richard Smart said in a statement on Wednesday.", "source": {"uri": "toronto.citynews.ca",

Images on social media depict blocks of homes and businesses burned to charred foundations, and vehicles torched to their hubcaps. Parks Canada says it will provide details when it can but says crews continue to battle a swift and dynamic fire in Jasper National Park.

Firefighters are \"working to save as many structures as possible and to protect critical infrastructure,\" Jasper National Park said in a post on social media, as more than 170 wildfires burn across the western province.\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau wrote on social media late Wednesday that Alberta had requested federal assistance with the fires, adding that \"we're mobilizing every necessary resource available.\" As of Wednesday afternoon, 59 of the fires were classified as \"out of control\" and more than 17,500 people were estimated to be under evacuation orders, according to the Alberta government.\n\nThis summer's outbreak of blazes comes after an unprecedented wildfire season in Canada last year, during which more than 45 million acres burned and smoke affected air quality in the country as well as large swaths of the United States.\n\nWildfire was driven into Jasper, a popular tourist destination in the Canadian Rockies with a population of about 4,500, on Wednesday by \"strong wind gusts from the south and southeast,\" according to an earlier post from Jasper National Park. \"If you have not yet evacuated town you must leave now,\" it urged park visitors and residents, who were first ordered to evacuate Monday.\n\nKatie Ellsworth, an incident commander with Parks Canada, told the Edmonton Journal that the wildfire \"is significantly larger and more aggressive than the wildfires we've seen in the past few years,\" and \"has much closer proximity to the community.\"\n\nBy 8:30 p.m. local time, only some first responders could remain in Jasper because air quality had deteriorated to a level that required \"wildland firefighters and others without self contained breathing apparatuses\" to evacuate to a town nearby, park authorities said on social media.\n\nUp to 20 millimeters of rain is forecast in the next 24 hours, the park said, noting it could \"help to reduce fire activity.\" Earlier Wednesday, suppression efforts by helicopter bucketing were not effective and water bombers could not assist due to dangerous conditions.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"},

Because there's nothing that we can do.\"\n\nThe general manager of the Jasper Park Chamber of Commerce said she had taken refuge with friends more than 500 kilometers (310 miles) away from her home.\n\nIn tears, Alberta Premier Smith provided an assessment of the damage and recalled that \"for many generations\" the town and Jasper National Park were \"a source of pride.\"\n\nIn recent days, numerous fires have been started by lightning in western Canada.\n\nIn Alberta province, more than 170 fires were active on Thursday, including more than a dozen in the Fort McMurray region, a

It is roughly eight kilometres away from the Town of Jasper, according to Incident Commander Katie Ellsworth.\n\nThe north fire, which is about five kilometres away from town, is still about 270 hectares.\n\n\u00d7\n\nAlready a Subscriber? Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nRain is forecasted for this evening and into Thursday morning. Ellsworth says commanders anticipate a reduction in fire activity if Jasper does receive precipitation, but gusty conditions mean the fire will likely grow before then.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nEllsworth confirmed to media that the town has not been impacted by fire. She added that there is no timeline for re-entry, including for temporary visits to gather items that evacuees left behind.\n\n\"We understand that this is stressful. We do ask for your patience, and we will provide you with a timeline (once) you are able to return to retrieve the items that you may have left behind,\" Ellsworth said.\n\nIn a Facebook post this afternoon, the Municipality of Jasper encouraged evacuees to prepare to stay elsewhere. They advise evacuees to make arrangements with friends or family if possible, or go to reception centres in Edmonton, Calgary, or Grande Prairie. Additionally, free camping for evacuees is available at Buck Lake in the County of Wetaskiwin, and at the Dr. Duncan Murray Recreation Centre Field in the Town of Hinton.\n\nThe Municipality also advises residents and business owners to call their insurance provider as soon as possible, and apply for Employment Insurance using their temporary address.\n\nThe status of structures outside of town - such as the Palisades Centre, Caribou Recovery Centre, and the HI Athabasca Falls Wilderness Hostel - is unknown at this time. Heavy smoke and aggressive fire behavior have made it unsafe for responders to access these structures, according to Ellsworth.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"In terms of the Palisades Centre, we can confirm that it has been impacted. Because of the fire behavior yesterday, we don't know the extent of those impacts,\" Ellsworth said. \"We are hoping to be able to confirm those impacts as soon as we can, so that we can share that information both to the public and the business owners. But we do ask for your continued patience.\"\n\nFirefighters are taking steps to protect the town's infrastructure in case the southern fire continues to move northward. This includes the installation of high-volume sprinklers on the south side of the Parks Canada compound, and around the southwest perimeter of town from Patricia Place to the entrance of Stone Mountain Village. Sprinklers will also be installed around Pyramid Bench from west to east. Additionally, firefighters are removing combustible material and dry vegetation from town today, Ellsworth added.\n\nEllsworth asks that the public look to Parks Canada, the Municipality of Jasper, and Alberta Wildfire for accurate information on the fire, rather than using other resources like NASA's MODIS and FIRMS satellite imagery.\n\n\"At this time due to heavy, thick smoke conditions in Jasper, we cannot confirm the MODIS or FIRMS hits that you can see if you're looking at the satellite imagery,\" she said. \"These satellites do indicate heat registers, and it's not uncommon after a fairly aggressive burning day when things calm down for that heat to sink back down to the surface and be registered as a fire point.\"\n\nAlert hiccups\n\nJasper Mayor Richard Ireland, who also attended the press conference, thanked Jasper residents and visitors for their cooperation during the evacuation. However, he said he received reports this morning that the alert system used by the municipality did not work as intended.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"We gave out an emergency alert on our system - we use something called Voyent,\" he told journalists. \"It has come to my attention that some subscribers to that service did not receive the messages that we thought that they had received.\"\n\nIreland added that the Alberta Emergency Alerts system worked as expected.\n\nThe glitch that caused the error has been fixed since the municipality learned of it earlier this morning, according to Ireland.\n\n\"All of these incidents undergo an after-action debrief. The whole system will be reviewed and we will see whether any corrections have to be made to prevent this happening, either in our location or other locations with the same sorts of mass alert systems,\" he said.\n\nHighway 16 partially cleared\n\nAccording to Drive BC, about 350 kilometres of Highway 16 has been cleared between Victoria Street and the B.C.-Alberta border, as of 11:01 a.m. today. There is still limited visibility due to smoke from 16 kilometres east of Tete Jaune to the Alberta border.\n\nHighway 16 eastbound is closed from the Mount Robson Visitor Centre to the Alberta border. The westbound lane is open only for evacuation purposes. Drive BC anticipates an update to Highway 16 at 4:30 p.m. today.", "source": {"uri": "thepeterboroughexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "thepeterboroughexaminer.com"}, "authors": [{"uri":

As of Wednesday, it was still operating, with sprinklers being used to protect it.\n\nThere have been more than 400 fires recorded in British Columbia and 176 in the neighboring province of Alberta.\n\nEnvironment Canada said there might soon be a reprieve from the hot and dry weather, which allowed the fire to grow, as 1cm to 2cm (0.4in to 0.8in) of rain is expected on Thursday.\n\nThe fire is so powerful that some weather experts say it is creating its own weather system and generating thunder and lightning, which can sometimes happen with intense blazes.\n\nFires were first reported in Jasper last week. The town's mayor, Richard Ireland, told CBC that the town was facing its \"worst nightmare\".\n\n\"I write to you today with profound sorrow as we begin to come to terms with the devastating impact of last night's wildfire that has ravaged our beloved community,\" Ireland wrote on Facebook on Thursday morning.\n\n\"The destruction and loss that many of you are facing and feeling is beyond description and comprehension; my deepest sympathies go out to each of you.\"\n\nIreland noted first responders were still working to protect the town from further destruction.\n\nThe wildfire reached the grounds of Fairmont Jasper Park Lodge on Wednesday night, Anastasia Martin-Stilwell, a spokesperson for the historic resort said.\n\nWhile all guest were safely evacuated, the extent of the damage, if any, remains unclear.\n\n\"We are devastated by the situation,\" Ms Martin-Stilwell said. \"The dedication of our first responders and those coming to our aid cannot fully be expressed.\"\n\nEleonor Dumlao told the Edmonton Journal she was filled with panic when her family received the evacuation order. They left Jasper on Monday night and headed to an evacuation centre in Edmonton.\n\n\"It was so very terrible experience for us, and I was so panicking that time. I don't know what to do. I don't know what to get first,\" she told the newspaper.\n\nJasper National Park said on X that \"air quality had deteriorated\" in the area. The park is the largest national park in the Canadian Rockies.\n\nAfter evacuations were issued, Alberta Premier Danielle Smith told residents to \"leave safely\" on Wednesday. In a post on Facebook, she said she was in \"constant contact\" with the authorities.\n\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau says his government has approved a request for federal assistance for Alberta.\n\n\"We're deploying @CanadianForces resources, evacuations support, and more emergency wildfire resources to the province immediately -- and we're coordinating firefighting and airlift assistance,\" Trudeau said on X.\n\nDaniel Turner also recounted how he evacuated the wildfires to the Edmonton Journal, saying he followed evacuation orders with three of his friends but hit bumper-to-bumper traffic fleeing Jasper and turned around.\n\nThe group slept in a Canadian Tire parking lot.\n\n\"You could see it deteriorating, like ash falling,\" he said of the wildfire smoke.\n\nMeanwhile, others like Jim Campbell and Shawn Cornett were asleep in their tent at a campsite in Jasper's backcountry when the evacuation order was issued, they told the Globe and Mail newspaper.\n\nAs word about the evacuation spread they packed up their belongings and hit the road with another 20 people who were leaving the site.\n\n\"We were the last ones out,\" Campbell said. \"Because we were the last ones to know.\"\n\nEarlier in the week, several US states including California and Utah were hit by wildfires.\n\nMore than 30 million people in the US have been affected by heat warnings since early July, according to the National Weather Service. The warnings are in place in California, Arizona, Nevada, Oregon and Washington state. -- BBC", "source": {"uri": "saudigazette.com.sa", "dataType": "news", "title": "Saudi Gazette"}, "authors": [],

While the rain helped reduce fire activity slightly, it is not enough to have made a meaningful impact to the overall wildfire situation, which remains out of control,\" read a post on the park's X account.\n\nIn places, the flames reached a height of 120 meters (390 feet) and were moving at a speed of 15 meters per minute.\n\nThe fire entered the deserted town on Wednesday evening after advancing very rapidly late in the day, pushed by strong winds in a region hit by severe drought and which has seen record heat in recent days.\n\nJasper National Park, Canada's largest, is known for its mountains, glaciers, lakes and waterfalls, and attracts 2.5 million visitors every year.\n\n- 'Devastation' -\n\n\"Everyone has a total feeling of devastation,\" said Pattie Pavlov, a Jasper resident who drove for hours on Monday night to escape the advancing fire.\n\n\"Many people are feeling very helpless. Because there's nothing that we can do.\"\n\nThe general manager of the Jasper Park Chamber of Commerce said she had taken refuge with friends more than 500 kilometers (310 miles) away from her home.\n\nIn tears, Alberta Premier Smith provided an assessment of the damage and recalled that \"for many generations\" the town and Jasper National Park were \"a source of pride.\"\n\nIn recent days, numerous fires have been started by lightning in western Canada.\n\nIn Alberta province, more than 170 fires were active on Thursday, including more than a dozen in the Fort McMurray region, a hub of oil sands development.\n\nBritish Columbia, Alberta's neighboring province, was grappling with 400 active fires, more than half of which were burning out of control.\n\nFifty-six fires have started in the last 24 hours alone, authorities said.\n\namp-tib/aha/acb\n\nFOX28 Spokane\u00a9", "source": {"uri": "fox28spokane.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FOX 28 Spokane"}, "authors": [],

A call between Smith and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is also scheduled for 2:30 p.m.\n\nMinister of Public Safety and Emergency Services, Mike Ellis was also on hand during Thursday's provincial update and confirmed that the flames hit 100 metres in some areas Wednesday night.\n\nThe fire was accelerated by a significant gust of wind.\n\n\"That fire was about five kilometres out [and] there was an enormous wind gust,\" he said. \"That wind gust moved the fire five kilometers in probably less than 30 minutes, with a wall of fire that was about 100 meters high.\n\n\"I think people need to picture what those wildfire folks were experiencing at that time. Any firefighter will tell you, there's little to nothing you can do when you have a wall of flames coming in like that.\"\n\nEllis also confirmed that Edmonton, Calgary, and Grand Prairie are accommodating evacuees, noting mental health supports are also available.\n\nSome acute care patients have, however, have been taken to Edson and Hinton, with two patients being taken to Prince George.\n\nFirefighters from across 34 municipalities, Lakeland College and industrial firefighters from across the province have been called in to help battle structure fires in Jasper, according to Minister Ellis.\n\nIn total, nearly 1,900 Alberta firefighters, contractors and support staff are working to battle wildfires in the province.\n\nIn addition to this, Alberta Wildfire says crews from Australia landed over the weekend, and at least 400 additional firefighters from overseas are expected in the coming days -- 100 from Mexico later Thursday, 200 from South Africa are expected to arrive on Friday, and an additional 100 from Australia and New Zealand are expected Sunday and Monday.\n\n\"These resources will be sent around the province to areas where they will be most effective in the wildfire response. Alberta wildfire has been active supporting Parks Canada in their response to wildfires and Jasper, as the Minister mentioned, we provided water, trucks, heavy equipment, helicopters, unit crews, and offered air tanker and night vision equipped helicopter,\" explained Christie Tucker, the information unit manager with Alberta Wildfire.\n\nDuring her opening speech on the update, Smith also went on to thank everyone who is currently helping battle wildfires across Alberta, before reassuring everyone from around the world that the magic of Jasper \"is not lost, and it will never will be.\"\n\n\"to the brave men and women currently in Jasper, I want to express my deep gratitude and the gratitude of all Albertans, whether you are part of the initial efforts or whether you were activated and drove in there last night or early this morning,\" said Smith.\n\n\"There really are not enough words to express our thanks and our wishes for your safety and your success. Once again, you put yourselves on the front lines in the show of true heroism. Thank you for your bravery and your commitment to keeping Albertans safe.\"\n\nAdding that residents, families, and business owners will recover from the wildfire.\n\nAlberta wildfire also provided an update on existing wildfires that are impacting the province.\n\nEvacuation orders are still in effect for John D'Or Prairie, Fox Lake, Garden River and Chippewan Lake.\n\nEvacuation orders have been lifted for the hamlet of Janvier due to recent rainfall in that part of the province, which has helped crews get the fire under control.\n\nIt is estimated that over 17,500 people have been displaced from wildfires. It is also believed that roughly 25,000 people were in the Jasper National Park at the time of its evacuation order earlier this week, with the majority of those being visitors.\n\nThe province added that those who are part of the mandatory evacuation order can register online, and receive some temporary funding from the province.", "source": {"uri": "kitchener.citynews.ca", "dataType": "news",

The social media account for Jasper National Park says the fire has caused significant loss within the townsite, but the specific locations or neighbourhoods affected are not being reported. On the social media platform X Wednesday night, the account for Fairmont's Jasper Park Lodge says the flames have reached the hotel's grounds, but the extent of damage, if any, is not yet known. As the flames consumed more fuel, officials say the air quality dropped to dangerous levels, prompting fire crews without breathing apparatus to evacuate to the nearby community of Hinton. Structural firefighters stayed behind in the Alberta mountain town in an effort to protect key infrastructure.

She struggled to avoid tears describing the beauty of Jasper National Park and the damage to the community that shares its name.\n\nPierre Martel, the director of fire management for Parks Canada, the national parks agency, told a briefing on Thursday afternoon that the \"aggressive and fast-moving fire\" was still burning in the park.\n\nAs the fires expanded on Monday evening, about 20,000 tourists and the 5,000 residents of Jasper were evacuated, mostly west to British Columbia.\n\nOn Wednesday night, wildfire fighters had to leave the town because of toxic smoke from the buildings that had caught fire. Parks Canada, which is in charge of fighting the fire, also moved its command post.\n\nFire fighters from other communities have since arrived to help fight the blaze, which follows a recent heat wave.\n\nJasper National Park, along with nearby Banff National Park, is one of Canada's premier tourist destinations and receives about 2.5 million visitors each year.\n\nThe mayor of Jasper, Richard Ireland, said on Thursday that the disaster had been \"almost beyond comprehension.\"\n\nAfter briefly restoring service through Jasper, the Canadian National Railway said on Thursday that it had been forced to shut down its lines through the town, which is a major link between ports on the Pacific Coast, the rest of Canada and the United States.\n\nVia Rail Canada, the national passenger rail service, has also suspended its trains through the area. Canadian National said it had dispatched two fire fighting trains to help with the inferno. The cause of the fire has not been determined.\n\nJasper grew around both the railway and a resort hotel, now known as the Fairmont Jasper Park Lodge, built in the early 20th century to lure tourists to the newly created park.\n\nThe town's economy continues to rely largely on tourism and the railway and is home to park employees and wildfire fighters.\n\nFairmont said on Thursday that the blaze had made its way into the grounds surrounding the hotel complex, which was still Jasper's signature tourist site. But the hotel chain said it had no information about the extent of damage to its buildings.\n\nOne resident, Mike Day, left on Monday night.\n\nHe took a final sweep of his house to confirm that his family's most urgent belongings for a wildfire evacuation -- passports, photo albums, a few days' worth of clothes -- were packed away in their sport utility vehicle. But he said that something made him reach for his acoustic guitar just as he was headed out the door.\n\n\"At the time, I thought 'This is silly, I shouldn't be taking the guitar with me,'\" Mr. Day, a restaurant owner, said. \"But I'm so glad I did.\"\n\nBy Thursday morning, it had become apparent that his house had burned down. A family member, who is a heavy equipment operator attempting to salvage standing buildings, had driven by the wreckage of the fire ravaged home and sent a video. Only its foundation remained.\n\nLike many residents of mountain communities in Western Canada, Mr. Day had taken several steps to protect his house from fire including the installation of water sprinklers, concrete siding and fireproof shingles.\n\n\"It obviously wasn't enough to protect us all,\" he said. \"We were at the mercy of Mother Nature at that point.\"\n\nSpeaking from Kamloops, British Columbia, where he and his family are sheltering, Mr. Day said that his restaurant, Evil Dave's Grill, appeared, to his relief, to have so far evaded the fire.\n\nDespite the ferocity of the fires in Jasper and the national park, Canada's wildfire season had not been as bad as last year, when smoke wafted south to the United States and even reached Western Europe.\n\nLast year, wildfires burned about 43 million acres across Canada, according to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre. So far, this year, they have burned 5.8 million acres, compared to about 29 million acres burned by this time last year.\n\nMr. Martel said that flames from the Jasper fire have reached as high as 100 meters, more than 300 feet.\n\n\"It's just a monster at that point,\" he said. \"There is no tools we have in our toolbox to deal with that. You get out of the way, you retreat and you do what you can to protect communities and infrastructure.\"", "source": {"uri": "dnyuz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "DNyuz"}, "authors": [],

The town and the park, which draws more than two million tourists a year, were evacuated on Monday, when officials estimated there were 15,000 visitors in the park.\n\nEnvironment Canada is forecasting 10 mm to 20 mm of rain for Thursday, which might help firefighters.\n\nThe blaze is one of hundreds ravaging the western provinces of Alberta and British Columbia. The federal government said in April that high temperatures and tinder dry forests meant this could be one of the worst years ever for fires in Canada.\n\nOfficials said the flames in Jasper reached a height of 400 feet and moved at 15 metres a minute.\n\n\"As the pictures and videos circulating online show, significant loss has occurred within the town site,\" Parks Canada said in a statement.\n\nThe federal government and other cities in Alberta are sending help. One major focus is the Trans Mountain oil pipeline, which can carry 890,000 barrels per day of oil from Edmonton to Vancouver.\n\n\"Losing structures, community, is like losing a close friend ... (but) the people have been saved and that is significant. We can find a way to rebuild,\" Jasper mayor Richard Ireland told the Canadian Broadcasting Corp.\n\nOne of the buildings destroyed by fire was the Maligne Lodge hotel in the south of the town.\n\n\"It's just so sad to know that so many families and people have lost not just their belongings but their livelihood and a beautiful park,\" owner Karyne Decore told the CBC.\n\nThere are currently 175 wildfires burning in Alberta, more than 50 of which are out of control.\n\nThe Jasper fire could be one of the most damaging in Alberta since a 2016 conflagration that hit the oil centre of Fort McMurray, forcing the evacuation of all 90,000 residents. The blaze destroyed 10 per cent of all structures in the city and shut in more than a million barrels per day of oil output.\n\nGet the latest news from thewest.com.au in your inbox.\n\nSign up for our emails", "source": {"uri": "thewest.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "The West Australian"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jasper_National_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jasper National Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Town", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Town"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildfire", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wildfire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alberta", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alberta"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alberta"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefighter", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Firefighter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_and_Climate_Change_Canada", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Environment and Climate Change Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provinces_and_territories_of_Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Provinces and territories of Canada"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parks_Canada", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Parks Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Canada", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Western Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_transport", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pipeline transport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Columbia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "British Columbia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "British Columbia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Broadcasting_Corporation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canadian Broadcasting Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Petroleum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hotel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancouver", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vancouver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Vancouver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_McMurray", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fort McMurray"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Fort McMurray"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmonton", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Edmonton"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Edmonton"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme_Parks/Individual_Parks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme Parks/Individual Parks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Camping", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Camping", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 49}], "image": "https://images.thewest.com.au/publication/C-15480259/4cc038f7adf1e78c844ef6fc98c293dc8d713985-16x9-x0y0w1280h720.jpg?imwidth=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9760758", "eventUri": "eng-9760758", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

Firefighters were striving to save as many buildings as possible in Jasper, located within the mountainous Jasper National Park in Alberta. The town and the park, which typically draw over 2 million tourists annually, were evacuated on Monday. At that time, officials estimated 10,000 people were in the town and an additional 15,000 visitors in the park.\n\n'There is no denying that this is the worst nightmare for any community,' Alberta premier Danielle Smith told reporters, fighting back tears. 'We're seeing potentially 30% to 50% structural damage ... that's going to be a significant rebuild,' she said, adding that the fire remains out of control.\n\nParks Canada reported significant loss of buildings in the town but couldn't provide specifics on the damage.

Five officials in bright neon yellow vests directed traffic at the roadblock. The only vehicle that was seen going through was a fire truck.\n\nOn social media, people shared Thursday-morning video of rain-slicked streets in Jasper and grey-black structures razed to charred foundations.\n\nAlberta Premier Danielle Smith and other officials were set to update the situation Thursday morning.\n\nJasper Mayor Richard Ireland, in an open letter to residents, urged them to stay strong.\n\n\"I write to you today with profound sorrow as we begin to come to terms with the devastating impact of last night's wildfire that has ravaged our beloved community,\" Ireland wrote.\n\n\"The destruction and loss that many of you are facing and feeling is beyond description and comprehension.\n\n\"Your resilience and strength have always been the backbone of our community. In the coming days and weeks, we will rally together, support one another, and begin the daunting process of recovery.\"\n\nAbout 25,000 people, including about 5,000 residents in the Jasper townsite, were forced to flee west at a moment's notice late Monday night as twin wildfires from the south and north roared up and cut off access to the east and south.\n\nA day later they were directed to loop back to Alberta as British Columbia, dealing with its own fires, did not have the capacity to assist.\n\nOn Wednesday, efforts to contain the fires -- include buckets and fire guards and a last-ditch effort to burn a path from the southern fire to the river and highway -- were foiled by raging, gusting winds.\n\nAfter 6 p.m. Wednesday, the fire roared in and began torching structures.\n\nJasper, a postcard-perfect mountain town, is famous for hiking, skiing, kayaking and biking. It is also home to dozens of species such as elk, mountain goats, cougars, lynx, black bears and grizzly bears.

To many in the province and abroad, the park and its iconic features are part of one of the most beautiful landscapes in Canada. The damage from the flames has left a devastating impact on some of the most recognizable destinations, Maligne Lake Lodge, with before and after shots showing the wrath of nature.\n\n\"Brace yourself. This is a tough image to see of Jasper-Maligne Lodge. Same eyewitness says PetroCan/ Brightspot were hit. This was over half hour ago,\" posted news anchor Lindsay Warner along with a picture of what is identified as the burning Maligne Lake Lodge on X, formerly known as Twitter.\n\nThe wildfires at Jasper are believed to have caused \"significant loss\" as they consumed several buildings -- belonging to homes and businesses, causing Albertans to vent their frustration with the provincial government online.\n\n\"Danielle Smith should've spent less time watching Oilers games in the private boxes of millionaire lobbyists while cutting wildfire funding and more time preparing for a fire season in one of the hottest summers on record. She's a failure on every level and should resign,\" wrote a social media user online.\n\nThe extent of the fires burning at Jasper remains unknown, however, local authorities and first responders believe multiple buildings based in the heart of the town have now been lost.\n\nA total of 182 fires are burning across the province of Alberta.\n\nMany people, who visited Jasper in the past, were quick to share their memories of the place and drew contrasts between the visuals of the place in the grip of adversity and the peaceful serendipity it stood for back in the day.\n\n\"The Jasper fire is hitting me pretty hard. You know how in Nova Scotia the ocean is your backyard. Jasper was pretty much my backyard growing up in Alberta. Lots of weekends spent adventuring. Last trip I ever took with Mom was to Maligne lodge. Just heartbreaking \ud83d\udc94,\" posted a dejected Jasper lover online.\n\n\"Had a wonderful, memorable breakfast @WickedCup in Jasper with friends in early June. It is the cafe attached to Maligne Lodge. Now it's gone. So devastating \ud83d\ude25. Thinking about Jasper friends and all towns folks right now,\" wrote another.\n\n\"This appears to be the beautiful Maligne Lodge burning in Jasper, Alberta, in the Canadian Rockies. The whole city was evacuated. I have stayed there. Given what happened to my hometown of Lahaina, my heart is with everyone who call Jasper home,\" chimed in a third.\n\nMany Albertans reacting online to the seriously horrific events unfolding at Jasper also took note of other fires burning in the region, especially those in and around Banff and Hector Lake.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Banff National Park reported a new fire burning south of Hector Lake inside the park late afternoon which resulted in a road closure to and from BC.\n\nMany Canadians, learning of the wildfires reaching Banff, were quick to share their concerns online\n\n\"I just saw that there's a fire near Banff now. I'm terrified,\" posted a worried X user.\n\n\"Dropped my mom, brother, and his gf off at the airport yesterday. They're in Canada for a week and a half and are in Banff this weekend. Supposed to go to Jasper next week. Hotel refunded their rooms 2 days ago. If the fire makes it to Banff it might actually break me \ud83d\ude2d,\" said another.\n\nThe United Conservative Party of Alberta and leader Danielle Smith are under fire for the decision to slash the wildfire budget and cut response strategy initiatives like the Wildland Firefighter Rappel back in 2019.\n\nCanadians online called out Smith for \"fighting all climate actions for years\" and \"cutting fire prevention funding\" only to request the federal government to help out with the Jasper tragedy in the end.\n\n\"The fire in Jasper, Alberta growing out of control is direct result of Danielle Smith not asking for help from the federal government sooner. Trudeau cannot help until a request comes from the Premier first. Alberta will continue to suffer until they start holding her accountable,\" a user wrote on X.\n\n\"Jasper is a National Park, yes. But there is no NATIONAL firefighting service. THAT is up to the province. The Feds send HELP to the PROVINCIAL firefighters. This is a Danielle Smith and UCP fuck up. Not Trudeau,\" said another.\n\n\"Danielle Smith is heartbroken but she defunded wildfire prevention and have no climate change plan.

I can't confirm how many locations or specific structures,\" said James Eastham, a wildfire information officer with Parks Canada.\n\n\"The pain and heartache that you feel is shared by each one of us,\" Ireland wrote. \"Please know that my thoughts are with all of you during this incredibly difficult time.\n\n\"To all the responders on the ground in our town -- our home -- words cannot express

thoughts are with everyone forced to flee their homes or lodging because of the wildfires and to \"those who are still in the community.\"\n\n\"Make sure if you can leave, please leave safely and take

through this, together.\"\n\nIt was not immediately clear when military assistance would arrive in the national park but officials confirmed help is also arriving from various municipalities in Alberta.\n\nGlobal News spoke to evacuees staying in nearby Hinton, Alta., on Wednesday night, when wet ash could be seen in the air.\n\nAman Singh, who works in Jasper, said that he left on Tuesday and that everybody realizes it is an \"intense situation.\"\n\n\"(It's a) hard situation for everyone who lives in Jasper,\" he said, adding he could feel \"ashes going into my lungs\" when he was outside.\n\nAs the wildfire situation in the Jasper townsite grew more intense Wednesday afternoon, some first responders were forced to leave because the situation had become too dangerous to stay.\n\nParks Canada officials said the air quality had deteriorated to the point that wildland firefighters and others without self-contained breathing apparatuses needed to leave.\n\nA Parks Canada official reiterated Wednesday night that safety is the agency's priority and that it was vitally important that all evacuees register at reception centres as soon as they can so officials know their

Unfortunately, we can't report on the extent of damage to specific locations or neighbourhoods at this time.\"\n\nThe blaze is one of hundreds ravaging Alberta and the neighbouring province of British Columbia, fuelled by a weeks-long heatwave and surge in lightning strikes.\n\nOfficials said the flames in Jasper reached a height of 122 metres (400 feet) and moved at 15 metres (50 feet) a minute.\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said early on Thursday that his government had approved Alberta's request for federal assistance.\n\n\"We're deploying [Canadian Armed Forces] resources, evacuations support, and more emergency wildfire resources to the province immediately -- and we're coordinating firefighting and airlift assistance. Alberta, we're with you,\" Trudeau wrote on X.\n\nParks Canada spokesperson James Eastham told reporters outside Jasper that the town is filled with smoke and there \"has been structural loss\".\n\n\"At this point, I can't confirm how many, locations or specific structures. The fire continues to burn,\" he said.\n\nExperts say the climate crisis has extended the Canadian wildfire season, which typically runs from late April until September or October, and increased lightning - a major cause of the blazes.\n\nMike Flannigan, research chair for predictive services, emergency management and fire science at Thompson Rivers University in British Columbia, told Al Jazeera last year that a warmer atmosphere also dries out fire fuels, such as the vegetation on forest floors.\n\nCanada saw its most intense fire season on record in 2023, with more than 6,600 wildfires burning 15 million hectares (37 million acres) across the country, an area roughly seven times the annual average.\n\nOn Wednesday evening, Jasper's Mayor Richard Ireland told the Canadian public broadcaster CBC News that multiple structures were burning in the community and \"it appears that the damage will be extensive\".\n\n\"This is simply, absolutely, our community's worst nightmare,\" Ireland said. \"Residents watching from afar, [it's] far beyond nervousness. I think like all residents, I feel devastated, shattered, and absolutely helpless in the face of nature, which is just so powerful.\"\n\nOne of the buildings destroyed by the fire was the Maligne Lodge hotel in the south of the town.\n\n\"It's just so sad to know that so many families and people have lost not just their belongings but their livelihood and a beautiful park,\" owner Karyne Decore told CBC.\n\nThere are 175 wildfires currently burning in Alberta, according to a provincial tracker, and more than 50 of them are out of control.", "source": {"uri": "aljazeera.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Al Jazeera Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jasper_National_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jasper National Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Rockies", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Canadian Rockies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provinces_and_territories_of_Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Provinces and territories of Canada"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Town", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Town"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefighter", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Firefighter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alberta", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alberta"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alberta"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefighting", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Firefighting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildfire", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wildfire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Trudeau", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Justin Trudeau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lightning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmonton", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Edmonton"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Edmonton"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Canadian Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parks_Canada", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Parks Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Canada", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_wave", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Heat wave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Columbia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "British Columbia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "British Columbia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thompson_Rivers_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thompson Rivers University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Jazeera", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Al Jazeera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Broadcasting_Corporation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canadian Broadcasting Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBC_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CBC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hectare", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hectare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_broadcasting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Public broadcasting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emergency management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-2162576364-1721915194.jpg?resize=1920%2C1365", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9760758", "eventUri": "eng-9760758", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

The residents have left, along with 20,000 park visitors.\n\nThe order to leave was issued around 10 p.m. Monday as fires cut off road access to Jasper. Residents and visitors fled west into British Columbia in a long, slow midnight procession through swirling smoke and ash.\n\nThe following day, evacuees in B.C. who didn't have a place to stay were directed to make the long drive around the fires back to Alberta to evacuation centres in Grande Prairie and Calgary.\n\nThe northern fire was spotted five kilometres from Jasper earlier Wednesday. The southern fire was farther away, but Parks Canada says strong winds sent it racing toward the town.\n\nThat forced crews using heavy equipment to pull back for safety. Water bombers were grounded due to dangerous flying conditions.\n\nAt the Grande Prairie evacuation centre, Addison McNeill recalled arriving in Jasper from Edmonton only to be told to get out.\n\n\"I moved there two hours before the evacuation notice,\" the 24-year-old said in an interview.\n\nMcNeill said she went to a nearby hotel, one of two meet-up points for those without transportation. She hopped in a recreational vehicle with others and headed out -- at a snail's pace.\n\n\"Every single person in town was beelining to one exit from about six different routes and so you get bottleneck, backups and congestion,\" she said.\n\nMcNeill said as she sat inside the vehicle, she felt so close to the wildfires that the windows seemed like they were going to shatter from the pressure of the hot, smoky air.\n\nShe saw acts of kindness amid the swirling ash: neighbours loaning their cars to those without; people knocking on doors to see if everyone inside was OK.",

Two of them, burning to the north and south, are threatening the town of Jasper. As of 12 pm. CST Wednesday, flames were five kilometres from the Jasper townsite.\n\nAround 25,000 people have left the national park since the evacuation notice Monday -- all with little advance warning.\n\nSaskatoon paddling instructor Bryan Sarauer, his wife and his daughter are on a road trip, and had stopped at Whistlers Campground just outside of Jasper.\n\nAfter emergency alerts Monday night, the family packed up and left at approximately 10:20 p.m. Sarauer said the evacuation order was sudden, but the leaving was slow. He said it took about three hours to travel three kilometres onto Highway 16.\n\n\"We never felt that we were that threatened by [the fire]. We felt that we needed to get out of harm's way to make room for the parks people to do their jobs ... taking care of the safety of tourists and visitors,\" said Sarauer.\n\nIt wasn't until 3:30 a.m. that the family arrived in the village of Valemount in east central B.C., where they were able to get gas and find a quiet place to park.\n\n\"And by four in the morning, we were curled up in the car as best we could in our car seats, you know, to try and get a little bit of rest,\" Sarauer said.\n\nThey managed to sleep a few hours before hitting the road again to head east back to Saskatoon.\n\nThis isn't the first time the family has encountered wildfires in their recent travels.\n\n\"We've driven by a lot of fire this summer. We've had numerous fires that we could see from the highways as we were driving and we even paddled through one fire on the Teslin River [in southern Yukon],\" Sarauer said.\n\n\"So lots of concern, I guess. And you do have to wonder how much of this is a new normal.\"\n\nSarauer said wildfires generally are a natural part of life. However, learning that flames are drawing nearer to Jasper does have him concerned for the locals.\n\n\"It's scary when it's threatening your home, your business, your livelihood, the place you work, the place you live,\" he said.\n\n\"Those of us who play there, I mean, it's sad to see that damage. It is part of the cycle and regrowth. But it's an entirely different story when you've got property, livelihoods and so on that are at risk.\"\n\nIn a news conference Wednesday morning, Parks Canada incident commander Katie Ellsworth said crews were facing another challenging day attempting to keep the flames away from homes and businesses.\n\nShe said \"aggressive\" fire behaviour is expected to continue.\n\nAs of Wednesday morning, the fire had scorched at least 270 hectares.\n\nThe fire burning south of town doubled in size overnight.

Official estimates suggest that the wildfire may have affected between 30% to 50% of the town.\n\nThe inferno, fueled by a recent lightning storm and high winds, prompted the evacuation of approximately 25,000 individuals from the region. In response, around 400 firefighters from various countries, including teams from Mexico, South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand, have been mobilized to assist with firefighting efforts.\n\nA heartfelt statement from Alberta Premier Danielle Smith highlighted the extensive rebuilding efforts required for the township. \"Jasper will require a significant rebuild,\" she commented during a press briefing.\n\nIn addition, Jasper's mayor, Richard Ireland, expressed deep concern over the situation, stating that the wildfire has \"ravaged our small, tight-knit mountain community.\" He further extended gratitude towards the emergency responders for their unwavering dedication.\n\nAs of now, detailed assessments of structural damage remain limited as efforts focus primarily on fire containment. Pierre Martel, who oversees national fire management at Parks Canada, described the fire's rapid escalation as \"just a monster,\" emphasizing the challenges faced by firefighters.\n\nWitness accounts from those in the area paint a vivid picture of the peril. Mike Ellis, Alberta's public safety minister, mentioned that the fire advanced swiftly, estimating that just moments passed between when it was 5 kilometers away and when it struck the town.\n\nThe community of Jasper, home to approximately 5,000 residents, has faced challenging conditions as they cope with the effects of the wildfire. The local infrastructure, vital to both residents and tourists, is under significant strain. In 2022, Jasper National Park welcomed nearly 2.5 million visitors, making this incident especially concerning for both the local economy and community wellbeing.\n\nThis wildfire event occurs in a context of ongoing wildfire challenges across Canada, with previous years witnessing severe fire conditions. Environment Canada has indicated the possibility of rainfall, providing a glimmer of hope for alleviating the dry conditions that have exacerbated the wildfire's spread.\n\nAuthorities and scientists continuously link the increase in natural disasters, including wildfires, to human-induced climate change, raising concerns about the future resilience of communities such as Jasper.\n\nThe emotional toll on residents is profound, with many grappling with the uncertainty of recovery.

The town and the park, which draws more than two million tourists a year, were evacuated on Monday, when officials estimated there were 15,000 visitors in the park.\n\nEnvironment Canada is forecasting 10 mm (0.4 inches) to 20 mm of rain for Thursday, which might help firefighters.\n\nThe blaze is one of hundreds ravaging the western provinces of Alberta and British Columbia. The federal government said in April that high temperatures and tinder dry forests meant this could be one of the worst years ever for fires in Canada.\n\nOfficials said the flames in Jasper reached a height of 400 feet and moved at 15 meters a minute.\n\n\"As the pictures and videos circulating online show, significant loss has occurred within the town site,\" Parks Canada said in a statement.\n\nThe federal government and other cities in Alberta are sending help. One major focus is the Trans Mountain oil pipeline, which can carry 890,000 barrels per day (bpd) of oil from Edmonton to Vancouver.\n\n\"Losing structures, community, is like losing a close friend ... (but) the people have been saved and that is significant.

The town and the park, which draw more than 2 million tourists a year, were evacuated on Monday, when officials estimated there were 15,000 visitors in the park.\n\n\"There is no denying that this is the worst nightmare for any community,\" Alberta premier Danielle Smith told reporters, saying the fire was still out of control.\n\n\"We're seeing potentially 30 per cent to 50 per cent structural damage ... that's going to be a significant rebuild.\"\n\nParks Canada said there had been a \"significant loss\" of buildings inside the town but added it could not give specific details of the damage or which areas had been hit.\n\nVideo from the town showed entire blocks had burned to the ground, including a church.\n\nJasper mayor Richard Ireland said the town was beginning to come to terms with \"the devastating impact\" of a fire that had ravaged the community.\n\nOne major concern for responders is if the fire reaches the Trans Mountain oil pipeline, which can carry 890,000 barrels per day of oil from Edmonton to Vancouver.\n\n\"At this time there is no indication of damage to our infrastructure, and the pipelines continue to operate safely,\" pipeline operator Trans Mountain said in a statement.\n\nThe federal government and other cities in Alberta are sending emergency crews. In addition, a total of 400 firefighters from Mexico, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand are due to arrive in the coming days.\n\nThere are currently 176 wildfires burning in Alberta, more than 50 of which are out of control. Around 10 of those blazes are close to the border with British Columbia, where dozens of fires are also out of control.\n\nOfficials said that at one point on Wednesday the flames had reached a height of 120m and were moving at 15m a minute.\n\nAshley Kliewer, co-owner of a restaurant in the middle of Jasper, told the Canadian Broadcasting crop she was devastated.\n\n\"I don't think anyone will be returning to Jasper any time soon and life is not going to be anywhere near what it was - it really is the end of an era,\" she said.\n\nThe Jasper fire could be one of the most damaging in Alberta since a 2016 conflagration that hit the oil town of Fort McMurray, forcing the evacuation of all 90,000 residents. The blaze destroyed 10 per cent of all structures in the city and shut in more than a million barrels per day of oil output.\n\nElsewhere, thousands of people were evacuated in northern California overnight, as yet another rapidly growing wildfire raged, joining hundreds of blazes in the Pacific Northwest and Canada that are sending smoke across swathes of the region, fire officials and weather services said.\n\nThe Park Fire in Butte County, California, exploded overnight from about 566 hectares on Wednesday to about 18,400 hectares on Thursday, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.\n\nIt's burning in California's Central Valley about 130km north of the state capital Sacramento, and was only 3 per cent contained on Thursday morning, said Cal Fire public information officer Dan Collins. No injuries were reported. Thousands were ordered to leave their homes.\n\n\"We have 400 firefighters and personnel on the scene, but we have units headed our way from all across the state,\" Collins said. \"The help is needed.\"\n\nMore than 4,000 people were evacuated in Butte County and the city of Chico, said Megan McMann a spokesperson for the Butte County Sheriff's Office.\n\nThe largest fire now burning in the United States, Oregon's Durkee Fire, has burned at least 97,000 hectares, threatened multiple small towns, scorched ranch land and killed cattle by the hundreds, local media reports said.\n\nHigh winds with lightning strikes Wednesday and overnight could fan the flames, said Marc Chenard, a forecaster with the National Weather Service in College Park, Maryland.\n\nThe fire, about 160km northwest of Boise, Idaho, was zero per cent contained on Thursday morning. More wind was forecast and lightning possible. - Reuters", "source": {"uri": "irishtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Irish Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

As of Wednesday it was still operating, with sprinklers being used to protect it.\n\nThere have been more than 400 fires recorded in British Columbia and 176 in the neighbouring province of Alberta.\n\nFires were first reported in Jasper last week. The town's mayor, Richard Ireland, told CBC that the town was facing its \"worst nightmare\".\n\nEleonor Dumlao told the Edmonton Journal she was filled with panic when her family received the evacuation order. They left Jasper on Monday night and headed to an evacuation centre in Edmonton.\n\n\"It was so very terrible experience for us, and I was so panicking that time. I don't know what to do. I don't know what to get first,\" she told the newspaper.\n\nJasper National Park said on X that \"air quality had deteriorated\" in the area. The park is the largest national park in the Canadian Rockies.\n\nAfter evacuations were issued, Alberta Premier Danielle Smith told residents to \"leave safely\" on Wednesday. In a post on Facebook, she said she was in \"constant contact\" with the authorities.\n\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau says his government has approved a request for federal assistance for Alberta.\n\n\"We're deploying @CanadianForces resources, evacuations support, and more emergency wildfire resources to the province immediately -- and we're coordinating firefighting and airlift assistance,\" Mr Trudeau said on X.\n\nDaniel Turner also recounted how he evacuated the wildfires to the Edmonton Journal, saying he followed evacuation orders with three of his friends but hit bumper-to-bumper traffic fleeing Jasper and turned around.\n\nThe group slept in a Canadian Tire parking lot.\n\n\"You could see it deteriorating, like ash falling,\" he said of the wildfire smoke.\n\nEarlier in the week, several US states including California and Utah were hit by wildfires.\n\nMore than 30 million people in the US have been affected by heat warnings since early July, according to the National Weather Service.

THE CANADIAN PRESS/Jeff McIntoshEDMONTON - One of two raging, wind-whipped fires menacing Jasper, Alta., has roared into town and begun burning buildings. Park officials say the fire entered the southern edge of the community at about 6:40 p.m. They say crews are battling multiple structural fires and working to protect key infrastructure.

Jasper is being menaced by fires from the north and south, and the town's 5,000 residents -- along with 20,000 more park visitors -- fled on short notice late Monday night when the fires flared up.

A call between Smith and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is also scheduled for 2:30 p.m.\n\nMinister of Public Safety and Emergency Services, Mike Ellis was also on hand during Thursday's provincial update and confirmed that the flames hit 100 metres in some areas Wednesday night.\n\nThe fire was accelerated by a significant gust of wind.\n\n\"That fire was about five kilometres out [and] there was an enormous wind gust,\" he said. \"That wind gust moved the fire five kilometers in probably less than 30 minutes, with a wall of fire that was about 100 meters high.\n\n\"I think people need to picture what those wildfire folks were experiencing at that time. Any firefighter will tell you, there's little to nothing you can do when you have a wall of flames coming in like that.\"\n\nEllis also confirmed that Edmonton, Calgary, and Grand Prairie are accommodating evacuees, noting mental health supports are also available.\n\nSome acute care patients have, however, have been taken to Edson and Hinton, with two patients being taken to Prince George.\n\nFirefighters from across 34 municipalities, Lakeland College and industrial firefighters from across the province have been called in to help battle structure fires in Jasper, according to Minister Ellis.\n\nIn total, nearly 1,900 Alberta firefighters, contractors and support staff are working to battle wildfires in the province.\n\nIn addition to this, Alberta Wildfire says crews from Australia landed over the weekend, and at least 400 additional firefighters from overseas are expected in the coming days -- 100 from Mexico later Thursday, 200 from South Africa are expected to arrive on Friday, and an additional 100 from Australia and New Zealand are expected Sunday and Monday.\n\n\"These resources will be sent around the province to areas where they will be most effective in the wildfire response,\" said Christie Tucker, the information unit manager with Alberta Wildfire. \"Alberta Wildfire has been active supporting Parks Canada in their response to wildfires.\"\n\nTucker adds the province has supplied water, trucks, heavy equipment, helicopters, and unit crews to Parks Canada officials, and offered air tanker and night vision equipped helicopters.\n\nDuring her opening speech on the update, Smith also went on to thank everyone who is currently helping battle wildfires across Alberta, before reassuring everyone from around the world that the magic of Jasper \"is not lost, and it will never will be.\"\n\n\"To the brave men and women currently in Jasper, I want to express my deep gratitude and the gratitude of all Albertans, whether you are part of the initial efforts or whether you were activated and drove in there last night or early this morning,\" said Smith.\n\n\"There really are not enough words to express our thanks and our wishes for your safety and your success. Once again, you put yourselves on the front lines in the show of true heroism. Thank you for your bravery and your commitment to keeping Albertans safe.\"\n\nAdding that residents, families, and business owners will recover from the wildfire.\n\nAlberta wildfire also provided an update on existing wildfires that are impacting the province.\n\nEvacuation orders are still in effect for John D'Or Prairie, Fox Lake, Garden River and Chippewan Lake.\n\nEvacuation orders have been lifted for the hamlet of Janvier due to recent rainfall in that part of the province, which has helped crews get the fire under control.\n\nIt is estimated that over 17,500 people have been displaced from wildfires. It is also believed that roughly 25,000 people were in the Jasper National Park at the time of its evacuation order earlier this week, with the majority of those being visitors.\n\nThe province added that those who are part of the mandatory evacuation order can register online, and receive some temporary funding from the province.", "source": {"uri": "edmonton.citynews.ca", "dataType": "news",

People started to panic in the campground, pulling out.\"\n\nShortly after that, a ranger came through the campsite and told everyone it was time to evacuate.\n\nHe and his companions spent the night camped out near Mt. Robson, on the B.C. side of the border. But most the RV-suitable roads home are blocked. Finding places to stop on a route full of detours is challenging. All the RV campgrounds are already booked, he said.\n\nAshley Kliewer and her husband drove to Edmonton with their two kids, pet guinea pig and two cats in the vehicle. Now they are waiting to hear whether the fire reached their home.\n\n\"The lack of information is excruciating,\" she said. \"I know at least a dozen families whose homes are gone. My understanding is the east end of town is completely burned.\"\n\nShe doesn't know if her home is still there, or if either of her family's restaurants is still standing.\n\nOne of those restaurants, the Peacock Cork & Fork, opened just last month.\n\n\"We poured every dollar, and then some, into getting this space open and it's such a beautiful concept.

Places you have so many memories of. It's so unbelievable how quickly things change.\"\n\nHe said he's been emailing everyone who had trips booked in the coming weeks, trying to explain the situation. To keep his business going, he will have to convince visitors to change their itineraries to activities outside of the park.\n\nP.E.I. musician Catherine MacLellan was visiting friends in Jasper during her tour of Western Canada when the evacuation order came at 10 p.m. She says traffic was \"bumper to bumper for hours and hours,\" with two of three exits out of Jasper closed due to encroaching fires.\n\n\"It was scary because there was this feeling that the fire could breech the town at any point. If you were stuck there in traffic and not able to get out, just the thought of that,\" said MacLellan.\n\n\"Once you hit the mountain road there's no cell service, so it's an intense place to be fleeing from in very slow traffic.\"\n\nThe group made it safely to Valemount, B.C. After a few hours of rest, MacLellan made the 12-hour drive to Calgary, where she had a place to stay with other friends.\n\nJasper was under threat from the north and south, and mandatory evacuation orders were issued Monday as the fires flared, forcing as many as 25,000 residents and visitors out.\n\nPark officials have reported \"significant loss\" in Jasper but have not detailed the damage to specific buildings or neighbourhoods.", "source": {"uri": "cbc.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campsite", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Campsite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Town", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Town"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildfire", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wildfire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jasper,_Alberta", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jasper, Alberta"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jasper, Alberta"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alberta", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alberta"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alberta"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreational_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Recreational vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jasper_National_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jasper National Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mountain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camping", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Camping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lightning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Park_ranger", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Park ranger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raven", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Raven"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guinea_pig", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Guinea pig"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmonton", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Edmonton"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Edmonton"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cork_(city)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cork (city)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cork (city)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine_MacLellan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Catherine MacLellan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valemount", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Valemount"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Valemount"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Summit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Canada", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Western Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiking", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hiking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Edward_Island", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prince Edward Island"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Prince Edward Island"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calgary", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Calgary"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Calgary"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 61}], "image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.7275065.1721924712!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/driving-home-from-jasper.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9760758", "eventUri": "eng-9760758", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1058823529411764, "wgt": 152, "relevance": 1}

Crews report witnessing \"300- to 400-foot flames,\" while up to 50 per cent of Jasper's buildings may be damaged. Luckily, there have been no reported fatalities so far.\n\nIf a fire can burn the town of Jasper in a national park that has the resources to deal with fire, what does the future hold for hundreds of small boreal forest towns across the country that do not have the means, know-how or resolve to accept that fire will come someday?\n\nJasper is the latest in a growing number of communities affected by wildfires. Twenty thousand people living in Yellowknife were evacuated from their homes for more than three weeks in 2023. The B.C. town of Lytton is still rebuilding after it burned in 2021.\n\nIndigenous people, who represent five per cent of the population, are disproportionately affected by wildfires, as First Nations communities comprise 42 per cent of evacuations. Residents of Fort Good Hope, a community that is mainly Indigenous in the Northwest Territories, were recently displaced from their homes for three weeks due to a wildfire.\n\nJasper reinforces just how much we need a national wildfire strategy to bring together all levels of governance within the business and Indigenous communities to map out a blueprint for how to better predict, prevent, mitigate and manage fires, and how to provide small boreal communities with the resources they need to make them more resilient.\n\nLongtime coming\n\nIn the summer of 2010, Parks Canada fire manager Dave Smith conducted aerial and ground surveys of three main valleys in Jasper National Park and found that 400 trees had been attacked by the mountain pine beetle.\n\nUntil then, Jasper had been one of the few regions on the east slopes of the Rockies that had not been seriously affected by this slow-moving catastrophe. This beetle species has destroyed pristine views, shuttered lumber mills, increased the threat of forest fires while dead needles are still in the trees and reshaped British Columbia's economy.\n\nIn 2011, I joined Smith on an aerial and ground survey to see how the infestation was progressing. So many trees in Jasper had been reddened by the pine beetle that Smith decided there was no use counting again; he would have to find some other way of monitoring the situation.\n\nRead more: How to protect your home from wildfires - here's what fire prevention experts say is most important\n\nBefore he retired, Smith told me that, although he loved his job, he had trouble sleeping at night on hot summer days. He worried about a wind-driven wildfire sweeping through the highly combustible needles still clinging to all those dead trees and the living stands of 80-year-old spruce and pine that were at risk of burning. It wasn't just the aging forest and dead needles that worried him; it was the intense heat, extended droughts and lightning that were intensifying in a rapidly warming world.\n\nParks Canada fire specialists like Smith have done a lot to prevent fire from coming into Jasper, Banff and other park towns across the country. Forests have been thinned, controlled burns have been ignited to reduce the threat of fire, and business and residential owners have been encouraged to make their properties fire smart.\n\nBut even that was not enough to save Jasper from the heartbreak its residents are going through. Jasper's aggressive response came too late to take the necessary actions to make the national park more resilient to fire. Perhaps, most critically, a century of fire suppression has left behind too many aging trees and not enough space for more resilient stands to be regenerated.\n\nThe scenes in Jasper are devastating but also depressingly predictable given the trajectory we've been heading towards since 2003 when Parks Canada was overwhelmed by fires burning in Kootenay, Jasper and Banff and other parts of the country -- and when more than 45,000 people were evacuated from the Okanagan.\n\nWaterton Lakes Park in Alberta dodged a bullet for nearly a century before the exceptionally intense Kenow fire ripped through it in 2017. Jasper got a scare in 2022 when the Chetamon Fire lit up the night sky. Is Banff next?\n\nAs Rob Walker, a former Parks Canada fire and vegetation specialist, noted in a Facebook post on July 25: \"Wildfire seasons will continue to worsen, and our political leadership must find a way to stop the madness of our addiction to oil and gas.\" It was Walker who told me the 2003 wildfire season was a harbinger of what we could expect in a rapidly warming world.\n\nRead more: COP28: Why we need to break our addiction to combustion\n\nLack of foresight\n\nAlberta no longer has a wildfire rappel team that can get to fires that are inaccessible to ground crews. Its fire science co-ordinator has long departed, and its wildfire budget is heavily weighted in favour of suppression over wildfire science. That has been left to the University of Alberta to do, even though its budget has been cut by more than 20 per cent.\n\nIn 2024, The Government of Canada invested close to $800 million in initiatives to improve wildfire management, including helping provinces and territories purchase additional firefighting equipment and training 1,000 firefighters across the country.\n\nIts investment in wildfire science pales in comparison.\n\nThere was a glimmer of hope in June when the Canadian Council of Forest Ministers met in Cranbrook, B.C. and ended their meeting with a promise to follow through on a national wildfire prevention and mitigation strategy. This time may be different, but we have heard this kind of promise many times before.\n\nMore dark days may be coming unless we develop a culture, and political policies, that respect fire, drawing upon the wealth of valuable insights in Indigenous fire stewardship practices.\n\nRead more: How Indigenous burning practices can help curb the biodiversity crisis\n\nFire has no ideology or preferences; it will always be quite simply a chemical reaction, a propulsive oxidation of hydrocarbons shaped by terrain, weather, climate and the combustible material around it. We must learn to live with fire, and find ways of containing it for fire will never learn to live with us.", "source": {"uri": "theconversation.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Conversation"},

Crews report witnessing \"300- to 400-foot flames,\" while up to 50 per cent of Jasper's buildings may be damaged. Luckily, there have been no reported fatalities so far.\n\nIf a fire can burn the town of Jasper in a national park that has the resources to deal with fire, what does the future hold for hundreds of small boreal forest towns across the country that do not have the means, know-how or resolve to accept that fire will come someday?\n\nJasper is the latest in a growing number of communities affected by wildfires. Twenty thousand people living in Yellowknife were evacuated from their homes for more than three weeks in 2023. The B.C. town of Lytton is still rebuilding after it burned in 2021.\n\nIndigenous people, who represent five per cent of the population, are disproportionately affected by wildfires, as First Nations communities comprise 42 per cent of evacuations. Residents of Fort Good Hope, a community that is mainly Indigenous in the Northwest Territories, were recently displaced from their homes for three weeks due to a wildfire.\n\nJasper reinforces just how much we need a national wildfire strategy to bring together all levels of governance within the business and Indigenous communities to map out a blueprint for how to better predict, prevent, mitigate and manage fires, and how to provide small boreal communities with the resources they need to make them more resilient.\n\nIn the summer of 2010, Parks Canada fire manager Dave Smith conducted aerial and ground surveys of three main valleys in Jasper National Park and found that 400 trees had been attacked by the mountain pine beetle.\n\nUntil then, Jasper had been one of the few regions on the east slopes of the Rockies that had not been seriously affected by this slow-moving catastrophe. This beetle species has destroyed pristine views, shuttered lumber mills, increased the threat of forest fires while dead needles are still in the trees and reshaped British Columbia's economy.\n\nIn 2011, I joined Smith on an aerial and ground survey to see how the infestation was progressing. So many trees in Jasper had been reddened by the pine beetle that Smith decided there was no use counting again; he would have to find some other way of monitoring the situation.\n\nRead more: How to protect your home from wildfires - here's what fire prevention experts say is most important\n\nBefore he retired, Smith told me that, although he loved his job, he had trouble sleeping at night on hot summer days. He worried about a wind-driven wildfire sweeping through the highly combustible needles still clinging to all those dead trees and the living stands of 80-year-old spruce and pine that were at risk of burning. It wasn't just the aging forest and dead needles that worried him; it was the intense heat, extended droughts and lightning that were intensifying in a rapidly warming world.\n\nParks Canada fire specialists like Smith have done a lot to prevent fire from coming into Jasper, Banff and other park towns across the country. Forests have been thinned, controlled burns have been ignited to reduce the threat of fire, and business and residential owners have been encouraged to make their properties fire smart.\n\nBut even that was not enough to save Jasper from the heartbreak its residents are going through. Jasper's aggressive response came too late to take the necessary actions to make the national park more resilient to fire. Perhaps, most critically, a century of fire suppression has left behind too many aging trees and not enough space for more resilient stands to be regenerated.\n\nThe scenes in Jasper are devastating but also depressingly predictable given the trajectory we've been heading towards since 2003 when Parks Canada was overwhelmed by fires burning in Kootenay, Jasper and Banff and other parts of the country -- and when more than 45,000 people were evacuated from the Okanagan.\n\nWaterton Lakes Park in Alberta dodged a bullet for nearly a century before the exceptionally intense Kenow fire ripped through it in 2017. Jasper got a scare in 2022 when the Chetamon Fire lit up the night sky. Is Banff next?\n\nAs Rob Walker, a former Parks Canada fire and vegetation specialist, noted in a Facebook post on July 25: \"Wildfire seasons will continue to worsen, and our political leadership must find a way to stop the madness of our addiction to oil and gas.\" It was Walker who told me the 2003 wildfire season was a harbinger of what we could expect in a rapidly warming world.\n\nRead more: COP28: Why we need to break our addiction to combustion\n\nAlberta no longer has a wildfire rappel team that can get to fires that are inaccessible to ground crews. Its fire science co-ordinator has long departed, and its wildfire budget is heavily weighted in favour of suppression over wildfire science. That has been left to the University of Alberta to do, even though its budget has been cut by more than 20 per cent.\n\nIn 2024, The Government of Canada invested close to $800 million in initiatives to improve wildfire management, including helping provinces and territories purchase additional firefighting equipment and training 1,000 firefighters across the country.\n\nIts investment in wildfire science pales in comparison.\n\nThere was a glimmer of hope in June when the Canadian Council of Forest Ministers met in Cranbrook, B.C. and ended their meeting with a promise to follow through on a national wildfire prevention and mitigation strategy. This time may be different, but we have heard this kind of promise many times before.\n\nMore dark days may be coming unless we develop a culture, and political policies, that respect fire, drawing upon the wealth of valuable insights in Indigenous fire stewardship practices.\n\nRead more: How Indigenous burning practices can help curb the biodiversity crisis\n\nFire has no ideology or preferences; it will always be quite simply a chemical reaction, a propulsive oxidation of hydrocarbons shaped by terrain, weather, climate and the combustible material around it. We must learn to live with fire, and find ways of containing it for fire will never learn to live with us.\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation, a nonprofit, independent news organisation bringing you facts and trustworthy analysis to help you make sense of our complex world.

Evacuations began as firefighters struggled to control the flames. The fire has caused significant structural damage, prompting a large-scale emergency response, including international firefighter support.\n\nA towering wildfire has wreaked havoc in Jasper, a renowned tourist destination in western Canada, potentially demolishing up to half of the town's buildings. Firefighters are racing against time to salvage what they can, authorities reported. Jasper is nestled in the mountainous Jasper National Park, Alberta -- a site drawing over 2 million annual visitors.\n\nAlberta Premier Danielle Smith, visibly emotional, described the situation as the community's worst nightmare. 'We are witnessing between 30% to 50% structural damage, making for a significant rebuild,' she stated, adding the fire remains uncontrollable.\n\nA reported 'significant loss' of buildings has occurred, though Parks Canada cannot confirm specific damages at this stage. Evacuation orders remain, as video footage reveals burnt vehicles and entire blocks, including historical sites like an Anglican church, reduced to rubble.\n\nResident Eva Korduliakova, currently abroad in the Czech Republic, discovered her house had burned. 'I am a single mom who became homeless and jobless overnight,' she shared.\n\nMayor Richard Ireland described the wildfires as having ravaged the tight-knit community, adding the destruction defies description. Critical infrastructure, such as the Trans Mountain oil pipeline, remains unharmed. However, CN Rail suspended operations as conditions worsened.\n\nApproximately 400 international firefighters are due to arrive, complementing local and federal emergency crews. Garlanded with 176 active wildfires in Alberta alone, the region faces a dire forecast, fueled by high temperatures and dry conditions. The Jasper fire, ignited by a lightning strike, escalated rapidly due to strong winds and lack of moisture, pushing the flames at alarming speeds.\n\nDespite potential rainfall relief, the Jasper fire stands as potentially the most devastating since the 2016 Fort McMurray blaze, which forced mass evacuations and destroyed substantial portions of the oil town.", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jasper_National_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jasper National Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Canada", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Western Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefighter", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Firefighter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildfire", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wildfire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Town", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Town"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danielle_Smith", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Danielle Smith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_of_Alberta", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Premier of Alberta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parks_Canada", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Parks Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglicanism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anglicanism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_National_Railway", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canadian National Railway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_transport", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pipeline transport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homelessness", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Homelessness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Petroleum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lightning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_McMurray", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fort McMurray"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Fort McMurray"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alberta", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alberta"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alberta"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czech_Republic", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Czech Republic"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Czech Republic"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Urban_Exploration", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Urban Exploration", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Emergency_Preparation/Safety", "label": "dmoz/Home/Emergency Preparation/Safety", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Construction_and_Maintenance/Restoration", "label": "dmoz/Business/Construction and Maintenance/Restoration", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/aiimagegallery/28_05_2024_04_02_47_5857682.png?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9760758", "eventUri": "eng-9760758", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 150, "relevance": 1}

The 400-room residence is run by Fairmont, a group owned by France's Accor.\n\nThe federal government and other cities in Alberta are sending emergency crews.

The blaze destroyed 10% of all structures in the city and shut in more than a million barrels per day of oil output.\n\nFort McMurray is forecast to receive up to 65 mm of rain in the next day, according to Environment Canada.\n\n(Reporting by David Ljunggren: Editing by Angus MacSwan; Editing by Aurora Ellis)", "source": {"uri": "theprint.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "ThePrint"}, "authors": [{"uri": "reuters@theprint.in", "name": "Reuters", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Town", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Town"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jasper,_Alberta", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jasper, Alberta"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jasper, Alberta"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parks_Canada", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Parks Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alberta", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alberta"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alberta"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Alberta", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Government of Alberta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_and_Climate_Change_Canada", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Environment and Climate Change Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Canada", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Government of Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_forecasting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Weather forecasting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefighter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Firefighter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildfire", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wildfire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jasper_Park_Lodge", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jasper Park Lodge"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jasper Park Lodge"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Columbia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "British Columbia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "British Columbia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AccorHotels", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "AccorHotels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Broadcasting_Corporation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canadian Broadcasting Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_transport", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pipeline transport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Petroleum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancouver", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vancouver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Vancouver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_McMurray", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fort McMurray"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Fort McMurray"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmonton", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Edmonton"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Edmonton"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurora,_Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aurora, Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Aurora, Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Emergency_Preparation", "label": "dmoz/Home/Emergency Preparation", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://static.theprint.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/theprint_default_image_new.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9760758", "eventUri": "eng-9760758", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 150, "relevance": 1}

There have been nearly 4,000 separate wildfires raging in the country this year and there are nearly 1,000 going at the moment. Two million acres have been lost to fires this year. The area around Jasper, Alberta, which includes one of Canada's most popular national parks, had to be hurriedly evacuated when a wildfire in the vicinity suddenly jumped up in intensity. From the CBC:\n\nParks Canada staff say aggressive fire behaviour prompted the decision to have thousands of people flee the Jasper area late Monday night. Parks Canada said at a media briefing Tuesday evening that the evacuation of the remaining hikers in the backcountry is still ongoing, but thousands of people have safely evacuated the park and the town. Up to 25,000 residents and visitors were evacuated since the order was made Monday night, as two fires raged south and north of Jasper, reaching within 12 kilometres of the townsite. By Tuesday afternoon, the wildfire south of the town had burned a minimum of 6,750 hectares, Parks Canada said, and the north wildfire, located between the Jasper Transfer Station and the Jasper Air Strip on both sides of Highway 16, had burned at least 270 hectares. When asked how the fire was able to come so close to the townsite before the alert was sent, incident commander Katie Ellsworth recounted a rapidly evolving situation leading up to the evacuation order. \"The situation unfolded very, very quickly,\" Ellsworth said, noting it was only a two-hour time frame from the start of the fires to when they were estimated to be of significant size.\n\nMuch of the evacuation had to be taken at night, which must have been a joy. Those clever Chinese climate hoaxsters are really on the job this year.\n\nRecently, the Pew Research Center published a report that found that there was a direct correlation between Americans who believe that the climate crisis and Americans who were immediately touched by its effects. This seems like it should be an obvious development but, hey, many of these people keep voting for people whose policies make the crisis worse, or who deny the existence of the crisis at all.\n\nSupport for regulating construction, but not for bans or mandates. Most Americans (73%) want stricter building standards in areas vulnerable to extreme weather. But more aggressive steps, like requiring people to move out of these areas, are unpopular (just 13% approve).Reports of extreme weather are common, though they vary by party. About seven-in-ten Americans say that in the past year, they've experienced at least one of five types of weather we asked about: severe weather, like floods or intense storms; unusually hot weather; droughts; wildfires; or rising sea levels. Democrats are more likely to report these experiences than Republicans, across each type of extreme weather, though the size of these differences vary by type.\n\nClimate change seen as a factor. Among those who say they've experienced any of these extreme weather events, a large majority say climate change contributed at least a little. Most Republicans - and nearly all Democrats - say climate change played a role. Hardships caused by extreme weather are wide-ranging. Those who say they suffered negative impacts of extreme weather events describe a host of challenges, in their own words. These include property damage, elevated utility and insurance bills, disruptions to daily life, and anxiety.\n\nAs the above evidence shows, this was a perfect time in history for the Supreme Court to defang the various regulatory agencies by eliminating the so-called \"Chevron deference.\" In Montana, the extraction industries already have heard the dinner bell ringing. From the Montana Free Press:\n\nTalen advised the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit that justices could no longer defer to EPA's judgment on new emissions standards affecting Colstrip. \"Courts must exercise their independent judgment in deciding whether an agency has acted within its statutory authority\" and \"may not defer to an agency interpretation of the law simply because a statute is ambiguous,\" Talen said in its advisory to the court.At issue are new pollution standards requiring tighter control of mercury and air toxics and, for the first time, carbon dioxide emissions. In corporate filings Talen and power plant shareholder NorthWestern Energy indicate the new rules, formalized in May, could render Colstrip uneconomical.\n\nRight now, today, the wildfires in western Canada are wreaking havoc with the air quality in Missoula and Butte and all over Montana, so why not let a corporation toss some mercury and excess CO2 into the mix as well? Everything is connected, and nobody is safe.", "source": {"uri": "esquire.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Esquire"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parks_Canada", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Parks Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildfire", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wildfire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jasper,_Alberta", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jasper, Alberta"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jasper, Alberta"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_weather", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Extreme weather"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hectare", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hectare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Town", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Town"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_park", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiking", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hiking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Broadcasting_Corporation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canadian Broadcasting Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pew_Research_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pew Research Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas_emissions", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Greenhouse gas emissions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_level_rise", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sea level rise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevron_U.S.A.,_Inc._v._Natural_Resources_Defense_Council,_Inc.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v.

Parks Canada spokesman James Eastham told reporters outside Jasper that the town is filled with smoke and there \"has been structural loss.\"", "source": {"uri": "newser.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newser"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rob_quinn@newser.com", "name": "Rob Quinn", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Town", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Town"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jasper,_Alberta", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jasper, Alberta"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jasper, Alberta"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Rockies", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canadian Rockies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_park", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildfire", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wildfire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parks_Canada", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Parks Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hinton,_Alberta", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hinton, Alberta"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hinton, Alberta"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme_Parks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme Parks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme_Parks/Individual_Parks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme Parks/Individual Parks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Camping", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Camping", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme_Parks/Defunct", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme Parks/Defunct", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme_Parks/Water_Parks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme Parks/Water Parks", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://img1-azrcdn.newser.com/image/1548096-12-20240725033617.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9760758", "eventUri": "eng-9760758", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.192156862745098, "wgt": 147, "relevance": 1}

He said the incident management team and fire responders are working valiantly to protect the town but that people's safety is the first priority.\n\n\"I write to you today with profound sorrow as we begin to come to terms with the devastating impact of last night's wildfire that has ravaged our beloved community. The destruction and loss that many of you are facing and feeling is beyond description and comprehension; my deepest sympathies go out to each of you,\" said Mr. Ireland on Thursday.\n\n\"Your resilience and strength have always been the backbone of our community. In the coming days and weeks, we will rally together, support one another, and begin the daunting process of recovery.\"\n\nHe said the local government is working closely with other levels of government, volunteers and other organizations to co-ordinate relief efforts and provide essential information and resources to those that have been affected.\n\nParks Canada, in an update on Thursday, said approximately 25,000 people were safely evacuated from the Town of Jasper and the national park and no injuries have been reported.\n\nThe agency said this emergency \"evolved rapidly\" with the wildfire hitting the town about 48 hours after it was first reported.\n\nJasper National Park received a small amount of rain overnight. While the rain helped reduce fire activity slightly, it is not enough to have made a meaningful impact to the overall wildfire situation, which remains out of control,\" said the update.\n\nFirefighting reinforcements arrived throughout the night, said Parks Canada, and are continuing to fight back the blazes and protect infrastructure.\n\n\"While we understand people are desperate to know about the status of our community, homes, work places, businesses, and cherished places we will need some time to stabilize this incident as we access and assess structures,\" said the agency.\n\nThe Canadian military is also on its way to help battle Alberta's raging wildfires, which are burning in every corner of the province, said federal Employment Minister Randy Boissonnault on X (formerly Twitter) Thursday morning. The army will help with evacuations, firefighting and airlift assistance, after the provincial government requested their help on Wednesday.\n\nFederal Emergency Preparedness Minister Harjit Sajjan also wrote on social media on Thursday that he is on his way to Edmonton to help co-ordinate efforts with \"various government agencies\" to respond to the rapidly-evolving wildfire situation.\n\n\"Our priority is the safety and well-being of the affected community members,\" said Mr. Sajjan.\n\nThe extent of the damage in Jasper is not yet known as dangerous conditions forced fire crews to retreat but videos and photos surfacing of the town show utter devastation with businesses, homes and vehicles burned to a crisp.\n\nThe owner of the Maligne Lodge, Karyn Decore, wrote on social media that the hotel was completely consumed by flames. Fairmont-owned Jasper Park Lodge also confirmed that the fire had reached the historic resort's ground on Wednesday night.\n\nAnnelies Lagger, who has owned and lived in the Austrian Haven B&B for over three decades, said she is patiently waiting to find out if her establishment was among the many that were burned to ashes Wednesday night. Ms. Lagger evacuated her lodge on Monday night with her 13 cats and a dog.\n\nNow, she said the only way to know the fate of her home and business is through photos circulating on Facebook groups. When she learned the Maligne Lodge had burned down, she said she lost the little hope she had remaining.\n\nShe has lived in Jasper for over 50 years, more than half of which she dedicated to building the bed and breakfast up.\n\n\"In these years, I have never been on holiday. Now, it's probably gone. All I could save were my cats and one dog,\" said Ms. Lagger, who added that she had no time to take any of her personal belongings when she fled. \"I'm 82 years old. I don't think I will survive much longer. My home was like my soul, my heart. It was everything.\"\n\nAs of Thursday morning, she said she is sheltering in Valemount at the home of a generous stranger who let her and her 14 pets in on Monday night after they were stranded on the roadside with nowhere else to go after having left their lives behind in Jasper.", "source": {"uri": "theglobeandmail.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Globe and Mail"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jasper_National_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jasper National Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Town", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Town"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildfire", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wildfire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alberta", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Alberta"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alberta"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parks_Canada", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Parks Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Local government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Siege"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefighting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Firefighting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randy_Boissonnault", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Randy Boissonnault"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Canadian Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_park", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provinces_and_territories_of_Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Provinces and territories of Canada"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harjit_Sajjan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Harjit Sajjan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valemount", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Valemount"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Valemount"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bed_and_breakfast", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bed and breakfast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quality of life"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hotel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jasper_Park_Lodge", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jasper Park Lodge"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jasper Park Lodge"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmonton", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Edmonton"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Edmonton"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Austria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Austria"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Grief,_Loss_and_Bereavement", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Grief, Loss and Bereavement", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://www.theglobeandmail.com/resizer/v2/6KT3HLUE6ZB3DAH3RC7CLGTTLE.jpg?auth=7c0337a165e98bad036794a683922c3f1357d825719664b7d8c1cb75b9a97ed3&width=560&quality=80", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9760758", "eventUri": "eng-9760758", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 147, "relevance": 1}

It is roughly eight kilometres away from the Town of Jasper, according to Incident Commander Katie Ellsworth.\n\nThe north fire, which is about five kilometres away from town, is still about 270 hectares.\n\n\u00d7\n\nAlready a Subscriber? Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nRain is forecasted for this evening and into Thursday morning. Ellsworth says commanders anticipate a reduction in fire activity if Jasper does receive precipitation, but gusty conditions mean the fire will likely grow before then.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nEllsworth confirmed to media that the town has not been impacted by fire.\n\nThe status of structures outside of town - such as the Palisades Centre, Caribou Recovery Centre, and the HI Athabasca Falls Wilderness Hostel - is unknown at this time. Heavy smoke and aggressive fire behavior have made it unsafe for responders to access these structures, according to Ellsworth.\n\n\"In terms of the Palisades Centre, we can confirm that it has been impacted. Because of the fire behavior yesterday, we don't know the extent of those impacts,\" Ellsworth said. \"We are hoping to be able to confirm those impacts as soon as we can, so that we can share that information both to the public and the business owners. But we do ask for your continued patience.\"\n\nFirefighters are taking steps to protect the town's infrastructure in case the southern fire continues to move northward. This includes the installation of high-volume sprinklers on the south side of the Parks Canada compound, and around the southwest perimeter of town from Patricia Place to the entrance of Stone Mountain Village. Sprinklers will also be installed around Pyramid Bench from west to east. Additionally, firefighters are removing combustible material and dry vegetation from town today, Ellsworth added.\n\nEllsworth asks that the public look to Parks Canada, the Municipality of Jasper, and Alberta Wildfire for accurate information on the fire, rather than using other resources like NASA's MODIS and FIRMS satellite imagery.\n\n\"At this time due to heavy, thick smoke conditions in Jasper, we cannot confirm the MODIS or FIRMS hits that you can see if you're looking at the satellite imagery,\" she said. \"These satellites do indicate heat registers, and it's not uncommon after a fairly aggressive burning day when things calm down for that heat to sink back down to the surface and be registered as a fire point.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nVoyent Alert! glitch\n\nJasper Mayor Richard Ireland, who also attended the press conference, thanked Jasper residents and visitors for their cooperation during the evacuation. However, he said he received reports this morning that the Voyent Alert! system used by the municipality did not work as intended.\n\n\"We gave out an emergency alert on our system - we use something called Voyent,\" he told journalists. \"It has come to my attention that some subscribers to that service did not receive the messages that we thought that they had received.\"\n\nIreland added that the Alberta Emergency Alerts system worked as expected.\n\nThe Voyent Alert! glitch has been fixed since the municipality learned of it earlier this morning, according to Ireland.\n\n\"All of these incidents undergo an after-action debrief. The whole system will be reviewed and we will see whether any corrections have to be made to prevent this happening, either in our location or other locations with the same sorts of mass alert systems,\" he said.\n\nHighway 16 partially cleared\n\nAccording to Drive BC, about 350 kilometres of Highway 16 has been cleared between Victoria Street and the B.C.-Alberta border, as of 11:01 a.m. today. There is still limited visibility due to smoke from 16 kilometres east of Tete Jaune to the Alberta border.\n\nHighway 16 eastbound is closed from the Mount Robson Visitor Centre to the Alberta border. The westbound lane is open only for evacuation purposes. Drive BC anticipates an update to Highway 16 at 4:30 p.m. today.", "source": {"uri": "thepeterboroughexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "thepeterboroughexaminer.com"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Indigenous people who previously lived on the land ignited some fires, and, governments and agencies didn't use to extinguish forest fires.\n\nThese smaller, more frequent fires would run out of fuel more quickly, he said.\n\n\"And now we have this just large buffet out there, which is just what fire needs,\" he said.\n\nComplicating the situation is the mountain pine beetle, which has ravaged parts of the park in the last two decades. The experts interviewed for this story said it leaves behind a heterogeneous network of dried debris that is sometimes extremely flammable, and at other stages, is at lower risk of igniting.\n\nClimate change and increased spells of hot, dry weather are no help, Gray said.\n\nThe Chilliwack, B.C.-based consultant said the number of prescribed burns happening in western Canada and the funding for such programs is inadequate to combat the volume of forest that's ready to burn.\n\n\"Right now it's stop, start, stop, start,\" he said. \"There's funding there one year, not the next. You can't retain people because there's no steady employment. It's a recipe for disaster.\"\n\nPrograms like FireSmart, which encourage property owners to build with less flammable materials, among other measures, have had limited success because these changes are expensive for citizens, Gray said.\n\nCBC News has requested an interview with FireSmart Alberta.\n\nBeverly says she's done research showing the Jasper townsite is particularly vulnerable to wildfire because it is located at the confluence of three mountain valleys, which fire would naturally migrate along.\n\nAnd no preventative burn or tree removal will allow the forest to withstand the power of a strong wind or an intense hot, dry spell, Beverly said.\n\n\"When it's really extreme, you can't expect these treatments to fulfil their goal,\" she said.\n\nSo far this wildfire season, about 540,000 hectares has burned in Alberta.

Hundreds of firefighters worked to battle the blaze through the night, but Alberta Premier Danielle Smith said Thursday that 30 to 50 per cent of the town's structures may be burned.\n\n\"We don't know which structures have been damaged and which ones are destroyed, but that's going to be a significant rebuild and significant displacement,\" she said.\n\nREAD ALSO: Alberta premier fights back tears as wildfire devastates iconic Jasper\n\nSeveral officials estimated the flames were about 100 metres tall when they entered Jasper.\n\n\"It's just a monster at that point. There are no tools we have in our tool box to deal with that at that point. You get out of the way, you retreat,\" Pierre Martel, director of fire management at Parks Canada, said. He added that no injuries have been reported so far.\n\nFirefighters continue to battle the wildfire Thursday and are working to save what remains of the popular tourist town. The Canadian Armed Forces have also been called into assist.\n\nThe BC Wildfire Service says the engines and crew members it sent were what it could spare while ensuring it still has enough resources to fight the more than 400 blazes burning in B.C.\n\nJasper evacuees were detoured through B.C. on Monday and Tuesday as they fled the town and made their way back to reception centres in Alberta. B.C. communities along the border did their best to support the influx of thousands of people, with some campgrounds providing sites free of charge and some residents opening up their homes.\n\nPremier David Eby noted earlier in the week that Alberta has supported B.C. in its wildfire fight on numerous occasions, and that B.C. was going to do its best to return the favour.\n\nDealing with its own evacuation orders though, the province was unable to support the Albertan evacuees for long.\n\nAs of Thursday morning, an estimated 1,400 British Columbians are under evacuation order and another 6,000 are under alert, according to the Ministry of Emergency Management and Climate Readiness.\n\nThere are 423 wildfires burning in the province, five of which are considered wildfires of note, meaning they are especially visible or pose a threat to the public.

While the town is home to 4,700 people, Jasper National Park draws thousands of visitors each year as it is one of Alberta's top tourist destinations.\n\nWarren Singh, executive director of the Alberta Construction Association, said it is too soon to fully understand the extent of the damage and just assessing those could take up to six months.\n\nPointing to the example of Alberta's Fort McMurray, which was swept by a ferocious 2016 wildfire, Warren said recovery for Jasper could also take five years or longer, depending on the damages.\n\nIn the aftermath of the wildfire, Singh said rebuilding communities like Jasper could be a \"logistical nightmare,\" involving sorting out what is needed in terms of cleanup, critical infrastructure damage and reckoning with the effects of blazes on the local environment.\n\nSpeaking from his own experience in Halifax, Savage said there is no set timeline for recovery from a wildfire as there are several challenges along the way and that rebuilding work only begins after the immediate danger is over.\n\nThings like finding emergency housing, feeding people and rescuing pets come before and that's where communities from across the country have to step in and come together to help, he said.\n\n\"I think the key is to come together and recognize that whether your house is there or gone, you're part of the solution and you work with your neighbours and make things better.\"\n\nNorthern Alberta town Slave Lake is among those offering assistance, with its fire chief and a crew en route to support, Mayor Francesca Ward told Global News.\n\nFor the people of Jasper, she said: \"We understand what you are going through, and our entire town's hearts are breaking with you.\"\n\nSlave Lake was in a similar situation in 2011, when a wildfire burned about one-third of the town.\n\n\"Patience is what is needed, and time to process,\" Ward said.\n\n\"To this day, when I smell smoke from wildfires and hear reports of fires in the vicinity, it causes that little hint of anxiety and memories to flood back of the wildfires. \"\n\nShe said the community's most immediate need will be financial resources and having access to immediate funding will aid in the recovery efforts in the weeks ahead.\n\nBecause Jasper, which is located in the Rocky Mountains, is a mountainous region, that presents its own unique set of challenges for rebuilding, such as access for services and having to cut through rock beds, Singh said.\n\nIn terms of environmental issues, wildfires also cause complex problems, such as vegetation loss, soil erosion, a decrease in water quality and a rise in the potential for flash flooding, he added.\n\nWard said the most significant challenge, other than locating builders and resources in more remote communities, would be communication.\n\n\"Evacuation, interim housing and rebuilding all require substantial moving parts, and communicating this to the relevant stakeholders is a huge hurdle.\"\n\nIn British Columbia, rebuilding efforts for fire-devastated Lytton have been slow.\n\nCement for Lytton's first home rebuild was finally poured in December 2023 - more than two years after a massive wildfire devastated the B.C. village.\n\nSingh said building permit processes can take time, while residents will be eager to move back quickly.\n\nSupply chain issues and safety concerns may also arise in the rebuild process, he said.\n\nFrom figuring out insurance to building to current standards to getting the workforce, there is a lot required to rebuild following a natural disaster, while also making sure the infrastructure can withstand future calamities, Savage said.\n\n\"The simple fact is, we can't just build back to the way it was with the changing climate,\" he said.\n\nAnd no matter how long it takes Jasper to rebuild, it's never really quite the same.\"", "source": {"uri": "globalnews.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "Global News"},

In a Facebook post earlier this morning, Jasper National Park wrote that the area received rain overnight, but \"it is not enough to have made a meaningful impact to the overall wildfire situation, which remains out of control.\"\n\nLast night, firefighters without self-contained breathing apparatuses were evacuated to Hinton. However, a number of structural firefighters remain in town to preserve what structures they can, according to Martel.\n\n\"We know many residents and business owners will be anxious to hear about the status of their own businesses,\" Martel added. \"We ask that people respect the area closure. We'll be able to provide further updates and more information as soon as conditions allow.\"\n\nJasper Mayor Richard Ireland echoed these comments.\n\n\"We simply need to have verifiable information,\" Ireland said. \"Until we can verify from people on the ground, our stance is that it would be irresponsible to try and confirm things based on unverified facts.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"We are as anxious as anybody to get detailed, verified information so we can share it with other residents. But until we have that, we have nothing to share.\"\n\nWhile Alberta Premier Danielle Smith told journalists in an earlier press conference that there is structural damage in 30 to 50 per cent of the town, Parks Canada was unable to confirm these numbers, according to External Relations Manager Natalie Fay.\n\nChief of the Valemount and District Volunteer Fire Department, Rick Lalonde, messaged The Goat with his assessment of the situation.\n\nAccording to him, the fire boss in Jasper estimated 25 per cent of structures had been destroyed when volunteers from Valemount arrived last night. Since then, more structures have been destroyed due to strong winds carrying sparks.\n\n\"Today there are 60 fire trucks, 6 pieces of equipment, 160 firefighters mopping up structures and burning brush,\" Lalonde said.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nHowever, Parks Canada reminds people to take images and information from social media with a grain of salt. In response to a question from The Goat about whether Parks Canada is regulating the sharing of images and information from people on the ground, Fay said the organization is not attempting to stop the spread of images on social media.

This situation escalated significantly on Tuesday as flames engulfed buildings, affecting the local community and the natural environment.\n\nAs reported by officials, the wildfires have caused substantial damage within Jasper National Park, leading to what has been described as \"significant loss\" within the town's vicinity. The fires are part of a broader series of wildfires affecting parts of western Canada, specifically Alberta and British Columbia.\n\nIn the past week, the region has experienced over 58,000 lightning strikes, which have contributed to the ignition of new fires following a prolonged heat wave lasting three weeks. The BC Wildfire Service highlighted the connection between the extreme weather and the rise in fire incidents.\n\nAn extensive firefighting operation is currently underway, with around 1,900 firefighters from Alberta deployed to tackle the flames. In addition to local efforts, teams from Alaska and Australia have also been brought in to assist in preserving critical infrastructure from the advancing fires.\n\nAmong the structures under threat is the Trans Mountain Pipeline, which runs through Jasper National Park. While the pipeline continues to operate safely as of Wednesday, precautions, including the use of sprinklers, are being implemented to mitigate any potential risks.\n\nBritish Columbia and Alberta have individually reported over 400 and 176 active fires, respectively. The initial fires around Jasper were identified last week, with the town's mayor describing the unfolding events as their \"worst nightmare.\"\n\nDue to the smoke and fire activity, air quality in the area has sharply declined, impacting residents and visitors of the park, which is known as the largest in the Canadian Rockies.\n\nFollowing the evacuation orders, Alberta Premier Danielle Smith has urged residents to evacuate in safety. She mentioned being in \"constant contact\" with emergency authorities to coordinate the response. Additionally, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has affirmed that federal assistance is being mobilized to support Alberta's firefighting efforts.\n\n\"We're deploying @CanadianForces resources, evacuations support, and more emergency wildfire resources to the province immediately -- and we're coordinating firefighting and airlift assistance,\" stated Mr. Trudeau.\n\nThis particular crisis in Canada is part of a larger trend of wildfires affecting the United States and Canada. A significant number of wildfires have also been reported in states like California and Utah, with over 30 million individuals under heat warnings across several western states.", "source": {"uri": "theglobalherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Global Herald"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jasper_National_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jasper National Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildfire", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wildfire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alberta", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Alberta"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alberta"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Canada", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Western Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lightning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Natural environment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Columbia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "British Columbia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "British Columbia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BC_Wildfire_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "BC Wildfire Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_weather", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Extreme weather"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_wave", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Heat wave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_transport", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pipeline transport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefighting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Firefighting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefighter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Firefighter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alaska"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alaska"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Rockies", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canadian Rockies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danielle_Smith", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Danielle Smith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_of_Alberta", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Premier of Alberta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provinces_and_territories_of_Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Provinces and territories of Canada"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_pollution", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Air pollution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Trudeau", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Justin Trudeau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Utah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Utah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9760758", "eventUri": "eng-9760758", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 132, "relevance": 1}

And the only thing that matters in this province is the ability of fossil fuel producers to continue to do their work mostly unhindered by the effects of the extreme weather that has become increasingly common during this century for some reason.\"\n\nWhile the vast majority of scientific experts agree that there is an unequivocal connection between global warming caused by the burning of hydrocarbons and the increase in wildfires that have turned summers in Canada into deadly, smokey infernos, Premier Smith has made it clear that she is not interested in playing the blame game about these fires, unless she can blame Trudeau.\n\n\"While I don't want to point fingers during this ongoing tragedy, this is all very likely Trudeau's fault,\" Smith continued. \"Not because of his own support of the oil industry and its wonderful pipeline,\" Smith hastily added, \"but for not taking better care of Jasper National Park, a federal responsibility.\"\n\n\"The UCP has spent most of the last five years cutting Alberta's wildfire preparedness budget, and Trudeau's government should've known that this kind of fire was going to grow out of control in this province because of our cuts and should've been better prepared for it.\"\n\n\"Finally, I want to assure the folks in Jasper that we will rebuild,\" Smith said. \"I don't care how long it takes. And I mean that literally, rebuilding Jasper will likely take a very long time and I sincerely doubt I or anyone else in my government will sincerely care about this a year from now, or five, or ten.

They had been waiting to find out when they could go home.\n\nSuddenly, word began trickling in that the firefighters guarding their homes had pulled out -- it was too dangerous to keep fighting the fire threatening the picturesque mountain community.\n\nFifteen minutes later, someone shouted: \"The Petro Canada just blew up.\"\n\nA photo of Jasper's Wicked Cup Caf\u00e9 in flames started circulating.\n\nA group of four grabbed one another in a hug.\n\n\"There's not going to be a lot left of Jasper by tomorrow,\" said Jeff Morris, through tears.\n\nMr. Morris was working as a guide at Sun Dog Tours on Monday night, when his boss phoned to tell him he had to get out because the entire town was under evacuation order. Mr. Morris drove quickly to the office, jumped into a tour bus and headed for the local senior's home, loading everyone inside for the frightening, late night drive to Valemount.\n\nThe tiny B.C. town of Valemount is like a sister community to Jasper, Nicole Dryden explained. \"It's where Jasper folks go to settle down when they finally grow up,\" added Jasper bartender, Hannah Basso.\n\nValemount is small enough that each of the 11 graduating students from Valemount Secondary has their photo displayed on a lamp post on Fifth Avenue, the town's main drag. That kind of community spirit has also embraced the evacuees.\n\n'Significant loss' in Jasper as wildfires close in, burning buildings and forcing fire crews to retreat\n\nAround 11:45 p.m. on Monday, Ms. Dryden and her husband learned people from Jasper were headed their way. Within hours they had taken in a group of eight Ukrainian refugees. Their Ukrainian guests are in shock: \"They keep saying: Two months ago, we evacuated our country. Where do we go now?\"\n\n\"They've never even been outside Jasper until now,\" she added.\n\nSeveral evacuees are sleeping at the Legion, the community hall, and a local church. The Valemount Pines Golf and R.V. Park is letting evacuees camp out on their grounds.\n\n\"I've never met nicer people -- ever,\" said Jasperite Eric Daniels. He and his wife Katie Potter manage a Bearcat Pizza in Jasper.\n\n\"When the fire started, it was 30 kilometres from town. Two hours later, the whole town was ordered to evacuate. I've never seen a fire move that quick.\"\n\n\"Our whole life -- it's gone.\"\n\nMs. Basso broke down in tears after learning the lodge abutting her apartment was in flames.\n\n\"I don't even have shoes,\" she said. \"We left with the clothes on our backs. The last thing we took was our marriage certificate. Unfortunately, I forgot my Permanent Resident documents. That's going to be quite a problem,\" she added..\n\nThe former lawyer from Australia and her Canadian-born husband are camping at a friend's house in Valemount.\n\n\"I feel numb and devastated,\" she said, adding a recent heat wave and continuing drought had left her and many others in Jasper with a sense of dread that the town was a tinder box.\n\n\"We're used to fires back home. But this one moved faster than any fire I've ever seen.\"\n\nValemount resident Swanny Pleister is also anxious. She took in 15 Jasper evacuees -- mostly friends and family -- at her farm outside Valemount. But conditions in the area, too, are threatened by wildfire.\n\n\"The problem is, we have two more fires threatening our home,\" she explained..\n\nShe and her husband spent the night before their evacuees arrived installing a sprinkler system on their roof.

Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nJasper residents Dorothy and David Marquis told The Goat it was the first time they'd been evacuated after living in the town for 40 years.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"This was just crazy. There was no notice,\" Dorothy said. \"There was a notice that there was a severe thunderstorm in Jasper, that's all we heard. And then next thing we knew, we were under alert, and then we were out. If you weren't ready to go, you just left.\"\n\nDorothy said she was only prepared to evacuate because a neighbour who worked for the Municipality of Jasper advised her to pack her car before the evacuation alert was issued. She was particularly frustrated because her husband, David, has mobility issues and would have struggled to leave on shorter notice.\n\nThis was the second evacuation that Hunter Chateau, a summer student working at Jasper National Park, has been through. Last year, she had to evacuate her hometown of Grande Prairie, Alberta - this time around, she felt more prepared.\n\n\"This one was much more organized. There was actually time, and people actually put in the effort to notify residents,\" Chateau said. \"From experience with that last one, and having family and friends go through it, I was already packing two days before the evacuation.\"\n\nNot everyone was as prepared as Chateau. Teresa and Douglas Wright, who were visiting Jasper National Park from California, were unable to return to their trailer in time to collect their things.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe Wrights had just driven into the Town of Jasper after spending the afternoon driving through the park when they got the evacuation alert. It caught them off-guard, Teresa said.\n\n\"Earlier I had called the visitors centre, and I said, 'How do we know if there's a fire? It's getting awfully smoky over here.' She said it was smoke coming from Washington, there was one small little fire but they had it under control.\"\n\nOnce they got notice of the evacuation order, the Wrights tried to return to their trailer in Wapiti Campground, but were told they couldn't drive back into the park. Someone who was managing traffic control at the park advised them to head west.\n\nWord about Valemount's welcome centre spread through Facebook and the hospitality industry in a hectic game of telephone. Chateau had friends who sent her Facebook posts about the village's community hall, while the Wrights were instructed to go to the community hall when they tried to book a hotel in town.\n\n\"I'm feeling much better now that I'm not in a car following the convoy. I understand that's what everybody had to do, but it's nice to be out,\" Chateau said. \"I'm just praying for everybody to make it out safe, and wishing the firefighters all the best.\"", "source": {"uri": "thepeterboroughexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "thepeterboroughexaminer.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "abigail_popple@thepeterboroughexaminer.com", "name": "Abigail Popple", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valemount", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Valemount"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Valemount"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Town", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Town"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jasper,_Alberta", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jasper, Alberta"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jasper, Alberta"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jasper_National_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jasper National Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alberta_Highway_16", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alberta Highway 16"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocky_Mountains", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rocky Mountains"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Montana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Montana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunderstorm", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thunderstorm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grande_Prairie", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grande Prairie"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Grande Prairie"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elk", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Telephone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hotel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefighter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Firefighter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_County,_Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Douglas County, Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Douglas County, Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/thepeterboroughexaminer.com/content/tncms/custom/image/c7910cd6-fbf6-11ed-943a-477f8589b241.png?resize=600%2C600", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9760758", "eventUri": "eng-9760758", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 122, "relevance": 1}

Varshavska was forced to flee Jasper and has registered at an evacuation cente in Calgary. Two years ago she fled the war in Ukraine to find a safer life in Canada. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Bill Graveland\n\nAlice Varshavska didn't expect this to happen again.\n\nTwo years ago, she fled war-torn Ukraine seeking a better life. She found it in Jasper, Alta.\n\nBut the 26-year-old restaurant server was forced to flee the picturesque Rocky Mountain tourist town as wildfires encroached on Monday night. On Thursday, she found herself registering at an evacuation centre in Calgary.\n\n\"I'm still trying to have a good mood. We flew from Ukraine and cried out all of our tears and collected all those things and left everything behind and now like it's just happened again and you are like, 'OK, I need to stay strong,'\" Varshavska said.\n\n\"I need to keep going and figure things out. If God wants it like that, then maybe it makes us stronger.\"\n\nVarshavska, who said she may look for work in Calgary, said nobody initially suspected anything was wrong. Then she saw drivers lined up to buy gasoline.\n\n\"I come out of work and then I see the ashes falling down and like, 'What is going on?' And you look on the other side there is this huge smoke coming up.\"\n\nShe said she packed quickly, bringing only documents, her phone and her most important belongings. It took two days to get to Calgary and the possibility of going back to Jasper is fading.\n\n\"I just got the video from my friends and it's all burned ... Even the houses made of stone all burned,\" she said.\n\n\"We still had a hope, me and my friends, that maybe some of the things will still be there when we come back and it's just hard to realize that all of your memories are just gone.\"\n\nPreliminary reports indicate a third and perhaps up to half of the structures in the Jasper townsite have been destroyed, Alberta Premier Danielle Smith said Thursday.\n\nAbout 25,000 people, including about 5,000 Jasper residents, were forced to flee west at a moment's notice late Monday night as twin wildfires from the south and north roared through, cutting off access to the east and south.\n\nRhett Fleming has worked at the golf course at the Fairmont Jasper Park Lodge for the past five years. He said he was waiting for an update from resort management about the damage.\n\nFleming said the smoke came out of nowhere, followed by a strong wind that blew it through town.\n\n\"It was scary and I never experienced anything like that and wouldn't wish that upon anybody,\" Fleming said as he was entering the Calgary evacuation centre.\n\n\"A lot of people I know who have been in that community 40, 50, 60 years ... their lives are there. Their houses are gone.

For thousands of Canadians and mountain-lovers around the world, it's the smell of cherished memory going up in smoke.\n\n\"It's a huge amount of history and memories that are now lost,\" said Alexis Keinlen, an Edmonton writer who recalls the winter 2015 wedding of a friend.\n\nBefore the ceremony, the party gathered in the evening on the shores of Lake Agnes on the grounds of the Jasper Park Lodge, now at least partially burned. They clasped mugs of hot chocolate around roaring fires or laced up skates for a turn on the ice.\n\nThe dark of the lake and the clarity of the sky felt \"otherworldly,\" she said.\n\n\"You could see all the stars above. It felt really big.\n\n\"One of my friends gave her child the name Jasper.\"\n\nA decade ago, Kelley Ware was living in Prince George, B.C., and her now-husband was in Edmonton. Every few weeks, they'd meet in Jasper.\n\n\"It was completely fundamental to building our relationship. My husband has a tattoo of Pyramid Mountain.\"\n\nFor Janet Millar, the memories go back generations.\n\nHer great-grandfather was on a roadbuilding crew in Jasper in 1948 when he noticed that lots were going up for sale around Lake Edith. He and his wife walked around it, chose their favourite spot and the next year built the cabin that has been in the family ever since.\n\n\"It's the smell of an old log cabin that has had a lot of bacon and pancakes and syrup served in it. It's the sight of old furniture that no one can bear to part with,\" she said.\n\n\"Everyone in my family and all sorts of friends have their own particular thing they like best. There's so much I like about it that I can't bear to part with.\"\n\nSocial media was awash Thursday with memories of Jasper proposals, weddings and honeymoons. But the town is steeped in memory of all kinds.\n\nThere's the generations of skiiers who have partied in the Whistle Stop pub or Athabasca Hotel, known locally as the Atha-B and a fixture since 1929. The families who carbed up for the day's adventures at Smitty's. The holidayers from around the world who met and gabbed in hotel hot tubs.\n\nThe worshippers at the gracious Anglican church of St. Mary and St. George, who have gathered since 1928 to praise God in the midst of some of His finest handiwork.\n\nThe classic fieldstone headquarters of Parks Canada, across the street from where travellers on Via Rail's Rocky Mountaineer disembarked to gape at the vista. The cheeky Fiberglas statue of Jasper the Friendly Bear, rubbed shiny since the '60s by the hands of children.\n\nThe roadside greeter elk casually grazing, charming visitors turning off Hwy 16 into town.\n\nThe great and famous, too, are part of Jasper's memory.\n\nFilm star Marilyn Monroe, in town with co-star Robert Mitchum to film the 1954 western \"River of No Return,\" was famously escorted from the dining room of the Jasper Park Lodge for inappropriate dress. That same year saw the release of \"The Far Country,\" for which the Lodge hosted Jimmy Stewart.\n\nBing Crosby was by in 1946 to film \"The Emperor Waltz\" and returned regularly to golf on the Lodge's renowned course. Anthony Hopkins and John Travolta have vacationed there.\n\nRoyalty first came to visit in 1939 when King George VI and Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother, stayed at the Jasper Park Lodge's Outlook Cabin. Their daughter, Queen Elizabeth II, stayed there with her husband Prince Phillip in 2005.\n\nBut Jasper's memories are not primarily of glitz and bling. It's an everyone kind of place.\n\n\"Our family had a dock that was always painted yellow,\" said Millar.\n\n\"All of us remember jumping off that dock and watching people come out from town and using it. That was always really special. It was heartwarming for us to see people enjoying the dock.\"\n\nWare remembers the fellowship.\n\n\"Striking up conversations with people and having an hour-long chat. Making friends with the bartenders. And just really feeling like you belonged.\"\n\nThursday morning, Parks Canada reported the fire remained out of control despite a small amount of rain overnight. Firefighting reinforcements had arrived to defend the town.\n\n\"While we understand people are desperate to know about the status of our community, homes, workplaces, businesses, and cherished places we will need some time to stabilize this incident as we access and assess structures,\" the agency said in a statement.\n\n\"We appreciate your patience and the community of people who have come together to support the people of Jasper and Parks Canada family.\"\n\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published July 25, 2024.", "source": {"uri": "winnipegfreepress.com", "dataType":

She found it in Jasper, Alta.\n\nBut the 26-year-old restaurant server was forced to flee the picturesque Rocky Mountain tourist town as wildfires encroached on Monday night. On Thursday, she found herself registering at an evacuation centre in Calgary.\n\n\"I'm still trying to have a good mood. We flew from Ukraine and cried out all of our tears and collected all those things and left everything behind and now like it's just happened again and you are like, 'OK, I need to stay strong,'\" Varshavska said.\n\n\"I need to keep going and figure things out. If God wants it like that, then maybe it makes us stronger.\"\n\nVarshavska, who said she may look for work in Calgary, said nobody initially suspected anything was wrong. Then she saw drivers lined up to buy gasoline.\n\n\"I come out of work and then I see the ashes falling down and like, 'What is going on?' And you look on the other side there is this huge smoke coming up.\"\n\nShe said she packed quickly, bringing only documents, her phone and her most important belongings. It took two days to get to Calgary and the possibility of going back to Jasper is fading.\n\n\"I just got the video from my friends and it's all burned ... Even the houses made of stone all burned,\" she said.\n\n\"We still had a hope, me and my friends, that maybe some of the things will still be there when we come back and it's just hard to realize that all of your memories are just gone.\"\n\nPreliminary reports indicate a third and perhaps up to half of the structures in the Jasper townsite have been destroyed, Alberta Premier Danielle Smith said Thursday.\n\nAbout 25,000 people, including about 5,000 Jasper residents, were forced to flee west at a moment's notice late Monday night as twin wildfires from the south and north roared through, cutting off access to the east and south.\n\nRhett Fleming has worked at the golf course at the Fairmont Jasper Park Lodge for the past five years. He said he was waiting for an update from resort management about the damage.\n\nFleming said the smoke came out of nowhere, followed by a strong wind that blew it through town.\n\n\"It was scary and I never experienced anything like that and wouldn't wish that upon anybody,\" Fleming said as he was entering the Calgary evacuation centre.\n\n\"A lot of people I know who have been in that community 40, 50, 60 years ... their lives are there.

Parks Canada are out there with assistance from other firefighters from the province and from other national parks across the country, and they're assisted with aerial support as well. But it is a very aggressive wildfire, really quite large, and still bearing down towards the town - so a significant threat for our entire community.\n\nMH: The aggressiveness of this fire is certainly a big point in this whole discussion. So if we dial back the clock, your thoughts on what it took to safely evacuate such a large number of people from your community, especially considering so many were tourists.\n\nRI: I think it speaks highly, both to all of the individuals who became the evacuees. People have been encouraged to take up incentives to be prepared over the last number of years, starting many years ago with other wildfires in Alberta. The sense, at least for residents, of 72-hour kits and having their documents already organized and ready to go: water and medications and all that stuff. We have really been aggressive with our messaging on that. And for our own residents, I think the uptake was stupendous. For visitors, I can only be somewhat incredulous at their ability to be so responsive, to hear the message and then to comply. The evacuation order came quite quickly on the heels of the evacuation alert. That, again, was just a testament to the really dynamic nature of this particular fire that caused the threat. People had hours to get out, approximately 25,000 people in total. Only one exit route from all of Jasper remained, because of fires north and south of the town, and all of those people safely evacuated beginning - unfortunately - at 10 o'clock in the evening and through the wee hours of Tuesday morning. But everybody got out safely with no significant incidents at all.\n\nMH: Now you're the mayor of a community within a national park, a national park that is within the province of Alberta. How challenging is it to navigate that dynamic in an emergency situation like this?\n\nRI: I suppose many looking from the outside would see that as a challenge, and in some respects it is, but it is our reality. And so we have worked closely with all of those agencies over a number of years and particularly with respect to emergency response and wildfire preparedness. We have held practice scenarios with all of the involved agencies, so that includes Alberta Emergency Management, Parks Canada and our own municipal team. And plans have been coordinated in advance how we're going to deal with this. We have gone into something called Unified Command. The fire is on the landscape, so Parks Canada, as having the expertise in wildland fire management on the landscape, take the lead on that, but we're all in at the same table. We had response from Alberta Emergency Management in our town in the early hours of Tuesday morning, and the level of cooperation and coordination is extremely high. So I can appreciate from an outside perspective you look at all these multiple jurisdictions all in one location and wonder how it will work. Well it works extremely well, because these people are professionals, they've trained for this, they're prepared for this, they know how to cooperate with each other and how to get the job done.\n\nMH: What about coordination with the tourism sector, their need to get all their guests, their own staff moving. How much of a partnership is there with the hospitality industry?\n\nRI: It is significant and critical to our needs. And so for the evacuation itself, we had hotels in the tourism industry become centres for the accumulation of people who needed to then get on buses to get out of town, who might not have had their own transportation. We have rafting companies and tour companies who have access to buses, and those buses were made available. Whatever residents and businesses within the community could do to assist appears to have been done. We had anecdotal evidence at least of residents helping each other and helping visitors. The degree of patience that was exhibited, the degree of preparedness, and responsiveness and just kindness to each other was quite staggering. And yes, the tourism industry steps up as they typically do to help us manage all the visitors that we rely upon through the rest of the year.\n\nMH: It was an Alberta Emergency Alert that prompted the evacuation Monday evening and then a follow up to clarify reference to a five-hour window. What played out in that regard?\n\nRI: I'm not entirely sure. I acknowledged that there was an error in some wording but it didn't impact negatively the evacuation at all. And so, although it may have caused a heightened degree of anxiety among some individuals thinking that the fire was perhaps closer than it actually was, at least in time, as soon as that error was recognized, it was corrected. That took about 50 minutes. But given the nature of the emergency, you can appreciate the first fire, north of town, was detected sometime after 7:00. Within half an hour, there was reports of a second fire south of town. Within another 10 minutes, another report of another fire south of town. And at the same time there was a forest fire already burning in the National Park which was being actioned by Parks Canada. So they were already spread quite thinly. This was a very dynamic, actively evolving situation. The timing between the emergency alert, the state of local emergency and the evacuation order was a really short timeframe. So yes, we acknowledge a mistake was made, but in the overall context it didn't cause damage. We still got everybody out safely.\n\nMH: A majority of evacuees had to head west. Thoughts for your municipal neighbors across the border who rallied around welcoming hundreds, if not thousands of people?\n\nRI: Valemount gets our credit for their response. I think I heard from the mayor in Valemount that they had about 16,000 unexpected visitors Monday night and Tuesday morning for the evacuees from Jasper. They responded as well as could ever be expected and beyond. So a very small community, smaller than Jasper, but they took up the challenge and served our guests and our residents extremely well and we thank them for that.", "source": {"uri": "edmonton.ctvnews.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "CTV Newsnet                        "}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_D._Higgins", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Michael D.

It felt really big.\n\n\"One of my friends gave her child the name Jasper.\"\n\nA decade ago, Kelley Ware was living in Prince George, B.C., and her now-husband was in Edmonton. Every few weeks, they'd meet in Jasper.\n\n\"It was completely fundamental to building our relationship. My husband has a tattoo of Pyramid Mountain.\"\n\nFor Janet Millar, the memories go back generations.\n\nHer great-grandfather was on a roadbuilding crew in Jasper in 1948 when he noticed that lots were going up for sale around Lake Edith. He and his wife walked around it, chose their favourite spot and the next year built the cabin that has been in the family ever since.\n\n\"It's the smell of an old log cabin that has had a lot of bacon and pancakes and syrup served in it. It's the sight of old furniture that no one can bear to part with,\" she said.\n\n\"Everyone in my family and all sorts of friends have their own particular thing they like best. There's so much I like about it that I can't bear to part with.\"\n\nSocial media was awash Thursday with memories of Jasper proposals, weddings and honeymoons. But the town is steeped in memory of all kinds.\n\nThere's the generations of skiiers who have partied in the Whistle Stop pub or Athabasca Hotel, known locally as the Atha-B and a fixture since 1929. The families who carbed up for the day's adventures at Smitty's. The holidayers from around the world who met and gabbed in hotel hot tubs.\n\nThe worshippers at the gracious Anglican church of St. Mary and St. George, who have gathered since 1928 to praise God in the midst of some of His finest handiwork.\n\nThe classic fieldstone headquarters of Parks Canada, across the street from where travellers on Via Rail's Rocky Mountaineer disembarked to gape at the vista. The cheeky Fiberglas statue of Jasper the Friendly Bear, rubbed shiny since the '60s by the hands of children.\n\nThe roadside greeter elk casually grazing, charming visitors turning off Hwy 16 into town.\n\nThe great and famous, too, are part of Jasper's memory.\n\nFilm star Marilyn Monroe, in town with co-star Robert Mitchum to film the 1954 western \"River of No Return,\" was famously escorted from the dining room of the Jasper Park Lodge for inappropriate dress. That same year saw the release of \"The Far Country,\" for which the Lodge hosted Jimmy Stewart.\n\nBing Crosby was by in 1946 to film \"The Emperor Waltz\" and returned regularly to golf on the Lodge's renowned course. Anthony Hopkins and John Travolta have vacationed there.\n\nRoyalty first came to visit in 1939 when King George VI and Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother, stayed at the Jasper Park Lodge's Outlook Cabin. Their daughter, Queen Elizabeth II, stayed there with her husband Prince Phillip in 2005.\n\nBut Jasper's memories are not primarily of glitz and bling. It's an everyone kind of place.\n\n\"Our family had a dock that was always painted yellow,\" said Millar.\n\n\"All of us remember jumping off that dock and watching people come out from town and using it. That was always really special. It was heartwarming for us to see people enjoying the dock.\"\n\nWare remembers the fellowship.\n\n\"Striking up conversations with people and having an hour-long chat. Making friends with the bartenders. And just really feeling like you belonged.\"\n\nThursday morning, Parks Canada reported the fire remained out of control despite a small amount of rain overnight. Firefighting reinforcements had arrived to defend the town.\n\n\"While we understand people are desperate to know about the status of our community, homes, workplaces, businesses, and cherished places we will need some time to stabilize this incident as we access and assess structures,\" the agency said in a statement.\n\n\"We appreciate your patience and the community of people who have come together to support the people of Jasper and Parks Canada family.\"\n\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published July 25, 2024.", "source": {"uri": "lethbridgenewsnow.com", "dataType":

Of that number, 950 were burning Tuesday.\n\nThere have been 153 wildfires in Manitoba so far this year, 53 of them currently active. The province's fire map indicates 10, most in the northwest, are \"out of control.\"\n\nThere's a large one about 35 kilometres north of Garden Hill First Nation. Two have joined to create a more-than-2,000-hectare blaze threatening Pukatawagan Cree Nation (also known as Mathias Colomb First Nation). Another is burning about 60 km northeast of Thompson, and two separate fires are closing in on Marcel Colomb First Nation, leading to this week's evacuation of elders, children and other vulnerable residents.\n\nThe communities have lived through the fear and danger before. Pukatawagan residents were forced to flee flames in July 2022. Marcel Colomb has been evacuated multiple times over the last decade.\n\nFirefighters, local leadership and Manitoba's fire protection program, along with plenty of rain, have so far ensured the communities haven't suffered significant damage this summer. Manitoba is down nearly 100 wildfires from last year at this time.\n\n\"I never thought we would be doing this again.\"\n\nBut the forecast over the next few days and into August is heat, in some cases potentially record-setting temperatures, which means there are likely going to be more evacuations of First Nations.\n\nResearch published in 2019 in the International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction, reported 80 per cent of \"majority-Indigenous\" communities (First Nations and urban areas) are located in \"fire-prone\" regions.\n\nDue primarily to climate change -- resulting in more lightning and drier forests -- the number of wildfires is increasing overall. A massive heat wave this month in Alberta and B.C. undoubtedly contributed to the conditions that sparked the catastrophe in Jasper.\n\nResearch published this year by the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre, the warming global climate is leading to hotter and more devastating fires. The area burned across the country last year was six times higher than the yearly average.\n\nMuch of the territory is First Nations. This week's evacuation of Marcel Colomb is likely just the beginning.\n\nIt's good when Canada acts after losses such as the one in Jasper. No doubt something will be done to ensure it doesn't happen again -- like the protection measures instituted after the terrible fires that destroyed Fort McMurray, Alta., in 2016.\n\nCommunities such as Little Red River Cree Nation or -- in Manitoba's case -- Garden Hill, Marcel Colomb and Pukatawagan are, perhaps, not viewed or valued in the same way Jasper is.", "source": {"uri":

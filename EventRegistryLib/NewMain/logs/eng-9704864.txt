Power was knocked out in much of the capital.\n\n\" READ MORE: Beryl, the season's first hurricane, forms -- and sets a record\n\nPrime Minister Andrew Holness said on Wednesday afternoon that nearly 500 people were placed in shelters.\n\nBy evening, he said that Jamaica has not seen the \"worst of what could possibly happen.\"\n\n\"We can do as much as we can do, as humanly possible, and we leave the rest in the hands of God,\" Holness said.\n\nSeveral roadways in the country's interior settlements were impacted by fallen trees and utility poles, while some communities in the northern section were without electricity, according to the government's information service.\n\n\" READ MORE: Record-setting Hurricane Beryl's peak winds reach 165 mph, a Category 5 and a 'warning shot' for the season\n\nKingston resident Pauline Lynch said that she had stockpiled food and water in anticipation of the storm's arrival. With wind already driving rain, Lynch said, \"I have no control over what is coming so I just have to pray that all people of Jamaica is safe and we don't suffer no deaths, no loss.\"\n\nBy midday, winds already howled in the capital, turning the sea into churning whitecaps as Beryl's eye scraped by the island's southern coast.\n\n\"We are very concerned about a wide variety of life threatening impacts in Jamaica,\" including storm surge, high winds and flash flooding, said Jon Porter, chief meteorologist at AccuWeather.\n\nPorter called Beryl \"the strongest and most dangerous hurricane threat that Jamaica has faced, probably, in decades.\"\n\nA hurricane warning was in effect for Jamaica, Grand Cayman, Little Cayman and Cayman Brac, and the coast of the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico from Puerto Costa Maya to Cancun. Beryl was forecast to weaken slightly over the next day or two, but still be at or near major-hurricane strength when it passes near the Cayman Islands on Thursday and into Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula late Thursday or Friday, according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center.\n\nJamaica was under a state of emergency as the island was declared a disaster zone hours before the impact of Beryl. Holness said that the disaster zone declaration will remain for the next seven days.\n\nAn evacuation order was in place for communities across Jamaica that are prone to flooding and landslides. Holness urged Jamaicans to move away from low-lying areas.\n\nMexico's Caribbean coast, meanwhile was preparing for Beryl.\n\nThe head of Mexico's civil defense agency said that Beryl is expected to make a rare double strike on Mexico. Laura Vel\u00e1zquez said the hurricane is expected to make landfall along a relatively unpopulated stretch of the Caribbean coast between Tulum and the inland town of Felipe Carrillo Puerto. Because the coast there is largely made up of lagoons and mangroves, there are few resorts or hotels in the area south of Tulum.\n\nOn Wednesday, Mexican government officials moved sea turtle eggs off Cancun beaches in an attempt to protect them from storm surge.\n\nThe hurricane is expected to weaken to a tropical storm as it crosses the Yucatan peninsula and reemerge over the weekend at storm strength into the Gulf of Mexico. Vel\u00e1zquez said that Beryl is then expected to hit Mexican territory a second time in the Gulf coast states of Veracruz or Tamaulipas, near the Texas border.\n\nLate Monday, Beryl became the earliest storm to develop into a Category 5 hurricane in the Atlantic and peaked at winds of 165 mph (270 kph) Tuesday before weakening to a still-destructive Category 4. Late Wednesday night, the storm's center was about 560 miles (905 kilometers) east-southeast of Tulum, Mexico. It had maximum sustained winds of 130 mph (215 kph) and was moving west-northwest at 21 mph (32 kph). Hurricane strength winds extended 45 miles from the center.\n\nIn Miami, hurricane center director Michael Brennan in an online briefing said people on the island should plan to stay sheltered throughout the day Wednesday with conditions only beginning to improve overnight.\n\nJamaica's southern coast, where Kingston is located, was expected to bear the brunt of Beryl with coastal water levels rising to 6 or 9 feet (1.8 to 2.7 meters) above normal tide levels in some area.\n\nHeavy rains of 4 to 8 inches, with up to a foot in isolated areas, threatened flash flooding and mudslides on the mountainous island, he said.\n\nAs Beryl barreled through the Caribbean Sea, rescue crews in southeastern islands fanned out to determine the extent of the damage the hurricane inflicted on Carriacou, an island in Grenada.\n\nMichelle Forbes, the St. Vincent and Grenadines director of the National Emergency Management Organization, said that about 95% of homes in Mayreau and Union Island have been damaged by Hurricane Beryl.\n\nThree people were reported killed in Grenada and Carriacou and another in St. Vincent and the Grenadines, officials said. Three other deaths were reported in northern Venezuela, where five people are missing, officials said. About 25,000 people in that area also were affected by heavy rainfall from Beryl.\n\nOne fatality in Grenada occurred after a tree fell on a house, Kerryne James, the environment minister, told The Associated Press.\n\nGrenada's Prime Minister Dickon Mitchell said Tuesday there was no power, roads are impassable and the possible rise of the death toll \"remains a grim reality.\"\n\nSt. Vincent and the Grenadines Prime Minister Ralph Gonsalves has promised to rebuild the archipelago.\n\nThe last strong hurricane to hit the southeast Caribbean was Hurricane Ivan 20 years ago, which killed dozens of people in Grenada.", "source": {"uri": "inquirer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Philadelphia Inquirer"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

With wind already driving rain, Lynch said, \"I have no control over what is coming so I just have to pray that all people of Jamaica is safe and we don't suffer no deaths, no loss.\"\n\nBy midday, winds already howled in the capital, turning the sea into churning whitecaps as Beryl's eye scraped by the island's southern coast.\n\n\"We are very concerned about a wide variety of life threatening impacts in Jamaica,\" including storm surge, high winds and flash flooding, said Jon Porter, chief meteorologist at AccuWeather.\n\nPorter called Beryl \"the strongest and most dangerous hurricane threat that Jamaica has faced, probably, in decades.\"\n\nA hurricane warning was in effect for Jamaica, Grand Cayman, Little Cayman and Cayman Brac. Beryl was forecast to weaken slightly over the next day or two, but still be at or near major-hurricane strength when it passes near or over Jamaica on Wednesday, near the Cayman Islands on Thursday and into Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula on Friday, according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center.\n\nJamaica was under a state of emergency as the island was declared a disaster zone hours before the impact of Hurricane Beryl.\n\nHolness said that the disaster zone declaration will remain for the next seven days. He also announced an island-wide curfew between 6 a.m. and 6 p.m. on Wednesday.\n\nAn evacuation order was in place for communities across Jamaica that are prone to flooding and landslides. Holness urged Jamaicans to move away from low-lying areas.\n\nA hurricane watch was in effect for Haiti's southern coast and the Yucatan's east coast. Belize issued a tropical storm watch stretching south from its border with Mexico to Belize City.\n\nLate Monday, Beryl became the earliest storm to develop into a Category 5 hurricane in the Atlantic and peaked at winds of 165 mph (270 kph) Tuesday before weakening to a still-destructive Category 4. On Wednesday, the storm's center was about 100 miles (160 kilometers) west of Kingston. It had maximum sustained winds of 130 mph (215 kph) and was moving west-northwest at 20 mph (31 kph). Hurricane strength winds extended 45 miles from the center.\n\nIn Miami, hurricane center director Michael Brennan in an online briefing said people on the island should plan to stay sheltered throughout the day Wednesday with conditions only beginning to improve overnight.\n\nJamaica's southern coast, where Kingston is located, was expected to bear the brunt of Beryl with coastal water levels rising to 6 or 9 feet (1.8 to 2.7 meters) above normal tide levels in some area.\n\nHeavy rains of 4 to 8 inches, with up to a foot in isolated areas, threatened flash flooding and mudslides on the mountainous island, he said.\n\nMexico's Caribbean coast was preparing for Beryl Wednesday. The government issued a hurricane warning for the coast of the Yucatan Peninsula from Puerto Costa Maya to Cancun.\n\nThe head of Mexico's civil defense agency said that Beryl is expected to make a rare double strike on Mexico. Laura Vel\u00e1zquez said the hurricane is expected to make landfall between late Thursday and early Friday along a relatively unpopulated stretch of the Caribbean coast between Tulum and the inland town of Felipe Carrillo Puerto. Because the coast there is largely made up of lagoons and mangroves, there are few resorts or hotels in the area south of Tulum.\n\nOn Wednesday, Mexican government officials moved sea turtle eggs off Cancun beaches in an attempt to protect them from storm surge.\n\nThe hurricane is expected to weaken to a tropical storm as it crosses the Yucatan peninsula and reemerge over the weekend at storm strength into the Gulf of Mexico. Vel\u00e1zquez said that Beryl is then expected to hit Mexican territory a second time in the Gulf coast states of Veracruz or Tamaulipas, near the Texas border.\n\nAs Beryl barreled through the Caribbean Sea, rescue crews in southeastern islands fanned out to determine the extent of the damage the hurricane inflicted on Carriacou, an island in Grenada.\n\nMichelle Forbes, the St. Vincent and Grenadines director of the National Emergency Management Organization, said that about 95% of homes in Mayreau and Union Island have been damaged by Hurricane Beryl.\n\nThree people were reported killed in Grenada and Carriacou and another in St. Vincent and the Grenadines, officials said. Three other deaths were reported in northern Venezuela, where five people are missing, officials said. About 25,000 people in that area also were affected by heavy rainfall from Beryl.\n\nOne fatality in Grenada occurred after a tree fell on a house, Kerryne James, the environment minister, told The Associated Press.\n\nGrenada's Prime Minister Dickon Mitchell said Tuesday there was no power, roads are impassable and the possible rise of the death toll \"remains a grim reality.\"\n\nSt. Vincent and the Grenadines Prime Minister Ralph Gonsalves has promised to rebuild the archipelago.\n\nThe last strong hurricane to hit the southeast Caribbean was Hurricane Ivan 20 years ago, which killed dozens of people in Grenada.\n\nAssociated Press writers Mark Stevenson in Mexico City, Coral Murphy Marcos in San Juan, Puerto Rico and Lucanus Ollivierre in Kingstown, St. Vincent and Grenadines

Power was knocked out in much of the capital.\n\nPrime Minister Andrew Holness said on Wednesday afternoon that nearly 500 people were placed in shelters.\n\nBy evening, he said that Jamaica has not seen the \"worst of what could possibly happen.\"\n\n\"We can do as much as we can do, as humanly possible, and we leave the rest in the hands of God,\" Holness said.\n\nSeveral roadways in the country's interior settlements were impacted by fallen trees and utility poles, while some communities in the northern section were without electricity, according to the government's information service.\n\nKingston resident Pauline Lynch said that she had stockpiled food and water in anticipation of the storm's arrival. With wind already driving rain, Lynch said, \"I have no control over what is coming so I just have to pray that all people of Jamaica is safe and we don't suffer no deaths, no loss.\"\n\nBy midday, winds already howled in the capital, turning the sea into churning whitecaps as Beryl's eye scraped by the island's southern coast.\n\n\"We are very concerned about a wide variety of life threatening impacts in Jamaica,\" including storm surge, high winds and flash flooding, said Jon Porter, chief meteorologist at AccuWeather.\n\nPorter called Beryl \"the strongest and most dangerous hurricane threat that Jamaica has faced, probably, in decades.\"\n\nA hurricane warning was in effect for Jamaica, Grand Cayman, Little Cayman and Cayman Brac, and the coast of the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico from Puerto Costa Maya to Cancun. Beryl was forecast to weaken slightly over the next day or two, but still be at or near major-hurricane strength when it passes near the Cayman Islands on Thursday and into Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula late Thursday or Friday, according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center.\n\nJamaica was under a state of emergency as the island was declared a disaster zone hours before the impact of Beryl. Holness said that the disaster zone declaration will remain for the next seven days.\n\nAn evacuation order was in place for communities across Jamaica that are prone to flooding and landslides. Holness urged Jamaicans to move away from low-lying areas.\n\nMexico's Caribbean coast, meanwhile was preparing for Beryl.\n\nThe head of Mexico's civil defense agency said that Beryl is expected to make a rare double strike on Mexico. Laura Vel\u00e1zquez said the hurricane is expected to make landfall along a relatively unpopulated stretch of the Caribbean coast between Tulum and the inland town of Felipe Carrillo Puerto. Because the coast there is largely made up of lagoons and mangroves, there are few resorts or hotels in the area south of Tulum.\n\nOn Wednesday, Mexican government officials moved sea turtle eggs off Cancun beaches in an attempt to protect them from storm surge.\n\nThe hurricane is expected to weaken to a tropical storm as it crosses the Yucatan peninsula and reemerge over the weekend at storm strength into the Gulf of Mexico. Vel\u00e1zquez said that Beryl is then expected to hit Mexican territory a second time in the Gulf coast states of Veracruz or Tamaulipas, near the Texas border.\n\nLate Monday, Beryl became the earliest storm to develop into a Category 5 hurricane in the Atlantic and peaked at winds of 165 mph (270 kph) Tuesday before weakening to a still-destructive Category 4. On Wednesday, the storm's center was about 100 miles (160 kilometers) west of Kingston. It had maximum sustained winds of 130 mph (215 kph) and was moving west-northwest at 20 mph (31 kph). Hurricane strength winds extended 45 miles from the center.\n\nIn Miami, hurricane center director Michael Brennan in an online briefing said people on the island should plan to stay sheltered throughout the day Wednesday with conditions only beginning to improve overnight.\n\nJamaica's southern coast, where Kingston is located, was expected to bear the brunt of Beryl with coastal water levels rising to 6 or 9 feet (1.8 to 2.7 meters) above normal tide levels in some area.\n\nHeavy rains of 4 to 8 inches, with up to a foot in isolated areas, threatened flash flooding and mudslides on the mountainous island, he said.\n\nAs Beryl barreled through the Caribbean Sea, rescue crews in southeastern islands fanned out to determine the extent of the damage the hurricane inflicted on Carriacou, an island in Grenada.\n\nMichelle Forbes, the St. Vincent and Grenadines director of the National Emergency Management Organization, said that about 95% of homes in Mayreau and Union Island have been damaged by Hurricane Beryl.\n\nThree people were reported killed in Grenada and Carriacou and another in St. Vincent and the Grenadines, officials said. Three other deaths were reported in northern Venezuela, where five people are missing, officials said. About 25,000 people in that area also were affected by heavy rainfall from Beryl.\n\nOne fatality in Grenada occurred after a tree fell on a house, Kerryne James, the environment minister, told The Associated Press.\n\nGrenada's Prime Minister Dickon Mitchell said Tuesday there was no power, roads are impassable and the possible rise of the death toll \"remains a grim reality.\"\n\nSt. Vincent and the Grenadines Prime Minister Ralph Gonsalves has promised to rebuild the archipelago.\n\nThe last strong hurricane to hit the southeast Caribbean was Hurricane Ivan 20 years ago, which killed dozens of people in Grenada.\n\nAssociated Press writers Mark Stevenson in Mexico City, Coral Murphy Marcos in San Juan, Puerto Rico and Lucanus Ollivierre in Kingstown, St. Vincent and Grenadines

Power was knocked out in much of the capital.\n\nPrime Minister Andrew Holness said on Wednesday afternoon that nearly 500 people were placed in shelters.\n\n\"We are placing emphasis on ensuring they are comfortable and well looked after,\" he said in a social media post.\n\nBefore Beryl's arrival in Kingston, people had earlier boarded up windows, fishermen pulled their boats out of the water and workers dismantled roadside advertising boards to protect them from the lashing winds.\n\nKingston resident Pauline Lynch said that she had stockpiled food and water in anticipation of the storm's arrival. With wind already driving rain, Lynch said, \"I have no control over what is coming so I just have to pray that all people of Jamaica is safe and we don't suffer no deaths, no loss.\"\n\nBy midday, winds already howled in the capital, turning the sea into churning whitecaps as Beryl's eye scraped by the island's southern coast.\n\n\"We are very concerned about a wide variety of life threatening impacts in Jamaica,\" including storm surge, high winds and flash flooding, said Jon Porter, chief meteorologist at AccuWeather.\n\nPorter called Beryl \"the strongest and most dangerous hurricane threat that Jamaica has faced, probably, in decades.\"\n\nA hurricane warning was in effect for Jamaica, Grand Cayman, Little Cayman and Cayman Brac. Beryl was forecast to weaken slightly over the next day or two, but still be at or near major-hurricane strength when it passes near or over Jamaica on Wednesday, near the Cayman Islands on Thursday and into Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula on Friday, according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center.\n\nJamaica was under a state of emergency as the island was declared a disaster zone hours before the impact of Hurricane Beryl.\n\nHolness said that the disaster zone declaration will remain for the next seven days. He also announced an island-wide curfew between 6 a.m. and 6 p.m. on Wednesday.\n\nSecurity forces \"will be fully mobilized to maintain public order and assist with disaster relief. As soon as the hurricane has passed, the security forces have developed strategic plans to counter any potential threat of looting or any other opportunistic crimes,\" Holness warned.\n\nAn evacuation order was also issued for communities across Jamaica that are prone to flooding and landslides. Holness urged Jamaicans to move away from low-lying areas.\n\nA hurricane watch was in effect for Haiti's southern coast and the Yucatan's east coast. Belize issued a tropical storm watch stretching south from its border with Mexico to Belize City.\n\nLate Monday, Beryl became the earliest storm to develop into a Category 5 hurricane in the Atlantic and peaked at winds of 165 mph (270 km/h) Tuesday before weakening to a still-destructive Category 4. On Wednesday, the storm's center was about 65 miles (100 kilometres) west-southwest of Kingston. It had maximum sustained winds of 140 mph (220 km/h) and was moving west-northwest at 20 mph (31 km/h). Hurricane strength winds extended 45 miles from the center.\n\nIn Miami, hurricane center director Michael Brennan in an online briefing said people on the island should plan to stay sheltered throughout the day Wednesday with conditions only beginning to improve overnight.\n\nJamaica's southern coast, where Kingston is located, was expected to bear the brunt of Beryl with coastal water levels rising to 6 or 9 feet (1.8 to 2.7 metres) above normal tide levels in some area.\n\nWidespread damage caused by Hurricane Beryl on Union Island in St. Vincent and the Grenadines is seen in this image taken from video on July 2, 2024.\n\nHeavy rains of 4 to 8 inches, with up to a foot in isolated areas, threatened flash flooding and mudslides on the mountainous island, he said.\n\nMexico's Caribbean coast was preparing for Beryl Wednesday. The government issued a hurricane warning for the coast of the Yucatan Peninsula from Puerto Costa Maya to Cancun.\n\nThe head of Mexico's civil defence agency said that Beryl is expected to make a rare double strike on Mexico. Laura Velazquez said the hurricane is expected to make landfall between late Thursday and early Friday along a relatively unpopulated stretch of the Caribbean coast between Tulum and the inland town of Felipe Carrillo Puerto. Because the coast there is largely made up of lagoons and mangroves, there are few resorts or hotels in the area south of Tulum.\n\nThe hurricane is expected to weaken to a tropical storm as it crosses the Yucatan peninsula and reemerge over the weekend at storm strength into the Gulf of Mexico. Velazquez said that Beryl is then expected to hit Mexican territory a second time in the Gulf coast states of Veracruz or Tamaulipas, near the Texas border.\n\nAs Beryl barrelled through the Caribbean Sea, rescue crews in southeastern islands fanned out to determine the extent of the damage the hurricane inflicted on Carriacou, an island in Grenada.\n\nThis picture taken by U.S. astronaut Matthew Dominick shows the scale of Hurricane Beryl as the International Space Station orbited over the Caribbean on July 1, 2024. (Source @dominickmatthew via X)\n\nThree people were reported killed in Grenada and Carriacou and another in St. Vincent and the Grenadines, officials said. Two other deaths were reported in northern Venezuela, where five people are missing, officials said. About 25,000 people in that area also were affected by heavy rainfall from Beryl.\n\nOne fatality in Grenada occurred after a tree fell on a house, Kerryne James, the environment minister, told The Associated Press. She said Carriacou and Petit Martinique sustained the greatest damage, with scores of homes and businesses flattened in Carriacou.\n\nGrenada's Prime Minister Dickon Mitchell said Tuesday there was no power, roads are impassable and the possible rise of the death toll \"remains a grim reality.\"\n\nSt. Vincent and the Grenadines Prime Minister Ralph Gonsalves has promised to rebuild the archipelago. He noted that 90% of homes on Union Island were destroyed, and that \"similar levels of devastation\" were expected on the islands of Myreau and Canouan.\n\nThe last strong hurricane to hit the southeast Caribbean was Hurricane Ivan 20 years ago, which killed dozens of people in Grenada.", "source": {"uri": "ctvnews.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "CTV News"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Because the coast there is largely made up of lagoons and mangroves, there are few resorts or hotels in the area south of Tulum.\n\nOn Wednesday, Mexican government officials moved sea turtle eggs off Cancun beaches in an attempt to protect them from storm surge.\n\nThe hurricane is expected to weaken to a tropical storm as it crosses the Yucatan peninsula and reemerge over the weekend at storm strength into the Gulf of Mexico. Vel\u00e1zquez said that Beryl is then expected to hit Mexican territory a second time in the Gulf coast states of Veracruz or Tamaulipas, near the Texas border.\n\nAs Beryl barreled through the Caribbean Sea, rescue crews in southeastern islands fanned out to determine the extent of the damage the hurricane inflicted on Carriacou, an island in Grenada.\n\nMichelle Forbes, the St. Vincent and Grenadines director of the National Emergency Management Organization, said that about 95% of homes in Mayreau and Union Island have been damaged by Hurricane Beryl.\n\nThree people were reported killed in Grenada and Carriacou and another in St. Vincent and the Grenadines, officials said. Three other deaths were reported in northern Venezuela, where five people are missing, officials said. About 25,000 people in that area also were affected by heavy rainfall from Beryl.\n\nOne fatality in Grenada occurred after a tree fell on a house, Kerryne James, the environment minister, told The Associated Press.\n\nGrenada's Prime Minister Dickon Mitchell said Tuesday there was no power, roads are impassable and the possible rise of the death toll \"remains a grim reality.\"\n\nSt. Vincent and the Grenadines Prime Minister Ralph Gonsalves has promised to rebuild the archipelago.\n\nThe last strong hurricane to hit the southeast Caribbean was Hurricane Ivan 20 years ago, which killed dozens of people in Grenada.\n\nFacebookTwitterPinterestLinkedin", "source": {"uri": "wccbcharlotte.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WCCB Charlotte's CW"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Beryl was roaring toward Jamaica on Wednesday, July 3, with islanders scrambling to make preparations after the powerful Category 4 storm earlier killed at least six people and caused significant damage in the southeast Caribbean. (NASA via AP)\n\n(AP) -- Hurricane Beryl was roaring by Jamaica Wednesday, bringing fierce winds and heavy rain after the powerful Category 4 storm earlier killed at least six people and caused significant damage in the southeast Caribbean.\n\nThe U.S. National Hurricane Center said Beryl's eyewall was \"brushing the south coast of Jamaica.\"\n\nWind-whipped rain pounded the island for hours as residents heeded authorities' call to shelter until the storm had passed. Power was knocked out in much of the capital.\n\nPrime Minister Andrew Holness said on Wednesday afternoon that nearly 500 people were placed in shelters.\n\n\"We are placing emphasis on ensuring they are comfortable and well looked after,\" he said in a social media post.\n\nBefore Beryl's arrival in Kingston, people had earlier boarded up windows, fishermen pulled their boats out of the water and workers dismantled roadside advertising boards to protect them from the lashing winds.\n\nKingston resident Pauline Lynch said that she had stockpiled food and water in anticipation of the storm's arrival. With wind already driving rain, Lynch said, \"I have no control over what is coming so I just have to pray that all people of Jamaica is safe and we don't suffer no deaths, no loss.\"\n\nBy midday, winds already howled in the capital, turning the sea into churning whitecaps as Beryl's eye scraped by the island's southern coast.\n\n\"We are very concerned about a wide variety of life threatening impacts in Jamaica,\" including storm surge, high winds and flash flooding, said Jon Porter, chief meteorologist at AccuWeather.\n\nPorter called Beryl \"the strongest and most dangerous hurricane threat that Jamaica has faced, probably, in decades.\"\n\nA hurricane warning was in effect for Jamaica, Grand Cayman, Little Cayman and Cayman Brac. Beryl was forecast to weaken slightly over the next day or two, but still be at or near major-hurricane strength when it passes near or over Jamaica on Wednesday, near the Cayman Islands on Thursday and into Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula on Friday, according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center.\n\nJamaica was under a state of emergency as the island was declared a disaster zone hours before the impact of Hurricane Beryl.\n\nHolness said that the disaster zone declaration will remain for the next seven days. He also announced an island-wide curfew between 6 a.m. and 6 p.m. on Wednesday.\n\nSecurity forces \"will be fully mobilized to maintain public order and assist with disaster relief. As soon as the hurricane has passed, the security forces have developed strategic plans to counter any potential threat of looting or any other opportunistic crimes,\" Holness warned.\n\nAn evacuation order was also issued for communities across Jamaica that are prone to flooding and landslides. Holness urged Jamaicans to move away from low-lying areas.\n\nA hurricane watch was in effect for Haiti's southern coast and the Yucatan's east coast. Belize issued a tropical storm watch stretching south from its border with Mexico to Belize City.\n\nLate Monday, Beryl became the earliest storm to develop into a Category 5 hurricane in the Atlantic and peaked at winds of 165 mph (270 kph) Tuesday before weakening to a still-destructive Category 4. On Wednesday, the storm's center was about 65 miles (100 kilometers) west-southwest of Kingston. It had maximum sustained winds of 140 mph (220 kph) and was moving west-northwest at 20 mph (31 kph). Hurricane strength winds extended 45 miles from the center.\n\nIn Miami, hurricane center director Michael Brennan in an online briefing said people on the island should plan to stay sheltered throughout the day Wednesday with conditions only beginning to improve overnight.\n\nJamaica's southern coast, where Kingston is located, was expected to bear the brunt of Beryl with coastal water levels rising to 6 or 9 feet (1.8 to 2.7 meters) above normal tide levels in some area.\n\nHeavy rains of 4 to 8 inches, with up to a foot in isolated areas, threatened flash flooding and mudslides on the mountainous island, he said.\n\nMexico's Caribbean coast was preparing for Beryl Wednesday. The government issued a hurricane warning for the coast of the Yucatan Peninsula from Puerto Costa Maya to Cancun.\n\nThe head of Mexico's civil defense agency said that Beryl is expected to make a rare double strike on Mexico. Laura Vel\u00e1zquez said the hurricane is expected to make landfall between late Thursday and early Friday along a relatively unpopulated stretch of the Caribbean coast between Tulum and the inland town of Felipe Carrillo Puerto. Because the coast there is largely made up of lagoons and mangroves, there are few resorts or hotels in the area south of Tulum.\n\nThe hurricane is expected to weaken to a tropical storm as it crosses the Yucatan peninsula and reemerge over the weekend at storm strength into the Gulf of Mexico. Vel\u00e1zquez said that Beryl is then expected to hit Mexican territory a second time in the Gulf coast states of Veracruz or Tamaulipas, near the Texas border.\n\nAs Beryl barreled through the Caribbean Sea, rescue crews in southeastern islands fanned out to determine the extent of the damage the hurricane inflicted on Carriacou, an island in Grenada.\n\nThree people were reported killed in Grenada and Carriacou and another in St. Vincent and the Grenadines, officials said. Two other deaths were reported in northern Venezuela, where five people are missing, officials said. About 25,000 people in that area also were affected by heavy rainfall from Beryl.\n\nOne fatality in Grenada occurred after a tree fell on a house, Kerryne James, the environment minister, told The Associated Press. She said Carriacou and Petit Martinique sustained the greatest damage, with scores of homes and businesses flattened in Carriacou.\n\nGrenada's Prime Minister Dickon Mitchell said Tuesday there was no power, roads are impassable and the possible rise of the death toll \"remains a grim reality.\"\n\nSt. Vincent and the Grenadines Prime Minister Ralph Gonsalves has promised to rebuild the archipelago. He noted that 90% of homes on Union Island were destroyed.\n\nThe last strong hurricane to hit the southeast Caribbean was Hurricane Ivan 20 years ago, which killed dozens of people in Grenada.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Mark Stevenson in Mexico City and Coral Murphy Marcos in San Juan, Puerto Rico, contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "kurv.com", "dataType":

Power was knocked out in much of the capital.\n\nPrime minister Andrew Holness said on Wednesday afternoon that nearly 500 people were placed in shelters.\n\nBy evening, he said that Jamaica has not seen the \"worst of what could possibly happen\".\n\n\"We can do as much as we can do, as humanly possible, and we leave the rest in the hands of God,\" Mr Holness said.\n\nSeveral roadways in the country's interior settlements were impacted by fallen trees and utility poles, while some communities in the northern section were without electricity, according to the government's information service.\n\nBy midday, winds already howled in the capital, turning the sea into churning whitecaps as Beryl's eye scraped by the island's southern coast.\n\n\"We are very concerned about a wide variety of life threatening impacts in Jamaica,\" including storm surge, high winds and flash flooding, said Jon Porter, chief meteorologist at AccuWeather.\n\nMr Porter called Beryl \"the strongest and most dangerous hurricane threat that Jamaica has faced, probably, in decades\".\n\nA hurricane warning was in effect for Jamaica, Grand Cayman, Little Cayman and Cayman Brac, and the coast of the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico from Puerto Costa Maya to Cancun.\n\nBeryl was forecast to weaken slightly over the next day or two, but still be at or near major-hurricane strength when it passes near the Cayman Islands on Thursday and into Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula late on Thursday or Friday, according to the US National Hurricane Centre.\n\nJamaica was under a state of emergency as the island was declared a disaster zone hours before the impact of Beryl. Mr Holness said that the disaster zone declaration will remain for the next seven days.\n\nAn evacuation order was in place for communities across Jamaica that are prone to flooding and landslides. Mr Holness urged Jamaicans to move away from low-lying areas.\n\nMexico's Caribbean coast, meanwhile was preparing for Beryl.\n\nThe head of Mexico's civil defence agency said that Beryl is expected to make a rare double strike on Mexico.\n\nLaura Velazquez said the hurricane is expected to make landfall along a relatively unpopulated stretch of the Caribbean coast between Tulum and the inland town of Felipe Carrillo Puerto.\n\nBecause the coast there is largely made up of lagoons and mangroves, there are few resorts or hotels in the area south of Tulum.\n\nOn Wednesday, Mexican government officials moved sea turtle eggs off Cancun beaches in an attempt to protect them from storm surge.\n\nThe hurricane is expected to weaken to a tropical storm as it crosses the Yucatan peninsula and re-emerge over the weekend at storm strength into the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nMs Velazquez said that Beryl is then expected to hit Mexican territory a second time in the Gulf coast states of Veracruz or Tamaulipas, near the Texas border.\n\nLate on Monday, Beryl became the earliest storm to develop into a Category 5 hurricane in the Atlantic and peaked at winds of 165 mph (270 kph) Tuesday before weakening to a still-destructive Category 4.\n\nLate on Wednesday night, the storm's centre was about 560 miles (905 kilometres) east-southeast of Tulum, Mexico. It had maximum sustained winds of 130 mph (215 kph) and was moving west-northwest at 21 mph (32 kph). Hurricane strength winds extended 45 miles from the centre.\n\nIn Miami, hurricane centre director Michael Brennan in an online briefing said people on the island should plan to stay sheltered throughout the day on Wednesday with conditions only beginning to improve overnight.\n\nJamaica's southern coast, where Kingston is located, was expected to bear the brunt of Beryl with coastal water levels rising to six or nine feet (1.8 to 2.7 metres) above normal tide levels in some area.\n\nHeavy rains of four to eight inches, with up to a foot in isolated areas, threatened flash flooding and mudslides on the mountainous island.\n\nAs Beryl barrelled through the Caribbean Sea, rescue crews in south-eastern islands fanned out to determine the extent of the damage the hurricane inflicted on Carriacou, an island in Grenada.\n\nMichelle Forbes, the St Vincent and Grenadines director of the National Emergency Management Organisation, said that about 95% of homes in Mayreau and Union Island have been damaged by Hurricane Beryl.\n\nThree people were reported killed in Grenada and Carriacou and another in St Vincent and the Grenadines, officials said.\n\nThree other deaths were reported in northern Venezuela, where five people are missing, officials said. About 25,000 people in that area also were affected by heavy rainfall from Beryl.\n\nOne fatality in Grenada occurred after a tree fell on a house, Kerryne James, the environment minister, told The Associated Press.\n\nGrenada's Prime Minister Dickon Mitchell said on Tuesday there was no power, roads are impassable and the possible rise of the death toll \"remains a grim reality\".", "source":

Power was knocked out in much of the capital.\n\nPrime Minister Andrew Holness said on Wednesday afternoon that nearly 500 people were placed in shelters.\n\n\"We are placing emphasis on ensuring they are comfortable and well looked after,\" he said in a social media post.\n\nBefore Beryl's arrival in Kingston, people had earlier boarded up windows, fishermen pulled their boats out of the water and workers dismantled roadside advertising boards to protect them from the lashing winds.\n\nKingston resident Pauline Lynch said that she had stockpiled food and water in anticipation of the storm's arrival. With wind already driving rain, Lynch said, \"I have no control over what is coming so I just have to pray that all people of Jamaica is safe and we don't suffer no deaths, no loss.\"\n\nBy midday, winds already howled in the capital, turning the sea into churning whitecaps as Beryl's eye scraped by the island's southern coast.\n\n\"We are very concerned about a wide variety of life threatening impacts in Jamaica,\" including storm surge, high winds and flash flooding, said Jon Porter, chief meteorologist at AccuWeather.\n\nPorter called Beryl \"the strongest and most dangerous hurricane threat that Jamaica has faced, probably, in decades.\"\n\nA hurricane warning was in effect for Jamaica, Grand Cayman, Little Cayman and Cayman Brac. Beryl was forecast to weaken slightly over the next day or two, but still be at or near major-hurricane strength when it passes near or over Jamaica on Wednesday, near the Cayman Islands on Thursday and into Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula on Friday, according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center.\n\nJamaica was under a state of emergency as the island was declared a disaster zone hours before the impact of Hurricane Beryl.\n\nHolness said that the disaster zone declaration will remain for the next seven days. He also announced an island-wide curfew between 6 a.m. and 6 p.m. on Wednesday.\n\nSecurity forces \"will be fully mobilized to maintain public order and assist with disaster relief. As soon as the hurricane has passed, the security forces have developed strategic plans to counter any potential threat of looting or any other opportunistic crimes,\" Holness warned.\n\nAn evacuation order was also issued for communities across Jamaica that are prone to flooding and landslides. Holness urged Jamaicans to move away from low-lying areas.\n\nA hurricane watch was in effect for Haiti's southern coast and the Yucatan's east coast. Belize issued a tropical storm watch stretching south from its border with Mexico to Belize City.\n\nLate Monday, Beryl became the earliest storm to develop into a Category 5 hurricane in the Atlantic and peaked at winds of 165 mph (270 kph) Tuesday before weakening to a still-destructive Category 4. On Wednesday, the storm's center was about 65 miles (100 kilometers) west-southwest of Kingston. It had maximum sustained winds of 140 mph (220 kph) and was moving west-northwest at 20 mph (31 kph). Hurricane strength winds extended 45 miles from the center.\n\nIn Miami, hurricane center director Michael Brennan in an online briefing said people on the island should plan to stay sheltered throughout the day Wednesday with conditions only beginning to improve overnight.\n\nJamaica's southern coast, where Kingston is located, was expected to bear the brunt of Beryl with coastal water levels rising to 6 or 9 feet (1.8 to 2.7 meters) above normal tide levels in some area.\n\nHeavy rains of 4 to 8 inches, with up to a foot in isolated areas, threatened flash flooding and mudslides on the mountainous island, he said.\n\nMexico's Caribbean coast was preparing for Beryl Wednesday. The government issued a hurricane warning for the coast of the Yucatan Peninsula from Puerto Costa Maya to Cancun.\n\nThe head of Mexico's civil defense agency said that Beryl is expected to make a rare double strike on Mexico. Laura Vel\u00e1zquez said the hurricane is expected to make landfall between late Thursday and early Friday along a relatively unpopulated stretch of the Caribbean coast between Tulum and the inland town of Felipe Carrillo Puerto. Because the coast there is largely made up of lagoons and mangroves, there are few resorts or hotels in the area south of Tulum.\n\nThe hurricane is expected to weaken to a tropical storm as it crosses the Yucatan peninsula and reemerge over the weekend at storm strength into the Gulf of Mexico. Vel\u00e1zquez said that Beryl is then expected to hit Mexican territory a second time in the Gulf coast states of Veracruz or Tamaulipas, near the Texas border.\n\nAs Beryl barreled through the Caribbean Sea, rescue crews in southeastern islands fanned out to determine the extent of the damage the hurricane inflicted on Carriacou, an island in Grenada.\n\nThree people were reported killed in Grenada and Carriacou and another in St. Vincent and the Grenadines, officials said. Two other deaths were reported in northern Venezuela, where five people are missing, officials said. About 25,000 people in that area also were affected by heavy rainfall from Beryl.\n\nOne fatality in Grenada occurred after a tree fell on a house, Kerryne James, the environment minister, told The Associated Press. She said Carriacou and Petit Martinique sustained the greatest damage, with scores of homes and businesses flattened in Carriacou.\n\nGrenada's Prime Minister Dickon Mitchell said Tuesday there was no power, roads are impassable and the possible rise of the death toll \"remains a grim reality.\"\n\nSt. Vincent and the Grenadines Prime Minister Ralph Gonsalves has promised to rebuild the archipelago. He noted that 90% of homes on Union Island were destroyed.\n\nThe last strong hurricane to hit the southeast Caribbean was Hurricane Ivan 20 years ago, which killed dozens of people in Grenada.\n\nAssociated Press writers Mark Stevenson in Mexico City and Coral Murphy Marcos in San Juan, Puerto Rico, contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com", "dataType":

Prime Minister Andrew Holness said on Wednesday afternoon that nearly 500 people were placed in shelters.\n\nBy evening, he said that Jamaica has not seen the \"worst of what could possibly happen.\" \"We can do as much as we can do, as humanly possible, and we leave the rest in the hands of God,\" Holness said. Several roadways in the country's interior settlements were impacted by fallen trees and utility poles, while some communities in the northern section were without electricity, according to the government's information service.\n\nKingston resident Pauline Lynch said that she had stockpiled food and water in anticipation of the storm's arrival.

The hurricane is expected to weaken to a tropical storm as it crosses the Yucatan peninsula and reemerge over the weekend at storm strength into the Gulf of Mexico.

As Beryl barreled through the Caribbean Sea, rescue crews in southeastern islands fanned out to determine the extent of the damage the hurricane inflicted on Carriacou, an island in Grenada. Michelle Forbes, the St. Vincent and Grenadines director of the National Emergency Management Organization, said that about 95% of homes in Mayreau and Union Island have been damaged by Hurricane Beryl.\n\nThree people were reported killed in Grenada and Carriacou and another in St. Vincent and the Grenadines, officials said.

Ricardo Mazalan/Associated Press\n\nKINGSTON, Jamaica -- Hurricane Beryl was roaring by Jamaica on Wednesday, bringing fierce winds and heavy rain after the powerful Category 4 storm earlier killed at least six people and caused significant damage in the southeast Caribbean.\n\nThe U.S. National Hurricane Center said Beryl's eyewall was \"brushing the south coast of Jamaica.\"\n\nWind-whipped rain pounded the island for hours as residents heeded authorities' call to shelter until the storm had passed. Power was knocked out in much of the capital.\n\nPrime Minister Andrew Holness said on Wednesday afternoon that nearly 500 people were placed in shelters.\n\n\"We are placing emphasis on ensuring they are comfortable and well looked after,\" he said in a social media post.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBefore Beryl's arrival in Kingston, people had earlier boarded up windows, fishermen pulled their boats out of the water and workers dismantled roadside advertising boards to protect them from the lashing winds.\n\nKingston resident Pauline Lynch said that she had stockpiled food and water in anticipation of the storm's arrival. With wind already driving rain, Lynch said, \"I have no control over what is coming so I just have to pray that all people of Jamaica is safe and we don't suffer no deaths, no loss.\"\n\nBy midday, winds already howled in the capital, turning the sea into churning whitecaps as Beryl's eye scraped by the island's southern coast.\n\n\"We are very concerned about a wide variety of life threatening impacts in Jamaica,\" including storm surge, high winds and flash flooding, said Jon Porter, chief meteorologist at AccuWeather.\n\nPorter called Beryl \"the strongest and most dangerous hurricane threat that Jamaica has faced, probably, in decades.\"\n\nA hurricane warning was in effect for Jamaica, Grand Cayman, Little Cayman and Cayman Brac. Beryl was forecast to weaken slightly over the next day or two, but still be at or near major-hurricane strength when it passes near or over Jamaica on Wednesday, near the Cayman Islands on Thursday and into Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula on Friday, according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJamaica was under a state of emergency as the island was declared a disaster zone hours before the impact of Hurricane Beryl.\n\nHolness said that the disaster zone declaration will remain for the next seven days. He also announced an island-wide curfew between 6 a.m. and 6 p.m. on Wednesday.\n\nSecurity forces \"will be fully mobilized to maintain public order and assist with disaster relief. As soon as the hurricane has passed, the security forces have developed strategic plans to counter any potential threat of looting or any other opportunistic crimes,\" Holness warned.\n\nAn evacuation order was also issued for communities across Jamaica that are prone to flooding and landslides. Holness urged Jamaicans to move away from low-lying areas.\n\nA hurricane watch was in effect for Haiti's southern coast and the Yucatan's east coast. Belize issued a tropical storm watch stretching south from its border with Mexico to Belize City.\n\nLate Monday, Beryl became the earliest storm to develop into a Category 5 hurricane in the Atlantic and peaked at winds of 165 mph Tuesday before weakening to a still-destructive Category 4. On Wednesday, the storm's center was about 65 miles (100 kilometers) west-southwest of Kingston. It had maximum sustained winds of 140 mph and was moving west-northwest at 20 mph. Hurricane strength winds extended 45 miles from the center.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Miami, hurricane center director Michael Brennan in an online briefing said people on the island should plan to stay sheltered throughout the day Wednesday with conditions only beginning to improve overnight.\n\nJamaica's southern coast, where Kingston is located, was expected to bear the brunt of Beryl with coastal water levels rising to 6 or 9 feet above normal tide levels in some area.\n\nHeavy rains of 4 to 8 inches, with up to a foot in isolated areas, threatened flash flooding and mudslides on the mountainous island, he said.\n\nMexico's Caribbean coast was preparing for Beryl Wednesday. The government issued a hurricane warning for the coast of the Yucatan Peninsula from Puerto Costa Maya to Cancun.\n\nThe head of Mexico's civil defense agency said that Beryl is expected to make a rare double strike on Mexico. Laura Vel\u00e1zquez said the hurricane is expected to make landfall between late Thursday and early Friday along a relatively unpopulated stretch of the Caribbean coast between Tulum and the inland town of Felipe Carrillo Puerto. Because the coast there is largely made up of lagoons and mangroves, there are few resorts or hotels in the area south of Tulum.\n\nThe hurricane is expected to weaken to a tropical storm as it crosses the Yucatan peninsula and reemerge over the weekend at storm strength into the Gulf of Mexico. Vel\u00e1zquez said that Beryl is then expected to hit Mexican territory a second time in the Gulf coast states of Veracruz or Tamaulipas, near the Texas border.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Beryl barreled through the Caribbean Sea, rescue crews in southeastern islands fanned out to determine the extent of the damage the hurricane inflicted on Carriacou, an island in Grenada.\n\nThree people were reported killed in Grenada and Carriacou and another in St. Vincent and the Grenadines, officials said. Two other deaths were reported in northern Venezuela, where five people are missing, officials said. About 25,000 people in that area also were affected by heavy rainfall from Beryl.\n\nOne fatality in Grenada occurred after a tree fell on a house, Kerryne James, the environment minister, told The Associated Press. She said Carriacou and Petit Martinique sustained the greatest damage, with scores of homes and businesses flattened in Carriacou.\n\nGrenada's Prime Minister Dickon Mitchell said Tuesday there was no power, roads are impassable and the possible rise of the death toll \"remains a grim reality.\"\n\nSt. Vincent and the Grenadines Prime Minister Ralph Gonsalves has promised to rebuild the archipelago. He noted that 90% of homes on Union Island were destroyed.\n\nThe last strong hurricane to hit the southeast Caribbean was Hurricane Ivan 20 years ago, which killed dozens of people in Grenada.\n\nAssociated Press writers Mark Stevenson in Mexico City and Coral Murphy Marcos in San Juan, Puerto Rico, contributed to this report.\n\nCopy the Story Link Related Headlines Hurricane

Power was knocked out in much of the capital.\n\nPrime Minister Andrew Holness said on Wednesday afternoon that nearly 500 people were placed in shelters.\n\nBy evening, he said that Jamaica has not seen the \"worst of what could possibly happen.\"\n\n\"We can do as much as we can do, as humanly possible, and we leave the rest in the hands of God,\" Holness said.\n\nSeveral roadways in the country's interior settlements were impacted by fallen trees and utility poles, while some communities in the northern section were without electricity, according to the government's information service.\n\nKingston resident Pauline Lynch said that she had stockpiled food and water in anticipation of the storm's arrival. With wind already driving rain, Lynch said, \"I have no control over what is coming so I just have to pray that all people of Jamaica is safe and we don't suffer no deaths, no loss.\"\n\nBy midday, winds already howled in the capital, turning the sea into churning whitecaps as Beryl's eye scraped by the island's southern coast.\n\n\"We are very concerned about a wide variety of life-threatening impacts in Jamaica,\" including storm surge, high winds and flash flooding, said Jon Porter, chief meteorologist at AccuWeather.\n\nPorter called Beryl \"the strongest and most dangerous hurricane threat that Jamaica has faced, probably, in decades.\"\n\nA hurricane warning was in effect for Jamaica, Grand Cayman, Little Cayman and Cayman Brac, and the coast of the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico from Puerto Costa Maya to Cancun. Beryl was forecast to weaken slightly over the next day or two, but still be at or near major-hurricane strength when it passes near the Cayman Islands on Thursday and into Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula late Thursday or Friday, according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center.\n\nJamaica was under a state of emergency as the island was declared a disaster zone hours before the impact of Beryl. Holness said that the disaster zone declaration will remain for the next seven days.\n\nAn evacuation order was in place for communities across Jamaica that are prone to flooding and landslides. Holness urged Jamaicans to move away from low-lying areas.\n\nMexico's Caribbean coast, meanwhile was preparing for Beryl.\n\nThe head of Mexico's civil defense agency said that Beryl is expected to make a rare double strike on Mexico. Laura Vel\u00e1zquez said the hurricane is expected to make landfall along a relatively unpopulated stretch of the Caribbean coast between Tulum and the inland town of Felipe Carrillo Puerto. Because the coast there is largely made up of lagoons and mangroves, there are few resorts or hotels in the area south of Tulum.\n\nOn Wednesday, Mexican government officials moved sea turtle eggs off Cancun beaches in an attempt to protect them from storm surge.\n\nThe hurricane is expected to weaken to a tropical storm as it crosses the Yucatan peninsula and reemerge over the weekend at storm strength into the Gulf of Mexico. Vel\u00e1zquez said that Beryl is then expected to hit Mexican territory a second time in the Gulf coast states of Veracruz or Tamaulipas, near the Texas border.\n\nLate Monday, Beryl became the earliest storm to develop into a Category 5 hurricane in the Atlantic and peaked at winds of 165 mph (270 kph) Tuesday before weakening to a still-destructive Category 4. On Wednesday, the storm's center was about 100 miles (160 kilometers) west of Kingston. It had maximum sustained winds of 130 mph (215 kph) and was moving west-northwest at 20 mph (31 kph). Hurricane strength winds extended 45 miles from the center.\n\nIn Miami, hurricane center director Michael Brennan in an online briefing said people on the island should plan to stay sheltered throughout the day Wednesday with conditions only beginning to improve overnight.\n\nJamaica's southern coast, where Kingston is located, was expected to bear the brunt of Beryl with coastal water levels rising to 6 or 9 feet (1.8 to 2.7 meters) above normal tide levels in some area.\n\nHeavy rains of 4 to 8 inches, with up to a foot in isolated areas, threatened flash flooding and mudslides on the mountainous island, he said.\n\nAs Beryl barreled through the Caribbean Sea, rescue crews in southeastern islands fanned out to determine the extent of the damage the hurricane inflicted on Carriacou, an island in Grenada.\n\nMichelle Forbes, the St. Vincent and Grenadines director of the National Emergency Management Organization, said that about 95% of homes in Mayreau and Union Island have been damaged by Hurricane Beryl.\n\nThree people were reported killed in Grenada and Carriacou and another in St. Vincent and the Grenadines, officials said. Three other deaths were reported in northern Venezuela, where five people are missing, officials said. About 25,000 people in that area also were affected by heavy rainfall from Beryl.\n\nOne fatality in Grenada occurred after a tree fell on a house, Kerryne James, the environment minister, told The Associated Press.\n\nGrenada's Prime Minister Dickon Mitchell said Tuesday there was no power, roads are impassable and the possible rise of the death toll \"remains a grim reality.\"\n\nSt. Vincent and the Grenadines Prime Minister Ralph Gonsalves has promised to rebuild the archipelago.\n\nThe last strong hurricane to hit the southeast Caribbean was Hurricane Ivan 20 years ago, which killed dozens of people in Grenada.", "source": {"uri": "politico.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "POLITICO"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Holness", "type":

Impostors Raising Funds by Claiming Slain Tamil Leader Is Still Alive, LTTE Chief's Family Urges Not To Fall Into Trap.\n\nWind-whipped rain pounded the island for hours as residents heeded authorities' call to shelter until the storm had passed. Power was knocked out in much of the capital.\n\nPrime Minister Andrew Holness said on Wednesday afternoon that nearly 500 people were placed in shelters.\n\nAlso Read | Canadian PM Justin Trudeau Appoints Lt. Gen. Jennie Carignan As the First Woman To Lead Canadian Armed Forces.\n\nBy evening, he said that Jamaica has not seen the \"worst of what could possibly happen.\"\n\n\"We can do as much as we can do, as humanly possible, and we leave the rest in the hands of God,\" Holness said.\n\nSeveral roadways in the country's interior settlements were impacted by fallen trees and utility poles, while some communities in the northern section were without electricity, according to the government's information service.\n\nKingston resident Pauline Lynch said that she had stockpiled food and water in anticipation of the storm's arrival. With wind already driving rain, Lynch said, \"I have no control over what is coming so I just have to pray that all people of Jamaica is safe and we don't suffer no deaths, no loss.\"\n\nBy midday, winds already howled in the capital, turning the sea into churning whitecaps as Beryl's eye scraped by the island's southern coast.\n\n\"We are very concerned about a wide variety of life threatening impacts in Jamaica,\" including storm surge, high winds and flash flooding, said Jon Porter, chief meteorologist at AccuWeather.\n\nPorter called Beryl \"the strongest and most dangerous hurricane threat that Jamaica has faced, probably, in decades.\"\n\nA hurricane warning was in effect for Jamaica, Grand Cayman, Little Cayman and Cayman Brac, and the coast of the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico from Puerto Costa Maya to Cancun. Beryl was forecast to weaken slightly over the next day or two, but still be at or near major-hurricane strength when it passes near the Cayman Islands on Thursday and into Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula late Thursday or Friday, according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center.\n\nJamaica was under a state of emergency as the island was declared a disaster zone hours before the impact of Beryl. Holness said that the disaster zone declaration will remain for the next seven days.\n\nAn evacuation order was in place for communities across Jamaica that are prone to flooding and landslides. Holness urged Jamaicans to move away from low-lying areas.\n\nMexico's Caribbean coast, meanwhile was preparing for Beryl.\n\nThe head of Mexico's civil defense agency said that Beryl is expected to make a rare double strike on Mexico. Laura Vel\u00e1zquez said the hurricane is expected to make landfall along a relatively unpopulated stretch of the Caribbean coast between Tulum and the inland town of Felipe Carrillo Puerto. Because the coast there is largely made up of lagoons and mangroves, there are few resorts or hotels in the area south of Tulum.\n\nOn Wednesday, Mexican government officials moved sea turtle eggs off Cancun beaches in an attempt to protect them from storm surge.\n\nThe hurricane is expected to weaken to a tropical storm as it crosses the Yucatan peninsula and reemerge over the weekend at storm strength into the Gulf of Mexico. Vel\u00e1zquez said that Beryl is then expected to hit Mexican territory a second time in the Gulf coast states of Veracruz or Tamaulipas, near the Texas border.\n\nLate Monday, Beryl became the earliest storm to develop into a Category 5 hurricane in the Atlantic and peaked at winds of 165 mph (270 kph) Tuesday before weakening to a still-destructive Category 4. Late Wednesday night, the storm's center was about 560 miles (905 kilometers) east-southeast of Tulum, Mexico. It had maximum sustained winds of 130 mph (215 kph) and was moving west-northwest at 21 mph (32 kph). Hurricane strength winds extended 45 miles from the center.\n\nIn Miami, hurricane center director Michael Brennan in an online briefing said people on the island should plan to stay sheltered throughout the day Wednesday with conditions only beginning to improve overnight.\n\nJamaica's southern coast, where Kingston is located, was expected to bear the brunt of Beryl with coastal water levels rising to 6 or 9 feet (1.8 to 2.7 meters) above normal tide levels in some area.\n\nHeavy rains of 4 to 8 inches, with up to a foot in isolated areas, threatened flash flooding and mudslides on the mountainous island, he said.\n\nAs Beryl barreled through the Caribbean Sea, rescue crews in southeastern islands fanned out to determine the extent of the damage the hurricane inflicted on Carriacou, an island in Grenada.\n\nMichelle Forbes, the St. Vincent and Grenadines director of the National Emergency Management Organization, said that about 95% of homes in Mayreau and Union Island have been damaged by Hurricane Beryl.\n\nThree people were reported killed in Grenada and Carriacou and another in St. Vincent and the Grenadines, officials said. Three other deaths were reported in northern Venezuela, where five people are missing, officials said. About 25,000 people in that area also were affected by heavy rainfall from Beryl.\n\nOne fatality in Grenada occurred after a tree fell on a house, Kerryne James, the environment minister, told The Associated Press.\n\nGrenada's Prime Minister Dickon Mitchell said Tuesday there was no power, roads are impassable and the possible rise of the death toll \"remains a grim reality.\"\n\nSt. Vincent and the Grenadines Prime Minister Ralph Gonsalves has promised to rebuild the archipelago.\n\nThe last strong hurricane to hit the southeast Caribbean was Hurricane Ivan 20 years ago, which killed dozens of people in Grenada.

Up to a foot of rain is possible locally, which could trigger flash flooding and mudslides.\n\nAs the storm barreled toward Jamaica, the country's prime minister, Andrew Holness, preemptively declared the entire island a disaster area in an address to the public Tuesday night.\n\nHolmes also said an islandwide curfew will be in place from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. local time Wednesday.\n\nAlthough the cyclone has lost some steam as it closes in on Jamaica, it has already caused six deaths in the Caribbean.\n\nBeryl was downgraded to a Category 4 from a Category 5, but its maximum sustained winds remained dangerous at 140 mph Wednesday afternoon, according to the National Hurricane Center. A hurricane warning has been issued for Jamaica and the Cayman Islands.\n\nIn anticipation of the storm, Jamaican officials shuttered three airports on Tuesday. They will stay closed through Wednesday, and reopening will be announced pending post-storm assessments.\n\nSangster International Airport (Montego Bay), Norman Manley International Airport (Kingston) and Ian Fleming International Airport (Boscobel) have all closed.\n\nCurrent forecast beyond Jamaica\n\nThe storm is expected to impact the Cayman Islands overnight and into Thursday morning, with winds around 100 mph possible.\n\nA weakening trend will continue through the rest of the week as Beryl sweeps across the Caribbean Sea and encounters less favorable atmospheric conditions.\n\nBeryl will then aim for Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula by the end of the week. The current forecast calls for another landfall sometime on Friday south of Cancun as a Category 1 storm. A hurricane warning is in effect for the coasts of the Yucatan Peninsula, from Puerto Costa Maya to Cancun.\n\nThe same general area of eastern Mexico will likely now see impacts from all three of the first named storms of the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season, after being hit by Tropical Storms Alberto and Chris.\n\nBeyond that, Beryl could weaken to a tropical storm, with maximum winds of 65 mph, but atmospheric conditions could become more favorable as it moves into the eastern Gulf of Mexico. By Sunday morning, Beryl could once again become a hurricane with winds near 75 mph. The current forecast calls for another landfall Sunday or Monday somewhere near the Mexico-U.S. border, near South Padre Island, possibly as a Category 1 storm. Some models push Beryl parallel to the Texas coast.\n\nThe storm is expected to bring flooding rain, storm surge and coastal flooding all the way to Corpus Christi by early next week. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is warning of life-threatening rip currents and large surf for the Gulf Coast from the Florida Panhandle to Texas.\n\nDeadly storm\n\nThe hurricane killed three people in Cariacou in Grenada, where it made landfall on Monday, officials said. Another death from the storm was reported in St. Vincent and the Grenadines, and two people were killed in northern Venezuela, officials in those countries said.\n\nHurricane Beryl had strengthened into a Category 5 storm heading into Tuesday as it moved through the warm waters of the Caribbean Sea, becoming the strongest July Atlantic hurricane on record.\n\nEarly Tuesday, Beryl was packing maximum winds of 165 mph. The hurricane surpassed the July record of 160 mph maximum winds produced by Hurricane Emily in 2005, according to the National Hurricane Center.\n\nThe outer bands of Beryl also brought heavy rain to southern portions of the Dominican Republic and Haiti late Tuesday and into Wednesday.\n\nResidents of St. Vincent and the Grenadines were cleaning up Tuesday and assessing damage. Schools, homes, buildings and farmland sustained extensive hurricane damage, officials said. On Union Island, which is part of St. Vincent and the Grenadines, authorities said 90% of the houses were either destroyed or severely damaged, and the roof of the Union Island airport was ripped off by the hurricane's buzzsaw-like winds. Heavy damage was also reported at Argyle International Airport on St. Vincent.\n\nThe one death reported in the Grenadines occurred on Bequia Island, officials said.\n\nAfter touring the damaged areas on Tuesday, St. Vincent and the Grenadines Prime Minister Ralph Gonsalves told reporters that Beryl \"left in its wake immense destruction.\"\n\nSea surface temperatures in the Caribbean Sea are running warmer than average for this time of the year, more in line with where they would be at the peak of the Atlantic hurricane season rather than early July. This is providing ample fuel for Beryl's extreme intensification.", "source": {"uri": "weisradio.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WEIS"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

through Caribbean islands as Category 3 storm", "body": "Our mission is to deliver unbiased, fact-based reporting that holds power to account and exposes the truth.\n\nWhether $5 or $50, every contribution counts.\n\nSupport us to deliver journalism without an agenda.\n\nHurricane Beryl is barreling towards Mexico and possibly the US, after tearing through Jamaica and the Windward Islands, bringing devastating winds and storm surges that have destroyed homes, wiped out power, and left at least eight people dead.\n\nThe storm continues to be a \"major hurricane\" after it got downgraded to Category 3 hurricane on Thursday morning, packing maximum sustained winds of 120mph (195kph).\n\nFollow our live coverage of Hurricane Beryl here.\n\nBeryl charted a deadly path through Jamaica, Grenada and St Vincent and the Grenadines, destroying buildings and killing at least eight, including one in Jamaica and three in Venezuela where outer rings of the hurricane caused heavy rainfall.\n\nOn Thursday morning, winds and rainfall from the hurricane were still battering Jamaica as prime minister Andrew Holness extended the curfew till 6am.\n\nAfter Jamaica, the hurricane was passing through Caymon Islands and heading towards Yucatan Peninsula and Belize on Thursday.\n\nBeryl was forecast to weaken slightly over the next day or two, but still be at or near major-hurricane strength when it enters and into Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula late Thursday or Friday, according to the US National Hurricane Centre.\n\nOfficials in Mexico warned the storm can make a \"rare\" double strike.\n\nLaura Velazquez, the head of Mexico's civil defence agency said the hurricane is expected to make landfall along a relatively unpopulated stretch of the Caribbean coast between Tulum and the inland town of Felipe Carrillo Puerto.\n\nBecause the coast there is largely made up of lagoons and mangroves, there are few resorts or hotels in the area south of Tulum.\n\nThe hurricane is expected to weaken to a tropical storm as it crosses the Yucatan peninsula and re-emerge over the weekend at storm strength into the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nMs Velazquez said that Beryl is then expected to hit Mexican territory a second time in the Gulf coast states of Veracruz or Tamaulipas, near the Texas border.\n\nIf Hurricane Beryl maintains its strength, it has the potential to hit southern Texas and Louisiana over the weekend, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nEarlier, Beryl beat records, first becoming the earliest Category 4 hurricane and later the earliest Category 5 hurricane in the Atlantic.\n\nOfficials in the Windward Islands, where Beryl first made landfall received \"widespread reports of destruction and devastation in Carriacou and Petite Martinique\", Grenada prime minister Dickon Mitchell said.\n\n\"In half an hour, Carriacou was flattened.\"\n\nA total of eight deaths have been confirmed, with Jamaica confirming first death on Thursday and four dead in the Windward islands, including one person who was killed in Grenada's capital St George's, when a tree fell on a house.\n\nThree deaths were reported in Venezuela where rainfall from outer rings of Hurricane Beryl caused flooding and landslides.\n\n\"We do hope there aren't any other fatalities or any injuries,\" said Mitchell. \"But bear in mind the challenge we have in Carriacou and Petite Martinique.\"\n\nAuthorities were scrambling to assess the situation on the islands of Carriacou and Petite Martinique, where there were initial reports of major damage but communications remained a challenge, he said.\n\nOn the Grenadine island Union Island, around 90 per cent of homes have been damaged or destroyed, he said.\n\nBeryl is now only the second storm on record to reach the intensity of Category 5 in July, after Emily did so in mid-July 2005.\n\nEarlier on Sunday, it became the earliest storm to reach Category 4 and the first ever to do so in June.\n\nThe hurricane was downgraded Sunday evening to a Category 3, but picked up power and speed over warm ocean water and was upgraded to Category 4 on Monday morning.\n\nWith the hurricane hitting St Vincent and the Grenadines over the carnival weekend, prime minister Ralph Gonsalves on Sunday urged residents to postpone their festivities and prepare for Beryl to hit.\n\nMr Gonsalves has already ordered the early closure of bars and postponed some carnival events, according to Loop News.\n\nAirports were also shuttered including in Barbados, Grenada, and St Lucia on Sunday night in preparation for the storm, however, Grenada's Maurice Bishop International Airport reopened on Tuesday.\n\nThe storm is expected to remain a major hurricane as it moves through the Caribbean, with a Tropical Storm watch in effect for the south coast of Hispaniola.\n\nA Hurricane Watch was also in effect on Tuesday for Grand Cayman, Little Cayman and Cayman Brac and the coast of the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico from Puerto Costa Maya to Cancun, including Cozumel.\n\nAfter making landfall in Mexico, Beryl is forecast to weaken. But a computer model of Hurricane Beryl's many possible paths, known as a \"spaghetti\" model, showed the direction the destructive storm could take as it moved towards the southeastern US in bathtub-warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nThe model showed the storm potentially blowing into the Gulf Coast, near eastern Texas and Louisiana.\n\nGlobal heating, caused by burning coal, oil and gas, has been increasing temperatures on land and the ocean. Warmer ocean waters fuel hurricanes. The area where Beryl is located, ocean temperatures are 2 to 3 degrees above normal for this time of the year, the levels that aren't typically seen until September.", "source": {"uri":

Power was knocked out in much of the capital.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPrime Minister Andrew Holness said on Wednesday afternoon that nearly 500 people were placed in shelters.\n\nD-FW Weather Wise\n\nFrom snow to 100-degree heat, we've got you covered.\n\nSIGN UP\n\nOr with:\n\nGoogleFacebook\n\nBy signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nBy evening, he said that Jamaica has not seen the \"worst of what could possibly happen.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"We can do as much as we can do, as humanly possible, and we leave the rest in the hands of God,\" Holness said.\n\nSeveral roadways in the country's interior settlements were impacted by fallen trees and utility poles, while some communities in the northern section were without electricity, according to the government's information service.\n\nKingston resident Pauline Lynch said that she had stockpiled food and water in anticipation of the storm's arrival. With wind already driving rain, Lynch said, \"I have no control over what is coming so I just have to pray that all people of Jamaica is safe and we don't suffer no deaths, no loss.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy midday, winds already howled in the capital, turning the sea into churning whitecaps as Beryl's eye scraped by the island's southern coast.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"We are very concerned about a wide variety of life threatening impacts in Jamaica,\" including storm surge, high winds and flash flooding, said Jon Porter, chief meteorologist at AccuWeather.\n\nPorter called Beryl \"the strongest and most dangerous hurricane threat that Jamaica has faced, probably, in decades.\"\n\nA hurricane warning was in effect for Jamaica, Grand Cayman, Little Cayman and Cayman Brac, and the coast of the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico from Puerto Costa Maya to Cancun. Beryl was forecast to weaken slightly over the next day or two, but still be at or near major-hurricane strength when it passes near the Cayman Islands on Thursday and into Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula late Thursday or Friday, according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJamaica was under a state of emergency as the island was declared a disaster zone hours before the impact of Beryl. Holness said that the disaster zone declaration will remain for the next seven days.\n\nAn evacuation order was in place for communities across Jamaica that are prone to flooding and landslides. Holness urged Jamaicans to move away from low-lying areas.\n\nMexico's Caribbean coast, meanwhile was preparing for Beryl.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe head of Mexico's civil defense agency said that Beryl is expected to make a rare double strike on Mexico. Laura Vel\u00e1zquez said the hurricane is expected to make landfall along a relatively unpopulated stretch of the Caribbean coast between Tulum and the inland town of Felipe Carrillo Puerto. Because the coast there is largely made up of lagoons and mangroves, there are few resorts or hotels in the area south of Tulum.\n\nOn Wednesday, Mexican government officials moved sea turtle eggs off Cancun beaches in an attempt to protect them from storm surge.\n\nThe hurricane is expected to weaken to a tropical storm as it crosses the Yucatan peninsula and reemerge over the weekend at storm strength into the Gulf of Mexico. Vel\u00e1zquez said that Beryl is then expected to hit Mexican territory a second time in the Gulf coast states of Veracruz or Tamaulipas, near the Texas border.\n\nLate Monday, Beryl became the earliest storm to develop into a Category 5 hurricane in the Atlantic and peaked at winds of 165 mph Tuesday before weakening to a still-destructive Category 4. Late Wednesday night, the storm's center was about 560 miles east-southeast of Tulum, Mexico. It had maximum sustained winds of 130 mph and was moving west-northwest at 21 mph. Hurricane strength winds extended 45 miles from the center.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Miami, hurricane center director Michael Brennan in an online briefing said people on the island should plan to stay sheltered throughout the day Wednesday with conditions only beginning to improve overnight.\n\nJamaica's southern coast, where Kingston is located, was expected to bear the brunt of Beryl with coastal water levels rising to 6 or 9 feet above normal tide levels in some area.\n\nHeavy rains of 4 to 8 inches, with up to a foot in isolated areas, threatened flash flooding and mudslides on the mountainous island, he said.\n\nAs Beryl barreled through the Caribbean Sea, rescue crews in southeastern islands fanned out to determine the extent of the damage the hurricane inflicted on Carriacou, an island in Grenada.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMichelle Forbes, the St. Vincent and Grenadines director of the National Emergency Management Organization, said that about 95% of homes in Mayreau and Union Island have been damaged by Hurricane Beryl.\n\nThree people were reported killed in Grenada and Carriacou and another in St. Vincent and the Grenadines, officials said. Three other deaths were reported in northern Venezuela, where five people are missing, officials said. About 25,000 people in that area also were affected by heavy rainfall from Beryl.\n\nOne fatality in Grenada occurred after a tree fell on a house, Kerryne James, the environment minister, told The Associated Press.\n\nGrenada's Prime Minister Dickon Mitchell said Tuesday there was no power, roads are impassable and the possible rise of the death toll \"remains a grim reality.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSt. Vincent and the Grenadines Prime Minister Ralph Gonsalves has promised to rebuild the archipelago.\n\nThe last strong hurricane to hit the southeast Caribbean was Hurricane Ivan 20 years ago, which killed dozens of people in Grenada.\n\nRelated StoriesView MoreHurricane season 2024 kicks off with vicious start, predicted to be especially activeBeryl heads

Beryl was downgraded to a Category 3 hurricane early Thursday with winds of 120 mph when it was about 50 miles southwest of Grand Cayman.\n\nBeryl is expected to dump up to half a foot of rain on the Cayman Islands Thursday and storm surge could raise water levels along the immediate coast by as much as 2 to 4 feet. Weather officials warned Beryl is expected to bring life-threatening surf and rip currents along the coasts of Jamaica, Cuba and the Cayman Islands. The currents could spread to the Yucatan Peninsula and parts of Central America later Thursday and then to eastern Mexico and much of the U.S. Gulf Coast by late Friday.\n\nWinds are expected to reach tropical storm strength in the Yucatan Peninsula on Thursday, making it difficult for anyone to be outside preparing given dangerous conditions expected to arrive later in the day or by early Friday, the hurricane center said.\n\nA hurricane warning was in effect for the Cayman Islands and the coast of the Yucatan Peninsula from Puerto Costa Maya to Cancun, including Cozumel, the hurricane center said. Beryl was forecast to weaken gradually over the next couple of days; however, it is still expected to be at or near hurricane intensity when it passes near the Cayman Islands on Thursday and heads toward the Yucatan Peninsula by late Thursday.\n\nThere were widespread power outages across Jamaica after Beryl brushed the island's southern coast on Wednesday. The hurricane thrashed Jamaica as a Category 4 storm, bringing destructive winds and rain.\n\nAt least one person was killed in Jamaica's Hanover parish after a tree fell on her home, according to Richard Thompson, acting director general at Jamaica's disaster agency. Nearly a thousand residents were in shelters by Wednesday evening, Thompson said.\n\nEmergency crews had evacuated people from flood-prone areas and airports were closed after Prime Minister Andrew Holness issued an islandwide curfew for Wednesday.\n\nA hurricane watch and tropical storm warning remained in effect for parts of the Yucatan Peninsula's coast. Mexico's government upgraded its tropical storm watch to a tropical storm warning from Progreso to Campeche, the hurricane center said. A tropical storm watch is also in effect for a large portion of the coast of Belize.\n\nThe hurricane center warned that Beryl will likely make landfall on the Yucatan Peninsula as early as Thursday night. In addition to heavy rain and wind, forecasters said dangerous storm surge flooding will threaten coastal areas.\n\n\"Widespread power outages and flash flooding are anticipated in the region,\" according to AccuWeather.\n\nDrone footage: As Hurricane Beryl tears through Caribbean, a drone sends back stunning footage\n\nDevelopments:\n\n\u220e The death toll from Beryl rose to at least 10 on Wednesday. But officials said deaths are expected to climb as communications come back online across islands that have been damaged by flooding and intense winds.\n\n\u220e Nerissa Gittens-McMillan, permanent secretary at St. Vincent and the Grenadines' agriculture ministry, warned of possible food shortages after 50% of plantain and banana crops were lost in the storm.\n\n\u220e Forecasters warned of strong rip currents along much of the Gulf Coast through the weekend. Surf conditions will likely become dangerous on the south coast of Texas.\n\nWill Hurricane Beryl hit Texas?\n\nPortions of South Texas are now within the forecast cone of Hurricane Beryl, which meteorologists say could arrive in the state over the weekend or early Monday.\n\nBut forecasters remain unsure of what Beryl will do and how strong it will be as it approaches the Gulf Coast after hitting Mexico: \"High uncertainty remains with both the track and intensity of Beryl,\" the National Weather Service said Wednesday.\n\n\"From Panama City, Florida to New Orleans, there is a low risk of direct impacts from Beryl, but from about Corpus Christi to Brownsville, Texas, the risk increases significantly due to the potential for Beryl to have more direct impacts,\" AccuWeather meteorologist Jonathan Porter said. \"That southern portion of the Texas coast is the zone we have to really watch.\"\n\nCoastal threats could begin this weekend, Weather.com warned: \"Well ahead of Beryl, onshore winds could lead to increasing surf, rip currents and coastal flooding along parts of the Gulf Coast from eastern Mexico to Texas and western Louisiana beginning as soon as Saturday, and continuing until just after Beryl's final landfall, Weather.com said. The rip current threat could extend further east along the northern Gulf Coast.\n\nBrennan said Tuesday that \"folks in the Texas coast, as we go into the holiday weekend, you're going to want to make sure you check back on the forecast and make sure you're ready for any potential impact. If we were to see tropical storm conditions affect those areas in the far western Gulf of Mexico, it could be during the day Saturday.\"\n\nHurricane Beryl tracker: Storm's path toward Jamaica, the Cayman Islands\n\nSome Caribbean islands report significant damages after Beryl\n\nAt least three islands report more than 90% of the homes and buildings either destroyed or severely damaged, the Caribbean Disaster Emergency Management Agency reported Wednesday. All three are within the chain of Grenadine Islands, where Beryl roared into the Caribbean on the southern end of the Windwards, between St. Vincent and Grenada.\n\nWith 19 participating states across the Caribbean, the agency was helping coordinate disaster response on Grenada, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines even as it continued to track Beryl's movements across Jamaica, Cayman Islands, and Belize.\n\nThe damage estimates for the Windwards - where Beryl made landfall over the island of Carriacou - are only \"a very preliminary look,\" said Elizabeth Riley, the disaster management agency's executive director. Beryl struck the islands with sustained winds of 150 mph and higher gusts on Monday, and the National Hurricane Center had warned that winds could be up to 30% higher on the tops of hills and mountains.\n\nThe impacts on the Grenadine Islands are \"quite significant,\" Riley said, leaving residents exposed and vulnerable. Even as recovery efforts began, a tropical wave brought rain and gusty winds Wednesday to the suffering residents.", "source": {"uri": "usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "USA Today"},

Power was knocked out in much of the capital.\n\nPrime minister Andrew Holness said on Wednesday afternoon that nearly 500 people were placed in shelters. By evening, he said that Jamaica has not seen the \"worst of what could possibly happen\".\n\n\"We can do as much as we can do, as humanly possible, and we leave the rest in the hands of God,\" Mr Holness said.\n\nSeveral roadways in the country's interior settlements were impacted by fallen trees and utility poles, while some communities in the northern section were without electricity.\n\nBy midday, winds already howled in the capital, turning the sea into churning whitecaps as Beryl's eye scraped by the island's southern coast.\n\n\"We are very concerned about a wide variety of life threatening impacts in Jamaica,\" including storm surge, high winds and flash flooding, said Jon Porter, chief meteorologist at AccuWeather.\n\nMr Porter called Beryl \"the strongest and most dangerous hurricane threat that Jamaica has faced, probably, in decades\".\n\nA hurricane warning was in effect for Jamaica, Grand Cayman, Little Cayman and Cayman Brac, and the coast of the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico from Puerto Costa Maya to Canc\u00fan.\n\nBeryl was forecast to weaken slightly over the next day or two, but still be at or near major-hurricane strength when it passes near the Cayman Islands on Thursday and into Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula late on Thursday or Friday, according to the US National Hurricane Centre.\n\nJamaica was under a state of emergency as the island was declared a disaster zone hours before the impact of Beryl. Mr Holness said that the disaster zone declaration will remain for the next seven days.\n\nAn evacuation order was in place for communities across Jamaica that are prone to flooding and landslides. Mr Holness urged Jamaicans to move away from low-lying areas.\n\nMexico's Caribbean coast, meanwhile was preparing for Beryl.\n\nThe head of Mexico's civil defence agency said that Beryl is expected to make a rare double strike on Mexico.\n\nLaura Velazquez said the hurricane is expected to make landfall along a relatively unpopulated stretch of the Caribbean coast between Tulum and the inland town of Felipe Carrillo Puerto.\n\nThe hurricane is expected to weaken to a tropical storm as it crosses the Yucatan peninsula and re-emerge over the weekend at storm strength into the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nMs Velazquez said that Beryl is then expected to hit Mexican territory a second time in the Gulf coast states of Veracruz or Tamaulipas, near the Texas border.\n\nLate on Monday, Beryl became the earliest storm to develop into a Category 5 hurricane in the Atlantic and peaked at winds of 270kph (165mph) on Tuesday before weakening to a still-destructive Category 4.\n\nLate on Wednesday night, the storm's centre was about 905km east-southeast of Tulum, Mexico. It had maximum sustained winds of 215kph and was moving west-northwest at 32kph. Hurricane strength winds extended 72km from the centre.\n\nIn Miami, hurricane centre director Michael Brennan in an online briefing said people on Jamaica should plan to stay sheltered throughout the day on Wednesday with conditions only beginning to improve overnight.\n\nJamaica's southern coast, where Kingston is located, was expected to bear the brunt of Beryl with coastal water levels rising to 1.8m to 2.7m (6ft to 9ft) above normal tide levels in some areas.\n\nHeavy rains of four to eight inches, with up to a foot in isolated areas, threatened flash flooding and mudslides on the mountainous island. - AP", "source": {"uri": "irishtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Irish Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Holness",

By evening, the country's prime minister said the country had yet to see the worst of it.\n\n\"We can do as much as we can do, as humanly possible, and we leave the rest in the hands of God,\" Prime Minister Andrew Holness said.\n\nThe storm knocked out power to Kingston and some communities on the northern part of the island, thanks to downed utility poles and trees.\n\nBefore Beryl, a Category 4 storm that has so far killed seven people, arrived in Jamaica's capital city, people could be seen boarding windows and pulling boats from the water.\n\n\"There are going to be multiple life-threatening hazards that are going to play out over the next 6 to 12 hours across Jamacia,\" said U.S. National Hurricane Center Director Michael Brennan.\n\nConditions include strong wind gusts and storm surge of 0.3 to 2.7 meters over typical tides with possible destructive waves atop it. Ten to 20 centimeters of rain will pelt most of the country, maxing at 30 centimeters in some areas, which could cause mudslides and flash flooding.\n\n\"Plan to shelter in place for the remainder of the day well into tonight,\" Brennan added for those living in Jamaica.\n\n\"Jamaica must take this hurricane seriously. I am now declaring the whole of Jamaica to be a disaster area ... for the next seven days,\" Holness, the prime minister, said in a video posted on X.\n\nAn island-wide curfew was to be imposed. And an evacuation order was issued for flood- and landslide-prone parts of the country.\n\nThe NHC says Hurricane Beryl has maximum sustained winds of 230 kph, making it a Category 4 storm on the center's five-level scale that measures a storm's maximum sustained wind speed and destructive potential. The storm has hurricane-force winds up to 75 kilometers from its center and tropical-storm force winds up to 295 kilometers from the center.\n\nAt last report Beryl was located just offshore of the southwest part of Jamaica.\n\nHurricane warnings are in effect for Jamaica and the islands of Grand Cayman, Little Cayman and Cayman Brac, while hurricane watches are in effect for Haiti and the Dominican Republic, which shares the island Hispaniola, and Mexico's Yucatan peninsula, where forecasters believe Beryl will reach by Thursday.\n\nThe central American nation of Belize is under a tropical storm watch. Texas may also see some inclement weather.\n\nThe Cayman Islands and Yucatan Peninsula will receive 5 to 10 centimeters of rainfall between Thursday and Friday. The hurricane is also expected to trigger dangerous storm surges that could raise water levels between 2 to 3 meters above normal tide levels in Jamaica, and up to one meter above normal tide levels on the Cayman Islands.\n\nThe NHC is warning that the southern coasts of Puerto Rico and Hispaniola will experience large swells that could cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.\n\nThe White House said on its social media account X that U.S. President Joe Biden is closely monitoring Hurricane Beryl and connecting with officials including the U.S. Agency for International Development and the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\n\nHurricane Beryl has left behind a trail of death and destruction since making landfall Monday on Grenada's Carriacou island as a Category 4 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 241 kph. Prime Minister Dickon Mitchell of Grenada says Carriacou and the nearby island of Petit Martinique sustained the brunt of Beryl's force, with scores of homes and businesses flattened in Carriacou and residents cut off from the outside due to downed power lines and damaged roads.\n\nAmong those whose homes were damaged on Carriacou were the parents of Simon Stiell, the head of the United Nations climate change agency. Stiell issued a statement saying, \"it's clear that the climate crisis is pushing disasters to record-breaking new levels of destruction.\"\n\nPrime Minister Ralph Gonsalves of the archipelago nation of St. Vincent and the Grenadines said Tuesday that 90% of homes on Union Island were destroyed.\n\nBeryl grew from a tropical storm to a major hurricane in 42 hours, which has only happened six times in the recorded history of Atlantic hurricanes. The hurricane is also the earliest to reach Category 4 status in the region and the earliest to reach Category 5 strength. Hurricane Dennis became a Category 4 storm on July 8, 2005.\n\nBeryl is the second named storm in the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season. Tropical Storm Alberto hit northeastern Mexico in June, killing four people.\n\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has warned of an above-average hurricane season.", "source": {"uri":

Beryl was downgraded to a Category 3 hurricane early Thursday with winds of 120 mph when it was about 50 miles southwest of Grand Cayman.\n\nBeryl is expected to dump up to half a foot of rain on the Cayman Islands Thursday and storm surge could raise water levels along the immediate coast by as much as 2 to 4 feet. Weather officials warned Beryl is expected to bring life-threatening surf and rip currents along the coasts of Jamaica, Cuba and the Cayman Islands. The currents could spread to the Yucatan Peninsula and parts of Central America later Thursday and then to eastern Mexico and much of the U.S. Gulf Coast by late Friday.\n\nWinds are expected to reach tropical storm strength in the Yucatan Peninsula on Thursday, making it difficult for anyone to be outside preparing given dangerous conditions expected to arrive later in the day or by early Friday, the hurricane center said.\n\nA hurricane warning was in effect for the Cayman Islands and the coast of the Yucatan Peninsula from Puerto Costa Maya to Cancun, including Cozumel, the hurricane center said. Beryl was forecast to weaken gradually over the next couple of days; however, it is still expected to be at or near hurricane intensity when it passes near the Cayman Islands on Thursday and heads toward the Yucatan Peninsula by late Thursday.\n\nThere were widespread power outages across Jamaica after Beryl brushed the island's southern coast on Wednesday. The hurricane thrashed Jamaica as a Category 4 storm, bringing destructive winds and rain.\n\nAt least one person was killed in Jamaica's Hanover parish after a tree fell on her home, according to Richard Thompson, acting director general at Jamaica's disaster agency. Nearly a thousand residents were in shelters by Wednesday evening, Thompson said.\n\nEmergency crews had evacuated people from flood-prone areas and airports were closed after Prime Minister Andrew Holness issued an islandwide curfew for Wednesday.\n\nA hurricane watch and tropical storm warning remained in effect for parts of the Yucatan Peninsula's coast. Mexico's government upgraded its tropical storm watch to a tropical storm warning from Progreso to Campeche, the hurricane center said. A tropical storm watch is also in effect for a large portion of the coast of Belize.\n\nThe hurricane center warned that Beryl will likely make landfall on the Yucatan Peninsula as early as Thursday night. In addition to heavy rain and wind, forecasters said dangerous storm surge flooding will threaten coastal areas.\n\n\"Widespread power outages and flash flooding are anticipated in the region,\" according to AccuWeather.\n\nDrone footage: As Hurricane Beryl tears through Caribbean, a drone sends back stunning footage\n\nDevelopments:\n\n\u220e The death toll from Beryl rose to at least 10 on Wednesday. But officials said deaths are expected to climb as communications come back online across islands that have been damaged by flooding and intense winds.\n\n\u220e Nerissa Gittens-McMillan, permanent secretary at St. Vincent and the Grenadines' agriculture ministry, warned of possible food shortages after 50% of plantain and banana crops were lost in the storm.\n\n\u220e Forecasters warned of strong rip currents along much of the Gulf Coast through the weekend. Surf conditions will likely become dangerous on the south coast of Texas.\n\nPortions of South Texas are now within the forecast cone of Hurricane Beryl, which meteorologists say could arrive in the state over the weekend or early Monday.\n\nBut forecasters remain unsure of what Beryl will do and how strong it will be as it approaches the Gulf Coast after hitting Mexico: \"High uncertainty remains with both the track and intensity of Beryl,\" the National Weather Service said Wednesday.\n\n\"From Panama City, Florida to New Orleans, there is a low risk of direct impacts from Beryl, but from about Corpus Christi to Brownsville, Texas, the risk increases significantly due to the potential for Beryl to have more direct impacts,\" AccuWeather meteorologist Jonathan Porter said. \"That southern portion of the Texas coast is the zone we have to really watch.\"\n\nCoastal threats could begin this weekend, Weather.com warned: \"Well ahead of Beryl, onshore winds could lead to increasing surf, rip currents and coastal flooding along parts of the Gulf Coast from eastern Mexico to Texas and western Louisiana beginning as soon as Saturday, and continuing until just after Beryl's final landfall, Weather.com said. The rip current threat could extend further east along the northern Gulf Coast.\n\nBrennan said Tuesday that \"folks in the Texas coast, as we go into the holiday weekend, you're going to want to make sure you check back on the forecast and make sure you're ready for any potential impact. If we were to see tropical storm conditions affect those areas in the far western Gulf of Mexico, it could be during the day Saturday.\"\n\nHurricane Beryl tracker: Storm's path toward Jamaica, the Cayman Islands\n\nAt least three islands report more than 90% of the homes and buildings either destroyed or severely damaged, the Caribbean Disaster Emergency Management Agency reported Wednesday. All three are within the chain of Grenadine Islands, where Beryl roared into the Caribbean on the southern end of the Windwards, between St. Vincent and Grenada.\n\nWith 19 participating states across the Caribbean, the agency was helping coordinate disaster response on Grenada, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines even as it continued to track Beryl's movements across Jamaica, Cayman Islands, and Belize.\n\nThe damage estimates for the Windwards - where Beryl made landfall over the island of Carriacou - are only \"a very preliminary look,\" said Elizabeth Riley, the disaster management agency's executive director. Beryl struck the islands with sustained winds of 150 mph and higher gusts on Monday, and the National Hurricane Center had warned that winds could be up to 30% higher on the tops of hills and mountains.\n\nThe impacts on the Grenadine Islands are \"quite significant,\" Riley said, leaving residents exposed and vulnerable. Even as recovery efforts began, a tropical wave brought rain and gusty winds Wednesday to the suffering residents.\n\nContributing: Reuters", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news",

By evening, the country's prime minister said the country had yet to see the worst of it.\n\n'We can do as much as we can do, as humanly possible, and we leave the rest in the hands of God,' Prime Minister Andrew Holness said.\n\nThe storm knocked out power to Kingston and some communities on the northern part of the island, thanks to downed utility poles and trees.\n\nBefore Beryl, a Category 4 storm that has so far killed seven people, arrived in Jamaica's capital city, people could be seen boarding windows and pulling boats from the water.\n\n'There are going to be multiple life-threatening hazards that are going to play out over the next 6 to 12 hours across Jamacia,' said U.S. National Hurricane Center Director Michael Brennan.\n\nConditions include strong wind gusts and storm surge of 0.3 to 2.7 meters over typical tides with possible destructive waves atop it. Ten to 20 centimeters of rain will pelt most of the country, maxing at 30 centimeters in some areas, which could cause mudslides and flash flooding.\n\nPeople lounge on the beach as the sun sets ahead of Hurricane Beryl's expected arrival, in Playa del Carmen, Mexico, July 3, 2024.\n\n'Plan to shelter in place for the remainder of the day well into tonight,' Brennan added for those living in Jamaica.\n\n'Jamaica must take this hurricane seriously. I am now declaring the whole of Jamaica to be a disaster area ... for the next seven days,' Holness, the prime minister, said in a video posted on X.\n\nAn island-wide curfew was to be imposed. And an evacuation order was issued for flood- and landslide-prone parts of the country.\n\nThe NHC says Hurricane Beryl has maximum sustained winds of 230 kph, making it a Category 4 storm on the center's five-level scale that measures a storm's maximum sustained wind speed and destructive potential. The storm has hurricane-force winds up to 75 kilometers from its center and tropical-storm force winds up to 295 kilometers from the center.\n\nAt last report Beryl was located just offshore of the southwest part of Jamaica.\n\nHurricane warnings are in effect for Jamaica and the islands of Grand Cayman, Little Cayman and Cayman Brac, while hurricane watches are in effect for Haiti and the Dominican Republic, which shares the island Hispaniola, and Mexico's Yucatan peninsula, where forecasters believe Beryl will reach by Thursday.\n\nThe central American nation of Belize is under a tropical storm watch. Texas may also see some inclement weather.\n\nThe Cayman Islands and Yucatan Peninsula will receive 5 to 10 centimeters of rainfall between Thursday and Friday. The hurricane is also expected to trigger dangerous storm surges that could raise water levels between 2 to 3 meters above normal tide levels in Jamaica, and up to one meter above normal tide levels on the Cayman Islands.\n\nThe NHC is warning that the southern coasts of Puerto Rico and Hispaniola will experience large swells that could cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.\n\nThe White House said on its social media account X that U.S. President Joe Biden is closely monitoring Hurricane Beryl and connecting with officials including the U.S. Agency for International Development and the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\n\nHurricane Beryl has left behind a trail of death and destruction since making landfall Monday on Grenada's Carriacou island as a Category 4 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 241 kph. Prime Minister Dickon Mitchell of Grenada says Carriacou and the nearby island of Petit Martinique sustained the brunt of Beryl's force, with scores of homes and businesses flattened in Carriacou and residents cut off from the outside due to downed power lines and damaged roads.\n\nAmong those whose homes were damaged on Carriacou were the parents of Simon Stiell, the head of the United Nations climate change agency. Stiell issued a statement saying, 'it's clear that the climate crisis is pushing disasters to record-breaking new levels of destruction.'\n\nPrime Minister Ralph Gonsalves of the archipelago nation of St. Vincent and the Grenadines said Tuesday that 90% of homes on Union Island were destroyed.\n\nBeryl grew from a tropical storm to a major hurricane in 42 hours, which has only happened six times in the recorded history of Atlantic hurricanes. The hurricane is also the earliest to reach Category 4 status in the region and the earliest to reach Category 5 strength. Hurricane Dennis became a Category 4 storm on July 8, 2005.\n\nBeryl is the second named storm in the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season. Tropical Storm Alberto hit northeastern Mexico in June, killing four people.\n\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has warned of an above-average hurricane season.\n\nSome information in this report came from The Associated Press, Reuters and Agence France-Presse.\n\nThe Voice of America provides news and information in more than 40 languages to an estimated weekly audience of over 326 million people.

At least six people have already been killed by the storm.\n\nIn Kingston, Jamaica's capital city, people could be seen boarding windows and pulling boats from the water.\n\n\"There are going to be multiple life-threatening hazards that are going to play out over the next 6 to 12 hours across Jamaica,\" said U.S. National Hurricane Center Director Michael Brennan.\n\nConditions include strong wind gusts and storm surge of 0.3 to 2.7 meters over typical tides with possible destructive waves atop it. Ten to 20 centimeters of rain will pelt most of the country, maxing at 30 centimeters in some areas, which could cause mudslides and flash flooding.\n\n\"Plan to shelter in place for the remainder of the day well into tonight,\" Brennan added for those living in Jamaica.\n\n\"Jamaica must take this hurricane seriously. I am now declaring the whole of Jamaica to be a disaster area ... for the next seven days,\" said Andrew Holness, prime minister of Jamaica, in a recent video posted on X.\n\nPalm trees wilt after being uprooted by Hurricane Beryl in St. Patrick, Grenada, July 2, 2024.\n\nAn island-wide curfew will be imposed. An evacuation order has been issued for flood- and landslide-prone parts of the country.\n\nThe NHC says Hurricane Beryl has maximum sustained winds of 230 kilometers an hour, making it a Category 4 storm on the center's five-level scale that measures a storm's maximum sustained wind speed and destructive potential. The storm has hurricane-force winds up to 75 kilometers from its center and tropical-storm force winds up to 295 kilometers from the center.\n\nAt last report, Beryl was located about 125 kilometers southeast of Kingston. The NHC says that the center of the storm will move through or near the country within the next several hours.\n\nHurricane warnings are in effect for Jamaica and the islands of Grand Cayman, Little Cayman and Cayman Brac, while hurricane watches are in effect for Haiti and the Dominican Republic, which shares the island Hispaniola, and Mexico's Yucatan peninsula, where forecasters believe Beryl will reach by Thursday.\n\nThe central American nation of Belize is under a tropical storm watch. Texas may also see some inclement weather.\n\nScattered debris and houses with missing roofs are seen in a drone photograph after Hurricane Beryl passed the island of Petite Martinique, Grenada July 2, 2024.\n\nThe Cayman Islands and Yucatan peninsula will receive 5 to 10 centimeters of rainfall between Thursday and Friday. The hurricane is also expected to trigger dangerous storm surges that could raise water levels between 2 to 3 meters above normal tide levels in Jamaica, and up to one meter above normal tide levels on the Cayman Islands.\n\nNHC is warning that the southern coasts of Puerto Rico and Hispaniola will experience large swells that could cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.\n\nThe White House said on its social media account X that U.S. President Joe Biden is closely monitoring Hurricane Beryl and connecting with officials including the U.S. Agency for International Development and the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\n\nHurricane Beryl has left behind a trail of death and destruction since making landfall Monday on Grenada's Carriacou island as a Category 4 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 241 kilometers an hour. Prime Minister Dickon Mitchell of Grenada says Carriacou and the nearby island of Petit Martinique sustained the brunt of Beryl's force, with scores of homes and businesses flattened in Carriacou and residents cut off from the outside due to downed power lines and damaged roads.\n\nAmong those whose homes were damaged on Carriacou were the parents of Simon Stiell, the head of the United Nations climate change agency. Stiell issued a statement saying, \"it's clear that the climate crisis is pushing disasters to record-breaking new levels of destruction.\"\n\nFamily members begin to repair their home damaged in the passing of Hurricane Beryl, in Ottley Hall, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, July 2, 2024.\n\nPrime Minister Ralph Gonsalves of the archipelago nation of St. Vincent and the Grenadines said Tuesday that 90% of homes on Union Island were destroyed.\n\nBeryl grew from a tropical storm to a major hurricane in 42 hours, which has only happened six times in the recorded history of Atlantic hurricanes. The hurricane is also the earliest to reach Category 4 status in the region and the earliest to reach Category 5 strength. Hurricane Dennis became a Category 4 storm on July 8, 2005.\n\nBeryl is the second named storm in the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season. Tropical Storm Alberto hit northeastern Mexico in June, killing four people.\n\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has warned of an above average hurricane season.\n\nSome information in this report came from The Associated Press, Reuters and Agence France-Presse.\n\nThe Voice of America provides news and information in more than 40 languages to an estimated weekly audience of over 326 million people.

With wind already whipping a light rain, Lynch said, \"I have no control over what is coming so I just have to pray that all people of Jamaica is safe and we don't suffer no deaths, no loss.\"\n\nBy midday, winds howled in the capital, turning the sea into churning whitecaps as Beryl's eye scraped by the island's southern coast.\n\n\"We are very concerned about a wide variety of life-threatening impacts in Jamaica,\" including storm surge, high winds and flash flooding, said Jon Porter, chief meteorologist at AccuWeather.\n\nPorter called Beryl \"the strongest and most dangerous hurricane threat that Jamaica has faced, probably, in decades.\"\n\nA hurricane warning was in effect for Jamaica, Grand Cayman, Little Cayman and Cayman Brac. Beryl was forecast to weaken slightly over the next day or two, but still be at or near major-hurricane strength when it passes near or over Jamaica on Wednesday, near the Cayman Islands on Thursday and into Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula on Friday, according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center.\n\nJamaica was under a state of emergency as the island was declared a disaster zone hours before the impact of Hurricane Beryl.\n\nJamaican Prime Minister Andrew Holness said that the disaster zone declaration will remain for the next seven days. He also announced an island-wide curfew between 6 a.m. and 6 p.m. on Wednesday.\n\nSecurity forces \"will be fully mobilized to maintain public order and assist with disaster relief. As soon as the hurricane has passed, the security forces have developed strategic plans to counter any potential threat of looting or any other opportunistic crimes,\" Holness warned.\n\nAn evacuation order was also issued for communities across Jamaica that are prone to flooding and landslides. Holness urged Jamaicans to move away from low-lying areas.\n\nA hurricane watch was in effect for Haiti's southern coast and the Yucatan's east coast. Belize issued a tropical storm watch stretching south from its border with Mexico to Belize City.\n\nLate Monday, Beryl became the earliest storm to develop into a Category 5 hurricane in the Atlantic and peaked at winds of 165 mph Tuesday before weakening to a still-destructive Category 4. On Wednesday, the storm's center was about 45 miles south of Kingston. It had maximum sustained winds of 140 mph and was moving west-northwest at 18 mph. Hurricane strength winds extended 45 miles from the center.\n\nIn Miami, U.S. National Hurricane Center Director Michael Brennan in an online briefing said that people on the island should plan to stay sheltered throughout the day Wednesday with conditions only beginning to improve overnight.\n\nJamaica's southern coast, where Kingston is located, was expected to bear the brunt of Beryl with coastal water levels rising to 6 or 9 feet above normal tide levels in some area.\n\nHeavy rains of 4 to 8 inches, with up to a foot in isolated areas, threatened flash flooding and mudslides on the mountainous island, he said.\n\nMexico's Caribbean coast was preparing for Beryl Wednesday. The government issued a hurricane warning for the coast of the Yucatan Peninsula from Puerto Costa Maya to Cancun.\n\nThe head of Mexico's civil defense agency said that Beryl is expected to make a rare double strike on Mexico. Laura Vel\u00e1zquez said the hurricane is expected to make landfall between late Thursday and early Friday along a relatively unpopulated stretch of the Caribbean coast between Tulum and the inland town of Felipe Carrillo Puerto. Because the coast there is largely made up of lagoons and mangroves, there are few resorts or hotels in the area south of Tulum.\n\nThree people were reported killed in Grenada and Carriacou and another in St. Vincent and the Grenadines, officials said. Two other deaths were reported in northern Venezuela, where five people are missing, officials said. About 25,000 people in that area also were affected by heavy rainfall from Beryl.\n\nInformation for this article was contributed by Mark Stevenson and Coral Murphy Marcos of The Associated Press.\n\nFishing boats lie in the middle of the street for protection from Hurricane Beryl in Kingston, Jamaica, Tuesday, July 2, 2024.

Apart from that, it's mainly concrete so there's not much we can do,\" Brown told the Jamaica Observer newspaper.\n\nAs of Wednesday night, Beryl was packing maximum sustained winds of 130 mph (215 kph), said the NHC.\n\nMore from this section Mitchell agrees to three-year extension with NBA Cavs: reports Idahoans deliver signatures seeking open primaries Hurricane Beryl storms through Caribbean with 155MPH winds - 'No communication' -\n\nBeryl has already left a trail of death with at least three people killed in Grenada, where the storm made landfall Monday, as well as one in St Vincent and the Grenadines and three in Venezuela.\n\nRalph Gonsalves, prime minister of St Vincent and the Grenadines, said that it would take a \"herculean effort\" to rebuild after the substantial destruction and that \"90-odd percent of the houses were blown away\" on Union Island.\n\n\"Most of the country doesn't have electricity, and more than half without water at the moment,\" he said.\n\nGrenada's Prime Minister Dickon Mitchell said the island of Carriacou, which was struck by the eye of the storm, has been all but cut off, with houses, telecommunications and fuel facilities there flattened.\n\nThe 13.5-square mile (35-square kilometer) island is home to around 9,000 people. At least two people there died, Mitchell said, with a third killed on the country's main island of Grenada when a tree fell on a house.\n\nIn St Vincent and the Grenadines, one person on the island of Bequia was reported dead from the storm, while a man died in Venezuela's northeastern coastal state of Sucre when he was swept away by a flooded river, officials there said.\n\n- Climate change -\n\nIt is extremely rare for such a powerful storm to form this early in the Atlantic hurricane season, which runs from early June to late November.\n\nWarm ocean temperatures are key for hurricanes, and North Atlantic waters are currently between two and five degrees Fahrenheit (1-3 degrees Celsius) warmer than normal, according to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).\n\nUN climate chief Simon Stiell, who has family on the island of Carriacou, said climate change was \"pushing disasters to record-breaking new levels of destruction.\"\n\n\"Disasters on a scale that used to be the stuff of science fiction are becoming meteorological facts, and the climate crisis is the chief culprit,\" he said Monday, reporting that his parents' property was damaged.\n\nbur-dw-bfm/dhw", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brattleboro Reformer"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ivan_shaw@reformer.com", "name": "Ivan Shaw", "type":

Apart from that, it's mainly concrete so there's not much we can do,\" Brown told the Jamaica Observer newspaper.\n\nAs of Wednesday night, Beryl was packing maximum sustained winds of 130 mph (215 kph), said the NHC.\n\nA destroyed dock is pictured after the passage of Hurricane Beryl in Enriquillo, Dominican Republic, on July 3, 2024. (Photo by Melbin Domingo / AFP)\n\n'No communication'\n\nBeryl has already left a trail of death with at least three people killed in Grenada, where the storm made landfall Monday, as well as one in St Vincent and the Grenadines and three in Venezuela.\n\nRalph Gonsalves, prime minister of St Vincent and the Grenadines, said that it would take a \"herculean effort\" to rebuild after the substantial destruction and that \"90-odd percent of the houses were blown away\" on Union Island.\n\n\"Most of the country doesn't have electricity, and more than half without water at the moment,\" he said.\n\nGrenada's Prime Minister Dickon Mitchell said the island of Carriacou, which was struck by the eye of the storm, has been all but cut off, with houses, telecommunications and fuel facilities there flattened.\n\nThe 13.5-square mile (35-square kilometer) island is home to around 9,000 people. At least two people there died, Mitchell said, with a third killed on the country's main island of Grenada when a tree fell on a house.\n\nIn St Vincent and the Grenadines, one person on the island of Bequia was reported dead from the storm, while a man died in Venezuela's northeastern coastal state of Sucre when he was swept away by a flooded river, officials there said.\n\nClimate change\n\nIt is extremely rare for such a powerful storm to form this early in the Atlantic hurricane season, which runs from early June to late November.\n\nWarm ocean temperatures are key for hurricanes, and North Atlantic waters are currently between two and five degrees Fahrenheit (1-3 degrees Celsius) warmer than normal, according to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).\n\nUN climate chief Simon Stiell, who has family on the island of Carriacou, said climate change was \"pushing disasters to record-breaking new levels of destruction.\"\n\n\"Disasters on a scale that used to be the stuff of science fiction are becoming meteorological facts, and the climate crisis is the chief culprit,\" he said Monday, reporting that his parents' property was damaged.", "source":

Large swells will spread to much of the U.S. Gulf Coast by late Friday, causing \"life-threatening\" surf and rip currents, the National Hurricane Center said.\n\n\"There is an increasing risk of strong winds, storm surge, and heavy rainfall in portions of northeastern Mexico and southern Texas later this weekend,\" forecasters said Thursday morning.\n\nBeryl was the earliest storm to strengthen into a Category 5 hurricane in the Atlantic, and the record-breaking storm left at least seven people dead on islands in the eastern Caribbean.\n\nBeryl's core will move away from the Cayman Islands through Thursday afternoon, though a hurricane warning was still in place Thursday morning, and Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula is in its path early Friday, the National Hurricane Center said.\n\nAfter crossing the Yucatan Peninsula, Beryl will emerge in the southwestern Gulf Friday night and head northwest over open water Saturday, putting the southern half of Texas' Gulf coast, including Corpus Christi, in Beryl's forecast cone of probability for early next week.\n\nAs of 11 a.m. Thursday, Beryl was 95 miles west-southwest of Grand Cayman and 330 miles east-southeast of Tulum, Mexico, moving west-northwestward at 18 mph, with maximum sustained winds of 115 mph. Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 30 miles from the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 160 miles.\n\nWhile Beryl weakened Thursday morning and will continue to weaken, it will remain a hurricane until it makes landfall in the Yucatan Peninsula, the hurricane center said.\n\nMexico has issued a hurricane warning for the coast of the Yucatan Peninsula, from Puerto Costa Maya near the Belize border north to Cancun and a tropical storm warning from Cabo Catoche to Progresso in the Yucatan Peninsula.\n\nBeryl's forecast cone shows it weakening into a tropical storm Friday night and into the weekend while crossing over the Gulf, but it is expected to strengthen back into a hurricane by the time it reaches the northern Gulf coast of Mexico, near the Texas border, Monday morning.\n\nThe eastern coast of the Yucatan Peninsula could see between 3 and 5 feet of storm surge and 1 to 3 feet on the western coast and possibly up to 10 inches of rain in some areas later Thursday into Friday, the NHC said. Some scattered flash flooding is expected.\n\nWhile hurricane conditions and tropical-storm conditions will subside in parts of the Cayman Islands by Thursday afternoon, the islands could see between 2 and 4 feet of storm surge and 4 to 6 inches of rain Thursday.\n\nEarlier in the week, Beryl's eye wall brushed by Jamaica's southern coast Wednesday afternoon knocking out power and ripping roofs off homes. Prime Minister Andrew Holness said Jamaica had not seen the \"worst of what could possibly happen.\"\n\nSeveral roadways in Jamaica's interior settlements were impacted by fallen trees and utility poles, while some communities in the northern section were without electricity, according to the government's Information Service.\n\nJamaica was under a state of emergency as the island was declared a disaster zone hours before the impact of Hurricane Beryl. Holness said that the disaster zone declaration will remain for the next seven days.\n\nThe worst perhaps came earlier in Beryl's trajectory when it smacked two small islands of the Lesser Antilles.\n\nMichelle Forbes, the St. Vincent and Grenadines director of the National Emergency Management Organization, said that about 95% of homes in Mayreau and Union Island have been damaged by Hurricane Beryl.\n\nBeryl's eyewall will track near the Yucatan Peninsula just south of Tulum and Cancun as a weaker hurricane early Friday.\n\nIn Cancun on Wednesday afternoon, Donna McNaughton, a 43-year-old cardiac physiologist from Scotland, was taking the approaching storm in stride.\n\nHer flight home wasn't leaving until Monday, so she planned to follow her hotel's advice to wait it out.\n\n\"We're not too scared of. It'll die down,\" she said. \"And we're used to wind and rain in Scotland anyway.\"\n\nThe head of Mexico's civil defense agency said that Beryl is expected to make a rare double strike on Mexico. Laura Vel\u00e1zquez said the hurricane is expected to make landfall between late Thursday and early Friday along a relatively unpopulated stretch of the Caribbean coast between Tulum and the inland town of Felipe Carrillo Puerto.\n\nThe hurricane is expected to weaken to a tropical storm as it crosses the Yucatan peninsula and reemerge over the weekend at storm strength into the Gulf of Mexico. Vel\u00e1zquez said that Beryl is then expected to hit Mexican territory a second time in the Gulf coast states of Veracruz or Tamaulipas, near the Texas border.\n\nLate Monday, Beryl became the earliest storm to develop into a Category 5 hurricane in the Atlantic and peaked at winds of 165 mph Tuesday before weakening to a still-destructive Category 4.\n\nIt was the first Category 4 storm to occur in June and the earliest Category 4 on record in the Atlantic Basin.\n\nThe storm strengthened from a tropical depression to a major hurricane in just 42 hours, which only six other Atlantic hurricanes have done, and never before September, according to hurricane expert Sam Lillo.\n\nBeryl made landfall Monday in the Grenadine Islands north of Grenada as a powerful Category 4 storm with sustained winds of 155 mph, just shy of the minimum Category 5 threshold of 157 mph.\n\nThree people were reported killed in Grenada and Carriacou and another in St. Vincent and the Grenadines, officials said. Three other deaths were reported in northern Venezuela, where four people were missing, officials said.\n\nOne fatality in Grenada occurred after a tree fell on a house, Kerryne James, the environment minister, told The Associated Press.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center also is keeping an eye on a tropical wave over the eastern Caribbean Sea that could become a tropical depression, though any development would happen slowly.\n\nForecasters expect it to cross the Yucatan Peninsula, as Beryl did, and emerge in the Gulf of Mexico by early next week, where it could develop.\n\nAs of 8 a.m. Thursday, forecasters gave it a 10% chance of developing in the next two days and a 20% chance over the next week.\n\nIt is expected to move west to west-northwest at 20 mph to 25 mph across the Caribbean over the next few days, forecasters said.\n\nIf it develops, it would be named Debby and follow a very similar path as Hurricane Beryl.", "source": {"uri": "sun-sentinel.com", "dataType":

Death Toll in the Caribbean Rises", "body": "Jamaica braces for Hurricane Beryl, a Category 4 storm with 140 mph winds, expected to hit the southern coast soon, warns the US National Hurricane Center (NHC).\n\nThe storm has killed nine across the Caribbean, with more expected as communication improves.\n\nUnion Island saw 90% of homes destroyed or damaged, according to BBC.\n\nA curfew is in place in Jamaica, and Prime Minister Andrew Holness urges evacuations from flood-prone areas.\n\nThe Jamaica Public Service Company paused power restoration for worker safety.\n\nNHC's Dr. Michael Brennan warns of \"devastating hurricane-force winds,\" 12 inches of rain, flooding, mudslides, and 9-foot storm surges.\n\nResidents are advised to stay in safe places for at least 12 hours.\n\nREAD NEXT: Caribbean Devastated by Record-Breaking Category 4 Hurricane Beryl\n\nHurricane Beryl hit Jamaica Wednesday, bringing fierce winds and heavy rain.\n\nThe Category 4 storm had already killed at least seven people and caused severe damage in the southeastern Caribbean.\n\nJamaica, Grand Cayman, Little Cayman, and Cayman Brac were under hurricane warnings.\n\nAlthough Beryl was expected to weaken, it was still forecast to remain a major hurricane as it moved past Jamaica, the Cayman Islands, and toward Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula.\n\nJamaica declared a state of emergency, with an island-wide curfew and evacuation orders for flood-prone areas.\n\nPrime Minister Holness assured that security forces would maintain order and assist with disaster relief, AP News reports.\n\nHurricane Beryl, which briefly reached Category 5 status, had maximum maintained winds of 140 mph and was 65 miles from Kingston on Wednesday.\n\nHeavy rains threatened flash flooding and mudslides.\n\nThe storm was expected to impact Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula and potentially hit the Gulf coast states of Veracruz or Tamaulipas.\n\nIn the Caribbean, rescue crews assessed the damage, with three deaths in Grenada and Carriacou, one in St. Vincent and the Grenadines, and two in Venezuela, where five people were missing.\n\nApproximately 25,000 people in Venezuela were affected by heavy rainfall.\n\nA fatality in Grenada occurred when a tree fell on a house, according to Environment Minister Kerryne James.\n\nCarriacou and Petit Martinique suffered the most damage, with many homes and businesses flattened.\n\nPrime Minister Dickon Mitchell reported widespread power outages and impassable roads.\n\nIn St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Prime Minister Ralph Gonsalves pledged to rebuild, noting that 90% of homes on Union Island were destroyed.\n\nJournalist Mikey Hutchinson described extensive damage to homes and agriculture in Grenada, Aljazeera noted.\n\nThe destruction recalled Hurricane Ivan from 20 years ago, which devastated Grenada.\n\nUnited Nations Climate Change Executive Secretary Simon Stiell highlighted the worsening climate crisis, pointing to Hurricane Beryl's impact on his parents' home in Carriacou and other global climate-related disasters.\n\nBeryl, the Atlantic season's first hurricane, is an early and intense storm, reflecting climate change's influence.\n\nIt rapidly strengthened from a Category 1 to a Category 4 storm in under 10 hours, the fastest recorded before September.\n\nThe 2024 hurricane season is expected to be highly active, with up to 25 named storms, including 13 hurricanes and four major hurricanes.\n\nThis projection surpasses the average of 14 named storms, seven hurricanes, and three major hurricanes.\n\nREAD MORE: Hurricane Beryl

The storm hit St. Vincent and the Grenadines earlier in the week. Prime Minister Ralph Gonsalves said in a radio interview that Union Island was \"flattened\" and it would \"be a Herculean effort to rebuild.\"\n\nThere were at least three confirmed fatalities and crop damage was widespread, senior officials told Reuters. Union Island suffered destruction of more than 90% of buildings. In Grenada, Prime Minister Dickon Mitchell described \"Armageddon-like\" conditions after the storm made impact earlier in the week, with no power and widespread destruction, while also confirming three deaths.\n\nVenezuelan President Nicolas Maduro told state television that three people had died, four were missing, and over 8,000 homes damaged. The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has forecast a large number of major hurricanes in an \"extraordinary\" season this year. The season runs from the start of June to the end of November\n\nBeryl's destructive power, coming so early in the hurricane season, underscores the consequences of a warmer Atlantic Ocean, which scientists cite as a sign of human-caused climate change fueling extreme weather.

Destructive winds, life-threatening storm surge, flooding and torrential rains are expected along Beryl's path.\n\nAs of 8 p.m. EDT Wednesday, the NHC reported maximum, sustained winds near 215 km/h in its latest update.\n\nSome weakening is forecast during the next day or two. However, Beryl is forecast to be at or near major hurricane intensity while it passes the Cayman Islands. Additional weakening is expected thereafter, though Beryl is forecast to remain a hurricane until it makes landfall on the Yucatan Peninsula.\n\nSEE ALSO: It's not just your imagination, Atlantic storms are getting stronger faster\n\nAfter the centre passes over Jamaica, it is expected to pass near or over the Cayman Islands Wednesday night or early Thursday, and move over the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico Thursday night or early Friday.\n\nThe track will take the core of Beryl just south of the Cayman Islands Wednesday overnight, and over the Yucatan Peninsula late Thursday night and Friday. Beryl is expected to emerge over the southwestern Gulf of Mexico Friday night and turn northwestward.\n\nInterests elsewhere in the northwestern Caribbean Sea and the western Gulf of Mexico, including southern Texas, should closely monitor the progress of Beryl, and heed the advice of local officials.\n\nBeryl wouldn't be out of place as a powerful hurricane in the middle of hurricane season, but it's unheard of to have such a powerful storm this early in the year.\n\nIt was the earliest we've ever seen a hurricane form in the tropical Atlantic Ocean.\n\nRELATED: Hurricane forecasts are better today than ever before -- here's how\n\nThe only other storms that formed this far east this early in the year were Hurricane Elsa in 2021 and an unnamed storm that hit Trinidad and Tobago in 1933. It's worth noting that both 2021 and 1933 eventually ranked among the most active hurricane seasons on record.\n\nBeryl is also the earliest Category 4 and 5 hurricane ever recorded in the Atlantic Ocean, beating by a week the record set by Hurricane Dennis back in 2005. The historic 2005 season saw Hurricanes Dennis and Emily peak at Category 4 and 5, respectively. Dennis reached major hurricane status on July 7, and Emily did so a week later.\n\nThe last time there was a major hurricane before the July 4th holiday was Hurricane Alma on June 8, 1966. Alma was also the earliest hurricane to make landfall in the U.S. since 1825.\n\nExperts largely agree that we're in for a very active Atlantic hurricane season in the weeks and months to come. Sea surface temperatures throughout the Atlantic are running several degrees hotter than normal, closer to what you'd expect in September than the end of June.\n\nMUST SEE: El Ni\u00f1o is over -- but La Ni\u00f1a may arrive during peak hurricane season\n\nThese abnormally hot waters will combine with the lower wind shear brought on by a developing La Ni\u00f1a in the eastern Pacific to foster extremely favourable conditions for tropical cyclone development through the peak of the season this fall.\n\nThe latest seasonal outlooks call for as many as two-dozen named storms, which is far more than the 14 tropical storms we'd see during a typical Atlantic hurricane season.\n\nThumbnail courtesy of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).\n\nStay with The Weather Network

The coast of the peninsula, from Puerto Costa Maya to Cancun, is under a hurricane warning as of late Wednesday morning.\n\nJamaica's size -- at some 146 miles long and 51 miles at its widest point -- makes it an unlikely target of a direct hit from a hurricane. Only two hurricanes have made landfall there in the last 40 years, CNN notes: Sandy in 2012 and Gilbert in 1988.\n\nBeryl has already wreaked havoc on several countries in the eastern Caribbean Sea. Photos emerging from the hardest-hit islands show roofs torn from buildings, fishing vessels ripped apart and roads flooded with water and sand.\n\nSome of the worst damage appears to have occurred in Carriacou and Petite Martinique, two small islands in Grenada.\n\nOfficials said about 98% of buildings on the islands -- which are home to some 6,000 people -- had been damaged or destroyed, including Carriacou's main health facility, according to the New York Times. Three storm-related fatalities have been confirmed there so far, per the AP.\n\n\"The possibility that there may be more fatalities remains a grim reality as movement is still highly restricted,\" Prime Minister Dickon Mitchell said at a news conference on Tuesday.\n\nTwo other deaths have been reported in northern Venezuela's Sucre state, where authorities said another five people are unaccounted for and a total of 25,000 have been affected by heavy rains, winds and river flooding from the outer bands of the storm.\n\nVenezuela's Vice President Delcy Rodr\u00edguez was injured after being hit by a falling tree while visiting one of the affected towns, CNN reports.\n\nThe country of St. Vincent and the Grenadines was also hit hard, with Prime Minister Ralph Gonsalves announcing at a press conference that 90% of the houses on Union Island -- which is about 3 miles long and home to some 3,000 people -- have been damaged or destroyed.\n\n\"The Union Island airport's roof is gone,\" Gonsalves said, per CBS News. \"It's no more.\"\n\nAs damage assessment and recovery efforts get underway, offers of help are also flooding in.\n\nPresident Biden said at a Tuesday news conference that \"people in impacted islands and communities are in our prayers, and we stand by to provide assistance to them.\"\n\nThe Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit World Central Kitchen also announced on Tuesday that it has teams mobilizing to distribute food -- starting with sandwiches -- to people in need across the region including in Antigua, Grenada, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines.\n\nAs Jamaicans hunker down for the storm, countries in the northwestern Caribbean Sea and western Gulf of Mexico are warned they could be next as Beryl moves west.\n\nThe NHC expects Beryl to continue moving west as a hurricane, albeit with some weakening possible over the next day or so.\n\nIt says tropical storm conditions are expected along the south coast of Hispaniola on Wednesday, and possible along the coast of Belize by Thursday or early Friday.\n\nHurricane conditions are possible along portions of the east coast of the Yucatan Peninsula as soon as late Thursday.\n\nIn the U.S., officials are urging residents of coastal Texas to \"keep an eye on the Gulf this holiday week.\"\n\nThe Texas Division of Emergency Management announced Tuesday that residents and visitors in coastal areas should heed local warnings and have a plan ready in case of bad weather, particularly over the weekend.\n\n\"While Texans take time to enjoy the holiday weekend with family and friends, it's important to stay weather aware, pay close attention to the rapidly-changing forecasts, and don't be caught without an emergency plan,\" said Texas Emergency Management Chief Nim Kidd.\n\nMeteorologist Eric Berger told Houston Public Media that while Beryl's potential impact on the central Texas coast is still uncertain, it's not likely to strike with the same intensity it's bringing to the Caribbean.\n\n\"My sense of what will happen is we will see enhanced rain chances Saturday and especially Sunday but I am not anticipating a hurricane to form in the Gulf and move into the central Texas coast,\" he added.\n\nBeryl is an unusually strong hurricane for this early in the season, fueled by record-high ocean temperatures that have been driven by climate change -- which is making powerful storms more common.\n\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has predicted an extra active Atlantic hurricane season, which spans June through November.\n\nAs they prepare for Beryl, some Jamaican officials are pointing to the storm as an example of how developing countries bear the brunt of climate change.\n\nHolness, the prime minister, said in a televised speech Tuesday that as the earliest Category 5 hurricane on record, Beryl highlights the growing impact of climate change on Small Island Developing Stateslike Jamaica.\n\n\"While our carbon emissions are miniscule, our region bears the brunt of the impacts of climate change,\" he added. \"This hurricane further highlights the urgent need for global climate action and targeted support to enhance resilience against the escalating dangers of climate change.\"\n\nEchoing those remarks, Jamaican Senator Delroy Williams told CNN that the international community must do more to widen coastal cities' access to climate change-related funding and improve infrastructure in low-lying areas.\n\nBeryl made that conversation extra personal for Simon Stiell, the executive secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and a native of Carriacou.\n\nHis late grandmother's home was destroyed, and his parents' property was damaged, his office told AFP. He called climate change \"not a tomorrow problem.\"", "source": {"uri": "wfae.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "WFAE 90.7 - Charlotte's NPR News Source"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Everything's gone. I'm in my house and scared,\" said Amoy Wellington, a 51-year-old cashier who lives in Top Hill, a rural farming community in southern St. Elizabeth parish. \"It's a disaster.\"\n\nBeryl moved away from Jamaica early on Thursday. At around 0900 GMT, the hurricane, now a Category 3 storm, was 55 miles (90 km) from Grand Cayman and about 440 miles (700 km) off Tulum, Mexico, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said.\n\nBeryl was carrying top winds of 130 mph (209 kph), and was expected to dump 4-6 inches (10-15 cm) of rain on the Cayman Islands, where life-threatening surf and rip currents were possible, the NHC said.\n\nA hurricane warning was in force for the Cayman Islands east coast of Mexico's Yucatan peninsula.\n\nMexico's tourist centres of Cancun and the wider Yucatan peninsula lie in Beryl's predicted path. Cancun's airport was thronged with tourists hoping to catch last flights out before the storm arrives. Workers filled bags with sand and boarded up doors and windows of businesses for protection.\n\nMexico's defense ministry opened around 120 storm shelters, and asked visitors to heed instructions on evacuation or other measures.\n\nBeryl is the 2024 Atlantic season's first hurricane and at its peak earlier this week was the earliest Category 5 storm on record. A Category 5 hurricane brings winds of 157 mph (252 kph) or higher, capable of causing catastrophic damage including the destruction of homes and infrastructure.\n\nJAMAICA AND SMALL ISLANDS\n\nIn Jamaica the island's main airports were closed and streets were mostly empty after Prime Minister Andrew Holness issued a curfew for Wednesday, which was extended to Thursday as storm conditions continued. At least one person was reported killed in the storm.\n\nNearly 1,000 people were in shelters by Wednesday evening, Richard Thompson, acting director general at Jamaica's disaster agency said in an interview on local news.\n\nThe storm hit St. Vincent and the Grenadines earlier in the week. Prime Minister Ralph Gonsalves said in a radio interview that Union Island was \"flattened\" and it would \"be a Herculean effort to rebuild.\"\n\nThere were at least three confirmed fatalities and crop damage was widespread, senior officials told Reuters. Union Island suffered destruction of more than 90% of buildings.\n\nIn Grenada, Prime Minister Dickon Mitchell described \"Armageddon-like\" conditions after the storm made impact earlier in the week, with no power and widespread destruction, while also confirming three deaths.\n\nVenezuelan President Nicolas Maduro told state television that three people had died, four were missing, and over 8,000 homes damaged.\n\nThe U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has forecast a large number of major hurricanes in an \"extraordinary\" season this year. The season runs from the start of June to the end of November\n\nBeryl's destructive power, coming so early in the hurricane season, underscores the consequences of a warmer Atlantic Ocean, which scientists cite as a sign of human-caused climate change fueling extreme weather.", "source": {"uri": "swissinfo.ch", "dataType": "news", "title": "SWI swissinfo.ch"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Apart from that, it's mainly concrete so there's not much we can do,\" Brown told the Jamaica Observer newspaper.\n\nAs of Wednesday night, Beryl was packing maximum sustained winds of 130 mph (215 kph), said the NHC.\n\n- 'No communication' -\n\nBeryl has already left a trail of death with at least three people killed in Grenada, where the storm made landfall Monday, as well as one in St Vincent and the Grenadines and three in Venezuela.\n\nRalph Gonsalves, prime minister of St Vincent and the Grenadines, said that it would take a \"herculean effort\" to rebuild after the substantial destruction and that \"90-odd percent of the houses were blown away\" on Union Island.\n\n\"Most of the country doesn't have electricity, and more than half without water at the moment,\" he said.\n\nGrenada's Prime Minister Dickon Mitchell said the island of Carriacou, which was struck by the eye of the storm, has been all but cut off, with houses, telecommunications and fuel facilities there flattened.\n\nThe 13.5-square mile (35-square kilometer) island is home to around 9,000 people. At least two people there died, Mitchell said, with a third killed on the country's main island of Grenada when a tree fell on a house.\n\nIn St Vincent and the Grenadines, one person on the island of Bequia was reported dead from the storm, while a man died in Venezuela's northeastern coastal state of Sucre when he was swept away by a flooded river, officials there said.\n\n- Climate change -\n\nIt is extremely rare for such a powerful storm to form this early in the Atlantic hurricane season, which runs from early June to late November.\n\nWarm ocean temperatures are key for hurricanes, and North Atlantic waters are currently between two and five degrees Fahrenheit (1-3 degrees Celsius) warmer than normal, according to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).\n\nUN climate chief Simon Stiell, who has family on the island of Carriacou, said climate change was \"pushing disasters to record-breaking new levels of destruction.\"\n\n\"Disasters on a scale that used to be the stuff of science fiction are becoming meteorological facts, and the climate crisis is the chief culprit,\" he said Monday, reporting that his parents' property was damaged.\n\nbur-dw-bfm/dhw\n\nFOX28 Spokane\u00a9", "source": {"uri": "fox28spokane.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FOX 28 Spokane"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ivan_shaw@fox28spokane.com", "name":

It was moving west-northwest at about 20 miles per hour.\n\nBeryl's maximum sustained winds decreased to 120 miles per hour overnight after being downgraded from a Category 5 on Tuesday. It killed at least seven people, slashed power, destroyed buildings and blocked roads as it tore through Grenada and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, according to The Associated Press.\n\n\"The good news is that Beryl has begun weakening a little bit,\" NHC Director Michael Brennan said in a late Tuesday video update. \"But those peak winds are only going to come down very slowly over the next couple of days, and we're still expecting Beryl to be a powerful major hurricane when it reaches Jamaica.\"\n\nThe NHC warned that Beryl could cause flash flooding and mudslides from heavy rainfall in much of Jamaica and parts of Haiti, and that mountainous areas could experience \"destructive\" wind gusts.\n\nAll three of Jamaica's international airports were closed on Wednesday, and officials say the island's electricity and water service would likely beshut off as a precaution to prevent fires and protect equipment.\n\nJamaican Prime Minister Andrew Holness declared a \"major disaster area\" and implemented an island-wide curfew from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. local time, based on what he called the \"strength, path and potential threat\" posed by Beryl.\n\n\"This is to ensure the safety of everyone during the passage of the storm and prevent any movement with the intent to carry out criminal activity,\" Holness said in an Instagram video.\n\nJamaica's size -- at some 146 miles long and 51 miles at its widest point -- made it an unlikely target of a direct hit. Only two hurricanes have made landfall there in the last 40 years, CNN noted: Sandy in 2012 and Gilbert in 1988.\n\nThe NHC has a hurricane warning in place for all three of the Cayman Islands and for parts of Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula from Puerto Costa Maya to Cancun, including Cozumel.\n\nWhile the storm is expected to weaken today and Friday, it's forecast to be near-major hurricane intensity today as it passed the Cayman Islands and would likely remain a hurricane until it makes landfall on the Yucatan Peninsula. Hurricane-force winds extended up to 45 miles from the center and tropical-storm-force winds extended up to 175 miles.\n\nBeryl is expected to drop four to six inches of rain, with localized amounts of 10 inches, today into Friday along the Yucatan Peninsula and scattered flash flooding is anticipated. Storm surge along the east coast of the peninsula could be as much as four to six feet above ground level in areas of onshore winds within the hurricane warning area.\n\nIn Jamaica, journalist Nick Davis, who is based in Kingston, told NPR's \"Morning Edition\" that trees and power lines were down and some 400,000 people were without power. There have been no reports of injuries or deaths as first responders assessed the damage after daybreak.\n\nBeryl wreaked havoc on several countries in the eastern Caribbean Sea. Photos emerging from the hardest-hit islands show roofs torn from buildings, fishing vessels ripped apart and roads flooded with water and sand.\n\nSome of the worst damage appears to have occurred in Carriacou and Petite Martinique, two small islands in Grenada.\n\nOfficials said about 98% of buildings on the islands -- which are home to some 6,000 people -- had been damaged or destroyed, including Carriacou's main health facility, according to the New York Times. Three storm-related fatalities have been confirmed there so far, per the AP.\n\n\"The possibility that there may be more fatalities remains a grim reality as movement is still highly restricted,\" Prime Minister Dickon Mitchell said at a news conference on Tuesday.\n\nTwo other deaths have been reported in northern Venezuela's Sucre state, where authorities said another five people are unaccounted for and a total of 25,000 have been affected by heavy rains, winds and river flooding from the outer bands of the storm.\n\nVenezuela's Vice President Delcy Rodr\u00edguez was injured after being hit by a falling tree while visiting one of the affected towns, CNN reports.\n\nThe country of St. Vincent and the Grenadines was also hit hard, with Prime Minister Ralph Gonsalves announcing at a press conference that 90% of the houses on Union Island -- which is about 3 miles long and home to some 3,000 people -- have been damaged or destroyed.\n\n\"The Union Island airport's roof is gone,\" Gonsalves said, per CBS News. \"It's no more.\"\n\nAs damage assessment and recovery efforts get underway, offers of help are also flooding in.\n\nPresident Biden said at a Tuesday news conference that \"people in impacted islands and communities are in our prayers, and we stand by to provide assistance to them.\"\n\nThe Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit World Central Kitchen also announced on Tuesday that it has teams mobilizing to distribute food -- starting with sandwiches -- to people in need across the region including in Antigua, Grenada, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines.\n\nAs Jamaicans hunker down for the storm, countries in the northwestern Caribbean Sea and western Gulf of Mexico are warned they could be next as Beryl moves west.\n\nThe NHC expects Beryl to continue moving west as a hurricane, albeit with some weakening possible over the next day or so.\n\nIt says tropical storm conditions are expected along the south coast of Hispaniola on Wednesday, and possible along the coast of Belize by Thursday or early Friday.\n\nHurricane conditions are possible along portions of the east coast of the Yucatan Peninsula as soon as late Thursday.\n\nIn the U.S., officials are urging residents of coastal Texas to \"keep an eye on the Gulf this holiday week.\"\n\nThe Texas Division of Emergency Management announced Tuesday that residents and visitors in coastal areas should heed local warnings and have a plan ready in case of bad weather, particularly over the weekend.\n\n\"While Texans take time to enjoy the holiday weekend with family and friends, it's important to stay weather aware, pay close attention to the rapidly-changing forecasts, and don't be caught without an emergency plan,\" said Texas Emergency Management Chief Nim Kidd.\n\nMeteorologist Eric Berger told Houston Public Media that while Beryl's potential impact on the central Texas coast is still uncertain, it's not likely to strike with the same intensity it's bringing to the Caribbean.\n\n\"My sense of what will happen is we will see enhanced rain chances Saturday and especially Sunday but I am not anticipating a hurricane to form in the Gulf and move into the central Texas coast,\" he added.\n\nBeryl is an unusually strong hurricane for this early in the season, fueled by record-high ocean temperatures that have been driven by climate change -- which is making powerful storms more common.\n\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has predicted an extra active Atlantic hurricane season, which spans June through November.\n\nAs they prepare for Beryl, some Jamaican officials are pointing to the storm as an example of how developing countries bear the brunt of climate change.\n\nHolness, the prime minister, said in a televised speech Tuesday that as the earliest Category 5 hurricane on record, Beryl highlights the growing impact of climate change on Small Island Developing Stateslike Jamaica.\n\n\"While our carbon emissions are miniscule, our region bears the brunt of the impacts of climate change,\" he added. \"This hurricane further highlights the urgent need for global climate action and targeted support to enhance resilience against the escalating dangers of climate change.\"\n\nEchoing those remarks, Jamaican Senator Delroy Williams told CNN that the international community must do more to widen coastal cities' access to climate change-related funding and improve infrastructure in low-lying areas.\n\nBeryl made that conversation extra personal for Simon Stiell, the executive secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and a native of Carriacou.\n\nHis late grandmother's home was destroyed, and his parents' property was damaged, his office told AFP. He called climate change \"not a tomorrow problem.\"", "source": {"uri": "tpr.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Texas Public Radio"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Everything's gone. I'm in my house and scared,\" said Amoy Wellington, a 51-year-old cashier who lives in Top Hill, a rural farming community in southern St. Elizabeth parish. \"It's a disaster.\"\n\nBeryl moved away from Jamaica early on Thursday. At around 1200 GMT, the Category 3 hurricane was 50 miles (80 km) from Grand Cayman and about 385 miles (620 km) off Tulum, Mexico, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said.\n\nBeryl was carrying top winds of 130 mph (209 kph), and was expected to dump 4-6 inches (10-15 cm) of rain on the Cayman Islands, where life-threatening surf and rip currents were possible, the NHC said.\n\nA hurricane warning was in force for the Cayman Islands east coast of Mexico's Yucatan peninsula.\n\nMexico's tourist centres of Cancun and the wider Yucatan peninsula lie in Beryl's predicted path. Cancun's airport was thronged with tourists hoping to catch last flights out before the storm arrives. Workers filled bags with sand and boarded up doors and windows of businesses for protection.\n\nMexico's defense ministry opened around 120 storm shelters, and asked visitors to heed instructions on evacuation or other measures.\n\nBeryl is the 2024 Atlantic season's first hurricane and at its peak earlier this week was the earliest Category 5 storm on record. A Category 5 hurricane brings winds of 157 mph (252 kph) or higher, capable of causing catastrophic damage including the destruction of homes and infrastructure.\n\nJAMAICA AND SMALL ISLANDS\n\nIn Jamaica the island's main airports were closed and streets were mostly empty after Prime Minister Andrew Holness issued a curfew for Wednesday, which was extended to Thursday as storm conditions continued. At least one person was reported killed in the storm.\n\nNearly 1,000 people were in shelters by Wednesday evening, Richard Thompson, acting director general at Jamaica's disaster agency said in an interview on local news.\n\nThe storm hit St. Vincent and the Grenadines earlier in the week. Prime Minister Ralph Gonsalves said in a radio interview that Union Island was \"flattened\" and it would \"be a Herculean effort to rebuild.\"\n\nThere were at least three confirmed fatalities and crop damage was widespread, senior officials told Reuters. Union Island suffered destruction of more than 90% of buildings.\n\nIn Grenada, Prime Minister Dickon Mitchell described \"Armageddon-like\" conditions after the storm made impact earlier in the week, with no power and widespread destruction, while also confirming three deaths.\n\nVenezuelan President Nicolas Maduro told state television that three people had died, four were missing, and over 8,000 homes damaged.\n\nThe U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has forecast a large number of major hurricanes in an \"extraordinary\" season this year. The season runs from the start of June to the end of November\n\nBeryl's destructive power, coming so early in the hurricane season, underscores the consequences of a warmer Atlantic Ocean, which scientists cite as a sign of human-caused climate change fueling extreme weather.", "source": {"uri": "stabroeknews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Stabroek News"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Beryl churned towards Jamaica on July 3, with forecasters warning of potentially deadly winds and storm surge, after at least seven people were killed and widespread destruction was reported across the southeastern Caribbean. The powerful hurricane, which is rare so early in the Atlantic season, was expected to pass over Jamaica around midday as a \"life-threatening\" Category 4 storm, meteorologists said. (AFP)\n\nKINGSTON, Jamaica - Powerful Hurricane Beryl churned along Jamaica's southern coast on Wednesday, battering the island with dangerous winds and sea surge after leaving a trail of destruction and at least seven people dead in the Caribbean.\n\nThe eye of the Category 4 hurricane has not yet breached the shore of Jamaica but could in the coming hours, and is expected to approach or even make landfall in the Cayman islands overnight before moving onward to Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula, the US National Hurricane Center said.\n\nThe storm is the first since NHC records began to reach the Category 4 level in June and the earliest to reach Category 5 in July.\n\nAhead of Beryl's arrival, people across Jamaica removed boats from the water and rushed to buy food, water, gasoline and other essentials.\n\nAs of Wednesday afternoon the storm was packing maximum sustained winds of 140 mph (220 kph), said the NHC. Hurricane conditions are spreading through the island, it said.\n\nPrime Minister Andrew Holness declared a curfew from 6:00 am to 6:00 pm across the island of 2.8 million and urged Jamaicans to comply with evacuation orders.\n\n\"If you live in a low lying area, an area historically prone to flooding and landslide or if you live on the banks of a river, I implore you to evacuate to a shelter, or to safer ground,\" he said in a video posted to social media.\n\nDesmon Brown, manager of the National Stadium in Kingston, said his staff has scrambled to be ready.\n\n\"We've taped up our windows, covered our equipment -- including computers, printers and that sort of thing. Apart from that, it's mainly concrete so there's not much we can do,\" Brown told the Jamaica Observer newspaper.\n\nMexican officials were meanwhile scrambling to prepare for Beryl, which is expected to hit somewhere between the well-known tourist hotspot of Tulum and the town of Felipe Carrillo Puerto, according to Civil Protection national coordinator Laura Velazquez.\n\nBeginning Thursday \"we will have intense rains and wind gusts\" she said, announcing the deployment of hundreds of military personnel, marines and electricity workers in anticipation of damage.\n\nThe government has prepared 112 shelters with a capacity for some 20,000 people and suspended school in the state of Quintana Roo where Beryl will hit.\n\n'No communication'\n\nBeryl has already left a trail of death with at least three people killed in Grenada, where the storm made landfall Monday, as well as one in St Vincent and the Grenadines and three in Venezuela.\n\nGrenada's Prime Minister Dickon Mitchell said the island of Carriacou, which was struck by the eye of the storm, has been all but cut off, with houses, telecommunications and fuel facilities there flattened.\n\nThe 13.5-square mile (35-square kilometer) island is home to around 9,000 people. At least two people there died, Mitchell said, with a third killed on the country's main island of Grenada when a tree fell on a house.\n\nIn St. Vincent and the Grenadines, one person on the island

is extremely rare for such a powerful storm to form this early in the Atlantic hurricane season, which runs from early June to late November.\n\nWarm ocean temperatures are key for hurricanes, and North Atlantic waters are currently between two and five degrees Fahrenheit (1-3 degrees Celsius) warmer than normal, according to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).\n\nUN climate chief Simon Stiell, who has family on the island of Carriacou, said climate change was \"pushing disasters to record-breaking new levels of destruction.\"\n\n\"Disasters on a scale that used

The storm's impact underscores the consequences of climate change and extreme weather. Recovery efforts are underway as affected regions brace for more challenges.\n\nHurricane Beryl thrashed Jamaica with heavy winds and rain on Wednesday, killing at least one person after forging a destructive, water-soaked path across smaller Caribbean islands over the past couple days. The death toll from the powerful Category 4 hurricane climbed to at least 10, but it is widely expected to rise further as communications come back online across drenched islands damaged by flooding and deadly winds.\n\nIn Jamaica, Beryl's eyewall skirted the island's southern coast, pummeling communities as emergency groups rushed to evacuate people from flood-prone areas. \"It's terrible. Everything's gone. I'm in my house and scared,\" said Amoy Wellington, a 51-year-old cashier who lives in Top Hill, a rural farming community in Jamaica's southern St. Elizabeth parish. \"It's a disaster.\"\n\nA woman died in Jamaica's Hanover parish after a tree fell on her home, Richard Thompson, acting director general at Jamaica's disaster agency said in an interview on local news. Nearly a thousand Jamaicans were in shelters by Wednesday evening, Thompson added.\n\nThe island's main airports were closed and streets were mostly empty after Prime Minister Andrew Holness issued a nationwide curfew for Wednesday. \"We can do as much as we can do, as (is) humanly possible, and we leave the rest in the hands of God,\" Holness said earlier on Wednesday, urging residents in vulnerable areas to evacuate.\n\nThe loss of life and damage wrought by Beryl underscores the consequences of a warmer Atlantic Ocean, which scientists cite as a telltale sign of human-caused climate change fueling extreme weather that differs from past experience. Ralph Gonsalves, prime minister of St. Vincent and the Grenadines, one of the hardest-hit areas in the eastern Caribbean, said in a radio interview that the country's Union Island was \"flattened\" by Beryl.\n\n\"Everybody is homeless ... It is going to be a Herculean effort to rebuild.\" Speaking to state media, Nerissa Gittens-McMillan, permanent secretary at St. Vincent and the Grenadines' agriculture ministry, warned of possible food shortages after 50% of the country's plantain and banana crops were lost, with significant losses also to root crops and vegetables.\n\nPower outages were widespread across Jamaica, while some roads near the coast were washed out. By Wednesday evening, the eye of the spiraling hurricane was located about 100 miles (161 km) west of Kingston, according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center (NHC), as the storm's core headed toward the Cayman Islands, where hurricane conditions were expected late tonight.\n\nBeryl is packing maximum sustained winds of 130 miles per hour (209 kph). The force of the winds is expected to weaken somewhat in the next day or two, according to the NHC, though it cautioned that Beryl would remain at or near major hurricane strength as it passed the Cayman Islands.\n\nBeryl is expected to dump 4-6 inches (10-15 cm) of rain on the Cayman Islands overnight and into Thursday. Large swells were expected to \"cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions,\" the NHC said. The center added that a hurricane warning was in effect for Jamaica, the Cayman Islands, as well as the eastern coast of Mexico's Yucatan peninsula, including for the country's top beach resort Cancun.\n\n'ARMAGEDDON-LIKE' Additional confirmed fatalities so far include at least three din St. Vincent and the Grenadines, a senior official told Reuters, where Union Island has suffered severe destruction of over 90% of buildings.\n\nIn Grenada, Prime Minister Dickon Mitchell described \"Armageddon-like\" conditions with no power and widespread destruction, while also confirming three deaths. In Venezuela, President Nicolas Maduro told state television that three people had died and four were missing in the area, along with more than 8,000 homes damaged by torrential rains, including at least 400 destroyed.\n\nVenezuelan Vice President Delcy Rodriguez was injured by a falling tree on Tuesday as she surveyed an area south of Beryl where intense rainfall caused the Manzanares River in Sucre state to burst its banks, the president confirmed. The unusually early hurricane strengthened at a record pace, which scientists argue is almost certainly fueled by climate change.\n\nBeryl is the 2024 Atlantic season's first hurricane and the earliest storm on record to reach the highest category on the Saffir-Simpson five-stage scale. The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has forecast a large number of major hurricanes in an \"extraordinary\" season this year. Beyond near-term impact in Jamaica and Haiti, the NHC warned that Beryl will likely make landfall as hurricane on Mexico's Yucatan peninsula as early as Thursday night.\n\nIn the fishing village of Punta Allen, in the state of Quintana Roo, residents moved boats inland for safety, while navy officers implored reluctant residents to evacuate. In tourist epicenter Cancun, an environmental agency worked to gather eggs from sea turtles' nests for their protection. Tourists soaked up the sun's rays while they still could.\n\nMeanwhile, workers filled bags with sand and boarded up doors and windows of businesses for protection. Officials said supplies of wooden boards were dwindling as Cancun locals and tourists prepared for Beryl's arrival. Laura Velazquez, head of Mexico's civil protection agency, encouraged tourists in Cancun and nearby Tulum to hunker down in hotel basements once the hurricane approaches, in comments to local broadcaster Milenio.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

What will be impact to Florida, Gulf Coast?", "body": "At least one person was killed by Hurricane Beryl in the Caribbean. It is expected to reach the eastern part of Mexico by the end of the week.\n\nThe weather was deteriorating in the Cayman Islands Saturday morning as Hurricane Beryl neared, expected to bring with it strong winds, dangerous storm surge and damaging waves, according to the National Hurricane Center's 8 a.m. advisory.\n\nThe storm's eyewall was passing southwest of Grand Cayman and the storm's westward to west-northwestward motion is expected to move the core of Beryl away from the Cayman Islands this morning and over the Yucatan Peninsula early Friday.\n\nBeryl lashed the southern coast of Jamaica Friday as a Category 4 hurricane with 140-mph winds.\n\nBeryl has weakened to a Category 3 hurricane packing 120 mph winds and is forecast to be near major hurricane intensity today as it passes by the Cayman Islands.\n\nThe storm is expected to remain a hurricane until it makes landfall on the Yucatan Peninsula, the NHC said.\n\nAfter emerging into the Gulf of Mexico, Beryl will likely have a couple of days to re-strengthen over warm waters with light or moderate shear.\n\nAlmost all of the model guidance show the system near hurricane strength as Beryl approaches the western Gulf Coast, and so does the official NHC forecast.\n\nBeryl's track and intensity over the western Gulf of Mexico this weekend remains uncertain. Interests in eastern Mexico and southern Texas should monitor the progress of Beryl, the NHC warns.\n\nRegardless of the exact track, rip currents could cause life-threatening beach conditions beginning late Friday and continuing through the weekend across much of the Gulf Coast.\n\nHurricane Beryl a storm without precedent. That's not good\n\nWhile Beryl poses a serious threat to the western Gulf of Mexico this weekend, its implications for the season ahead are also sobering, according to Dr. Ryan Truchelut, chief meteorologist at WeatherTiger. Truchelut works with the USA TODAY Network-Florida to provide the latest storm information Florida residents need.\n\nHurricane Beryl: Why a storm without precedent signals bad season ahead | WeatherTiger\n\n\"When Beryl peaked at Category 5 intensity on Tuesday, it became not only the earliest Category 5 in Atlantic history, but both the strongest June and strongest July hurricane on record.\"\n\nThis is especially remarkable given that any kind of early-season tropical development is rare in the eastern Atlantic, Truchelut said.\n\n\"In the last 150 years, there are 10 seasons in which a hurricane formed in the Main Development Region before August: 2021, 2020, 2018, 2008, 2005, 1996, 1961, 1933, 1926, and 1887. All of those years were above-normal hurricane seasons, averaging almost double the intensity of a normal season.\"\n\nWhat does that mean?\n\n\"You should do the things you can do now to prepare before the inevitable cone-panic hits. So, trim those trees, know where you would go if you need to evacuate, and make sure your hurricane kits are in good order, \" Truchelut said.\n\nAccuWeather forecasters: Impact to southern Texas depends on Beryl's strength\n\nAfter plowing into the Caribbean as a major hurricane, leaving death and destruction in its wake, Beryl is expected to make landfall on Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula, before heading into the Gulf of Mexico this weekend and making landfall again in northeastern Mexico, AccuWeather meteorologists predict.\n\n\u27a4 Track all active storms\n\nThe impact on northeastern Mexico and southern Texas will depend on how much Beryl strengthens over the Gulf and its speed when it arrives.\n\n\"A significant factor to consider is that Beryl's forward speed is likely to slow,\" AccuWeather Chief On-Air Meteorologist Bernie Rayno said.\n\nA slower-moving storm will increase the duration of wind, surf and storm surge.\n\nWhen it made its first landfall at 11 a.m. on Carriacou Island Monday, July 1, Beryl was a Category 4 storm with 150-mph winds.\n\nHistorically warm water affecting Beryl's strength\n\nFactors affecting Beryl's intensity include much warmer-than-historical-average waters and wind shear, according to AccuWeather forecasters. If wind shear is strong enough, it can lead to weakening of tropical systems. Warm water helps storms develop and intensify.\n\nAccuWeather Lead Tropical Meteorologist Alex DaSilva said water temperatures in early July are equal to what they usually are in late August, early September.\n\nSpaghetti models: Where will Hurricane Beryl go next?\n\nSpecial note about spaghetti models: Illustrations include an array of forecast tools and models, and not all are created equal. The Hurricane Center uses only the top four or five highest performing models to help make its forecasts.\n\nWatches and warnings issued for Hurricane Beryl\n\nFor an explanation of what the watches and warnings mean, scroll to the bottom of this story.\n\nHurricane warning: A hurricane warning is in effect for:\n\nHurricane watch: A hurricane watch is in effect for:\n\nTropical storm warning: A tropical storm warning is in effect for the following:\n\nTropical storm watch: A tropical storm watch is in effect for:\n\nHurricane Beryl\n\nHow strong is Hurricane Beryl and where is it going?\n\nKey messages from the National Hurricane Center: What you need to know about Hurricane Beryl\n\nCurrent forecast: How strong is Hurricane Beryl expected to get?\n\nWhat impact could Hurricane Beryl have and what areas could be affected?\n\nInteractive map: What tropical storms, hurricanes have impacted your area in the past?\n\nHurricane warning: A hurricane warning means that hurricane conditions are expected somewhere within the warning area. A warning is typically issued 36 hours before the anticipated first occurrence of tropical-storm-force winds, conditions that make outside preparations difficult or dangerous. Preparations to protect life and property should be rushed to completion.\n\nHurricane watch: A hurricane watch means that hurricane conditions are possible within the watch area. A watch is typically issued 48 hours before the anticipated first occurrence of tropical-storm-force winds, conditions that make outside preparations difficult or dangerous.\n\nTropical storm warning: A tropical storm warning means that tropical storm conditions are expected somewhere within the warning area within 36 hours.\n\nTropical storm watch: An announcement that sustained winds of 39 to 73 mph are possible within the specified area within 48 hours in association with a tropical, subtropical, or post-tropical cyclone.\n\nStorm surge warning: A storm surge warning means there is a danger of life-threatening inundation, from rising water moving inland from the coastline, in the indicated locations. This is a life-threatening situation. Persons located within these areas should take all necessary actions to protect life and property from rising water and the potential for other dangerous conditions. Follow evacuation and other instructions from local officials.\n\nStorm surge watch: A storm surge watch means there is a possibility of life-threatening inundation, from rising water moving inland from the coastline, in the indicated locations during the next 48 hours.", "source": {"uri": "news-press.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The News-Press"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Apart from that, it's mainly concrete so there's not much we can do,\" Brown told the Jamaica Observer newspaper.\n\nAs of last night, Beryl was packing maximum sustained winds of 130 mph (215 kph), said the NHC.\n\n'No communication'\n\nBeryl has already left a trail of death with at least three people killed in Grenada, where the storm made landfall on Monday.\n\nAccording to Reuters, three people were killed in St Vincent and the Grenadines, while in Venezuela, President Nicolas Maduro told state television that three people had died and four were missing.\n\nRalph Gonsalves, prime minister of St Vincent and the Grenadines, said that it would take a \"herculean effort\" to rebuild after the substantial destruction and that \"90-odd percent of the houses were blown away\" on Union Island.\n\n\"Most of the country doesn't have electricity, and more than half without water at the moment,\" he said.\n\nGrenada's Prime Minister Dickon Mitchell said the island of Carriacou, which was struck by the eye of the storm, has been all but cut off, with houses, telecommunications and fuel facilities there flattened.\n\nThe 35-square kilometer island is home to around 9,000 people. At least two people there died, Mitchell said, with a third killed on the country's main island of Grenada when a tree fell on a house.\n\nClimate change\n\nIt is extremely rare for such a powerful storm to form this early in the Atlantic hurricane season, which runs from early June to late November.\n\nWarm ocean temperatures are key for hurricanes, and North Atlantic waters are currently between one and three degrees Celsius warmer than normal, according to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).\n\nUN climate chief Simon Stiell, who has family on the island of Carriacou, said climate change was \"pushing disasters to record-breaking new levels of destruction.\"\n\n\"Disasters on a scale that used to be the stuff of science fiction are becoming meteorological facts, and the climate crisis is the chief culprit,\" he said Monday, reporting that his parents' property was damaged.\n\n\u00a9 AFP 2024", "source": {"uri": "thejournal.ie",

It will also reach the Cayman Islands and then enter the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico on Thursday, according to the National Hurricane Center (NHC).\n\n\"Beryl is expected to cause life-threatening winds and storm surge in Jamaica on Wednesday, and in the Cayman Islands on Wednesday night and Thursday,\" reported the NHC.\n\nThe World Meteorological Organization said that never before has a hurricane of such magnitude been recorded in the Atlantic at this time of year. Experts say its rapid intensification and devastating effects are consequences of the warming of the oceans caused by climate change.\n\nAccording to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, this year, the Atlantic will have a well above average hurricane season, with the possibility of up to 13 hurricanes.\n\nThe Caribbean community began Wednesday to coordinate shipments of essential supplies to member countries affected by Beryl.", "source": {"uri": "aa.com.tr", "dataType": "news", "title": "Anadolu Ajans\u0131"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grenada", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Grenada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Grenada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saffir\u2013Simpson_scale", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Saffir\u2013Simpson scale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Caribbean"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Beryl", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hurricane Beryl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carriacou", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carriacou"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Carriacou"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Grenada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_sustained_wind", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Maximum sustained wind"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yucat\u00e1n_Peninsula", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_hurricane", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlantic hurricane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venezuela", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Venezuela"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Venezuela"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Vincent_and_the_Grenadines", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saint Vincent and the Grenadines"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saint Vincent and the Grenadines"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dickon_Mitchell", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dickon Mitchell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landfall", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Landfall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hurricane_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Hurricane Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cayman_Islands", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cayman Islands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Cayman Islands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_intensification", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rapid intensification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Meteorological_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World Meteorological Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storm_surge", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Storm surge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Oceanic_and_Atmospheric_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlantic Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tropical cyclone"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Atmospheric_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Atmospheric Sciences", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Tropical_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Tropical Health", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Environment", "label": "news/Environment", "wgt": 48}], "image": "https://cdnuploads.aa.com.tr/uploads/Contents/2024/07/04/thumbs_b_c_4400d6c458b975705cd299cc93ade847.jpg?v=074514", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9704864", "eventUri": "eng-9704864", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1450980392156863, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

The Cayman Islands and Mexico are bracing to be next.\n\nHurricane Beryl thrashed Jamaica with heavy winds and rain on Wednesday, killing at least one person after forging a destructive, water-soaked path across smaller Caribbean islands over the past couple days.\n\nThe death toll from the powerful Category 4 hurricane climbed to at least 10, but it is widely expected to rise further as communications come back online across drenched islands damaged by flooding and deadly winds.\n\nIn Jamaica, Beryl's eyewall skirted the island's southern coast, pummeling communities as emergency groups rushed to evacuate people from flood-prone areas.\n\n\"It's terrible. Everything's gone. I'm in my house and scared,\" said Amoy Wellington, a 51-year-old cashier who lives in Top Hill, a rural farming community in Jamaica's southern St. Elizabeth parish. \"It's a disaster.\"\n\nA woman died in Jamaica's Hanover parish after a tree fell on her home, Richard Thompson, acting director general at Jamaica's disaster agency said in an interview on local news.\n\nNearly a thousand Jamaicans were in shelters by Wednesday evening, Thompson added.\n\nThe island's main airports were closed and streets were mostly empty after Prime Minister Andrew Holness issued a nationwide curfew for Wednesday.\n\n\"We can do as much as we can do, as (is) humanly possible, and we leave the rest in the hands of God,\" Holness said earlier on Wednesday, urging residents in vulnerable areas to evacuate.\n\nThe loss of life and damage wrought by Beryl underscores the consequences of a warmer Atlantic Ocean, which scientists cite as a telltale sign of human-caused climate change fueling extreme weather that differs from past experience.\n\nRalph Gonsalves, prime minister of St. Vincent and the Grenadines, one of the hardest-hit areas in the eastern Caribbean, said in a radio interview that the country's Union Island was \"flattened\" by Beryl.\n\n\"Everybody is homeless ... It is going to be a Herculean effort to rebuild.\"\n\nSpeaking to state media, Nerissa Gittens-McMillan, permanent secretary at St. Vincent and the Grenadines' agriculture ministry, warned of possible food shortages after 50% of the country's plantain and banana crops were lost, with significant losses also to root crops and vegetables.\n\nPower outages were widespread across Jamaica, while some roads near the coast were washed out.\n\nBy Wednesday evening, the eye of the spiraling hurricane was located about 100 miles (161 km) west of Kingston, according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center (NHC), as the storm's core headed toward the Cayman Islands, where hurricane conditions were expected late tonight.\n\nBeryl is packing maximum sustained winds of 130 miles per hour (209 kph).\n\nThe force of the winds is expected to weaken somewhat in the next day or two, according to the NHC, though it cautioned that Beryl would remain at or near major hurricane strength as it passed the Cayman Islands.\n\nBeryl is expected to dump 4-6 inches (10-15 cm) of rain on the Cayman Islands overnight and into Thursday. Large swells were expected to \"cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions,\" the NHC said.\n\nThe center added that a hurricane warning was in effect for Jamaica, the Cayman Islands, as well as the eastern coast of Mexico's Yucatan peninsula, including for the country's top beach resort Cancun.\n\n'ARMAGEDDON-LIKE'\n\nAdditional confirmed fatalities so far include at least three din St. Vincent and the Grenadines, a senior official told Reuters, where Union Island has suffered severe destruction of over 90% of buildings.\n\nIn Grenada, Prime Minister Dickon Mitchell described \"Armageddon-like\" conditions with no power and widespread destruction, while also confirming three deaths.\n\nIn Venezuela, President Nicolas Maduro told state television that three people had died and four were missing in the area, along with more than 8,000 homes damaged by torrential rains, including at least 400 destroyed.\n\nVenezuelan Vice President Delcy Rodriguez was injured by a falling tree on Tuesday as she surveyed an area south of Beryl where intense rainfall caused the Manzanares River in Sucre state to burst its banks, the president confirmed.\n\nThe unusually early hurricane strengthened at a record pace, which scientists argue is almost certainly fueled by climate change.\n\nBeryl is the 2024 Atlantic season's first hurricane and the earliest storm on record to reach the highest category on the Saffir-Simpson five-stage scale. The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has forecast a large number of major hurricanes in an \"extraordinary\" season this year.\n\nBeyond near-term impact in Jamaica and Haiti, the NHC warned that Beryl will likely make landfall as hurricane on Mexico's Yucatan peninsula as early as Thursday night.\n\nIn the fishing village of Punta Allen, in the state of Quintana Roo, residents moved boats inland for safety, while navy officers implored reluctant residents to evacuate.\n\nIn tourist epicenter Cancun, an environmental agency worked to gather eggs from sea turtles' nests for their protection. Tourists soaked up the sun's rays while they still could.\n\nMeanwhile, workers filled bags with sand and boarded up doors and windows of businesses for protection. Officials said supplies of wooden boards were dwindling as Cancun locals and tourists prepared for Beryl's arrival.\n\nLaura Velazquez, head of Mexico's civil protection agency, encouraged tourists in Cancun and nearby Tulum to hunker down in hotel basements once the hurricane approaches, in comments to local broadcaster Milenio.", "source": {"uri": "france24.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

She waited out the hurricane in her bathroom before she fled.\n\n\"It was a hard four hours battling with six of us in that little area,\" she said.\n\nA hurricane warning is in effect for Jamaica, Grand Cayman, Little Cayman and Cayman Brac.\n\nBeryl is losing intensity but is forecast to still be near major-hurricane strength when it passes Jamaica and the Cayman Islands on Thursday and into Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula on Friday, according to the National Hurricane Center.\n\nHurricane Beryl was roaring by Jamaica on Wednesday, bringing fierce winds and heavy rain after the powerful category 4 storm earlier killed at least seven people and caused significant damage in the south-east Caribbean.\n\nThe US National Hurricane Center said Beryl's eyewall was \"brushing the south coast of Jamaica\".\n\nWind-whipped rain pounded the island for hours as residents heeded authorities' call to shelter until the storm had passed. Power was knocked out in much of the capital.\n\nThe prime minister, Andrew Holness, said on Wednesday afternoon that nearly 500 people were placed in shelters. By the evening, he said that Jamaica has not seen the \"worst of what could possibly happen\".\n\nHeavy rains of four to eight inches, with up to a foot in isolated areas, threatened flash flooding and mudslides on the mountainous island.\n\nAs Beryl barrelled through the Caribbean Sea, rescue crews in south-eastern islands fanned out to determine the extent of the damage the hurricane inflicted on Carriacou, an island in Grenada.\n\nMichelle Forbes, the St Vincent and Grenadines director of the National Emergency Management Organisation, said that about 95 per cent of homes in Mayreau and Union Island have been damaged by Hurricane Beryl.\n\nThree people were reported killed in Grenada and Carriacou and another in St Vincent and the Grenadines, officials said. One fatality in Grenada occurred after a tree fell on a house, Kerryne James, the environment minister, told the Associated Press.\n\nGrenada's prime minister, Dickon Mitchell, said on Tuesday there was no power, roads are impassable and the possible rise of the death toll \"remains a grim reality\".\n\nThree other deaths were reported in northern Venezuela, where five people are missing, officials said. About 25,000 people in that area also were affected by heavy rainfall from Beryl.\n\nBeryl is expected to bring life-threatening winds and storm surge to Jamaica, where officials warned residents in flood-prone areas to prepare for evacuation.\n\n\"I am encouraging all Jamaicans to take the hurricane as a serious threat,\" the country's prime minister said in a public address Tuesday. \"It is, however, not a time to panic.\"\n\nBut if you have a holiday booked to the area soon, where do you stand? Here is what we know.\n\nThe storm has proved highly destructive so far, with winds of up to 155 mph recorded on Grenada. Multiple airports in the region have been closed, so it's best to contact your travel provider if you have a trip booked to the Caribbean.\n\nThe Foreign Office said: \"A major hurricane moving through the Caribbean has impacted services in Barbados. Grantley Adams International Airport and Bridgetown Port reopened on 2 July 2024 with the resumption of commercial flights.\n\nYou should follow and monitor local and international weather updates from the US National Hurricane Center and follow the advice of local authorities, including any evacuation orders.

Roofs ripped from airport, buildings - West Hawaii Today", "body": "The northern eyewall of Category 4 Hurricane Beryl scraped along Jamaica's southern coast Wednesday afternoon, walloping the island with high winds and drenching rains for most of the day with the worst impacts on the south end of the island.\n\nThe northern eyewall of Category 4 Hurricane Beryl scraped along Jamaica's southern coast Wednesday afternoon, walloping the island with high winds and drenching rains for most of the day with the worst impacts on the south end of the island.\n\nEarly Wednesday evening, reports of felled trees, impassable roads, extensive power outages and winds so strong they stripped roofs from buildings -- including the international airport -- began cropping up across Jamaica, where hundreds waited out the storm in hurricane shelters.\n\nIt's too soon to know the full extent of the havoc the storm wrought on the island nation, but it's already left at least seven dead from its first brush with the eastern Caribbean and leveled some of the smaller islands in the southeast Caribbean.\n\n\"It is almost Armageddon-like, almost total damage or destruction of all buildings whether they be public buildings, homes or other private facilities,\" said Grenada Prime Minister Dickon Mitchell after a helicopter survey on Tuesday.\n\nAs of the 5 p.m. Eastern time update Wednesday, the National Hurricane Center said Beryl was still holding on to its Category 4 status with 140 mph sustained winds, a slight decline from earlier in the day. In a potential good sign, the initial readings in the Jamaican capital Kingston were significantly less, with sustained winds topping 48 mph and a wind gust as high as 81 mph.\n\nAfter some slight weakening just before it closed in, Beryl appeared to be more organized Wednesday afternoon with a clear-out eye. Forecasters expect it to bring up to 9 feet of \"life-threatening\" storm surge and up to a foot of rain.\n\nBeryl was about 65 miles west-southwest of Kingston, Jamaica and headed west-northwest at 20 mph. Hurricane-force winds extended up to 45 miles from the storm's eye, putting Kingston within reach of the worst of the storm's winds and covering nearly the entire island with tropical-storm-force winds, which reached up to 185 miles from the center.\n\nJamaica was getting smacked with the upper right section of the storm, also known as the dirty side, which brings the most storm surge and holds the greatest potential for tornado formation. It's \"the worst side of the storm,\" wrote Sammy Hadi, a meteorologist with the Miami office of the National Weather Service, on Twitter.\n\nNext on the forecast track is the Cayman Islands, which are also under hurricane warnings. Beryl is on track to pass south of the islands on Thursday as a strong Category 3 before heading onward to the Yucatan Peninsula.\n\nFrom there, Beryl is forecast to make another landfall in the Quintana Roo region of Mexico as a Category 1 hurricane, before re-emerging in the Gulf of Mexico as a tropical storm. New on Wednesday morning, the hurricane center now predicts Beryl could re-strengthen to a Category 1 hurricane again before striking the northeast coast of Mexico.\n\nDamage toll rising\n\nJamaican news outlets began reporting widespread power and water outages Wednesday evening as floodwaters and fallen trees began to make some roads impassable. Part of the roof at Norman Manley International Airport in Kingston ripped off in the storm, video on social media shows.\n\nAs of 5 p.m., Jamaican Prime Minister Andrew Holness reported no official deaths and said that more than 500 people were relocated to hurricane shelters.\n\nJamaica also fully mobilized its security forces to maintain order, and extended the 6 p.m. cutoff time for the curfew as the storm continued to pound the island. As Jamaicans were getting swiped, Haiti announced it had lifted the alerts for its southern coast. The storm no longer presented a threat, a message from Haiti's Office of Civil Protection said.\n\nIn Grenada, which got slammed on Monday, officials reported an \"Armageddon-like\" impact. The hardest hit islands saw 98% of all homes and buildings destroyed, and massive damage to communications and the electrical grid.\n\n\"Complete devastation and destruction of agriculture. Complete and total destruction of the natural environment; there is literally no vegetation left anywhere on the island of Carriacou,\" Mitchell, the prime minister, said.\n\nIn Venezuela, nearly 1,500 people are homeless after Beryl's rains caused a river to overflow and destroy about 300 homes, El Caribe reported. Venezuela announced three more official deaths from the storm, bringing the latest total to seven dead.\n\nThe Caribbean Disaster Emergency Management agency, the regional body responsible for responding to disasters, said Wednesday there is not yet an official death toll and they are still assessing the destruction in member countries.\n\nElizabeth Riely, director of CDEMA, confirmed that while the Grenadines islands of Grenada and St. Vincent bore the brunt of the hurricane, Barbados, St. Lucia and Dominica were also affected.\n\nRiley said based on reports provided so far, they know that 100% of the population on the island of Canouan, which has 12,600 inhabitants, was affected by Beryl. \"There is an estimated 90% of the houses that were damaged either extensively or destroyed.\"\n\nElsewhere in the Atlantic, the hurricane center continued to drop the likelihood that another system would form behind Beryl. By Wednesday morning, it had a 20% chance of strengthening into a tropical depression this week.\n\nThe system dumped heavy rain on the already-ravaged islands Wednesday, prompting a flash flood warning in Barbados.", "source": {"uri": "westhawaiitoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "West Hawaii Today"}, "authors": [{"uri": "none@westhawaiitoday.com", "name": "none", "type": "author",

Everything's gone. I'm in my house and scared,\" said Amoy Wellington, a 51-year-old cashier who lives in a rural farming community in southern St. Elizabeth parish. \"It's a disaster.\"\n\nBeryl moved away from Jamaica early on Thursday. At around 0900 GMT, the hurricane, now a Category 3 storm, was 55 miles (90 km) from Grand Cayman and about 440 miles (700 km) off Tulum, Mexico, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said.\n\nBeryl was carrying top winds of 130 mph (209 kph), and was expected to dump 4-6 inches (10-15 cm) of rain on the Cayman Islands, where life-threatening surf and rip currents were possible, the NHC said.\n\nA hurricane warning was in force for the Cayman Islands east coast of Mexico's Yucatan peninsula.\n\nMexico's tourist centres of Cancun and the wider Yucatan peninsula lie in Beryl's predicted path. Cancun's airport was thronged with tourists hoping to catch last flights out before the storm arrives. Workers filled bags with sand and boarded up doors and windows of businesses for protection.\n\nMexico's defense ministry opened around 120 storm shelters, and asked visitors to heed instructions on evacuation or other measures.\n\nBeryl is the 2024 Atlantic season's first hurricane and at its peak earlier this week was the earliest Category 5 storm on record. A Category 5 hurricane brings winds of 157 mph (252 kph) or higher, capable of causing catastrophic damage including the destruction of homes and infrastructure.\n\nJAMAICA AND SMALL ISLANDS\n\nIn Jamaica the island's main airports were closed and streets were mostly empty after Prime Minister Andrew Holness issued a curfew for Wednesday, which was extended to Thursday as storm conditions continued. At least one person was reported killed in the storm.\n\nNearly 1,000 people were in shelters by Wednesday evening, Richard Thompson, acting director general at Jamaica's disaster agency said in an interview on local news.\n\nThe storm hit St. Vincent and the Grenadines earlier in the week. Prime Minister Ralph Gonsalves said in a radio interview that Union Island was \"flattened\" and it would \"be a Herculean effort to rebuild.\"\n\nThere were at least three confirmed fatalities and crop damage was widespread, senior officials told Reuters. Union Island suffered destruction of more than 90% of buildings.\n\nIn Grenada, Prime Minister Dickon Mitchell described \"Armageddon-like\" conditions after the storm made impact earlier in the week, with no power and widespread destruction, while also confirming three deaths.\n\nVenezuelan President Nicolas Maduro told state television that three people had died, four were missing, and over 8,000 homes damaged.\n\nThe U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has forecast a large number of major hurricanes in an \"extraordinary\" season this year. The season runs from the start of June to the end of November\n\nBeryl's destructive power, coming so early in the hurricane season, underscores the consequences of a warmer Atlantic Ocean, which scientists cite as a sign of human-caused climate change fueling extreme weather.\n\n(Writing by Bernadette Baum and Brendan O'Boyle; Reporting by Zahra Burton in Kingston, Robertson Henry in St.

The PA news agency said the couple will also follow the impact \"closely\" as warnings are issued for a series of areas in the hurricane's path. A royal source said: \"The Prince and Princess of Wales are donating privately to the relief efforts. They continue to follow the impact of Hurricane Beryl closely.\"\n\nWarnings are in effect for Jamaica, Grand Cayman, Little Cayman, and Cayman Brac. Hurricane Beryl was forecast to be near major-hurricane strength when it passed near or over Jamaica early on Wednesday, and near the Cayman Islands on Thursday and into Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula on Friday, according to the National Hurricane Centre (NHC).\n\nThe NHC warned in an advisory released today: \"Devastating hurricane-force winds, life-threatening storm surge, and damaging waves are expected to begin in Jamaica within the next few hours and spread into the Caymwan Islands tonight. Mountainous locations in Jamaica are likely to experience destructive wind gusts.\"\n\nThe advisory adds that people should also expect \"life-threatening flash flooding and mudslides\" caused by the heavy rainfall in Jamaica and southern Haiti, with damaging winds, storm surges and heavy rainfall over the Yucatan Peninsula and Belize on Thursday night.\n\nA hurricane watch was in effect for Haiti's southern coast and the Yucatan's east coast, as Belize issued a tropical storm watch stretching south from its border with Mexico to Belize City. Late on Monday, Beryl became the earliest storm to develop into a Category five hurricane in the Atlantic and peaked at winds of 165mph on Tuesday before weakening to a still-destructive Category four.\n\nOn Wednesday, the storm was about 250 miles east-southeast of Kingston, Jamaica. It had top winds of 145mph and was moving west-northwest at 22mph, the centre said. Three people were reported killed in Grenada and Carriacou and another in St Vincent and the Grenadines, officials said.\n\nTwo other deaths were reported in northern Venezuela, where five people are missing, officials said. One fatality in Grenada occurred after a tree fell on a house. As it progresses, the NHC adds that it is uncertain about how the hurricane may track, with governments in the Gulf of Mexico, including Texas, advised to monitor Beryl's progress.", "source": {"uri":

With winds of up to 140 mph and severe flooding, the storm has caused at least nine deaths, widespread homelessness, and significant agricultural losses across the region.\n\nHurricane Beryl churned menacingly over Jamaica on Wednesday afternoon, after uprooting trees, ripping off roofs and destroying farms as it forged a destructive, water-soaked path across smaller Caribbean islands over the past couple days. The death toll from the powerful Category 4 hurricane rose to at least nine, but it is widely expected to rise as communications come back online across drenched islands damaged by flooding and deadly winds.\n\nIn Jamaica, the storm hit the island's southern coast on Wednesday afternoon, pummeling communities with intense wind and rain as emergency groups evacuated people living in flood-prone communities. \"It's terrible. Everything's gone. I'm in my house and scared,\" said Amoy Wellington, a 51-year-old cashier who lives in Top Hill, a rural farming community in Jamaica's southern St. Elizabeth parish. \"It's a disaster.\"\n\nAlmost 500 Jamaicans were in shelters by Wednesday afternoon, Prime Minister Andrew Holness told reporters, urging people in high-risk areas to move. \"We have not seen the worst of what could happen,\" Holness said. \"We can do as much as we can do, as (is) humanly possible, and we leave the rest in the hands of God.\"\n\nThe airports in the Jamaican capital, Kingston, and tourist-popular Montego Bay were closed throughout the day. The loss of life and damage wrought by Beryl underscores the consequences of a warmer Atlantic Ocean, which scientists cite as a telltale sign of human-caused climate change fueling extreme weather that differs from past experience.\n\nRalph Gonsalves, prime minister of St. Vincent and the Grenadines, one of the hardest-hit areas in the eastern Caribbean, said in a radio interview that the country's Union Island was \"flattened\" by Beryl. \"Everybody is homeless ... It is going to be a Herculean effort to rebuild.\"\n\nSpeaking to state media, Nerissa Gittens-McMillan, permanent secretary at St. Vincent and the Grenadines' agriculture ministry, warned of possible food shortages after 50% of the country's plantain and banana crops were lost, with significant losses also to root crops and vegetables. In Kingston, streets were quiet as anxious residents hunkered down after spending the morning stocking up on essential supplies.\n\nJamaicans braced for electricity cuts later on Wednesday, according to a power company official, with roads near the coast already washed out as steady rain continued to fall and winds picked up in the capital. In St. Elizabeth, local politician Joseph Patterson said the power was out and the situation was \"getting gradually worse by the minute,\" with aggressive winds bringing down trees.\n\nBy Wednesday afternoon, the well-defined eye of the spiraling hurricane was located about 65 miles (105 km) southeast of Kingston, according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center (NHC), though its outer rings were already lashing much of the island with a population of nearly 3 million. Beryl is packing maximum sustained winds of 140 miles per hour (225 kph).\n\nThe force of the winds is expected to weaken somewhat in next day or two, according to the NHC, though it cautioned that Beryl will remain at or near major hurricane strength as it moves on to the Cayman Islands. \"Life-threatening flash flooding and mudslides from heavy rainfall are expected over much of Jamaica and southern Haiti through today,\" the NHC said in a post, adding that dangerous winds and storm surge are also expected in the Cayman Islands through early Thursday.\n\nThe center added that a hurricane warning was in effect for Jamaica, the Cayman Islands, as well as the eastern coast of Mexico's Yucatan peninsula, including for the country's top beach resort Cancun. 'WE COULD NOT SLEEP'\n\nOvernight in Haiti as Beryl's impact grew progressively stronger, residents anxiously awaited its full impact. \"We were not comfortable. We could not sleep normally with the wind, the water. Many people slept in the yard,\" said Pouchon Jean-Francois, who lives in an improvised camp in Port-au-Prince.\n\nVenezuelan Vice President Delcy Rodriguez was injured as she surveyed an area south of Beryl on Tuesday night, where the Manzanares River in Sucre state burst its banks. President Nicolas Maduro confirmed the injuries caused by a falling tree to his second-in-command, along with head injuries suffered by senior officials accompanying her, after intense rainfall struck inland from the country's Caribbean coastline.\n\nOn Tuesday night, Maduro told state television that three people had died and four were missing in the area, along with more than 8,000 homes damaged by torrential rains, including at least 400 destroyed. The unusually early hurricane strengthened at a record pace, which scientists argue is almost certainly fueled by climate change.\n\nBeryl is the 2024 Atlantic season's first hurricane and the earliest storm on record to reach the highest category on the Saffir-Simpson five-stage scale. The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has forecast a large number of major hurricanes in an \"extraordinary\" season this year. Additional confirmed fatalities so far include at least three in St. Vincent and the Grenadines, a senior official told Reuters, where Union Island has suffered severe destruction of over 90% of buildings.\n\nIn Grenada, Prime Minister Dickon Mitchell described \"Armageddon-like\" conditions with no power and widespread destruction, while also confirming three deaths. Beyond near-term impact in Jamaica and Haiti, the NHC warned that Beryl will likely make landfall on Mexico's Yucatan peninsula as early as Thursday night.\n\nIn Cancun, officials said supplies of wooden boards used to protect doors and windows were dwindling as locals and tourists prepared for Beryl's arrival. Laura Velazquez, head of Mexico's civil protection agency, encouraged tourists in Cancun and nearby Tulum to hunker down in hotel basements once the hurricane approaches, in comments to local broadcaster Milenio.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

It was expected to reach the Yucatan Peninsula by Friday morning and cover the southwestern Gulf of Mexico before taking a more northerly turn.\n\nThen Beryl is expected to emerge over the southwestern Gulf of Mexico on Friday night and move northwestward across the southwestern Gulf of Mexico on Saturday.\n\nHurricane warnings were maintained for the Cayman Islands, including Grand Cayman, and the Yucatan Peninsula from Puerto Costa Maya to Cancun.\n\nPowerful hurricane-force winds extend 45 miles from the eye of the storm with tropical storm-force winds extending out another 175 miles.\n\n\"Strong winds, dangerous storm surge, and damaging waves expected on the coast of the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico by early Friday,\" NHC said,\n\nHurricane Beryl was the earliest Category 5 hurricane on record in the Atlantic. It has been blamed for six deaths and caused severe damage after slamming the Caribbean. Forecasters said water could rise to 12 feet on the islands.\n\nNumerous Americans rode out Hurricane Beryl in Jamaica on Wednesday, including Emmy Award-winning actress Sheryl Lee Ralph. The actress, who plays Barbara Howard on Abbott Elementary, shared a brief video from Kingston on Wednesday, praying for everyone's safety.\n\nJamaica's Prime Minister Andrew Holness said the country is now assessing what the storm left behind, which appears to have caused damaged coastal infrastructure. He said the examination is still early because the potential of flooding and landslides remained high.\n\nHolness said road damage and debris caused by the high winds and winds will take investigators some time to give a preliminary estimate of damage.\n\nAt least one death has been blamed on the storm in Jamaica when a woman died after a tree fell on her home.\n\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's satellites captured the first four days of Beryl, as the storm grew from a \"tropical cyclone in the western Atlantic Ocean to a Category 5 hurricane in the Caribbean Sea.\"\n\nSince Monday, the hurricane has torn through the island of Cariacou in Grenada, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, as well as Venezuela. At least six people have died, as Cariacou was \"flattened\" in half an hour, according to Grenada Prime Minister Dickon Mitchell.\n\nMitchell reported three people were killed in Cariacou on Monday, with another death reported in St. Vincent and the Grenadines. Two people were killed in northern Venezuela, according to officials.\n\nAt least five other people are missing in Venezuela, according to Remigio Ceballos Ichaso, the Venezuelan minister of Interior Relations.\n\nIn addition to the deaths, Beryl's heavy rains and winds have caused landslides, leveled buildings and taken out power systems, as scientists have warned of a more active and extreme hurricane season this year.\n\nCruise lines in the Caribbean were rerouting their ships Tuesday night.\n\n\"The safety of our guests and crew is paramount,\" Carnival Cruise Line said in a statement, \"and we are continuing to monitor forecasts and factor in guidance from the National Hurricane Center, U.S. Coast Guard and local port authorities to provide timely updates to our guests as more information becomes available.\"\n\n\"People, impacted islands and communities are in our prayers, and we stand by to provide assistance to them,\" Biden said during an event on extreme weather.\n\n\"Ignoring climate change is deadly and dangerous and irresponsible,\" Biden added. \"These climate-fueled extreme weather events don't just affect people's lives. They also cost money.\"", "source": {"uri": "theolympian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The  Olympian"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Beryl",

Regardless of the exact track, rip currents could cause life-threatening beach conditions beginning late Friday and continuing through the weekend across much of the Gulf Coast.\"\n\nAs of 7 a.m. CDT Thursday, the center of Hurricane Beryl was located about 50 miles southwest of Grand Cayman and was tracking to the west-northwest at 20 mph.\n\nBeryl had sustained winds of 120 mph, making it a Category 3 hurricane.\n\nThe hurricane center expects Beryl to keep on a path to the west or west-northwest, and it will move away from the Cayman Islands and toward Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula, where it could make landfall early Friday morning. The hurricane center expects Beryl to be weaker by then but still a hurricane.\n\nThen Beryl could make it into the southern Gulf of Mexico by Friday night. Forecasters think it could restrengthen to a hurricane over the Gulf and make its final landfall in northern Mexico, very close to the border with Texas. That could happen late Sunday or early Monday morning, according to the hurricane center's official forecast track.\n\nBeryl could bring 2 to 4 feet of storm surge to the Cayman Islands today and 4 to 6 feet to the Yucatan Peninsula on Friday.\n\nThe storm could also drop 4 to 6 inches of rain on those same places, forecasters said.\n\nA hurricane warning is in effect for remained in effect for Grand Cayman, Little Cayman and Cayman Brac and the coast of the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico from Puerto Costa Maya to Cancun, including Cozumel.\n\nA hurricane watch is in effect for the coast of the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico south of Puerto Costa Maya to Chetumal and the coast of the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico north of Cancun to Cabo Catoche.\n\nA tropical storm warning is in effect for the coast of the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico south of Puerto Costa Maya to Chetumal and the coast of the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico north of Cancun to Campeche.\n\nA tropical storm watch is in effect for the coast of Belize from south of Chetumal to Belize City.\n\nBeryl peaked as a Category 5 hurricane late Monday into Tuesday morning and had maximum winds of 165 mph. It made its first landfall on the small island of Carriacou on Monday with 150 mph winds, causing significant damage and killing at least six people.\n\nEarly reports suggest two others were killed by

The historic hurricane, however, has only weakened slightly, packing a 140 mph punch and already being blamed for seven deaths in other countries.\n\nJamaican officials, as a result, pleaded with residents to take the storm seriously -urging evacuations as storm surges make flooding possible. As of writing, no deaths have been reported there, the the storm's path remains somewhat uncertain.\n\nThe Americas, however, appears to be the storm's next stop, weather officials said - with either Mexico or Texas set to be hit next within the next 48 hours, by an even stronger version of the storm that's already killed at least seven.\n\nHurricane Beryl struck the island nation of Jamaica Wednesday.

Such was the case in Barbados Tuesday, as several boats were left nearly sunk by surging currents created by the then Category-5 sotrm\n\nThe storm is currently moving west, where it may strike the southern part of Mexico before potentially engaging in a rare double strike of the country by passing over its eponymous gulf and toward more northern cities like Monterrey.\n\nThat said, Beryl's path remains unpredictable, and state authorities in Texas are warning people - particularly in coastal areas - about the prospect of a July 4 hurricane or tropical storm.\n\n'While Texans take time to enjoy the holiday weekend with family and friends, it's important to stay weather aware, pay close attention to the rapidly-changing forecasts,' Texas Emergency Management Chief Nim Kidd said in a statement.\n\n'[D]on't be caught without an emergency plan.'\n\n'If I lived in Texas, and I have lived in Texas, this would be a storm that I would be watching closely,' FOX Weather Meteorologist Britta Merwin added.\n\n'The possible impacts would be Sunday into Monday.'\n\nAs of writing, the southern state seems more set be spared, with Mexico the more likely candidate.\n\nBut Gov. Greg Abbott on Wednesday still told the Texas Division of Emergency Management to issue a hurricane advisory notice to the Texas Emergency Management Council.\n\n'Texas stands ready to deploy all available resources and support to our coastal communities,' the Republican said, urging Texans to be ready for the still-real prospect the tropical weather will reach the US's Gulf Coast.\n\nIn Jamaica, though, extensive damage already appears unavoidable, with the storm then projected to cross the Yucatan Peninsula sometime Friday.\n\nBy then, it will against strengthen into a Category 5, officials said - after it had already achieved that status Monday.\n\nA piece of tin roofing was seen wrapped into a tree after Hurricane Beryl passes through the country's capital of Kingston\n\nA man is seen looking at breaking waves along the coast as Hurricane Beryl approached Kingston\n\nA person makes their way through the wind and rain from Hurricane Beryl Wednesday, as towering waves and high-speed winds hit Jamaica\n\nFlooding was seen across the southern part of the country Wednesday, with Kingston one of the hardest hit\n\nThe storm is currently moving west, where it may strike the southern part of Mexico before potentially engaging in a rare double strike of the country by passing over its eponymous gulf and toward more northern cities like Monterrey. It has already hit much of the Carribean\n\nThere, it will move into the Gulf of Mexico, before slamming into either Mexico or southern Texas, weather officials said.\n\nAs of 5pm Wednesday, the hurricane's center had already passed through the capital Kingston, still some 265 miles from Grand Cayman, as the storm moved past the country.\n\nIt is currently moving west-northwest at speeds of around 20mph, while the winds whipping around insight of it are around seven times faster.\n\n'The Cayman Islands are sort of next in line for seeing significant impacts,' Brennan on Wednesday added, after some slight weakening occurred as the storm approached Jamaica earlier in the day.\n\nAuthorities at the time made it clear how the storm was a major weather event that should be taken seriously, with Prime minister Holness telling those in low-lying areas and areas historically prone to flooding and landslide to evacuate.\n\nHe further urged those living on the banks of a river to either 'evacuate to a shelter or to safer ground,' hours before the storm made landfall.\n\nPeople proceeded to board up windows, and fishermen pulled their boats out of the surrounding water.\n\nWorkers, meanwhile, worked to dismantle roadside advertising boards to protect them from the lashing winds, just before wind-whipped rains plowed into the island for several hours.\n\nThat said, Beryl's path remains unpredictable, and state authorities in Texas are warning people - particularly in coastal areas - about the prospect of a July 4 hurricane or tropical storm. People braving the storm Wednesday afternoon in Kingston are seen here\n\nA tree lays in the road in hard-hit Kingston as Hurricane Beryl passes through the area towards the Gulf of Mexico\n\nAs the storm gains strength over the gulf, Gov.

'The possible impacts would be Sunday into Monday.' Flooding in Jamaica Wednesday is seen here\n\nPower was knocked out in much of the capital, but by the evening, the storm had glanced off the island and continued making its way toward the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nIn an ensuing social media post, Prime Minister Holness revealed that nearly 500 Jamaicans had been placed in shelters.\n\n'We are placing emphasis on ensuring they are comfortable and well looked after,' he said.\n\nEarlier in the day, as churning whitecaps brought by Beryl's eye scraped by the island's southern coast, Jon Porter, chief meteorologist at AccuWeather, issued a statement citing the dangerous nature of the storm\n\n'We are very concerned about a wide variety of life threatening impacts in Jamaica,\" he said, before branding Beryl 'the strongest and most dangerous hurricane threat that Jamaica has faced, probably, in decades.'\n\nAs a result Jamaica was under a state of emergency, and afterward was declared a disaster zone hours before the impact.\n\nHolness says the disaster zone declaration will remain for the next seven days, as he implemented an island-wide curfew.\n\nThe hours for the restrictions were between 6 am and 6 pm, and were in effect only Wednesday.\n\nThe curfew has since passed, with officials now surveying the damage.\n\nOfficials said that nearly 500 Jamaicans had been placed in shelters, after an evacuation was ordered for those near rivers and residing low-lying areas. Several were left without power\n\nIn total, at least seven people are known to have died as a result of the storm's path across the Caribbean\n\nOn Monday, Beryl strengthened to a Category 5 hurricane for the first time, and by early Tuesday it was creating record-breaking 165 mph maximum sustained winds.\n\nThe small island nation of St. Vincent and the Grenadines were among those hit, with at least one person dead and more casualties likely as officials continue to probe flooded areas and wreckage.\n\nIn Grenada, at least three people have died, after Prime Minister Dickon Mitchell said a unspecified number of homes had been destroyed by the \"Armageddon-like\" stom\n\nVenezuela was also hit by heavy flooding that caused the deaths of at least, as four more remain missing as a result of the storm, the country's president, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, said.\n\nIn total, at least seven people are known to have died as a result of the storm's path.", "source": {"uri":

Apart from that, it's mainly concrete so there's not much we can do,\" Brown told the Jamaica Observer newspaper.\n\nAs of Wednesday night, Beryl was packing maximum sustained winds of 130 mph (215 kph), said the NHC.\n\nBeryl has already left a trail of death with at least three people killed in Grenada, where the storm made landfall Monday, as well as one in St Vincent and the Grenadines and three in Venezuela.\n\nRalph Gonsalves, prime minister of St Vincent and the Grenadines, said that it would take a \"herculean effort\" to rebuild after the substantial destruction and that \"90-odd percent of the houses were blown away\" on Union Island.\n\n\"Most of the country doesn't have electricity, and more than half without water at the moment,\" he said.\n\nGrenada's Prime Minister Dickon Mitchell said the island of Carriacou, which was struck by the eye of the storm, has been all but cut off, with houses, telecommunications and fuel facilities there flattened.\n\nThe 13.5-square mile (35-square kilometer) island is home to around 9,000 people. At least two people there died, Mitchell said, with a third killed on the country's main island of Grenada when a tree fell on a house.\n\nIn St Vincent and the Grenadines, one person on the island of Bequia was reported dead from the storm, while a man died in Venezuela's northeastern coastal state of Sucre when he was swept away by a flooded river, officials there said.\n\nIt is extremely rare for such a powerful storm to form this early in the Atlantic hurricane season, which runs from early June to late November.\n\nWarm ocean temperatures are key for hurricanes, and North Atlantic waters are currently between two and five degrees Fahrenheit (1-3 degrees Celsius) warmer than normal, according to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).\n\nUN climate chief Simon Stiell, who has family on the island of Carriacou, said climate change was \"pushing disasters to record-breaking new levels of destruction.\"\n\n\"Disasters on a scale that used to be the stuff of science fiction are becoming meteorological facts, and the climate crisis is the chief culprit,\" he said Monday, reporting that his parents' property was damaged.", "source": {"uri":

Roofs ripped from airport, buildings", "body": "The northern eyewall of Category 4 Hurricane Beryl scraped along Jamaica's southern coast Wednesday afternoon, walloping the island with high winds and drenching rains for most of the day with the worst impacts on the south end of the island.\n\nEarly Wednesday evening, reports of felled trees, impassable roads, extensive power outages and winds so strong they stripped roofs from buildings -- including the international airport -- began cropping up across Jamaica, where hundreds waited out the storm in hurricane shelters.\n\nIt's too soon to know the full extent of the havoc the storm wrought on the island nation, but it's already left at least seven dead from its first brush with the eastern Caribbean and leveled some of the smaller islands in the southeast Caribbean.\n\n\"It is almost Armageddon-like, almost total damage or destruction of all buildings whether they be public buildings, homes or other private facilities,\" said Grenada Prime Minister Dickon Mitchell after a helicopter survey on Tuesday.\n\nAs of the 5 p.m. Eastern time update Wednesday, the National Hurricane Center said Beryl was still holding on to its Category 4 status with 140 mph sustained winds, a slight decline from earlier in the day. In a potential good sign, the initial readings in the Jamaican capital Kingston were significantly less, with sustained winds topping 48 mph and a wind gust as high as 81 mph.\n\nAfter some slight weakening just before it closed in, Beryl appeared to be more organized Wednesday afternoon with a clear-out eye. Forecasters expect it to bring up to 9 feet of \"life-threatening\" storm surge and up to a foot of rain.\n\nBeryl was about 65 miles west-southwest of Kingston, Jamaica and headed west-northwest at 20 mph. Hurricane-force winds extended up to 45 miles from the storm's eye, putting Kingston within reach of the worst of the storm's winds and covering nearly the entire island with tropical-storm-force winds, which reached up to 185 miles from the center.\n\nJamaica was getting smacked with the upper right section of the storm, also known as the dirty side, which brings the most storm surge and holds the greatest potential for tornado formation. It's \"the worst side of the storm,\" wrote Sammy Hadi, a meteorologist with the Miami office of the National Weather Service, on Twitter.\n\nNext on the forecast track is the Cayman Islands, which are also under hurricane warnings. Beryl is on track to pass south of the islands on Thursday as a strong Category 3 before heading onward to the Yucatan Peninsula.\n\nFrom there, Beryl is forecast to make another landfall in the Quintana Roo region of Mexico as a Category 1 hurricane, before re-emerging in the Gulf of Mexico as a tropical storm. New on Wednesday morning, the hurricane center now predicts Beryl could re-strengthen to a Category 1 hurricane again before striking the northeast coast of Mexico.\n\nDamage toll rising\n\nJamaican news outlets began reporting widespread power and water outages Wednesday evening as floodwaters and fallen trees began to make some roads impassable. Part of the roof at Norman Manley International Airport in Kingston ripped off in the storm, video on social media shows.\n\nAs of 5 p.m., Jamaican Prime Minister Andrew Holness reported no official deaths and said that more than 500 people were relocated to hurricane shelters.\n\nJamaica also fully mobilized its security forces to maintain order, and extended the 6 p.m. cutoff time for the curfew as the storm continued to pound the island. As Jamaicans were getting swiped, Haiti announced it had lifted the alerts for its southern coast. The storm no longer presented a threat, a message from Haiti's Office of Civil Protection said.\n\nIn Grenada, which got slammed on Monday, officials reported an \"Armageddon-like\" impact. The hardest hit islands saw 98% of all homes and buildings destroyed, and massive damage to communications and the electrical grid.\n\n\"Complete devastation and destruction of agriculture. Complete and total destruction of the natural environment; there is literally no vegetation left anywhere on the island of Carriacou,\" Mitchell, the prime minister, said.\n\nIn Venezuela, nearly 1,500 people are homeless after Beryl's rains caused a river to overflow and destroy about 300 homes, E l Caribe reported. Venezuela announced three more official deaths from the storm, bringing the latest total to seven dead.\n\nThe Caribbean Disaster Emergency Management agency, the regional body responsible for responding to disasters, said Wednesday there is not yet an official death toll and they are still assessing the destruction in member countries.\n\nElizabeth Riely, director of CDEMA, confirmed that while the Grenadines islands of Grenada and St. Vincent bore the brunt of the hurricane, Barbados, St. Lucia and Dominica were also affected.\n\nRiley said based on reports provided so far, they know that 100% of the population on the island of Canouan, which has 12,600 inhabitants, was affected by Beryl. \"There is an estimated 90% of the houses that were damaged either extensively or destroyed.\"\n\nElsewhere in the Atlantic, the hurricane center continued to drop the likelihood that another system would form behind Beryl. By Wednesday morning, it had a 20% chance of strengthening into a tropical depression this week.\n\nThe system dumped heavy rain on the already-ravaged islands Wednesday, prompting a flash flood warning in Barbados.\n\n\u00a92024 Miami Herald.

Everything's gone. I'm in my house and scared,\" said Amoy Wellington, a 51-year-old cashier who lives in a rural farming community in the southern St. Elizabeth parish.\n\nThe island's main airports were closed and streets empty after Jamaica's Prime Minister Andrew Holness issued a curfew for Wednesday, which was extended to Thursday as storm conditions continued.\n\nMr Holness insisted the country had not seen the \"worst of what could possibly happen\".\n\n\"We can do as much as we can do, as humanly possible, and we leave the rest in the hands of God.\"\n\nThe government's Information Service said power outages spread across Jamaica's north, while some roads near the coast were washed out or blocked off by fallen trees and utility poles.\n\nBeryl moved on from Jamaica early on Thursday.\n\nThe island discontinued its hurricane warning but kept a flash flood watch, the Meteorological Service of Jamaica said on X.\n\nBeryl weakened slightly to a category three hurricane after descending on Jamaica, but remains a threat as it bears down on the Cayman Islands and Mexico.\n\nAt around 4am local time, the tropical storm was just 88 kilometres from Grand Cayman and about 708 kilometres off Tulum Mexico, the NHC said.\n\nPacking maximum sustained winds of 209 kilometres per hour, Beryl is expected to dump 10-15 centimetres of rain on the Cayman Islands into Thursday.\n\nA hurricane warning is in effect and life-threatening surf and rip currents are possible, the NHC add.\n\nA hurricane warning is also in force for the eastern coast of Mexico's Yucatan peninsula.\n\nBeryl is expected to make landfall in a sparsely populated area of lagoons and mangroves south of Tulum in the early hours of Friday, local time.\n\nIt is expected to weaken further to a category two storm by then, but re-strengthen over the Gulf of Mexico to make a second strike on the country's north-east coast.\n\nNational coordinator of Civil Protection Laura Velazquez encouraged tourists in Cancun and nearby Tulum to hunker down in hotel basements as the storm approached, in comments to local broadcaster Milenio.\n\nBeryl is the 2024 Atlantic season's first hurricane, and marked the earliest-developing category five hurricane on record when it was categorised on Monday.\n\nThe World Meteorological Organization says Beryl sets a precedent for a \"very dangerous hurricane season\", while scientists cite the destruction as a sign of human-caused ocean warming in the Atlantic causing extreme weather.\n\nThe US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has forecast a large number of major hurricanes in an \"extraordinary\" season this year.\n\nBut residents of the Caribbean are facing more immediate consequences.\n\nNerissa Gittens-McMillan, permanent secretary at St. Vincent and the Grenadines' agriculture ministry, warns of possible food shortages after half the country's plantain and banana crops were lost.\n\nRalph Gonsalves, Prime Minister of St. Vincent and the Grenadines, said in a radio interview the country's Union Island was \"flattened\" by Beryl and it would \"be a Herculean effort to rebuild\".\n\nMayreau and Union Island suffered destruction of more

REUTERS\n\nHurricane Beryl churned menacingly over Jamaica on Wednesday afternoon, after uprooting trees, ripping off roofs and destroying farms as it forged a destructive, water-soaked path across smaller Caribbean islands over the past couple days.\n\nThe death toll from the powerful Category 4 hurricane rose to at least nine, but it is widely expected to rise as communications come back online across drenched islands damaged by flooding and deadly winds.\n\nIn Jamaica, the storm hit the island's southern coast on Wednesday afternoon, pummeling communities with intense wind and rain as emergency groups evacuated people living in flood-prone communities.\n\n\"It's terrible. Everything's gone. I'm in my house and scared,\" said Amoy Wellington, a 51-year-old cashier who lives in Top Hill, a rural farming community in Jamaica's southern St. Elizabeth parish. \"It's a disaster.\"\n\nAlmost 500 Jamaicans were in shelters by Wednesday afternoon, Prime Minister Andrew Holness told reporters, urging people in high-risk areas to move.\n\n\"We have not seen the worst of what could happen,\" Holness said. \"We can do as much as we can do, as (is) humanly possible, and we leave the rest in the hands of God.\"\n\nThe airports in the Jamaican capital, Kingston, and tourist-popular Montego Bay were closed throughout the day.\n\nThe loss of life and damage wrought by Beryl underscores the consequences of a warmer Atlantic Ocean, which scientists cite as a telltale sign of human-caused climate change fueling extreme weather that differs from past experience.\n\nRalph Gonsalves, prime minister of St Vincent and the Grenadines, one of the hardest-hit areas in the eastern Caribbean, said in a radio interview that the country's Union Island was \"flattened\" by Beryl.\n\n\"Everybody is homeless ... It is going to be a Herculean effort to rebuild.\"\n\nSpeaking to state media, Nerissa Gittens-McMillan, permanent secretary at St. Vincent and the Grenadines' agriculture ministry, warned of possible food shortages after 50% of the country's plantain and banana crops were lost, with significant losses also to root crops and vegetables.\n\nIn Kingston, streets were quiet as anxious residents hunkered down after spending the morning stocking up on essential supplies.\n\nJamaicans braced for electricity cuts later on Wednesday, according to a power company official, with roads near the coast already washed out as steady rain continued to fall and winds picked up in the capital.\n\nIn St Elizabeth, local politician Joseph Patterson said the power was out and the situation was \"getting gradually worse by the minute,\" with aggressive winds bringing down trees.\n\nBy Wednesday afternoon, the well-defined eye of the spiraling hurricane was located about 65 miles (105 km) southeast of Kingston, according to the US National Hurricane Center (NHC), though its outer rings were already lashing much of the island with a population of nearly 3 million.\n\nBeryl is packing maximum sustained winds of 140 miles per hour (225 kph).\n\nThe force of the winds is expected to weaken somewhat in next day or two, according to the NHC, though it cautioned that Beryl will remain at or near major hurricane strength as it moves on to the Cayman Islands.\n\n\"Life-threatening flash flooding and mudslides from heavy rainfall are expected over much of Jamaica and southern Haiti through today,\" the NHC said in a post, adding that dangerous winds and storm surge are also expected in the Cayman Islands through early Thursday.\n\nThe center added that a hurricane warning was in effect for Jamaica, the Cayman Islands, as well as the eastern coast of Mexico's Yucatan peninsula, including for the country's top beach resort Cancun.\n\n'WE COULD NOT SLEEP'\n\nOvernight in Haiti as Beryl's impact grew progressively stronger, residents anxiously awaited its full impact.\n\n\"We were not comfortable. We could not sleep normally with the wind, the water. Many people slept in the yard,\" said Pouchon Jean-Francois, who lives in an improvised camp in Port-au-Prince.\n\nVenezuelan Vice President Delcy Rodriguez was injured as she surveyed an area south of Beryl on Tuesday night, where the Manzanares River in Sucre state burst its banks.\n\nPresident Nicolas Maduro confirmed the injuries caused by a falling tree to his second-in-command, along with head injuries suffered by senior officials accompanying her, after intense rainfall struck inland from the country's Caribbean coastline.\n\nOn Tuesday night, Maduro told state television that three people had died and four were missing in the area, along with more than 8,000 homes damaged by torrential rains, including at least 400 destroyed.\n\nThe unusually early hurricane strengthened at a record pace, which scientists argue is almost certainly fuelled by climate change.\n\nBeryl is the 2024 Atlantic season's first hurricane and the earliest storm on record to reach the highest category on the Saffir-Simpson five-stage scale. The US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has forecast a large number of major hurricanes in an \"extraordinary\" season this year.\n\nAdditional confirmed fatalities so far include at least three in St. Vincent and the Grenadines, a senior official told Reuters, where Union Island has suffered severe destruction of over 90% of buildings.\n\nIn Grenada, Prime Minister Dickon Mitchell described \"Armageddon-like\" conditions with no power and widespread destruction, while also confirming three deaths.\n\nBeyond near-term impact in Jamaica and Haiti, the NHC warned that Beryl will likely make landfall on Mexico's Yucatan peninsula as early as Thursday night.\n\nIn Cancun, officials said supplies of wooden boards used to protect doors and windows were dwindling as locals and tourists prepared for Beryl's arrival.\n\nLaura Velazquez, head of Mexico's civil protection agency, encouraged tourists in Cancun and nearby Tulum to hunker down in hotel basements once the hurricane approaches, in comments to local broadcaster Milenio.", "source": {"uri": "bdnews24.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "bdnews24.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bdnews24_com@bdnews24.com",

Roofs ripped from airport, buildings", "body": "The northern eyewall of Category 4 Hurricane Beryl scraped along Jamaica's southern coast Wednesday afternoon, walloping the island with high winds and drenching rains for most of the day with the worst impacts on the south end of the island.\n\nEarly Wednesday evening, reports of felled trees, impassable roads, extensive power outages and winds so strong they stripped roofs from buildings -- including the international airport -- began cropping up across Jamaica, where hundreds waited out the storm in hurricane shelters.\n\nIt's too soon to know the full extent of the havoc the storm wrought on the island nation, but it's already left at least seven dead from its first brush with the eastern Caribbean and leveled some of the smaller islands in the southeast Caribbean.\n\n\"It is almost Armageddon-like, almost total damage or destruction of all buildings whether they be public buildings, homes or other private facilities,\" said Grenada Prime Minister Dickon Mitchell after a helicopter survey on Tuesday.\n\nAs of the 5 p.m. Eastern time update Wednesday, the National Hurricane Center said Beryl was still holding on to its Category 4 status with 140 mph sustained winds, a slight decline from earlier in the day. In a potential good sign, the initial readings in the Jamaican capital Kingston were significantly less, with sustained winds topping 48 mph and a wind gust as high as 81 mph.\n\nAfter some slight weakening just before it closed in, Beryl appeared to be more organized Wednesday afternoon with a clear-out eye. Forecasters expect it to bring up to 9 feet of \"life-threatening\" storm surge and up to a foot of rain.\n\nBeryl was about 65 miles west-southwest of Kingston, Jamaica and headed west-northwest at 20 mph. Hurricane-force winds extended up to 45 miles from the storm's eye, putting Kingston within reach of the worst of the storm's winds and covering nearly the entire island with tropical-storm-force winds, which reached up to 185 miles from the center.\n\nJamaica was getting smacked with the upper right section of the storm, also known as the dirty side, which brings the most storm surge and holds the greatest potential for tornado formation. It's \"the worst side of the storm,\" wrote Sammy Hadi, a meteorologist with the Miami office of the National Weather Service, on Twitter.\n\nNext on the forecast track is the Cayman Islands, which are also under hurricane warnings. Beryl is on track to pass south of the islands on Thursday as a strong Category 3 before heading onward to the Yucatan Peninsula.\n\nFrom there, Beryl is forecast to make another landfall in the Quintana Roo region of Mexico as a Category 1 hurricane, before re-emerging in the Gulf of Mexico as a tropical storm. New on Wednesday morning, the hurricane center now predicts Beryl could re-strengthen to a Category 1 hurricane again before striking the northeast coast of Mexico.\n\n...continued", "source": {"uri": "arcamax.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ArcaMax"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Caribbean"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Beryl", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hurricane Beryl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_(cyclone)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eye (cyclone)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Island_country", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Island country"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_outage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Power outage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_sustained_wind", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Maximum sustained wind"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingston,_Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kingston, Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kingston, Jamaica"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dickon_Mitchell", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dickon Mitchell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saffir\u2013Simpson_scale", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Saffir\u2013Simpson scale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storm_surge", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Storm surge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hurricane_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Hurricane Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tropical cyclone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grenada", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grenada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Grenada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landfall", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Landfall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Weather_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Weather Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tornado", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tornado"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yucat\u00e1n_Peninsula", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gulf of Mexico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone_warnings_and_watches", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tropical cyclone warnings and watches"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quintana_Roo", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quintana Roo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Quintana Roo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cayman_Islands", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cayman Islands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Cayman Islands"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Atmospheric_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Atmospheric Sciences", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Tropical_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Tropical Health", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Environment", "label": "news/Environment", "wgt": 54}], "image": "https://resources.arcamax.com/newspics/296/29644/2964434.gif", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9704864", "eventUri": "eng-9704864", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2156862745098039, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

I'm in my house and scared,\" said Amoy Wellington, a 51-year-old cashier who lives in Top Hill, a rural farming community in Jamaica's southern St. Elizabeth parish. \"It's a disaster.\"\n\nAlmost 500 Jamaicans were in shelters by Wednesday afternoon, Prime Minister Andrew Holness told reporters, urging people in high-risk areas to move. \"We have not seen the worst of what could happen,\" Holness said. \"We can do as much as we can do, as (is) humanly possible, and we leave the rest in the hands of God.\"\n\nThe airports in the Jamaican capital, Kingston, and tourist-popular Montego Bay were closed throughout the day. The loss of life and damage wrought by Beryl underscores the consequences of a warmer Atlantic Ocean, which scientists cite as a telltale sign of human-caused climate change fueling extreme weather that differs from past experience.\n\nRalph Gonsalves, prime minister of St. Vincent and the Grenadines, one of the hardest-hit areas in the eastern Caribbean, said in a radio interview that the country's Union Island was \"flattened\" by Beryl. \"Everybody is homeless ... It is going to be a Herculean effort to rebuild.\"\n\nSpeaking to state media, Nerissa Gittens-McMillan, permanent secretary at St. Vincent and the Grenadines' agriculture ministry, warned of possible food shortages after 50% of the country's plantain and banana crops were lost, with significant losses also to root crops and vegetables. In Kingston, streets were quiet as anxious residents hunkered down after spending the morning stocking up on essential supplies.\n\nJamaicans braced for electricity cuts later on Wednesday, according to a power company official, with roads near the coast already washed out as steady rain continued to fall and winds picked up in the capital. In St. Elizabeth, local politician Joseph Patterson said the power was out and the situation was \"getting gradually worse by the minute,\" with aggressive winds bringing down trees.\n\nBy Wednesday afternoon, the well-defined eye of the spiraling hurricane was located about 65 miles (105 km) southeast of Kingston, according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center (NHC), though its outer rings were already lashing much of the island with a population of nearly 3 million. Beryl is packing maximum sustained winds of 140 miles per hour (225 kph).\n\nThe force of the winds is expected to weaken somewhat in next day or two, according to the NHC, though it cautioned that Beryl will remain at or near major hurricane strength as it moves on to the Cayman Islands. \"Life-threatening flash flooding and mudslides from heavy rainfall are expected over much of Jamaica and southern Haiti through today,\" the NHC said in a post, adding that dangerous winds and storm surge are also expected in the Cayman Islands through early Thursday.\n\nThe center added that a hurricane warning was in effect for Jamaica, the Cayman Islands, as well as the eastern coast of Mexico's Yucatan peninsula, including for the country's top beach resort Cancun. 'WE COULD NOT SLEEP'\n\nOvernight in Haiti as Beryl's impact grew progressively stronger, residents anxiously awaited its full impact. \"We were not comfortable. We could not sleep normally with the wind, the water. Many people slept in the yard,\" said Pouchon Jean-Francois, who lives in an improvised camp in Port-au-Prince.\n\nVenezuelan Vice President Delcy Rodriguez was injured as she surveyed an area south of Beryl on Tuesday night, where the Manzanares River in Sucre state burst its banks. President Nicolas Maduro confirmed the injuries caused by a falling tree to his second-in-command, along with head injuries suffered by senior officials accompanying her, after intense rainfall struck inland from the country's Caribbean coastline.\n\nOn Tuesday night, Maduro told state television that three people had died and four were missing in the area, along with more than 8,000 homes damaged by torrential rains, including at least 400 destroyed. The unusually early hurricane strengthened at a record pace, which scientists argue is almost certainly fueled by climate change.\n\nBeryl is the 2024 Atlantic season's first hurricane and the earliest storm on record to reach the highest category on the Saffir-Simpson five-stage scale. The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has forecast a large number of major hurricanes in an \"extraordinary\" season this year. Additional confirmed fatalities so far include at least three in St. Vincent and the Grenadines, a senior official told Reuters, where Union Island has suffered severe destruction of over 90% of buildings.\n\nIn Grenada, Prime Minister Dickon Mitchell described \"Armageddon-like\" conditions with no power and widespread destruction, while also confirming three deaths. Beyond near-term impact in Jamaica and Haiti, the NHC warned that Beryl will likely make landfall on Mexico's Yucatan peninsula as early as Thursday night.\n\nIn Cancun, officials said supplies of wooden boards used to protect doors and windows were dwindling as locals and tourists prepared for Beryl's arrival. Laura Velazquez, head of Mexico's civil protection agency, encouraged tourists in Cancun and nearby Tulum to hunker down in hotel basements once the hurricane approaches, in comments to local broadcaster Milenio.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

While the storm has weakened from its earlier state, it is still a very dangerous Category 3 hurricane.\n\nHere's what you need to know about the damage Beryl has caused and its continued path.\n\nBeryl passed near the Cayman Islands Thursday morning and was headed towards the Yucatan Peninsula as a Category 3 storm with sustained winds of 120 mph.\n\nAs of Thursday morning, a hurricane warning was in effect for the Grand Cayman, the Little Cayman, and Cayman Brac islands, as well as the coast of the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico from Puerto Costa Maya to Cancun, including the island of Cozumel.\n\nStorm warnings and watches are also in effect up and down the Yucatan Peninsula and Belize.\n\nWhile there are no warnings or watches issued for parts of the U.S. yet, those in the western Gulf of Mexico, including southern Texas, were advised to continue monitoring Beryl's path.\n\nStorm warnings are issued for an area in which weather conditions are expected to arrive within 36 hours, while watches are issued when the conditions are expected to arrive within 48 hours.\n\nIn Jamaica, two deaths were reported by NBC News, and hundreds of thousands of customers were without power, according to local media.\n\nBeryl did the most severe damage when it made landfall earlier this week on the Grenadines, a small belt of islands in the Eastern Caribbean. At least 90% or more of the homes and buildings were destroyed or damaged on three small islands, according to the Caribbean Disaster Emergency Management Agency.\n\nWhile several deaths have been reported on these islands, officials at the Caribbean Disaster Emergency Management Agency declined to confirm a death toll at Wednesday's news conference.\n\nGrenada Prime Minister Dickon Mitchell described the \"total destruction\" to the islands of Carriacou and Petite Martinique in Grenada at a news conference Wednesday.\n\n\"Having seen it myself, there is really nothing that can prepare you to see this level of destruction,\" Mitchell said. \"It is almost Armageddon-like, almost total damage and destruction of all buildings, whether they be public buildings, homes or private facilities.\"\n\nMitchell also described \"complete devastation and destruction\" of agriculture and the natural environment, and severe damage to boats, marinas, and the electrical grid on Carriacou.\n\nMichael Lowry, a hurricane and storm surge expert, told the Associated Press that the rapid development of Beryl marked a \"very serious threat.\"\n\n\"Beryl is an extremely dangerous and rare hurricane for this time of year in this area,\" he said in a phone interview with the AP. \"Unusual is an understatement. Beryl is already a historic hurricane.\"\n\nOn Monday, Beryl became the earliest Atlantic hurricane to reach the Category 5 level. (It is both the earliest Category 4 and Category 5 storm on record in the Atlantic.)\n\nThe last strong hurricane to affect the southeast Caribbean was Hurricane Ivan in September 2004. Ivan battered Grenada as a Category 3 and killed 39 people.\n\nBeryl's emergence also marks an ominous start to the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season, which typically doesn't ramp up until late July or August.\n\nAnd experts agree that this could be one of the busiest hurricane seasons on record. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced in May that it expected eight to 13 hurricanes in the Atlantic, with four to seven of them classified as major hurricanes, meaning at least 111 mph winds.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yucat\u00e1n_Peninsula", "type": "loc",

It is expected to weaken further as it heads toward landfall early Friday on Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula, the US National Hurricane Center said.\n\nThe storm has left a trail of destruction across the Caribbean and the coast of Venezuela, killing at least seven people and bringing with it flash floods and mudslides.\n\nThe storm is the first since NHC records began to reach the Category 4 level in June and the earliest to reach Category 5 in July.\n\nIn the Cayman Islands, Acting Deputy Governor Eric Bush said there have been no calls for evacuations and expressed worry that some people were leaving their homes to film the storm, the Cayman Compass news website said.\n\nIn Jamaica, more than 400,000 people were without power, according to the Jamaica Gleaner newspaper, citing a public service company.\n\nMexican officials have scrambled to prepare, with the NHC warning Beryl will remain a hurricane until it makes landfall.\n\n\"We will have intense rains and wind gusts\" from Thursday, Civil Protection national coordinator Laura Velazquez said, announcing the deployment of hundreds of military personnel, marines and electricity workers in anticipation of damage.\n\nThe government has prepared 112 shelters with a capacity for around 20,000 people and suspended school in the state of Quintana Roo, where Beryl will likely hit.\n\nIn towns including the resort Tulum, public activities will be suspended starting at 4:00 pm Thursday. Velazquez urged people to report to the nearest shelter as the storm approaches.\n\nThe hurricane is expected to slam the Yucatan as a Category 1 hurricane, emerge over the Gulf of Mexico, then hit the northern state of Tamaulipas, which borders the United States.\n\nIt is extremely rare for such a powerful storm to form this early in the Atlantic hurricane season, which runs from early June to late November.\n\nWarm ocean temperatures are key for hurricanes, and North Atlantic waters are currently between two and five degrees Fahrenheit (1-3 degrees Celsius) warmer than normal, according to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).\n\nUN climate chief Simon Stiell, who has family on the island of Carriacou, said climate change was \"pushing disasters to record-breaking new levels of destruction.\"\n\n\"Disasters on a scale that used to be the stuff of science fiction are becoming meteorological facts, and the climate crisis is the chief culprit,\" he said Monday, reporting that his parents' property was damaged.\n\nbur-dw/mlm", "source": {"uri": "ktbs.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KTBS"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ivan_shaw@ktbs.com", "name":

Everything's gone. I'm in my house and scared,\" said Amoy Wellington, a 51-year-old cashier who lives in Top Hill, a rural farming community in Jamaica's southern St. Elizabeth parish. \"It's a disaster.\"\n\nAlmost 500 Jamaicans were in shelters by Wednesday afternoon, Prime Minister Andrew Holness told reporters, urging people in high-risk areas to move.\n\n\"We have not seen the worst of what could happen,\" Holness said. \"We can do as much as we can do, as (is) humanly possible, and we leave the rest in the hands of God.\"\n\nThe airports in the Jamaican capital, Kingston, and tourist-popular Montego Bay were closed throughout the day.\n\nThe loss of life and damage wrought by Beryl underscores the consequences of a warmer Atlantic Ocean, which scientists cite as a telltale sign of human-caused climate change fueling extreme weather that differs from past experience.\n\nRalph Gonsalves, prime minister of St. Vincent and the Grenadines, one of the hardest-hit areas in the eastern Caribbean, said in a radio interview that the country's Union Island was \"flattened\" by Beryl.\n\n\"Everybody is homeless ... It is going to be a Herculean effort to rebuild.\"\n\nSpeaking to state media, Nerissa Gittens-McMillan, permanent secretary at St. Vincent and the Grenadines' agriculture ministry, warned of possible food shortages after 50% of the country's plantain and banana crops were lost, with significant losses also to root crops and vegetables.\n\nIn Kingston, streets were quiet as anxious residents hunkered down after spending the morning stocking up on essential supplies.\n\nJamaicans braced for electricity cuts later on Wednesday, according to a power company official, with roads near the coast already washed out as steady rain continued to fall and winds picked up in the capital.\n\nIn St. Elizabeth, local politician Joseph Patterson said the power was out and the situation was \"getting gradually worse by the minute,\" with aggressive winds bringing down trees.\n\nBy Wednesday afternoon, the well-defined eye of the spiraling hurricane was located about 65 miles (105 km) southeast of Kingston, according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center (NHC), though its outer rings were already lashing much of the island with a population of nearly 3 million.\n\nBeryl is packing maximum sustained winds of 140 miles per hour (225 kph).\n\nThe force of the winds is expected to weaken somewhat in next day or two, according to the NHC, though it cautioned that Beryl will remain at or near major hurricane strength as it moves on to the Cayman Islands.\n\n\"Life-threatening flash flooding and mudslides from heavy rainfall are expected over much of Jamaica and southern Haiti through today,\" the NHC said in a post, adding that dangerous winds and storm surge are also expected in the Cayman Islands through early Thursday.\n\nThe center added that a hurricane warning was in effect for Jamaica, the Cayman Islands, as well as the eastern coast of Mexico's Yucatan peninsula, including for the country's top beach resort Cancun.\n\n'WE COULD NOT SLEEP'\n\nOvernight in Haiti as Beryl's impact grew progressively stronger, residents anxiously awaited its full impact.\n\n\"We were not comfortable. We could not sleep normally with the wind, the water. Many people slept in the yard,\" said Pouchon Jean-Francois, who lives in an improvised camp in Port-au-Prince.\n\nVenezuelan Vice President Delcy Rodriguez was injured as she surveyed an area south of Beryl on Tuesday night, where the Manzanares River in Sucre state burst its banks.\n\nPresident Nicolas Maduro confirmed the injuries caused by a falling tree to his second-in-command, along with head injuries suffered by senior officials accompanying her, after intense rainfall struck inland from the country's Caribbean coastline.\n\nOn Tuesday night, Maduro told state television that three people had died and four were missing in the area, along with more than 8,000 homes damaged by torrential rains, including at least 400 destroyed.\n\nThe unusually early hurricane strengthened at a record pace, which scientists argue is almost certainly fueled by climate change.\n\nBeryl is the 2024 Atlantic season's first hurricane and the earliest storm on record to reach the highest category on the Saffir-Simpson five-stage scale. The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has forecast a large number of major hurricanes in an \"extraordinary\" season this year.\n\nAdditional confirmed fatalities so far include at least three in St. Vincent and the Grenadines, a senior official told Reuters, where Union Island has suffered severe destruction of over 90% of buildings.\n\nIn Grenada, Prime Minister Dickon Mitchell described \"Armageddon-like\" conditions with no power and widespread destruction, while also confirming three deaths.\n\nBeyond near-term impact in Jamaica and Haiti, the NHC warned that Beryl will likely make landfall on Mexico's Yucatan peninsula as early as Thursday night.\n\nIn Cancun, officials said supplies of wooden boards used to protect doors and windows were dwindling as locals and tourists prepared for Beryl's arrival.\n\nLaura Velazquez, head of Mexico's civil protection agency, encouraged tourists in Cancun and nearby Tulum to hunker down in hotel basements once the hurricane approaches, in comments to local broadcaster Milenio.", "source": {"uri": "indiatoday.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "India Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Everything's gone. I'm in my house and scared,\" said Amoy Wellington, a 51-year-old cashier who lives in a rural farming community in southern St. Elizabeth parish. \"It's a disaster.\"\n\nBeryl moved away from Jamaica early on Thursday. At around 0900 GMT, the hurricane, now a Category 3 storm, was 55 miles (90 km) from Grand Cayman and about 440 miles (700 km) off Tulum, Mexico, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said.\n\nBeryl was carrying top winds of 130 mph (209 kph), and was expected to dump 4-6 inches (10-15 cm) of rain on the Cayman Islands, where life-threatening surf and rip currents were possible, the NHC said.\n\nA hurricane warning was in force for the Cayman Islands east coast of Mexico's Yucatan peninsula.\n\nMexico's tourist centres of Cancun and the wider Yucatan peninsula lie in Beryl's predicted path. Cancun's airport was thronged with tourists hoping to catch last flights out before the storm arrives. Workers filled bags with sand and boarded up doors and windows of businesses for protection.\n\nMexico's defense ministry opened around 120 storm shelters, and asked visitors to heed instructions on evacuation or other measures.\n\nBeryl is the 2024 Atlantic season's first hurricane and at its peak earlier this week was the earliest Category 5 storm on record. A Category 5 hurricane brings winds of 157 mph (252 kph) or higher, capable of causing catastrophic damage including the destruction of homes and infrastructure.\n\nJAMAICA AND SMALL ISLANDS\n\nIn Jamaica the island's main airports were closed and streets were mostly empty after Prime Minister Andrew Holness issued a curfew for Wednesday, which was extended to Thursday as storm conditions continued. At least one person was reported killed in the storm.\n\nNearly 1,000 people were in shelters by Wednesday evening, Richard Thompson, acting director general at Jamaica's disaster agency said in an interview on local news.\n\nThe storm hit St. Vincent and the Grenadines earlier in the week. Prime Minister Ralph Gonsalves said in a radio interview that Union Island was \"flattened\" and it would \"be a Herculean effort to rebuild.\"\n\nThere were at least three confirmed fatalities and crop damage was widespread, senior officials told Reuters.

Winds gusted as high as 81 mph at Norman Manley International Airport on a peninsula south of the country's capital city, Kingston, Wednesday afternoon. On Beryl's eastern flank, bands of rain continue to wrap into parts of Haiti, which could result in flooding and mudslides.\n\nWednesday afternoon, the National Hurricane Center reported Beryl was located at 17.5\u00b0N 77.9\u00b0W and was moving west-northwest at 20 mph. Maximum sustained winds were 140 mph.\n\nBeryl Forecast Track - 7/3/24\n\nHurricane Beryl Forecast Track on July 3, 2024 (CREDIT: The Weather Channel)\n\nBeryl is the earliest hurricane to reach Category 5 strength on record in the Atlantic, and it beat the previous record by more than two weeks. The previous earliest Category 5 was Hurricane Emily on July 16 during the hyperactive 2005 Atlantic hurricane season. Record warm water temperature have likely catapulted Beryl's intensity.\n\nBeryl will take a west-northwest track in the Caribbean Sea through the rest of this week. Although the hurricane will eventually lose intensity because of increasingly hostile wind shear, it will still pose a considerable danger. Here's the general timeline:\n\nThrough Wednesday Night: Beryl will continue to lash Jamaica with potentially devastating winds, especially over mountainous terrain, and life-threatening storm surge flooding that could reach 6 to 9 feet above normal tide levels where winds blow onshore on the coast into the evening. Torrential rainfall could last through the overnight hours, triggering flash flooding and landslides in Jamaica. This is the strongest hurricane to strike Jamaica in almost 17 years, since Hurricane Dean in 2007.Wednesday Night and Early Thursday: Beryl will make its closest approach to the Cayman Islands, particularly Grand Cayman, with storm surge flooding, high winds, and heavy rain.Thursday Night and Friday: While conditions will deteriorate Thursday night, Beryl is expected to make a landfall as a hurricane in Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula, anywhere from the Belize border and Costa Maya to Cozumel. Storm surge flooding, potentially damaging winds and flooding rain are all possible. Heavy rain and strong wind gusts will continue in the Yucatan Peninsula through Friday.\n\nBeryl is likely to emerge in the southwest Gulf of Mexico this weekend after being steered by a heat dome of high pressure over the Southeast U.S. There is considerable uncertainty in Beryl's future after that.\n\nThat Southeast U.S. upper-level heat dome is expected to both weaken and retreat off the Southeast coast, leaving a gap between that and a western U.S. heat dome.\n\nBecause of that, some computer forecast models are suggesting Beryl could eventually curl more toward the northwest or north in the western Gulf of Mexico. That opens the door to a track anywhere from eastern Mexico's Gulf Coast to Texas early next week.\n\nBeryl should have lost strength by the time it reaches the southwest Gulf because of wind shear and land interaction, however it could still bring significant impacts to the Gulf Coast as either a tropical storm or hurricane. Some restrengthening is possible.\n\nCLICK HERE for more.", "source": {"uri": "kadn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KADN News 15"}, "authors": [{"uri": "weather_channel@kadn.com", "name": "Weather

Apart from that, it's mainly concrete so there's not much we can do,\" Brown told the Jamaica Observer newspaper.\n\nAs of Wednesday night, Beryl was packing maximum sustained winds of 130 mph (215 kph), said the NHC.\n\n- 'No communication' -\n\nBeryl has already left a trail of death with at least three people killed in Grenada, where the storm made landfall Monday, as well as one in St Vincent and the Grenadines and three in Venezuela.\n\nRalph Gonsalves, prime minister of St Vincent and the Grenadines, said that it would take a \"herculean effort\" to rebuild after the substantial destruction and that \"90-odd percent of the houses were blown away\" on Union Island.\n\n\"Most of the country doesn't have electricity, and more than half without water at the moment,\" he said.\n\nGrenada's Prime Minister Dickon Mitchell said the island of Carriacou, which was struck by the eye of the storm, has been all but cut off, with houses, telecommunications and fuel facilities there flattened.\n\nThe 13.5-square mile (35-square kilometer) island is home to around 9,000 people. At least two people there died, Mitchell said, with a third killed on the country's main island of Grenada when a tree fell on a house.\n\nIn St Vincent and the Grenadines, one person on the island of Bequia was reported dead from the storm, while a man died in Venezuela's northeastern coastal state of Sucre when he was swept away by a flooded river, officials there said.\n\n- Climate change -\n\nIt is extremely rare for such a powerful storm to form this early in the Atlantic hurricane season, which runs from early June to late November.\n\nWarm ocean temperatures are key for hurricanes, and North Atlantic waters are currently between two and five degrees Fahrenheit (1-3 degrees Celsius) warmer than normal, according to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).\n\nUN climate chief Simon Stiell, who has family on the island of Carriacou, said climate change was \"pushing disasters to record-breaking new levels of destruction.\"\n\n\"Disasters on a scale that used to be the stuff of science fiction are becoming meteorological facts, and the climate crisis is the chief culprit,\" he said Monday, reporting that his parents' property was damaged.\n\nbur-dw-bfm/dhw\n\nMore from this section\n\nCenterpoint Appoints Galen Baggs as New Chief Operating Officer\n\nSuper Incubator: Hatching Pok\u00e9mon Eggs without Walking or Moving at the

Everything's gone. I'm in my house and scared,\" said Amoy Wellington, a 51-year-old cashier who lives in Top Hill, a rural farming community in Jamaica's southern St. Elizabeth parish. \"It's a disaster.\"\n\nAlmost 500 Jamaicans were in shelters by Wednesday afternoon, Prime Minister Andrew Holness told reporters, urging people in high-risk areas to move.\n\nALSO READ: La Nina threatens Latin America with hurricanes and droughts, experts say\n\n\"We have not seen the worst of what could happen,\" Holness said. \"We can do as much as we can do, as (is) humanly possible, and we leave the rest in the hands of God.\"\n\nThe airports in the Jamaican capital, Kingston, and tourist-popular Montego Bay were closed throughout the day.\n\nThe loss of life and damage wrought by Beryl underscores the consequences of a warmer Atlantic Ocean, which scientists cite as a telltale sign of human-caused climate change fueling extreme weather that differs from past experience.\n\nRalph Gonsalves, prime minister of St. Vincent and the Grenadines, one of the hardest-hit areas in the eastern Caribbean, said in a radio interview that the country's Union Island was \"flattened\" by Beryl.\n\n\"Everybody is homeless ... It is going to be a Herculean effort to rebuild.\"\n\nSpeaking to state media, Nerissa Gittens-McMillan, permanent secretary at St. Vincent and the Grenadines' agriculture ministry, warned of possible food shortages after 50 percent of the country's plantain and banana crops were lost, with significant losses also to root crops and vegetables.\n\nIn Kingston, streets were quiet as anxious residents hunkered down after spending the morning stocking up on essential supplies.\n\nJamaicans braced for electricity cuts later on Wednesday, according to a power company official, with roads near the coast already washed out as steady rain continued to fall and winds picked up in the capital.\n\nIn St. Elizabeth, local politician Joseph Patterson said the power was out and the situation was \"getting gradually worse by the minute,\" with aggressive winds bringing down trees.\n\nBy Wednesday afternoon, the well-defined eye of the spiraling hurricane was located about 105 km southeast of Kingston, according to the US National Hurricane Center (NHC), though its outer rings were already lashing much of the island with a population of nearly 3 million.\n\nBeryl is packing maximum sustained winds of 225 kph.\n\nALSO READ: Hurricane Beryl, churning toward Jamaica, threatens Haiti & Dominican Republic\n\nThe force of the winds is expected to weaken somewhat in next day or two, according to the NHC, though it cautioned that Beryl will remain at or near major hurricane strength as it moves on to the Cayman Islands.\n\n\"Life-threatening flash flooding and mudslides from heavy rainfall are expected over much of Jamaica and southern Haiti through today,\" the NHC said in a post, adding that dangerous winds and storm surge are also expected in the Cayman Islands through early Thursday.\n\nThe center added that a hurricane warning was in effect for Jamaica, the Cayman Islands, as well as the eastern coast of Mexico's Yucatan peninsula, including for the country's top beach resort Cancun.\n\n'We could not sleep'\n\nOvernight in Haiti as Beryl's impact grew progressively stronger, residents anxiously awaited its full impact.\n\n\"We were not comfortable. We could not sleep normally with the wind, the water. Many people slept in the yard,\" said Pouchon Jean-Francois, who lives in an improvised camp in Port-au-Prince.\n\nVenezuelan Vice-President Delcy Rodriguez was injured as she surveyed an area south of Beryl on Tuesday night, where the Manzanares River in Sucre state burst its banks.\n\nPresident Nicolas Maduro confirmed the injuries caused by a falling tree to his second-in-command, along with head injuries suffered by senior officials accompanying her, after intense rainfall struck inland from the country's Caribbean coastline.\n\nOn Tuesday night, Maduro told state television that three people had died and four were missing in the area, along with more than 8,000 homes damaged by torrential rains, including at least 400 destroyed.\n\nThe unusually early hurricane strengthened at a record pace, which scientists argue is almost certainly fueled by climate change.\n\nBeryl is the 2024 Atlantic season's first hurricane and the earliest storm on record to reach the highest category on the Saffir-Simpson five-stage scale. The US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has forecast a large number of major hurricanes in an \"extraordinary\" season this year.\n\nAdditional confirmed fatalities so far include at least three in St. Vincent and the Grenadines, a senior official told Reuters, where Union Island has suffered severe destruction of over 90 percent of buildings.\n\nIn Grenada, Prime Minister Dickon Mitchell described \"Armageddon-like\" conditions with no power and widespread destruction, while also confirming three deaths.\n\nBeyond near-term impact in Jamaica and Haiti, the NHC warned that Beryl will likely make landfall on Mexico's Yucatan peninsula as early as Thursday night.\n\nIn Cancun, officials said supplies of wooden boards used to protect doors and windows were dwindling as locals and tourists prepared for Beryl's arrival.\n\nLaura Velazquez, head of Mexico's civil protection agency, encouraged tourists in Cancun and nearby Tulum to hunker down in hotel basements once the hurricane approaches, in comments to local broadcaster Milenio.", "source": {"uri": "chinadailyasia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "China Daily Asia"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

It is expected to make landfall just south of Tulum on Friday morning around 5 a.m. ET.\n\nMORE: Record warm ocean temperatures allowed Hurricane Beryl to become the earliest Category 5 Atlantic storm\n\nBy Friday evening, Beryl should cross into the southern Gulf of Mexico and weaken into a tropical storm.\n\nAs Beryl moves over the Gulf, in the direction of the U.S.-Mexico border, it could re-intensify back into a hurricane, with winds near 75 mph ahead of landfall sometime Monday morning. Right now, it's too soon to tell exactly where it will make landfall along the Gulf Coast, with models predicting just south of the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nRegardless of Beryl's strength, it is expected to bring heavy rain to southern Texas and could produce coastal flooding on the Texas Gulf Coast, from Galveston to South Padre Island, and the Florida Panhandle.\n\nIn addition, the prolonged period of onshore winds along the U.S. Gulf Coast could create rough beach conditions, including a risk for rip currents this holiday weekend.\n\nJamaica assessing damage\n\nDamage has been reported in southern Jamaica after Beryl battered the island.\n\nAt the height of the storm, hundreds of thousands -- about 65% -- of customers were without power. Jamaica Public Service said teams are making remote assessments and waiting on an all-clear from emergency management to make ground assessments and begin the restoration process.\n\nOne of the main cell providers in Jamaica -- Digicel -- has been down since the overnight hours and is working on network restoration.\n\nThe island's three major airports closed on Tuesday as the storm approached, stranding travelers. Sangster International Airport in Montego Bay said it will reopen at 6 p.m. local time Thursday. Guards at the airport told ABC News the facility sustained some damage.\n\nNorman Manley International Airport in Kingston said it plans to reopen Friday at 5 a.m. local time. It saw some minor damage from the storm, including a small section of the roof of the passenger boarding pier that blew off.\n\nIt is unclear when Ian Fleming International Airport in Ocho Rios will reopen.\n\nABC News' Faith Abubey contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [{"uri": "max_golembo@yahoo.com", "name": "Max

Reuters\n\nHurricane Beryl barrelled toward Jamaica as a powerful Category 4 storm on Wednesday, after flattening homes and devastating agriculture on smaller islands in the eastern Caribbean, killing at least three people.\n\nAt around 0500 EDT (0900 GMT), the hurricane was about 300 km east-southeast of the Jamaican capital of Kingston, according the US National Hurricane Center (NHC), packing maximum sustained winds of 230 kmph.\n\n\"Beryl is expected to bring life-threatening winds and storm surge to Jamaica on Wednesday and the Cayman Islands on Wednesday night and Thursday,\" NHC said in an advisory. A hurricane warning is in effect for both places.\n\nHurricane conditions are expected to reach the coast of Jamaica about midday local time, with tropical storm-strength winds from late morning, making outside preparations difficult or dangerous, it said.\n\nIn the capital Kingston, cars queued at petrol stations as people filled additional containers with fuel. Residents stocked up on water and other essential supplies and boarded up shops and houses.\n\n\"Yeah right now (we're) worrying about the storm. You know it's Category 5 and in Jamaica people are worried and always shopping and buying things as in this store,\" Andre, a salesperson in a local store said, without giving his full name. The unusually early hurricane, whose rapid strengthening scientists said was likely fuelled by human-caused climate change, is expected to still be a hurricane when it passes near Jamaica and the Cayman Islands later this week.\n\nBeryl, the 2024 Atlantic season's first hurricane and the earliest storm on record to reach the highest category on the Saffir-Simpson Scale, felled power lines and unleashed flash floods across smaller islands.\n\nThe storm hit St. Vincent and the Grenadines especially hard, according to Prime Minister Ralph Gonsalves.\n\n\"The hurricane has come and gone, and it has left in its wake immense destruction,\" he said. On one island in the Grenadines archipelago, Union Island, 90 per cent of homes had been \"severely damaged or destroyed\", he said. The Prime Minister confirmed one death.\n\nIn a briefing on Tuesday, Grenada's Prime Minister, Dickon Mitchell, said Carriacou and Petite Martinique, two of the three islands that make up the country,

The outer bands lashed the Caribbean island nation Wednesday morning before the eyewall brushed the south coast of Jamaica in the mid-afternoon. Beryl was a Category 4 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 140 mph at the time.\n\nThe storm was projected to pound Jamaica with 4 to 8 inches of rain with localized amounts of 12 inches. Storm trackers captured waves up to 25 feet as Beryl made its way to Jamaica, which has a population of 3 million people. The center was 45 miles from the capital city of Kingston by mid-afternoon. One woman died after a tree fell on her home, said Richard Thompson, acting director general at Jamaica's disaster agency. He also said nearly 1,000 residents were in shelters by Wednesday evening.\n\nBeryl made history by becoming the earliest category 4 and 5 hurricane on record and developed from a tropical storm into a major hurricane (winds of 111 mph or higher) in just over 12 hours.

Everything's gone. I'm in my house and scared,\" said Amoy Wellington, a 51-year-old cashier who lives in Top Hill, a rural farming community in Jamaica's southern St. Elizabeth parish. \"It's a disaster.\"\n\nAlmost 500 Jamaicans were in shelters by Wednesday afternoon, Prime Minister Andrew Holness told reporters, urging people in high-risk areas to move.\n\n\"We have not seen the worst of what could happen,\" Holness said. \"We can do as much as we can do, as (is) humanly possible, and we leave the rest in the hands of God.\"\n\nThe airports in the Jamaican capital, Kingston, and tourist-popular Montego Bay were closed throughout the day.\n\nThe loss of life and damage wrought by Beryl underscores the consequences of a warmer Atlantic Ocean, which scientists cite as a telltale sign of human-caused climate change fueling extreme weather that differs from past experience.\n\nRalph Gonsalves, prime minister of St. Vincent and the Grenadines, one of the hardest-hit areas in the eastern Caribbean, said in a radio interview that the country's Union Island was \"flattened\" by Beryl.\n\n\"Everybody is homeless ... It is going to be a Herculean effort to rebuild.\"\n\nSpeaking to state media, Nerissa Gittens-McMillan, permanent secretary at St. Vincent and the Grenadines' agriculture ministry, warned of possible food shortages after 50% of the country's plantain and banana crops were lost, with significant losses also to root crops and vegetables.\n\nIn Kingston, streets were quiet as anxious residents hunkered down after spending the morning stocking up on essential supplies.\n\nJamaicans braced for electricity cuts later on Wednesday, according to a power company official, with roads near the coast already washed out as steady rain continued to fall and winds picked up in the capital.\n\nIn St. Elizabeth, local politician Joseph Patterson said the power was out and the situation was \"getting gradually worse by the minute,\" with aggressive winds bringing down trees.\n\nBy Wednesday afternoon, the well-defined eye of the spiraling hurricane was located about 65 miles (105 km) southeast of Kingston, according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center (NHC), though its outer rings were already lashing much of the island with a population of nearly 3 million.\n\nBeryl is packing maximum sustained winds of 140 miles per hour (225 kph).\n\nThe force of the winds is expected to weaken somewhat in next day or two, according to the NHC, though it cautioned that Beryl will remain at or near major hurricane strength as it moves on to the Cayman Islands.\n\n\"Life-threatening flash flooding and mudslides from heavy rainfall are expected over much of Jamaica and southern Haiti through today,\" the NHC said in a post, adding that dangerous winds and storm surge are also expected in the Cayman Islands through early Thursday.\n\nThe center added that a hurricane warning was in effect for Jamaica, the Cayman Islands, as well as the eastern coast of Mexico's Yucatan peninsula, including for the country's top beach resort Cancun.\n\n'We could not sleep'\n\nOvernight in Haiti as Beryl's impact grew progressively stronger, residents anxiously awaited its full impact.\n\n\"We were not comfortable. We could not sleep normally with the wind, the water. Many people slept in the yard,\" said Pouchon Jean-Francois, who lives in an improvised camp in Port-au-Prince.\n\nVenezuelan Vice President Delcy Rodriguez was injured as she surveyed an area south of Beryl on Tuesday night, where the Manzanares River in Sucre state burst its banks.\n\nPresident Nicolas Maduro confirmed the injuries caused by a falling tree to his second-in-command, along with head injuries suffered by senior officials accompanying her, after intense rainfall struck inland from the country's Caribbean coastline.\n\nOn Tuesday night, Maduro told state television that three people had died and four were missing in the area, along with more than 8,000 homes damaged by torrential rains, including at least 400 destroyed.\n\nThe unusually early hurricane strengthened at a record pace, which scientists argue is almost certainly fueled by climate change.\n\nBeryl is the 2024 Atlantic season's first hurricane and the earliest storm on record to reach the highest category on the Saffir-Simpson five-stage scale. The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has forecast a large number of major hurricanes in an \"extraordinary\" season this year.\n\nAdditional confirmed fatalities so far include at least three in St. Vincent and the Grenadines, a senior official told Reuters, where Union Island has suffered severe destruction of over 90% of buildings.\n\nIn Grenada, Prime Minister Dickon Mitchell described \"Armageddon-like\" conditions with no power and widespread destruction, while also confirming three deaths.\n\nBeyond near-term impact in Jamaica and Haiti, the NHC warned that Beryl will likely make landfall on Mexico's Yucatan peninsula as early as Thursday night.\n\nIn Cancun, officials said supplies of wooden boards used to protect doors and windows were dwindling as locals and tourists prepared for Beryl's arrival.\n\nLaura Velazquez, head of Mexico's civil protection agency, encouraged tourists in Cancun and nearby Tulum to hunker down in hotel basements once the hurricane approaches, in comments to local broadcaster Milenio.\n\nReuters", "source": {"uri": "newshub.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newshub"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The historic hurricane, however, has only weakened slightly, packing a 140 mph punch and already being blamed for seven deaths in other countries.\n\nJamaican officials, as a result, pleaded with residents to take the storm seriously -urging evacuations as storm surges make flooding possible. As of writing, no deaths have been reported there, the storm's path remains somewhat uncertain.\n\nThe Americas, however, appears to be the storm's next stop, weather officials said - with either Mexico or Texas set to be hit next within the next 48 hours, by an even stronger version of the storm that's already killed at least seven.\n\n'Hurricane Beryl has so far brought a lot of water,' Jamaica Prime Minister Andrew Holness wrote in a post to X just after 6pm ET.\n\n'Please stay as safe as you can and remember to use the emergency contacts if you need them.'\n\nHours earlier, the National Hurricane Center issued its own update, as nine-foot waves were seen barreling into Jamaica's southern seaboard.\n\nIt advertised a still-ongoing Hurricane Warning, 'in effect for Jamaica, Grand Cayman, Little Cayman and Cayman Brac, and the coast of the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico from Puerto Costa Maya to Cancun.'\n\nA less severe Hurricane Watch, meanwhile, was issued for the coast of the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico south of Puerto Costa Maya to Chetumal, and the coast of the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico north of Cancun to Cabo Catoche.\n\nA Hurricane Warning refers to when hurricane conditions are expected somewhere within the warning area, while a Hurricane Watch means that hurricane conditions are possible within an area, generally within 48 hours.\n\nFor the former, 'preparations to protect life and property should be rushed to completion,' the hurricane center said.\n\nNational Hurricane Center Director Michael Brennan added how storm surges of 6 to 9 feet above normal are expected, as the counterclockwise-rotating storm pushes water onto Jamaica's coast Wednesday night.\n\nThe storm is currently moving west, where it may strike the southern part of Mexico before potentially engaging in a rare double strike of the country by passing over its eponymous gulf and toward more northern cities like Monterrey.\n\nThat said, Beryl's path remains unpredictable, and state authorities in Texas are warning people - particularly in coastal areas - about the prospect of a July 4 hurricane or tropical storm.\n\n'While Texans take time to enjoy the holiday weekend with family and friends, it's important to stay weather aware, pay close attention to the rapidly-changing forecasts,' Texas Emergency Management Chief Nim Kidd said in a statement.\n\n'[D]on't be caught without an emergency plan.'\n\n'If I lived in Texas, and I have lived in Texas, this would be a storm that I would be watching closely,' FOX Weather Meteorologist Britta Merwin added.\n\n'The possible impacts would be Sunday into Monday.'\n\nAs of writing, the southern state seems more set be spared, with Mexico the more likely candidate.\n\nBut Texas Gov. Greg Abbott on Wednesday still told the state's Division of Emergency Management to issue a hurricane advisory notice to the Texas Emergency Management Council.\n\n'Texas stands ready to deploy all available resources and support to our coastal communities,' the Republican said, urging Texans to be ready for the still-real prospect the tropical weather will reach the US's Gulf Coast.\n\nIn Jamaica, though, extensive damage already appears unavoidable, with the storm then projected to cross the Yucatan Peninsula sometime Friday.\n\nBy then, it will against strengthen into a Category 5, officials said - after it had already achieved that status Monday.\n\nThere, it will move into the Gulf of Mexico, before slamming into either Mexico or southern Texas, weather officials said.\n\nAs of 5pm Wednesday, the hurricane's center had already passed through the capital Kingston, still some 265 miles from Grand Cayman, as the storm moved past the country.\n\nIt is currently moving west-northwest at speeds of around 20mph, while the winds whipping around insight of it are around seven times faster.\n\n'The Cayman Islands are sort of next in line for seeing significant impacts,' Brennan on Wednesday added, after some slight weakening occurred as the storm approached Jamaica earlier in the day.\n\nAuthorities at the time made it clear how the storm was a major weather event that should be taken seriously, with Prime Minister Holness telling those in low-lying areas and areas historically prone to flooding and landslide to evacuate.\n\nHe further urged those living on the banks of a river to either 'evacuate to a shelter or to safer ground,' hours before the storm made landfall.\n\nPeople proceeded to board up windows, and fishermen pulled their boats out of the surrounding water.\n\nWorkers, meanwhile, worked to dismantle roadside advertising boards to protect them from the lashing winds, just before wind-whipped rains plowed into the island for several hours.\n\nPower was knocked out in much of the capital, but by the evening, the storm had glanced off the island and continued making its way toward the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nIn an ensuing social media post, Prime Minister Holness revealed that nearly 500 Jamaicans had been placed in shelters.\n\n'We are placing emphasis on ensuring they are comfortable and well looked after,' he said.\n\nEarlier in the day, as churning whitecaps brought by Beryl's eye scraped by the island's southern coast, Jon Porter, chief meteorologist at AccuWeather, issued a statement citing the dangerous nature of the storm\n\n'We are very concerned about a wide variety of life threatening impacts in Jamaica,\" he said, before branding Beryl 'the strongest and most dangerous hurricane threat that Jamaica has faced, probably, in decades.'\n\nAs a result Jamaica was under a state of emergency, and afterward was declared a disaster zone hours before the impact.\n\nHolness says the disaster zone declaration will remain for the next seven days, as he implemented an island-wide curfew.\n\nThe hours for the restrictions were between 6 am and 6 pm, and were in effect only Wednesday.\n\nThe curfew has since passed, with officials now surveying the damage.\n\nOn Monday, Beryl strengthened to a Category 5 hurricane for the first time, and by early Tuesday it was creating record-breaking 165 mph maximum sustained winds.\n\nThe small island nation of St. Vincent and the Grenadines were among those hit, with at least one person dead and more casualties likely as officials continue to probe flooded areas and wreckage.\n\nIn Grenada, at least three people have died, after Prime Minister Dickon Mitchell said a unspecified number of homes had been destroyed by the \"Armageddon-like\" storm.\n\nVenezuela was also hit by heavy flooding that caused the deaths of at least, as four more remain missing as a result of the storm, the country's president, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, said.\n\nIn total, at least seven people are known to have died as a result of the storm's path.", "source": {"uri": "internewscast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Internewscast Journal"}, "authors": [],

Everything's gone. I'm in my house and scared,\" said Amoy Wellington, a 51-year-old cashier who lives in Top Hill, a rural farming community in Jamaica's southern St. Elizabeth parish. \"It's a disaster.\"\n\nAlmost 500 Jamaicans were in shelters by Wednesday afternoon, Prime Minister Andrew Holness told reporters, urging people in high-risk areas to move.\n\n\"We have not seen the worst of what could happen,\" Mr Holness said. \"We can do as much as we can do, as (is) humanly possible, and we leave the rest in the hands of God.\"\n\nThe airports in the Jamaican capital, Kingston, and tourist-popular Montego Bay were closed throughout the day.\n\nThe loss of life and damage wrought by Beryl underscores the consequences of a warmer Atlantic Ocean, which scientists cite as a telltale sign of human-caused climate change fuelling extreme weather that differs from past experience.\n\nRalph Gonsalves, prime minister of St. Vincent and the Grenadines, one of the hardest-hit areas in the eastern Caribbean, said in a radio interview that the country's Union Island was \"flattened\" by Beryl.\n\n\"Everybody is homeless ... It is going to be a Herculean effort to rebuild,\" he added.\n\nSpeaking to state media, Nerissa Gittens-McMillan, permanent secretary at St. Vincent and the Grenadines' agriculture ministry, warned of possible food shortages after 50% of the country's plantain and banana crops were lost, with significant losses also to root crops and vegetables.\n\nIn Kingston, streets were quiet as anxious residents hunkered down after spending the morning stocking up on essential supplies.\n\nJamaicans braced for electricity cuts, according to a power company official, with roads near the coastal ready washed out as steady rain continued to fall and winds picked up in the capital.\n\nIn St. Elizabeth, local politician Joseph Patterson said the power was out and the situation was \"getting gradually worse by the minute,\" with aggressive winds bringing down trees.\n\nBy Wednesday afternoon, the well-defined eye of the spiralling hurricane was located about 105km southeast of Kingston, according to the US National Hurricane Centre (NHC), though its outer rings were already lashing much of the island with a population of nearly 3 million.\n\nBeryl is packing maximum sustained winds of 225km/h.\n\nThe force of the winds is expected to weaken somewhat in next day or two, according to the NHC, though it cautioned that Beryl will remain at or near major hurricane strength as it moves on to the Cayman Islands.\n\n\"Life-threatening flash flooding and mudslides from heavy rainfall are expected over much of Jamaica and southern Haiti through today,\" the NHC said in a post, adding that dangerous winds and storm surge are also expected in the Cayman Islands through early Thursday.\n\nThe centre added that a hurricane warning was in effect for Jamaica, the Cayman Islands, as well as the eastern coast of Mexico's Yucatan peninsula, including for the country's top beach resort Cancun.\n\nOvernight in Haiti as Beryl's impact grew progressively stronger, residents anxiously awaited its full impact.\n\n\"We were not comfortable. We could not sleep normally with the wind, the water. Many people slept in the yard,\" said Pouchon Jean-Francois, who lives in an improvised camp in Port-au-Prince.\n\nVenezuelan Vice President Delcy Rodriguez was injured as she surveyed an area south of Beryl, where the Manzanares River in Sucre state burst its banks.\n\nPresident Nicolas Maduro confirmed the injuries caused by a falling tree to his second-in-command, along with head injuries suffered by senior officials accompanying her, after intense rainfall struck inland from the country's Caribbean coastline.\n\nOn Tuesday night, Mr Maduro told state television that three people had died and four were missing in the area, along with more than 8,000 homes damaged by torrential rains, including at least 400 destroyed.\n\nThe unusually early hurricane strengthened at a record pace, which scientists argue is almost certainly fuelled by climate change.\n\nBeryl is the 2024 Atlantic season's first hurricane and the earliest storm on record to reach the highest category on the Saffir-Simpson five-stage scale. The US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has forecast a large number of major hurricanes in an \"extraordinary\" season this year.\n\nAdditional confirmed fatalities so far include at least three in St. Vincent and the Grenadines, a senior official told Reuters, where Union Island has suffered severe destruction of over 90% of buildings.\n\nIn Grenada, Prime Minister Dickon Mitchell described \"Armageddon-like\" conditions with no power and widespread destruction, while also confirming three deaths.\n\nBeyond near-term impact in Jamaica and Haiti, the NHC warned that Beryl will likely make landfall on Mexico's Yucatan peninsula as early as Thursday night.\n\nIn Cancun, officials said supplies of wooden boards used to protect doors and windows were dwindling as locals and tourists prepared for Beryl's arrival.\n\nLaura Velazquez, head of Mexico's civil protection agency, encouraged tourists in Cancun and nearby Tulum to hunker down in hotel basements once the hurricane approaches, in comments to local broadcaster Milenio.", "source": {"uri": "rte.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "RTE.ie"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Apart from that, it's mainly concrete so there's not much we can do,\" Brown told the Jamaica Observer newspaper.\n\nAs of Wednesday night, Beryl was packing maximum sustained winds of 130 mph (215 kph), said the NHC.\n\nAt least three people were killed in Grenada, where the storm made landfall Monday, as well as one in St Vincent and the Grenadines and three in Venezuela.\n\nRalph Gonsalves, prime minister of St Vincent and the Grenadines, said that it would take a \"herculean effort\" to rebuild after the substantial destruction and that \"90-odd per cent of the houses were blown away\" on Union Island.\n\n\"Most of the country doesn't have electricity, and more than half without water at the moment,\" he said.\n\nDickon Mitchell, Grenada's prime minister, said the island of Carriacou, which was struck by the eye of the storm, has been all but cut off, with houses, telecommunications and fuel facilities there flattened.\n\nThe 13.5-square mile (35-square km) island is home to around 9,000 people. At least two people died, Mitchell said, with a third killed in Grenada when a tree fell on a house.\n\nIn St Vincent and the Grenadines, one person on the island of Bequia was reported dead from the storm, while a man died in Venezuela's northeastern coastal state of Sucre when he was swept away by a flooded river, officials there said.\n\nIt is extremely rare for such a powerful storm to form this early in the Atlantic hurricane season, which runs from early June to late November.\n\nWarm ocean temperatures are key for hurricanes, and North Atlantic waters are currently between two and five degrees Fahrenheit (1-3 degrees Celsius) warmer than normal, according to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).\n\nUN climate chief Simon Stiell, who has family on the island of Carriacou, said climate change was \"pushing disasters to record-breaking new levels of destruction.\"\n\n\"Disasters on a scale that used to be the stuff of science fiction are becoming meteorological facts, and the climate crisis is the chief culprit,\" he said Monday, reporting that his parents' property was damaged.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Now, the storm maintains its strength as it barrels past the Cayman Islands and heads toward Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula.\n\nAccording to the National Hurricane Center's 11 a.m. update, the center of Beryl is expected to move past the Cayman Islands on Thursday afternoon, bringing \"strong winds, dangerous storm surge, and damaging waves\" to the Yucatan Peninsula's coast early Friday. The hurricane, downgraded to a Category 3 early Thursday, had winds of 115 mph when it was about 95 miles west-southwest of Grand Cayman.\n\nThe Cayman Islands can expect up to six inches of rain on Thursday, while the Yucatan Peninsula could see up to 10 inches, potentially causing flash flooding.\n\nStorm surge warnings indicate water levels could rise by 2 to 4 feet along the Cayman Islands' immediate coast and 3 to 5 feet on the Yucatan's east coast, accompanied by \"large and destructive waves.\" Weather officials caution that Beryl will likely bring life-threatening surf and rip currents to the coasts of Jamaica, Cuba, and the Cayman Islands, with these dangers spreading to the Yucatan Peninsula and parts of Central America by Thursday and then to eastern Mexico and the U.S. Gulf Coast by late Friday.\n\nAs hurricane conditions subside in the Cayman Islands, tropical storm-strength winds are expected in the Yucatan Peninsula on Thursday. This will make outdoor preparations hazardous ahead of the storm's anticipated arrival later in the day or by early Friday.\n\nA hurricane warning is in effect for the Cayman Islands and the coast of the Yucatan Peninsula from Puerto Costa Maya to Cancun, including Cozumel. While Beryl is forecasted to weaken over the next two days, it is still projected to be near hurricane intensity when passing by the Cayman Islands on Thursday and heading toward the Yucatan Peninsula later in the day.\n\nJamaica experienced widespread power outages after Beryl brushed the island's southern coast on Wednesday as a Category 4 storm. The hurricane's destructive winds and rain have left a trail of devastation.\n\nOfficials confirmed that nine people were killed in Grenada, Venezuela, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines, according to Reuters. Jamaica's Prime Minister Andrew Holness told CNN on Thursday that two deaths have been registered in Jamaica due to Hurricane Beryl.\n\nA hurricane watch and tropical storm warning remain in effect for parts of the Yucatan Peninsula's coast.

Everything's gone. I'm in my house and scared,\" said Amoy Wellington, a 51-year-old cashier who lives in Top Hill, a rural farming community in Jamaica's southern St. Elizabeth parish. \"It's a disaster.\"\n\nA woman died in Jamaica's Hanover parish after a tree fell on her home, Richard Thompson, acting director general at Jamaica's disaster agency said in an interview on local news.\n\nNearly a thousand Jamaicans were in shelters by last evening, Thompson added.\n\nThe island's main airports were closed and streets were mostly empty after Prime Minister Andrew Holness issued a nationwide curfew for yesterday.\n\n\"We can do as much as we can do, as (is) humanly possible, and we leave the rest in the hands of God,\" Holness said earlier yesterday, urging residents in vulnerable areas to evacuate.\n\nThe loss of life and damage wrought by Beryl underscores the consequences of a warmer Atlantic Ocean, which scientists cite as a telltale sign of human-caused climate change fueling extreme weather that differs from past experience.\n\nRalph Gonsalves, prime minister of St. Vincent and the Grenadines, one of the hardest-hit areas in the eastern Caribbean, said in a radio interview that the country's Union Island was \"flattened\" by Beryl.\n\n\"Everybody is homeless ... It is going to be a Herculean effort to rebuild.\"\n\nSpeaking to state media, Nerissa Gittens-McMillan, permanent secretary at St. Vincent and the Grenadines' agriculture ministry, warned of possible food shortages after 50% of the country's plantain and banana crops were lost, with significant losses also to root crops and vegetables.\n\nPower outages were widespread across Jamaica, while some roads near the coast were washed out.\n\nBy last evening, the eye of the spiraling hurricane was located about 100 miles (161 km) west of Kingston, according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center (NHC), as the storm's core headed toward the Cayman Islands, where hurricane conditions were expected late tonight.\n\nBeryl is packing maximum sustained winds of 130 miles per hour (209 kph).\n\nThe force of the winds is expected to weaken somewhat in the next day or two, according to the NHC, though it cautioned that Beryl would remain at or near major hurricane strength as it passed the Cayman Islands.\n\nBeryl is expected to dump 4-6 inches (10-15 cm) of rain on the Cayman Islands overnight and into today. Large swells were expected to \"cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions,\" the NHC said.\n\nThe center added that a hurricane warning was in effect for Jamaica, the Cayman Islands, as well as the eastern coast of Mexico's Yucatan peninsula, including for the country's top beach resort Cancun.\n\nAdditional confirmed fatalities so far include at least three din St. Vincent and the Grenadines, a senior official told Reuters, where Union Island has suffered severe destruction of over 90% of buildings.\n\nIn Grenada, Prime Minister Dickon Mitchell described \"Armageddon-like\" conditions with no power and widespread destruction, while also confirming three deaths.\n\nIn Venezuela, President Nicolas Maduro told state television that three people had died and four were missing in the area, along with more than 8,000 homes damaged by torrential rains, including at least 400 destroyed.\n\nVenezuelan Vice President Delcy Rodriguez was injured by a falling tree on Tuesday as she surveyed an area south of Beryl where intense rainfall caused the Manzanares River in Sucre state to burst its banks, the president confirmed.\n\nThe unusually early hurricane strengthened at a record pace, which scientists argue is almost certainly fueled by climate change.\n\nBeryl is the 2024 Atlantic season's first hurricane and the earliest storm on record to reach the highest category on the Saffir-Simpson five-stage scale. The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has forecast a large number of major hurricanes in an \"extraordinary\" season this year.\n\nBeyond near-term impact in Jamaica and Haiti, the NHC warned that Beryl will likely make landfall as hurricane on Mexico's Yucatan peninsula as early as Thursday night.\n\nIn the fishing village of Punta Allen, in the state of Quintana Roo, residents moved boats inland for safety, while navy officers implored reluctant residents to evacuate.\n\nIn tourist epicenter Cancun, an environmental agency worked to gather eggs from sea turtles' nests for their protection. Tourists soaked up the sun's rays while they still could.\n\nMeanwhile, workers filled bags with sand and boarded up doors and windows of businesses for protection. Officials said supplies of wooden boards were dwindling as Cancun locals and tourists prepared for Beryl's arrival.\n\nLaura Velazquez, head of Mexico's civil protection agency, encouraged tourists in Cancun and nearby Tulum to hunker down in hotel basements once the hurricane approaches, in comments to local broadcaster Milenio.", "source": {"uri": "stabroeknews.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Three people died and several are still missing.\n\nA government delegation was hit by a falling tree while inspecting damage.\n\nPresident Nicol\u00e1s Maduro said Vice-President Delcy Rodr\u00edguez was among those injured. He said she was \"very bruised but conscious\".\n\nIn Mexico, where Hurricane Beryl is expected in the coming days, residents in Canc\u00fan have rushed to supermarkets to stock up on supplies. Some have encountered empty shelves.\n\nThe NHC said that Hurricane Beryl was the earliest category five storm recorded in the Atlantic and had formed much earlier in the hurricane season than usual.\n\nMeteorologists have also remarked on how quickly Beryl developed.\n\nThe storm strengthened from a tropical depression into a major hurricane in 42 hours, hurricane expert Sam Lillo told the Associated Press news agency.\n\nIn Texas, officials warned residents to prepare for the possibility of Beryl's arrival this weekend.\n\nOn Tuesday, Governor Greg Abbott told resident's near the

It is expected to weaken further as it heads toward landfall early Friday on Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula, the US National Hurricane Center said.\n\nThe storm has left a trail of destruction across the Caribbean and the coast of Venezuela, killing at least seven people and bringing with it flash floods and mudslides.\n\nThe storm is the first since NHC records began to reach the Category 4 level in June and the earliest to reach Category 5 in July.\n\nIn the Cayman Islands, Acting Deputy Governor Eric Bush said there have been no calls for evacuations and expressed worry that some people were leaving their homes to film the storm, the Cayman Compass news website said.\n\nIn Jamaica, more than 400,000 people were without power, according to the Jamaica Gleaner newspaper, citing a public service company.\n\nMexican officials have scrambled to prepare, with the NHC warning Beryl will remain a hurricane until it makes landfall.\n\n\"We will have intense rains and wind gusts\" from Thursday, Civil Protection national coordinator Laura Velazquez said, announcing the deployment of hundreds of military personnel, marines and electricity workers in anticipation of damage.\n\nThe government has prepared 112 shelters with a capacity for around 20,000 people and suspended school in the state of Quintana Roo, where Beryl will likely hit.\n\nIn towns including the resort Tulum, public activities will be suspended starting at 4:00 pm Thursday. Velazquez urged people to report to the nearest shelter as the storm approaches.\n\nThe hurricane is expected to slam the Yucatan as a Category 1 hurricane, emerge over the Gulf of Mexico, then hit the northern state of Tamaulipas, which borders the United States.\n\nIt is extremely rare for such a powerful storm to form this early in the Atlantic hurricane season, which runs from early June to late November.\n\nWarm ocean temperatures are key for hurricanes, and North Atlantic waters are currently between two and five degrees Fahrenheit (1-3 degrees Celsius) warmer than normal, according to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).\n\nUN climate chief Simon Stiell, who has family on the island of Carriacou, said climate change was \"pushing disasters to record-breaking new levels of destruction.\"\n\n\"Disasters on a scale that used to be the stuff of science fiction are becoming meteorological facts, and the climate crisis is the chief culprit,\" he

In a potential good sign, the initial readings in the Jamaican capital Kingston were significantly less, with sustained winds topping 48 mph and a wind gust as high as 81 mph.\n\nAfter some slight weakening just before it closed in, Beryl appeared to be more organized Wednesday afternoon with a clear-out eye. Forecasters expect it to bring up to nine fete of \"life-threatening\" storm surge and up to a foot of rain.\n\nBeryl was about 65 miles west-southwest of Kingston, Jamaica and headed west-northwest at 20 mph. Hurricane-force winds extended up to 45 miles from the storm's eye, putting Kingston within reach of the worst of the storm's winds and covering nearly the entire island with tropical-storm-force winds, which reached up to 185 miles from the center.\n\nJamaica was getting smacked with the upper right section of the storm, also known as the dirty side, which brings the most storm surge and holds the greatest potential for tornado formation.

In a potential good sign, the initial readings in the Jamaican capital Kingston were significantly less, with sustained winds topping 48 mph and a wind gust as high as 81 mph.\n\nAfter some slight weakening just before it closed in, Beryl appeared to be more organized Wednesday afternoon with a clear-out eye. Forecasters expect it to bring up to nine fete of \"life-threatening\" storm surge and up to a foot of rain.\n\nBeryl was about 65 miles west-southwest of Kingston, Jamaica and headed west-northwest at 20 mph. Hurricane-force winds extended up to 45 miles from the storm's eye, putting Kingston within reach of the worst of the storm's winds and covering nearly the entire island with tropical-storm-force winds, which reached up to 185 miles from the center.\n\nJamaica was getting smacked with the upper right section of the storm, also known as the dirty side, which brings the most storm surge and holds the greatest potential for tornado formation. It's \"the worst side of the storm,\" wrote Sammy Hadi, a meteorologist with the Miami office of the National Weather Service, on Twitter.\n\nNext on the forecast track is the Cayman Islands, which are also under hurricane warnings. Beryl is on track to pass south of the islands on Thursday as a strong Category 3 before heading onward to the Yucatan Peninsula.\n\nFrom there, Beryl is forecast to make another landfall in the Quintana Roo region of Mexico as a Category 1 hurricane, before re-emerging in the Gulf of Mexico as a tropical storm. New on Wednesday morning, the hurricane center now predicts Beryl could re-strengthen to a Category 1 hurricane again before striking the northeast coast of Mexico.\n\nBy mid-morning Wednesday, there were reports of downed trees and power outages in the Dominican Republic, Listin Diario reported.\n\nIn Grenada, which got slammed on Monday, officials reported an \"Armageddon-like\" impact. The hardest hit islands saw 98% of all homes and buildings destroyed, and massive damage to communications and the electrical grid.\n\n\"Complete devastation and destruction of agriculture. Complete and total destruction of the natural environment; there is literally no vegetation left anywhere on the island of Carriacou,\" Prime Minister Mitchell said.\n\nThe Caribbean Disaster Emergency Management agency, which is the regional body responsible for responding to disasters, said Wednesday there is not yet an official death toll and they are still assessing the destruction in member countries.\n\nElizabeth Riely, director of CDEMA, confirmed that while the Grenadines islands of Grenada and St. Vincent bore the brunt of the hurricane, Barbados, St. Lucia and Dominica were also affected.\n\nRiley said based on reports provided so far, they know that 100% of the population on the island of Canouan, which has 12,600 inhabitants, was affected by Beryl. \"There is an estimated 90% of the houses that were damaged either extensively or destroyed.\"\n\nElsewhere in the Atlantic, the hurricane center continued to drop the likelihood that another system would form behind Beryl. By Wednesday morning, it had a 20% chance of strengthening into a tropical depression this week.\n\nThe system dumped heavy rain on the already-ravaged islands Wednesday, prompting a flash flood warning in Barbados.\n\n\u00a92024 Miami Herald.

The storm underwent rapid intensification and became a Category 4 hurricane as soon as its wind speeds reached 130 miles per hour. The system temporarily weakened to a Category 3 before strengthening again, with maximum winds documented at 150 mph when it made landfall in the Windward Islands on Monday morning.\n\nAt one point, Hurricane Beryl was categorized as a Category 5, but it has since weakened again to a Category 3, with wind speeds at 120 mph. The storm has killed at least seven people, according to the Associated Press.\n\nIt also has continued to surprise meteorologists with its tenacity and strength, with one extreme storm chaser expressing concern that the storm was intensifying when its northern eyewall-a ring of thunderstorms that produce heavy rains and typically the strongest winds-slammed Jamaica on Wednesday.\n\n\"Not good to see Category 4 Hurricane #Beryl intensifying as its northern eyewall slams the southern part of Jamaica,\" extreme storm chaser Colin McCarthy posted on X, formerly Twitter on Wednesday. \"Beryl was expected to weaken due to wind shear, but has continued to defy the odds, with sustained winds of 140 mph and gusts to 175 mph.\"\n\nHurricane Beryl produced catastrophic damage on the Caribbean island of Carriacou on Monday, and AccuWeather lead hurricane forecaster Alex DaSilva told Newsweek that Jamaica had been expecting a similar onslaught from the storm. DaSilva added that the storm produced very heavy rainfall over Jamaica, which could contribute to mudslides.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center (NHC) continues to sound the alarm about the storm's strength as it churns through the Atlantic Ocean. On Thursday morning, the NHC warned that Beryl is now approaching the Yucatan Peninsula and Belize, where hurricane-force winds, dangerous storm surge and heavy rains are expected on Thursday night.\n\nBeryl is the first hurricane of the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season and the second named storm. Tropical Storm Alberto made landfall in Mexico on the morning of June 20. Shortly after Beryl formed, the third named storm of the season-Tropical Storm Chris-formed quickly on Sunday night. Chris made landfall in Mexico on Sunday night, with wind speeds at around 40 mph. It has since dissolved.\n\nMultiple agencies, including the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, have issued forecasts warning that 2024 will be an exceptionally strong year for hurricanes.\n\nNOAA's forecast anticipates 17 to 25 named storms for an above-average hurricane season.

It is expected to weaken further as it heads toward landfall early Friday on Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula, the US National Hurricane Center said.\n\nThe storm has left a trail of destruction across the Caribbean and the coast of Venezuela, killing at least seven people and bringing with it flash floods and mudslides.\n\nThe storm is the first since NHC records began to reach the Category 4 level in June and the earliest to reach Category 5 in July.\n\nIn the Cayman Islands, Acting Deputy Governor Eric Bush said there have been no calls for evacuations and expressed worry that some people were leaving their homes to film the storm, the Cayman Compass news website said.\n\nIn Jamaica, more than 400,000 people were without power, according to the Jamaica Gleaner newspaper, citing a public service company.\n\nMexican officials have scrambled to prepare, with the NHC warning Beryl will remain a hurricane until it makes landfall.\n\n\"We will have intense rains and wind gusts\" from Thursday, Civil Protection national coordinator Laura Velazquez said, announcing the deployment of hundreds of military personnel, marines and electricity workers in anticipation of damage.\n\nMore from this section Fresno State introduces new athletic director Hungary's PM Orban Meets Zelensky in a Surprise Visit, Ukraine To Cede Territory To Russia?| Watch MTA bathrooms making a long-awaited return across the subway system\n\nThe government has prepared 112 shelters with a capacity for around 20,000 people and suspended school in the state of Quintana Roo, where Beryl will likely hit.\n\nIn towns including the resort Tulum, public activities will be suspended starting at 4:00 pm Thursday. Velazquez urged people to report to the nearest shelter as the storm approaches.\n\nThe hurricane is expected to slam the Yucatan as a Category 1 hurricane, emerge over the Gulf of Mexico, then hit the northern state of Tamaulipas, which borders the United States.\n\nIt is extremely rare for such a powerful storm to form this early in the Atlantic hurricane season, which runs from early June to late November.\n\nWarm ocean temperatures are key for hurricanes, and North Atlantic waters are currently between two and five degrees Fahrenheit (1-3 degrees Celsius) warmer than normal, according to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).\n\nUN climate chief Simon Stiell, who has family on the island of Carriacou, said climate change was \"pushing disasters to record-breaking new levels of destruction.\"\n\n\"Disasters on a scale that used to be the stuff of science fiction are becoming meteorological facts, and the climate crisis is the chief culprit,\" he

The storm underwent rapid intensification and became a Category 4 hurricane as soon as its wind speeds reached 130 miles per hour. The system temporarily weakened to a Category 3 before strengthening again, with maximum winds documented at 150 mph when it made landfall in the Windward Islands on Monday morning.\n\nAt one point, Hurricane Beryl was categorized as a Category 5, but it has since weakened again to a Category 3, with wind speeds at 120 mph. The storm has killed at least seven people, according to the Associated Press.\n\nIt also has continued to surprise meteorologists with its tenacity and strength, with one extreme storm chaser expressing concern that the storm was intensifying when its northern eyewall -- a ring of thunderstorms that produce heavy rains and typically the strongest winds -- slammed Jamaica on Wednesday.\n\n\"Not good to see Category 4 Hurricane #Beryl intensifying as its northern eyewall slams the southern part of Jamaica,\" extreme storm chaser Colin McCarthy posted on X, formerly Twitter on Wednesday. \"Beryl was expected to weaken due to wind shear, but has continued to defy the odds, with sustained winds of 140 mph and gusts to 175 mph.\"\n\nHurricane Beryl produced catastrophic damage on the Caribbean island of Carriacou on Monday, and AccuWeather lead hurricane forecaster Alex DaSilva told Newsweek that Jamaica had been expecting a similar onslaught from the storm. DaSilva added that the storm produced very heavy rainfall over Jamaica, which could contribute to mudslides.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center (NHC) continues to sound the alarm about the storm's strength as it churns through the Atlantic Ocean. On Thursday morning, the NHC warned that Beryl is now approaching the Yucatan Peninsula and Belize, where hurricane-force winds, dangerous storm surge and heavy rains are expected on Thursday night.\n\nBeryl is the first hurricane of the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season and the second named storm. Tropical Storm Alberto made landfall in Mexico on the morning of June 20. Shortly after Beryl formed, the third named storm of the season -- Tropical Storm Chris -- formed quickly on Sunday night. Chris made landfall in Mexico on Sunday night, with wind speeds at around 40 mph. It has since dissolved.\n\nMultiple agencies, including the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, have issued forecasts warning that 2024 will be an exceptionally strong year for hurricanes.\n\nNOAA's forecast anticipates 17 to 25 named storms for an above-average hurricane season. Of the 25, eight to 13 will be hurricanes, and four to seven will be major hurricanes. The forecast number of named storms, hurricanes and major hurricanes is the highest NOAA has ever issued in a May outlook.\n\nSeveral factors are contributing to this year's storm-heavy predictions,

A hurricane warning was in effect for the Cayman Islands on Thursday.\n\nHurricane Beryl was hurtling toward the Cayman Islands early Thursday after lashing Jamaica, charting a course of destruction through the Caribbean while putting countries in its path on edge.\n\nThe storm has flattened islands, inundated communities and killed at least eight people. It lost some of its force at a Category 3 strength, with wind speeds of 120 miles per hour, but was still taking with it dangerous winds, storm surges and heavy rainfall.\n\nHere are key things to know about the storm:\n\nBeryl devastated islands in Grenada after making landfall earlier on Monday as a Category 4 hurricane.\n\nIn Jamaica on Wednesday, hundreds of thousands of households lost power, and several communities were flooded. Officials said that the full extent of the damage was not yet clear.\n\nA hurricane warning was in effect for the Cayman Islands on Thursday, and forecasters expected strong winds, dangerous storm surge, damaging waves and flooding.\n\nIn Mexico, officials warned that the country could be hit twice in the coming days. Forecasters said the storm could weaken but is likely to remain a hurricane until it makes landfall on the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula.\n\nThe weekend forecast remained uncertain as of Thursday morning. The Weather Service said it could cause rip currents and life-threatening conditions along Gulf Coast beaches beginning late Friday.\n\nThe storm has left destruction in its wake.\n\nBeryl made landfall on Monday in Grenada, where officials said about 98 percent of the buildings on Carriacou and Petite Martinique, where 9,000 to 10,000 people live in total, had been damaged or destroyed, including Carriacou's main health facility. Crops were ravaged, and fallen trees and utility poles littered the streets.\n\n\"We have to rebuild from the ground up,\" said Dickon Mitchell, prime minister of Grenada.\n\nIt then churned along toward Jamaica, where on Wednesday heavy rain and destructive winds left their mark as well. Beryl was the strongest storm to approach the island in over a decade.\n\nThe storm ripped away a section of the jet bridge roof of Jamaica's main airport. Jamaica's transport minister, Daryl Vaz, said a plan was being prepared to figure out how the airport would operate while the roof for boarding and arrivals was being repaired.\n\nAs the storm approached the Caymans on Thursday morning, most businesses had started closing their doors as residents lined up for last-minute purchases, enduring painfully slow commutes through dense traffic.\n\nThis hurricane season is expected to be busy.\n\nForecasters have warned that the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season could be much more active than usual.\n\nIn late May, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicted 17 to 25 named storms this year, an \"above-normal\" number and a prediction in line with more than a dozen forecasts earlier in the year from experts at universities, private companies and government agencies. Hurricane seasons produce 14 named storms, on average.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saffir\u2013Simpson_scale", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Saffir\u2013Simpson scale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cayman_Islands", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cayman Islands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Cayman Islands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grenada", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Grenada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Grenada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landfall", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Landfall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storm_surge", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Storm surge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone_warnings_and_watches", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tropical cyclone warnings and watches"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Beryl", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hurricane Beryl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Caribbean"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rip_current", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rip current"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_Coast_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gulf Coast of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yucat\u00e1n_Peninsula", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Flood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tropical cyclone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carriacou_and_Petite_Martinique", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carriacou and Petite Martinique"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Carriacou and Petite Martinique"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Grenada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dickon_Mitchell", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dickon Mitchell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daryl_Vaz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daryl Vaz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carriacou", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carriacou"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Carriacou"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Grenada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Oceanic_and_Atmospheric_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_hurricane", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlantic hurricane"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Atmospheric_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Atmospheric Sciences", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Tropical_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Tropical Health", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/06/28/world/two-satellite-map-satellite_map/two-satellite-map-satellite_map-videoSixteenByNine3000-v192.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9704864", "eventUri": "eng-9704864", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.4823529411764705, "wgt": 168, "relevance": 1}

Beryl has already caused severe damage in some of the eastern islands: flattening buildings, cutting off power and water, and killing up to seven people.\n\nHurricane Beryl has been bringing 140mph winds and continuous rain and causing severe damage.\n\nAt 11pm on Wednesday night, Eastern Daylight Time, the US National Hurricane Service said: \"Devastating hurricane-force winds, life-threatening storm surge, and damaging waves are expected to continue in Jamaica for a few more hours and spread into the Cayman Islands.\"\n\nA map with estimated timings shows the Cayman Islands likely to be hit from around 2am EDT on Thursday, with western Cuba to be struck a few hours later.\n\nAt 5am on Thursday morning, the National Hurricane Service added: \"Weather deteriorating in the Cayman Islands with strong winds, dangerous storm surge, and damaging waves expected there later this morning.\"\n\nMexico's Yucatan Peninsula is in line for the hurricane at around 8pm on Thursday, local time.\n\n\"These will quickly increase to near hurricane strength as the centre of Beryl remains close to the island throughout the day.\"\n\nIn the US, President Biden and his team are closely monitoring the situation, with those in the region urged to follow the advice of local officials.\n\nThe UK Foreign Office has said people should \"follow and monitor local and international weather updates from the US National Hurricane Center and follow the advice of local authorities including any evacuation orders.\"\n\nThis is happening at a time of year when many travellers are visiting the Caribbean. These are the key questions and answers.\n\nThe worst damage appears to be in the small islands of Carriacou and Petite Martinique, which are part of Grenada. Carriacou was left \"flattened\" with more than 98 per cent of the buildings, including the main health facility and airport, damaged.\n\n\"We have to rebuild from the ground up,\" said Grenada's prime minister, Dickon Mitchell, after visiting the islands of Carriacou and Petite Martinique.\n\nTwo of the three deaths in Grenada were recorded on Carriacou. \"The possibility there may be more fatalities remains a grim reality as movement is still highly restricted,\" Mr Mitchell said.\n\nSt Vincent and the Grenadines was also badly hit. The prime minister, Ralph Gonsalves, said: \"On one island in the Grenadines archipelago, the Union Island, 90 per cent of homes have been severely damaged or destroyed.\"\n\nThe impact in Jamaica has been devastating. About two-thirds of homes are without power. All flights from the island's airports were cancelled on Wednesday and the authorities will be assessing the conditions at each before reopening. Damage is reported at the airport serving the capital, Kingston.\n\nThe government in the Cayman Islands warned on Wednesday night: \"The hurricane is exhibiting maximum sustained winds of 130 mph and is moving west northwest at a speed of 21 mph.\n\n\"Residents are advised to remain indoors and adhere to stay-in-place guidance until the storm has passed and the government issues all-clear notice.\n\n\"Avoid non-essential travel and stay indoors once the hurricane conditions begin to manifest.\n\n\"Even if Hurricane Beryl does not make direct landfall to our islands, we can still experience significant impacts from storm surge.\n\n\"Storm surge is a dangerous rise in sea level caused by a hurricane's strong winds pushing water towards the shore. This can lead to severe flooding, extensive property damage, and life-threatening conditions.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center says: \"Hurricane-force winds, dangerous storm surge, and heavy rainfall are expected over portions of the Yucatan Peninsula and Belize beginning tonight as Beryl approaches that area as a hurricane.\n\n\"There remains uncertainty in the track and intensity forecast of Beryl over the western Gulf of Mexico this weekend. Interests in eastern Mexico and southern Texas should monitor the progress of Beryl.\n\nRegardless of the exact track, rip currents could cause life-threatening beach conditions beginning late Friday and continuing through the weekend across much of the Gulf coast.\"\n\nFlights from Jamaica's airports to the US are likely to resume around lunchtime on Thursday.\n\nUK airlines cancelled flights to and from Jamaica on Wednesday. The Virgin Atlantic flight from London Heathrow to Montego Bay on Thursday has also been grounded.\n\nVirgin Atlantic and Virgin Holidays is telling customers in Jamaica: \"Please remain in your hotels and follow instructions issued by local authorities and hotels.\n\n\"We have extended your current hotels, therefore you can remain safely where you are. We will be in touch again by email as soon as we have new information for you and appreciate your patience while we work through looking at options for you.\"\n\nHotels have plans for keeping guests safe, and their instructions should be followed.\n\nFriday's British Airways departure from London Gatwick to Kingston is shown as operating on time.\n\nAmerican Airlines says passengers booked to Barbados, Grenada, St Lucia, St Vincent, Grand Cayman, Kingston, Montego Bay and Ocho Rios up to and including Friday 6 July can defer travel up to 10 July.\n\nJetBlue has a similar policy for passengers to Belize City, Grand Cayman, Kingston and Montego Bay.\n\nVirgin Atlantic is allowing passengers booked this week to defer trips up to 17 July.\n\n\"We are contacting affected customers regarding their travel arrangements, including the option to rebook if they no longer wish to travel. We'd like to thank them for their patience and understanding and recommend that all customers due to travel to or from the Caribbean over the next 48 hours check the status of their flight on virginatlantic.com before going to the airport.\"\n\nChristina Tunnah, general manager of Americas for World Nomads, said; \"If Hurricane Beryl derails your travel plans, the first point of call should be your airline or travel provider as they may provide aid. The same goes if your accommodation is impacted by the disaster.\n\n\"Travel insurance may offer cover for a range of events including trip cancellation, missed connection, and trip delay - but it depends on the type of travel insurance policy purchased and whether you've started your journey yet.\n\n\"At World Nomads, on our Explorer Plan, if your accommodation is affected, you may be covered for reasonable additional accommodation and transport costs. You may also claim for additional expenses incurred if your pre booked public transport is cancelled or delayed for more than 12-24 hours, depending on the scenario.\"", "source": {"uri":

It is expected to weaken further as it heads toward landfall early Friday on Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula, the US National Hurricane Center said.\n\nThe storm has left a trail of destruction across the Caribbean and the coast of Venezuela, killing at least seven people and bringing with it flash floods and mudslides.\n\nThe storm is the first since NHC records began to reach the Category 4 level in June and the earliest to reach Category 5 in July.\n\nIn the Cayman Islands, Acting Deputy Governor Eric Bush said there have been no calls for evacuations and expressed worry that some people were leaving their homes to film the storm, the Cayman Compass news website said.\n\nIn Jamaica, more than 400,000 people were without power, according to the Jamaica Gleaner newspaper, citing a public service company.\n\nMexican officials have scrambled to prepare, with the NHC warning Beryl will remain a hurricane until it makes landfall.\n\n\"We will have intense rains and wind gusts\" from Thursday, Civil Protection national coordinator Laura Velazquez said, announcing the deployment of hundreds of military personnel, marines and electricity workers in anticipation of damage.\n\nThe government has prepared 112 shelters with a capacity for around 20,000 people and suspended school in the state of Quintana Roo, where Beryl will likely hit.\n\nIn towns including the resort Tulum, public activities will be suspended starting at 4:00 pm Thursday. Velazquez urged people to report to the nearest shelter as the storm approaches.\n\nThe hurricane is expected to slam the Yucatan as a Category 1 hurricane, emerge over the Gulf of Mexico, then hit the northern state of Tamaulipas, which borders the United States.\n\nIt is extremely rare for such a powerful storm to form this early in the Atlantic hurricane season, which runs from early June to late November.\n\nWarm ocean temperatures are key for hurricanes, and North Atlantic waters are currently between two and five degrees Fahrenheit (1-3 degrees Celsius) warmer than normal, according to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).\n\nUN climate chief Simon Stiell, who has family on the island of Carriacou, said climate change was \"pushing disasters to record-breaking new levels of destruction.\"\n\n\"Disasters on a scale that used to be the stuff of science fiction are becoming meteorological facts, and the climate crisis is the chief culprit,\" he said Monday, reporting that his parents' property was damaged.\n\nbur-dw/mlm\n\nMore from this section\n\nSuper Incubator: Hatching Pok\u00e9mon Eggs without Walking or Moving at the Pokemon GO Fest

Grenada and Carriacou saw similar levels of devastation, with Prime Minister Dickon Mitchell describing the scene as \"Armageddon-like.\" Approximately 98% of structures in Carriacou were damaged or destroyed, leaving the island almost entirely without electricity and communications.\n\nThe islands of Grenada and St. Vincent and the Grenadines reported three deaths each, while Venezuela counted three fatalities and four missing amidst severe floods.\n\nAs Beryl approached Jamaica, Prime Minister Andrew Holness issued urgent warnings and imposed a nationwide curfew. By July 3, in the afternoon, the storm had knocked out power and communications across the island, particularly in the southern regions. Nearly 1,000 Jamaicans sought refuge in shelters as the storm's eyewall grazed the southern coast, delivering maximum sustained winds of 140 mph (225 km/h).\n\nHolness warned the nation that they had not seen the worst yet. \"We can do as much as we can do, as humanly possible, and we leave the rest in the hands of God,\" he said.\n\nThe storm also battered Jamaica's agriculture, with significant damage reported to banana and plantain crops. The US-based National Hurricane Centre (NHC) warned of life-threatening flash floods and mudslides, exacerbated by Jamaica's mountainous terrain. The NHC also issued an alert for southern Haiti and the Cayman Islands, expected to be hit on July 4.\n\nBeryl, now weakened slightly to a Category 4 but still a major hurricane, is expected to make landfall in Mexico's sparsely populated region south of Tulum in the early hours of July 5 as a Category 2 storm. Mexican authorities have begun evacuations in coastal communities and moved sea turtle eggs from beaches threatened by the impending storm surge.\n\nIn popular tourist destinations like Playa del Carmen and Tulum, however, nightlife continued unabated despite the Navy's patrols and warnings. Tourists were urged to seek shelter as the storm approached.\n\nLaura Velazquez, head of Mexico's civil protection agency, recommended visitors to stay in hotel basements once the hurricane hits, with additional hurricane warnings issued for the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula, including Cancun.\n\nIf Beryl maintains its current forecasted path, it will likely bypass the major refining and petrochemical hubs in both the United States and Mexico. Consequently, few, if any, energy companies are expected to shut down US oil and gas wells in the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nMajor US oil and LNG ports are also expected to avoid the worst of the storm. According to the current forecast, the hurricane will make landfall between the Mexican petrochemical hub of Altamira, Tamaulipas, and the US hub of Corpus Christi, Texas.\n\nMexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador (AMLO) addressed the public on July 2, urging calm amid what he described as \"sensationalism\" regarding Beryl, which had reached Category 5 status on July 1, marking it as the most intense cyclone for this early in the Atlantic hurricane season.\n\n\"You will never be left helpless. However, do not get upset because there will be a lot of sensationalism and too much-exaggerated information about the hurricane,\" AMLO said in a bid to reassure residents of the Mexican Caribbean.\n\nMeanwhile, neighbouring Belize on July 3 issued a tropical storm watch extending from its border with Mexico down to Belize City.\n\nBeryl's unprecedented early development into a Category 5 hurricane has been attributed to unusually warm sea temperatures, a consequence of global heating. Scientists argue that human-driven climate change is intensifying the frequency and severity of tropical storms.\n\nThe US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has predicted a particularly active hurricane season this year, with a significant number of major hurricanes anticipated. As Beryl continues its destructive path, it is feared it may restrengthen over the Gulf of Mexico and potentially impact Mexico's northeast coast near the Texas border.\n\nIn the wake of the storm, recovery and rebuilding efforts are expected to be long and arduous across the affected Caribbean islands. Prime Ministers Ralph Gonsalves of St. Vincent and the Grenadines and Dickon Mitchell of Grenada have both pledged comprehensive rebuilding initiatives, emphasising the resilience and determination of their nations in the face of such unprecedented devastation.\n\nAs Mexico braces for impact, the region remains on high alert, hoping to mitigate further loss of life and damage.", "source": {"uri":

So far it has killed at least seven people, flattened numerous homes and destroyed crops on smaller islands as it has churned through the eastern Caribbean.\n\nPower issues in Kingston\n\nThe US National Hurricane Center (NHC) said Beryl's eyewall was \"brushing the south coast of Jamaica.\" The eyewall is where the most damaging winds and intense rainfall from a storm is found.\n\nPower was knocked out in much of Kingston, the Jamaican capital.\n\nPrime Minister Andrew Holness said on Wednesday afternoon that nearly 500 people were placed in shelters. By evening, he said that Jamaica had not seen the \"worst of what could possibly happen.\"\n\nSeveral roadways in Jamaica's interior regions were impacted by fallen trees and utility poles, while some communities in the northern section were without electricity, the government's information service reported.\n\n\"We can do as much as we can do, as humanly possible, and we leave the rest in the hands of God,\" Holness said.\n\nJamaica had announced a state of emergency and was declared a disaster zone for the next seven days, in anticipation.\n\nMexico braces for storm\n\nMexico's Navy patrolled areas like Tulum telling tourists in Spanish and English to prepare for the storm's arrival.\n\nAs of late Wednesday, Beryl was forecasted to make landfall in a sparsely populated area of lagoons and mangroves south of Tulum in the early hours of Friday, likely as a weakened Category 2 storm.\n\nThat changed when it was expected to cross the Yucatan Peninsula and restrengthen over the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico, making a second strike on Mexico's northeast coast near the Texas border.\n\n\"We will have intense rains and wind gusts\" from Thursday, Civil Protection national coordinator Laura Velazquez said, announcing the deployment of hundreds of military personnel, marines and electricity workers in anticipation of damage.\n\nBeryl's widespread destruction\n\n\"Beryl has also affected the Cayman Islands and is expected to spin up to even higher speeds by Wednesday night and Thursday,\" the NHC said in an advisory.\n\nLocal authorities have issued hurricane warnings as the rapidly moving hurricane has felled power lines and unleashed flash floods across smaller islands.\n\nHaiti's capital Port-au-Prince -- currently in the grip of gang violence and experiencing an ongoing humanitarian crisis -- also saw strong winds on Tuesday afternoon.\n\nThe new Haitian Prime Minister Garry Conille has warned residents to take precautions and stay alert.\n\nGrenada's PM calls it 'Armageddon-like'\n\nMeanwhile other countries in the Carribean, which have already faced the wrath of Beryl, took stock of the situation.\n\nRalph Gonsalves, prime minister of St. Vincent and the Grenadines, said in a radio interview that the country's Union Island was \"flattened\" by Beryl. \"Everybody is homeless ... It is going to be a Herculean effort to rebuild.\"\n\n\"90% of homes had been severely damaged or destroyed on one island in the Grenadines archipelago, Union Island,\" Prime Minister Gonsalves added. He confirmed one death and said more fatalities could be confirmed in the coming days.\n\nThe situation is \"Armageddon-like,\" Grenada's Prime Minister Dickon Mitchell said in a video briefing on Tuesday. He stressed that Carriacou and Petite Martinique, two of the three islands that make up the country, were badly affected by the natural disaster.\n\n\"There is no power. There is almost complete destruction of homes and buildings,\" he said, citing impassable roads due to downed power lines and destroyed fuel stations crimping supplies.\n\nBeryl, the first to reach Category 4\n\nScientists have said that Beryl's arrival has come earlier than is normally the case for such powerful storms. Given how the storm is rapidly strengthening, human-caused climate change might be the culprit, scientists argue.\n\nThe weather system is this year's first Atlantic hurricane and the earliest storm on record to reach the highest category on the Saffir-Simpson Scale.\n\n\"The Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale is a 1 to 5 rating based only on a hurricane's maximum sustained wind speed.

What will be impact to Florida, Gulf Coast?", "body": "The weather was deteriorating in the Cayman Islands Saturday morning as Hurricane Beryl neared, expected to bring with it strong winds, dangerous storm surge and damaging waves, according to the National Hurricane Center's 8 a.m. advisory.\n\nThe storm's eyewall was passing southwest of Grand Cayman and the storm's westward to west-northwestward motion is expected to move the core of Beryl away from the Cayman Islands this morning and over the Yucatan Peninsula early Friday.\n\nBeryl lashed the southern coast of Jamaica Friday as a Category 4 hurricane with 140-mph winds.\n\nBeryl has weakened to a Category 3 hurricane packing 120 mph winds and is forecast to be near major hurricane intensity today as it passes by the Cayman Islands.\n\nThe storm is expected to remain a hurricane until it makes landfall on the Yucatan Peninsula, the NHC said.\n\nAfter emerging into the Gulf of Mexico, Beryl will likely have a couple of days to re-strengthen over warm waters with light or moderate shear.\n\nAlmost all of the model guidance show the system near hurricane strength as Beryl approaches the western Gulf Coast, and so does the official NHC forecast.\n\nBeryl's track and intensity over the western Gulf of Mexico this weekend remains uncertain. Interests in eastern Mexico and southern Texas should monitor the progress of Beryl, the NHC warns.\n\nRegardless of the exact track, rip currents could cause life-threatening beach conditions beginning late Friday and continuing through the weekend across much of the Gulf Coast.\n\nWhile Beryl poses a serious threat to the western Gulf of Mexico this weekend, its implications for the season ahead are also sobering, according to Dr. Ryan Truchelut, chief meteorologist at WeatherTiger. Truchelut works with the USA TODAY Network-Florida to provide the latest storm information Florida residents need.\n\nHurricane Beryl: Why a storm without precedent signals bad season ahead | WeatherTiger\n\n\"When Beryl peaked at Category 5 intensity on Tuesday, it became not only the earliest Category 5 in Atlantic history, but both the strongest June and strongest July hurricane on record.\"\n\nThis is especially remarkable given that any kind of early-season tropical development is rare in the eastern Atlantic, Truchelut said.\n\n\"In the last 150 years, there are 10 seasons in which a hurricane formed in the Main Development Region before August: 2021, 2020, 2018, 2008, 2005, 1996, 1961, 1933, 1926, and 1887. All of those years were above-normal hurricane seasons, averaging almost double the intensity of a normal season.\"\n\nWhat does that mean?\n\n\"You should do the things you can do now to prepare before the inevitable cone-panic hits. So, trim those trees, know where you would go if you need to evacuate, and make sure your hurricane kits are in good order, \" Truchelut said.\n\nAfter plowing into the Caribbean as a major hurricane, leaving death and destruction in its wake, Beryl is expected to make landfall on Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula, before heading into the Gulf of Mexico this weekend and making landfall again in northeastern Mexico, AccuWeather meteorologists predict.\n\n\u27a4 Track all active storms\n\nThe impact on northeastern Mexico and southern Texas will depend on how much Beryl strengthens over the Gulf and its speed when it arrives.\n\n\"A significant factor to consider is that Beryl's forward speed is likely to slow,\" AccuWeather Chief On-Air Meteorologist Bernie Rayno said.\n\nA slower-moving storm will increase the duration of wind, surf and storm surge.\n\nWhen it made its first landfall at 11 a.m. on Carriacou Island Monday, July 1, Beryl was a Category 4 storm with 150-mph winds.\n\nFactors affecting Beryl's intensity include much warmer-than-historical-average waters and wind shear, according to AccuWeather forecasters. If wind shear is strong enough, it can lead to weakening of tropical systems. Warm water helps storms develop and intensify.\n\nAccuWeather Lead Tropical Meteorologist Alex DaSilva said water temperatures in early July are equal to what they usually are in late August, early September.\n\nSpecial note about spaghetti models: Illustrations include an array of forecast tools and models, and not all are created equal. The Hurricane Center uses only the top four or five highest performing models to help make its forecasts.\n\nFor an explanation of what the watches and warnings mean, scroll to the bottom of this story.\n\nTropical storm warning: A tropical storm warning is in effect for the following:\n\nHurricane warning: A hurricane warning means that hurricane conditions are expected somewhere within the warning area. A warning is typically issued 36 hours before the anticipated first occurrence of tropical-storm-force winds, conditions that make outside preparations difficult or dangerous. Preparations to protect life and property should be rushed to completion.\n\nHurricane watch: A hurricane watch means that hurricane conditions are possible within the watch area. A watch is typically issued 48 hours before the anticipated first occurrence of tropical-storm-force winds, conditions that make outside preparations difficult or dangerous.\n\nTropical storm warning: A tropical storm warning means that tropical storm conditions are expected somewhere within the warning area within 36 hours.\n\nTropical storm watch: An announcement that sustained winds of 39 to 73 mph are possible within the specified area within 48 hours in association with a tropical, subtropical, or post-tropical cyclone.\n\nStorm surge warning: A storm surge warning means there is a danger of life-threatening inundation, from rising water moving inland from the coastline, in the indicated locations. This is a life-threatening situation. Persons located within these areas should take all necessary actions to protect life and property from rising water and the potential for other dangerous conditions. Follow evacuation and other instructions from local officials.\n\nStorm surge watch: A storm surge watch means there is a possibility of life-threatening inundation, from rising water moving inland from the coastline, in the indicated locations during the next 48 hours.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Everything's gone. I'm in my house and scared,\" said Amoy Wellington, 51, who lives in Top Hill, a rural farming community in Jamaica's southern St Elizabeth parish. \"It's a disaster.\"\n\nA woman died in Jamaica's Hanover parish after a tree fell on her home, Richard Thompson, acting director general at Jamaica's disaster agency said in an interview on local news.\n\nWe need your consent to load this comcast-player contentWe use comcast-player to manage extra content that can set cookies on your device and collect data about your activity.

It is going to be a Herculean effort to rebuild,\" he added.\n\nSpeaking to state media, Nerissa Gittens-McMillan, permanent secretary at St Vincent and the Grenadines' agriculture ministry, warned of possible food shortages after 50% of the country's plantain and banana crops were lost, with significant losses also to root crops and vegetables.\n\nIn Kingston, streets were quiet as anxious residents hunkered down after spending the morning stocking up on essential supplies.\n\nJamaicans braced for electricity cuts, according to a power company official, with roads near the coastal ready washed out as steady rain continued to fall and winds picked up in the capital.\n\nIn St Elizabeth, local politician Joseph Patterson said the power was out and the situation was \"getting gradually worse by the minute,\" with aggressive winds bringing down trees.\n\nBy yesterday afternoon, the well-defined eye of the spiralling hurricane was located about 105km southeast of Kingston, according to the US National Hurricane Center (NHC), though its outer rings were already lashing much of the island with a population of nearly 3 million.\n\nBeryl is packing maximum sustained winds of 225km/h.\n\nThe force of the winds is expected to weaken somewhat in next day or two, according to the NHC, though it cautioned that Beryl will remain at or near major hurricane strength as it moves on to the Cayman Islands.\n\n\"Life-threatening flash flooding and mudslides from heavy rainfall are expected over much of Jamaica and southern Haiti through today,\" the NHC said in a post, adding that dangerous winds and storm surge are also expected in the Cayman Islands through today\n\nThe centre added that a hurricane warning was in effect for Jamaica, the Cayman Islands, as well as the eastern coast of Mexico's Yucatan peninsula, including for the country's top beach resort Cancun.\n\nOvernight in Haiti as Beryl's impact grew progressively stronger, residents anxiously awaited its full impact.\n\n\"We were not comfortable. We could not sleep normally with the wind, the water. Many people slept in the yard,\" said Pouchon Jean-Francois, who lives in an improvised camp in Port-au-Prince.\n\nVenezuelan Vice President Delcy Rodriguez was injured as she surveyed an area south of Beryl, where the Manzanares River in Sucre state burst its banks.\n\nPresident Nicolas Maduro confirmed the injuries caused by a falling tree to his second-in-command, along with head injuries suffered by senior officials accompanying her, after intense rainfall struck inland from the country's Caribbean coastline.\n\nOn Tuesday night, Mr Maduro told state television that three people had died and four were missing in the area, along with more than 8,000 homes damaged by torrential rains, including at least 400 destroyed.\n\nThe unusually early hurricane strengthened at a record pace, which scientists argue is almost certainly fuelled by climate change.\n\nBeryl is the 2024 Atlantic season's first hurricane and the earliest storm on record to reach the highest category on the Saffir-Simpson five-stage scale. The US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has forecast a large number of major hurricanes in an \"extraordinary\" season this year.\n\nAdditional confirmed fatalities so far include at least three in St Vincent and the Grenadines, a senior official told Reuters, where Union Island has suffered severe destruction of over 90% of buildings.\n\nIn Grenada, Prime Minister Dickon Mitchell described \"Armageddon-like\" conditions with no power and widespread destruction, while also confirming three deaths.\n\nBeyond near-term impact in Jamaica and Haiti, the NHC warned that Beryl will likely make landfall on Mexico's Yucatan peninsula as early as Thursday night.\n\nIn Cancun, officials said supplies of wooden boards used to protect doors and windows were dwindling as locals and tourists prepared for Beryl's arrival.\n\nLaura Velazquez, head of Mexico's civil protection agency, encouraged tourists in Cancun and nearby Tulum to hunker down in hotel basements once

The storm is forecast to remain a hurricane until it makes landfall on Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula early Friday. Beryl is expected to emerge over the southwestern Gulf of Mexico Friday night local time and move northwestward across the gulf on Saturday.\n\nBeryl has already left a trail of destruction through the Caribbean, and earlier this week its winds topped the five-step Saffir-Simpson scale, achieving a rare Category 5 strength. It was the earliest Atlantic storm to do so, signaling an unusually active hurricane season as hot ocean waters fuel tropical systems. The storm weakened after sweeping past Jamaica and Grenada, but still left behind widespread damage.\n\nClean up and recovery efforts began in Jamaica on Thursday after Beryl churned just south of the island, causing widespread damage, at least one death and knocking out power to about 60% of the population. The country's airports are being evaluated to see when they can be reopened, but the Jamaica Observer reported that a small section of the roof at Norman Manley International Airport had been damaged.\n\nEarly reports for Grand Cayman suggest some power outages along the eastern side of the island, though there haven't been major damage reports so far. Winds are expected to start waning in the Grand Cayman around midday, according to a weather update from the Cayman Islands National Weather Service.\n\nConditions in the Yucatan will likely start to deteriorate Thursday, with torrential rains, strong winds, and crashing surf raking the region, according to the National Meteorological Service of Mexico.\n\nMeanwhile, the threat to Gulf of Mexico oil and gas production is diminishing as the path of the storm spares major drilling areas and platforms in US federal waters, according to data from the hurricane center and Bureau of Ocean Energy Management. Major platforms platforms including Exxon Mobil Corp.'s Hoover, Occidental Petroleum Corp.'s Boomvang and Shell Plc's Perdido that were in the path Wednesday are now clear.\n\nBeryl made landfall Monday on Carriacou, the second-largest of Grenada's islands. The electricity and communications system has been completely destroyed and the island's marina -- the heart of its tourism industry -- was also significantly damaged, Grenada Prime Minister Dickon Mitchell said in a national address.\n\n\"It is going to be a mammoth task to rebuild,\" Mitchell said.\n\n--With assistance from Robert Tuttle and Brian K.

Winds are now decreasing in Jamaica following a close scrape with the island.\n\nFollowing Jamaica, Beryl will pass near the Cayman Islands with destructive wind gusts and storm surge. On Beryl's eastern flank, bands of rain continue to wrap into parts of eastern Cuba and Jamaica, which could result in flooding and mudslides.\n\nLate Wednesday night, the National Hurricane Center reported Beryl was located at 18.0\u00b0N 79.2\u00b0W and was moving west-northwest at 21 mph. Maximum sustained winds were 130 mph.\n\nBeryl is the earliest hurricane to reach Category 5 strength on record in the Atlantic, and it beat the previous record by more than two weeks. The previous earliest Category 5 was Hurricane Emily on July 16 during the hyperactive 2005 Atlantic hurricane season. Record warm water temperature have likely catapulted Beryl's intensity.\n\nBeryl will take a west-northwest track in the Caribbean Sea through the rest of this week. Although the hurricane will eventually lose some intensity because of increasingly hostile wind shear, it will still pose a considerable danger. Here's the general timeline\n\nThrough early Thursday: Beryl will make its closest approach to the Cayman Islands, particularly Grand Cayman, with storm surge flooding, high winds and heavy rain. This could be Grand Cayman's strongest hurricane strike since November 2008's Hurricane Paloma.Thursday night and Friday: While conditions will deteriorate Thursday night, Beryl is expected to make a landfall as a hurricane in Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula early Friday morning, anywhere from the Belize border and Costa Maya to Cozumel. Storm surge flooding, potentially damaging winds and flooding rain are all possible. Heavy rain and strong wind gusts will continue in the Yucatan Peninsula through Friday.\n\nBeryl will emerge in the southwest Gulf of Mexico Friday night or early Saturday after being steered by a heat dome of high pressure over the Southeast U.S. There is lingering uncertainty in Beryl's future once it's in the Gulf of Mexico. That Southeast U.S. upper-level heat dome will both weaken and retreat off the Southeast coast, leaving a gap between that and a western U.S. heat dome.\n\nBecause of that, Beryl is expected to take a subtle northwest curl in the western Gulf of Mexico eastern Mexico or South Texas' Gulf Coast sometime Sunday or early Monday. There is some chance Beryl could slow down its forward speed either near or after landfall. Beryl will have lost strength by the time it reaches the southwest Gulf because of wind shear and land interaction. However it could still bring significant impacts to the Gulf Coast as either a tropical storm or hurricane. Some re-strengthening is expected before its final landfall.\n\nCLICK HERE for more.", "source": {"uri": "kadn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KADN News 15"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The storm is forecast to remain a hurricane until it makes landfall on Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula early Friday. Beryl is expected to emerge over the southwestern Gulf of Mexico Friday night local time and move northwestward across the gulf on Saturday.\n\nBeryl has already left a trail of destruction through the Caribbean, and earlier this week its winds topped the five-step Saffir-Simpson scale, achieving a rare Category 5 strength. It was the earliest Atlantic storm to do so, signaling an unusually active hurricane season as hot ocean waters fuel tropical systems. The storm weakened after sweeping past Jamaica and Grenada, but still left behind widespread damage.\n\nClean up and recovery efforts began in Jamaica on Thursday after Beryl churned just south of the island, causing widespread damage, at least one death and knocking out power to about 60% of the population. The country's airports are being evaluated to see when they can be reopened, but the Jamaica Observer reported that a small section of the roof at Norman Manley International Airport had been damaged.\n\nEarly reports for Grand Cayman suggest some power outages along the eastern side of the island, though there haven't been major damage reports so far. Winds are expected to start waning in the Grand Cayman around midday, according to a weather update from the Cayman Islands National Weather Service.\n\nConditions in the Yucatan will likely start to deteriorate Thursday, with torrential rains, strong winds, and crashing surf raking the region, according to the National Meteorological Service of Mexico.\n\nMeanwhile, the threat to Gulf of Mexico oil and gas production is diminishing as the path of the storm spares major drilling areas and platforms in US federal waters, according to data from the hurricane center and Bureau of Ocean Energy Management. Major platforms platforms including Exxon Mobil Corp.'s Hoover, Occidental Petroleum Corp.'s Boomvang and Shell Plc's Perdido that were in the path Wednesday are now clear.\n\nBeryl made landfall Monday on Carriacou, the second-largest of Grenada's islands. The electricity and communications system has been completely destroyed and the island's marina -- the heart of its tourism industry -- was also significantly damaged, Grenada Prime Minister Dickon Mitchell said in a national address.\n\n\"It is going to be a mammoth task to rebuild,\" Mitchell said.\n\n--With assistance from Robert Tuttle and Brian K. Sullivan.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek", "source": {"uri": "ca.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

Hurricane conditions are spreading through the island, it said.\n\nPrime Minister Andrew Holness declared a curfew from 6:00 am to 6:00 pm across the island of 2.8 million and urged Jamaicans to comply with evacuation orders.\n\n\"If you live in a low lying area, an area historically prone to flooding and landslide or if you live on the banks of a river, I implore you to evacuate to a shelter, or to safer ground,\" he said in a video posted to social media.\n\nDesmon Brown, manager of the National Stadium in Kingston, said his staff has scrambled to be ready.\n\n\"We've taped up our windows, covered our equipment -- including computers, printers and that sort of thing. Apart from that, it's mainly concrete so there's not much we can do,\" Brown told the Jamaica Observer newspaper.\n\nMexican officials were meanwhile scrambling to prepare for Beryl, which is expected to hit somewhere between the well-known tourist hotspot of Tulum and the town of Felipe Carrillo Puerto, according to Civil Protection national coordinator Laura Velazquez.\n\nBeginning Thursday \"we will have intense rains and wind gusts\" she said, announcing the deployment of hundreds of military personnel, marines and electricity workers in anticipation of damage.\n\nThe government has prepared 112 shelters with a capacity for some 20,000 people and suspended school in the state of Quintana Roo where Beryl will hit.\n\n- 'No communication' -\n\nBeryl has already left a trail of death with at least three people killed in Grenada, where the storm made landfall Monday, as well as one in St Vincent and the Grenadines and three in Venezuela.\n\nGrenada's Prime Minister Dickon Mitchell said the island of Carriacou, which was struck by the eye of the storm, has been all but cut off, with houses, telecommunications and fuel facilities there flattened.\n\nThe 13.5-square mile (35-square kilometer) island is home to around 9,000 people. At least two people there died, Mitchell said, with a third killed on the country's main island of Grenada when a tree fell on a house.\n\nIn St. Vincent and the Grenadines, one person on the island of Bequia was reported dead from the storm, while a man died in Venezuela's northeastern coastal state of Sucre when he was swept away by a flooded river, officials there said.\n\n- Climate change -\n\nIt is extremely rare for such a powerful storm to form this early in the Atlantic hurricane season, which runs from early June to late November.\n\nWarm ocean temperatures are key for hurricanes, and North Atlantic waters are currently between two and five degrees Fahrenheit (1-3 degrees Celsius) warmer than normal, according to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).\n\nUN climate chief Simon Stiell, who has family on the island of Carriacou, said climate change was \"pushing disasters to record-breaking new levels of destruction.\"", "source": {"uri":

The outer bands lashed the Caribbean island nation Wednesday morning before the eyewall brushed the south coast of Jamaica in the mid-afternoon. Beryl was a Category 4 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 140 mph at the time.\n\nThe storm was projected to pound Jamaica with 4 to 8 inches of rain with localized amounts of 12 inches. Storm trackers captured waves up to 25 feet as Beryl made its way to Jamaica, which has a population of 3 million people. The center was 45 miles from the capital city of Kingston by mid-afternoon. One woman died after a tree fell on her home, said Richard Thompson, acting director general at Jamaica's disaster agency. He also said nearly 1,000 residents were in shelters by Wednesday evening.\n\nBeryl made history by becoming the earliest category 4 and 5 hurricane on record and developed from a tropical storm into a major hurricane (winds of 111 mph or higher) in just over 12 hours. It first made landfall Monday on Grenada's Carriacou Island with wind speeds touching 150 mph.\n\nForecasters say Beryl is projected to approach the Cayman Islands before moving toward the Yucatan Peninsula on Thursday.

Even though Invest 96-L is expected to move into the Gulf of Mexico and possibly develop, the chances are low (10% formation chance in the next 48 hours, 20% chance in the next seven days).\n\nThe NHC says Invest 96-L has the potential to bring gusty winds and some heavy rainfall to portions of the Greater Antilles over the next few days.", "source": {"uri": "wesh.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WESH"}, "authors": [{"uri": "averi_kremposky@wesh.com", "name": "Averi Kremposky", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Beryl", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hurricane Beryl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saffir\u2013Simpson_scale", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Saffir\u2013Simpson scale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landfall", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Landfall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hurricane_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Hurricane Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Caribbean"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storm_surge", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Storm surge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yucat\u00e1n_Peninsula", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean_Sea", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Caribbean Sea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tropical cyclone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cayman_Islands", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cayman Islands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Cayman Islands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Antilles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Greater Antilles"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_convection", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atmospheric convection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_wave", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tropical wave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gulf of Mexico"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Atmospheric_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Atmospheric Sciences", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Socially_Responsible", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Socially Responsible", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Investment_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Investment Services", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Environment", "label": "news/Environment", "wgt": 46}], "image": "https://kubrick.htvapps.com/htv-prod-media.s3.amazonaws.com/images/groz39pbmaeeolj-66867d8ba1044.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=640:*", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9704864", "eventUri": "eng-9704864", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

Everything's gone. I'm in my house and scared,\" said Amoy Wellington, a 51-year-old cashier who lives in Top Hill, a rural farming community in southern St. Elizabeth parish. \"It's a disaster.\"\n\nBeryl moved away from Jamaica early on Thursday. At around 1200 GMT, the Category 3 hurricane was 50 miles (80 km) from Grand Cayman and about 385 miles (620 km) off Tulum, Mexico, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said.\n\nBeryl was carrying top winds of 130 mph (209 kph), and was expected to dump 4-6 inches (10-15 cm) of rain on the Cayman Islands, where life-threatening surf and rip currents were possible, the NHC said.\n\nA hurricane warning was in force for the Cayman Islands east coast of Mexico's Yucatan peninsula.\n\nMexico's tourist centres of Cancun and the wider Yucatan peninsula lie in Beryl's predicted path. Cancun's airport was thronged with tourists hoping to catch last flights out before the storm arrives. Workers filled bags with sand and boarded up doors and windows of businesses for protection.\n\nMexico's defense ministry opened around 120 storm shelters, and asked visitors to heed instructions on evacuation or other measures.\n\nBeryl is the 2024 Atlantic season's first hurricane and at its peak earlier this week was the earliest Category 5 storm on record. A Category 5 hurricane brings winds of 157 mph (252 kph) or higher, capable of causing catastrophic damage including the destruction of homes and infrastructure.\n\nIn Jamaica the island's main airports were closed and streets were mostly empty after Prime Minister Andrew Holness issued a curfew for Wednesday, which was extended to Thursday as storm conditions continued. At least one person was reported killed in the storm.\n\nNearly 1,000 people were in shelters by Wednesday evening, Richard Thompson, acting director general at Jamaica's disaster agency said in an interview on local news.\n\nThe storm hit St. Vincent and the Grenadines earlier in the week. Prime Minister Ralph Gonsalves said in a radio interview that Union Island was \"flattened\" and it would \"be a Herculean effort to rebuild.\"\n\nThere were at least three confirmed fatalities and crop damage was widespread, senior officials told Reuters. Union Island suffered destruction of more than 90% of buildings.\n\nIn Grenada, Prime Minister Dickon Mitchell described \"Armageddon-like\" conditions after the storm made impact earlier in the week, with no power and widespread destruction, while also confirming three deaths.\n\nVenezuelan President Nicolas Maduro told state television that three people had died, four were missing, and over 8,000 homes damaged.\n\nThe U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has forecast a large number of major hurricanes in an \"extraordinary\" season this year. The season runs from the start of June to the end of November\n\nBeryl's destructive power, coming so early in the hurricane season, underscores the consequences of a warmer Atlantic Ocean, which scientists cite as a sign of human-caused climate change fueling extreme weather.\n\n(Writing by Bernadette Baum and Brendan O'Boyle; Reporting by Zahra Burton in Kingston, Robertson Henry in St.

We could not sleep normally with the wind, the water. Many people slept in the yard,\" said Pouchon Jean-Francois, who lives in an improvised camp in Port-au-Prince.\n\nVenezuelan Vice President Delcy Rodriguez was injured as she surveyed an area south of Beryl on Tuesday night, where the Manzanares River in Sucre state burst its banks.\n\nPresident Nicolas Maduro confirmed the injuries caused by a falling tree to his second-in-command, along with head injuries suffered by senior officials accompanying her, after intense rainfall struck inland from the country's Caribbean coastline.\n\nOn Tuesday night, Maduro told state television that three people had died and four were missing in the area, along with more than 8000 homes damaged by torrential rains, including at least 400 destroyed.\n\nThe unusually early hurricane strengthened at a record pace, which scientists argue is almost certainly fueled by climate change.\n\nBeryl is the 2024 Atlantic season's first hurricane and the earliest storm on record to reach the highest category on the Saffir-Simpson five-stage scale. The US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has forecast a large number of major hurricanes in an \"extraordinary\" season this year.\n\nAdditional confirmed fatalities so far

Dickon Mitchell described \"Armageddon-like\" conditions with no power and widespread destruction, while also confirming three deaths.\n\nBeyond near-term impact in Jamaica and Haiti, the NHC warned that Beryl will likely make landfall on Mexico's Yucatan peninsula as early as Thursday night.\n\nIn Cancun, officials said supplies of wooden boards used to protect doors and windows were dwindling

Storm weakens Thursday as path continues toward South Texas", "body": "Hurricane Beryl is bringing strong winds and dangerous storm surges to the Cayman Islands after slamming Jamaica on Wednesday as a Category 4 storm with 140-mph winds.\n\nBeryl was downgraded to a Category 3 hurricane early Thursday and is forecast to weaken gradually as it heads toward the Yucatan Peninsula by late Thursday. A hurricane warning is in effect for the coast of the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico from Puerto Costa Maya to Cancun, including Cozumel.\n\nThe National Weather Service office in Corpus Christi said on Wednesday afternoon that \"it is looking more likely that Beryl will make landfall across far northeast Mexico or the South Texas Coast\" as a Category 1 hurricane early next week. Authorities still advise to prepare for the event as if it's a Category 2 storm.\n\nMore: As Hurricane Beryl moves through the Caribbean, Corpus Christi prepares for possible hit\n\nThe center of Hurricane Beryl was located near latitude 18.7 North, longitude 81.8 West, according to the National Hurricane Center's latest advisory.\n\nBeryl is moving toward the west-northwest near 20 mph. A westward to west- northwestward motion is expected during the next day or two, taking the core of Beryl away from the Cayman Islands this morning and over the Yucatan Peninsula early Friday.\n\nBeryl is expected to emerge over the southwestern Gulf of Mexico Friday night and turn northwestward.\n\nHurricane Beryl tracker: Maps show storm's projected path as it heads toward South Texas\n\nThe impact on northeastern Mexico and southern Texas will depend on how much Beryl strengthens over the Gulf and its speed when it arrives.\n\nIn recent days, Beryl's wind field has increased, extending up to 185 miles from the center and bringing South Texas -- from Brownsville to Corpus Christi -- into the edge of the storm's impact.\n\n\"From Panama City, to New Orleans, there is a low risk of direct impacts from Beryl, but from about Corpus Christi to Brownsville, Texas, the risk increases significantly due to the potential for Beryl to have more direct impacts,\" AccuWeather Chief Meteorologist Jonathan Porter said.\n\n\"That southern portion of the Texas coast is the zone we have to really watch,\" he added.\n\nMore: History-making Hurricane Beryl likely to hit South Texas as Cat 1 storm next week, NWS says\n\nGov. Greg Abbott issued an advisory notice warning the state's emergency management agencies to prepare for storm response and recovery efforts as Hurricane Beryl's path shifts toward South Texas.\n\n\"As Texans around the south coastal areas make holiday plans and visitors begin to travel for the holiday weekend, I urge them to take necessary safety precautions, remain weather aware, and have an emergency plan ready for themselves and their families.\" the advisory said.\n\n\"State and local officials will continue to work around-the-clock to monitor statewide weather conditions and help protect Texans.\"\n\nThis forecast track shows the most likely path of the center of the storm. It does not illustrate the full width of the storm or its impacts, and the center of the storm is likely to travel outside the cone up to 33% of the time.\n\n-- USA TODAY contributed to this

Hurricane conditions are spreading through the island, it said.\n\nPrime Minister Andrew Holness declared a curfew from 6:00 am to 6:00 pm across the island of 2.8 million and urged Jamaicans to comply with evacuation orders.\n\n\"If you live in a low lying area, an area historically prone to flooding and landslide or if you live on the banks of a river, I implore you to evacuate to a shelter, or to safer ground,\" he said in a video posted to social media.\n\nDesmon Brown, manager of the National Stadium in Kingston, said his staff has scrambled to be ready.\n\n\"We've taped up our windows, covered our equipment -- including computers, printers and that sort of thing. Apart from that, it's mainly concrete so there's not much we can do,\" Brown told the Jamaica Observer newspaper.\n\nMexican officials were meanwhile scrambling to prepare for Beryl, which is expected to hit somewhere between the well-known tourist hotspot of Tulum and the town of Felipe Carrillo Puerto, according to Civil Protection national coordinator Laura Velazquez.\n\nBeginning Thursday \"we will have intense rains and wind gusts\" she said, announcing the deployment of hundreds of military personnel, marines and electricity workers in anticipation of damage.\n\nThe government has prepared 112 shelters with a capacity for some 20,000 people and suspended school in the state of Quintana Roo where Beryl will hit.\n\n- 'No communication' -\n\nBeryl has already left a trail of death with at least three people killed in Grenada, where the storm made landfall Monday, as well as one in St Vincent and the Grenadines and three in Venezuela.\n\nGrenada's Prime Minister Dickon Mitchell said the island of Carriacou, which was struck by the eye of the storm, has been all but cut off, with houses, telecommunications and fuel facilities there flattened.\n\nThe 13.5-square mile (35-square kilometer) island is home to around 9,000 people. At least two people there died, Mitchell said, with a third killed on the country's main island of Grenada when a tree fell on a house.\n\nIn St. Vincent and the Grenadines, one person on the island of Bequia was reported dead from the storm, while a man died in Venezuela's northeastern coastal state of Sucre when he was swept away by a flooded river, officials there said.\n\n- Climate change -\n\nIt is extremely rare for such a powerful storm to form this early in the Atlantic hurricane season, which runs from early June to late November.\n\nWarm ocean temperatures are key for hurricanes, and North Atlantic waters are currently between two and five degrees Fahrenheit (1-3 degrees Celsius) warmer than normal, according to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).\n\nUN climate chief Simon Stiell, who has family on the island of Carriacou, said climate change was \"pushing disasters to record-breaking new levels of destruction.\"\n\n\"Disasters on a scale that used to be the stuff of science fiction are becoming meteorological facts, and the climate crisis is the chief culprit,\" he said Monday, reporting that his parents' property was

from Hurricane Beryl", "body": "A damaged road in Venezuela after a river swelled due to heavy rains following Hurricane Beryl\n\nTourist resorts in Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula girded Thursday for a hit from Hurricane Beryl, which is still packing ferocious winds after slamming Jamaica and then the Cayman Islands.\n\nBeryl dropped to a Category 3 storm, with winds of 185 kilometers (115 miles) per hour, and was expected to weaken further as it headed toward landfall overnight Thursday into Friday on the peninsula, the US National Hurricane Center said.\n\nAs of midday Thursday it was in the Caribbean about 530 kilometers east of Tulum, which is a about a two-hour drive from Cancun -- the two main resort cities in the region.\n\nThe storm already left a trail of destruction across the Caribbean and the coast of Venezuela, killing at least seven people and bringing with it flash floods and mudslides.\n\nIn Mexico, classes in the area bracing for a hit were suspended and shelters were set up for locals and tourists alike.\n\nIn Cancun, people have been stocking up on food and other essentials for days and hotels have boarded up their windows.\n\nBeryl is expected to slam the Yucatan as a Category 1 hurricane, emerge over the Gulf of Mexico, then hit the northern state of Tamaulipas, which borders the United States.\n\nThe storm is the first since NHC records began to reach the Category 4 level in June and the earliest to reach Category 5 in July.\n\nMore from this section When It Comes to Weight Gain, Not All Antidepressants Are the Same Toms River School District sues state over lack of sufficient education funding 'I don't know where I'm going to go'\n\nIn the Cayman Islands, Acting Deputy Governor Eric Bush said there have been no calls for evacuations and expressed worry that some people were leaving their homes to film the storm, the Cayman Compass news website said.\n\nIn Jamaica, more than 400,000 people were without power, according to the Jamaica Gleaner newspaper, citing a public service company.\n\nIt is extremely rare for such a powerful storm to form this early in the Atlantic hurricane season, which runs from early June to late November.\n\nWarm ocean temperatures are key for hurricanes, and North Atlantic waters are currently between two and five degrees Fahrenheit (1-3 degrees Celsius) warmer than normal, according to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).\n\nUN climate chief Simon Stiell, who has family on the island of Carriacou, said climate change was \"pushing disasters to record-breaking new levels of destruction.\"\n\n\"Disasters on a scale that used to be the stuff of science fiction are becoming meteorological facts, and the climate crisis is the chief culprit,\" he said Monday, reporting that his parents' property was damaged.\n\nbur-dw/mlm", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brattleboro Reformer"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ivan_shaw@reformer.com",

Hurricane conditions are spreading through the island, it said.\n\nPrime Minister Andrew Holness declared a curfew from 6am to 6pm across the island of 2.8 million and urged Jamaicans to comply with evacuation orders.\n\n\u201cIf you live in a low lying area, an area historically prone to flooding and landslide or if you live on the banks of a river, I implore you to evacuate to a shelter, or to safer ground,\u201d he said in a video posted to social media.\n\nDesmon Brown, manager of the National Stadium in Kingston, said his staff has scrambled to be ready.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve taped up our windows, covered our equipment \u2013 including computers, printers and that sort of thing. Apart from that, it\u2019s mainly concrete so there\u2019s not much we can do,\u201d Brown told the Jamaica Observer newspaper.\n\nMexican officials were meanwhile scrambling to prepare for Beryl, which is expected to hit somewhere between the well-known tourist hotspot of Tulum and the town of Felipe Carrillo Puerto, according to Civil Protection national coordinator Laura Velazquez.\n\nBeginning on Thursday \u201cwe will have intense rains and wind gusts\u201d she said, announcing the deployment of hundreds of military personnel, marines and electricity workers in anticipation of damage.\n\nThe government has prepared 112 shelters with a capacity for some 20,000 people and suspended school in the state of Quintana Roo where Beryl will hit.\n\nBeryl has already left a trail of death with at least three people killed in Grenada, where the storm made landfall on Monday, as well as one in St Vincent and the Grenadines and three in Venezuela.\n\nGrenada\u2019s Prime Minister Dickon Mitchell said the island of Carriacou, which was struck by the eye of the storm, has been all but cut off, with houses, telecommunications and fuel facilities there flattened.\n\nThe 35 sq km (13.5 square mile) island is home to around 9,000 people. At least two people there died, Mitchell said, with a third killed on the country\u2019s main island of Grenada when a tree fell on a house.\n\nIn St Vincent and the Grenadines, one person on the island of Bequia was reported dead from the storm, while a man died in Venezuela\u2019s northeastern coastal state of Sucre when he was swept away by a flooded river, officials there said.\n\nIt is extremely rare for such a powerful storm to form this early in the Atlantic hurricane season, which runs from early June to late November.\n\nWarm ocean temperatures are key for hurricanes, and North Atlantic waters are currently between 2 and 5 degrees Fahrenheit (1 to3 degrees Celsius) warmer than normal, according to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).\n\nUN climate chief Simon Stiell, who has family on the island of Carriacou, said climate change was \u201cpushing disasters to record-breaking new levels of destruction.\u201d\n\n\u201cDisasters on a scale that used to be the stuff of science fiction are becoming meteorological facts, and the climate crisis is the chief culprit,\u201d he said on Monday, reporting that his parents\u2019 property was damaged.", "source": {"uri": "scmp.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "South China Morning Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean", "type": "loc", "score":

It's the first hurricane of the season and is the strongest storm, a Category 5, to form in the Atlantic so early in the hurricane season.\n\nJamaica, Grand Cayman, Little Cayman, and Cayman Brac currently have hurricane warnings as Beryl approaches those islands. At least six people have died across the Caribbean Sea. Rescue crews in the southeastern islands continue to determine the extent of the damage the hurricane inflicted on Carriacou, an island in Grenada.\n\nWhen Hurricane Beryl made landfall on Grenada, it was a Category 4.

That's one thing that's comforting about the United States: You can always escape,\" said Hany Elqutub.\n\nElqutub, his wife, daughter and two grandchildren had been there for a week when the storm hit.\n\n\"We came here enjoying our time for the first couple of days, and then suddenly, the news came out about this beast, and it was a scary experience; yet, being from Houston, we've lived it, we've seen it,\" said Elqutub.\n\nElqutub recorded video showing when Hurricane Beryl began to make landfall. As the wind intensified, the water had more white caps.\n\n\"It was a big beast. I mean, it was really windy. I mean, you could see the sea going so mad, the waves and the surge was so high and it was extremely windy,\" described Elqutub.\n\nHe said he was grateful they were in a concrete resort with food, water, and a generator because he knew it was a different story for the locals.\n\n\"We are fortunate to be in this place. The rest of the island population had to go through a rough time, and I feel for them,\" said Elqutub.\n\nAccording to the National Hurricane Center, Hurricane Beryl is expected to hit Jamaica on Wednesday.

Everything's gone. I'm in my house and scared,\" said Amoy Wellington, a 51-year-old cashier who lives in Top Hill, a rural farming community in southern St. Elizabeth parish. \"It's a disaster.\"\n\nA woman died in Jamaica's Hanover parish after a tree fell on her home, Richard Thompson, acting director general at Jamaica's disaster agency said in an interview on local news.\n\nNearly a thousand Jamaicans were in shelters by Wednesday evening, Thompson added.\n\nThe island's main airports were closed and streets were mostly empty after Prime Minister Andrew Holness issued a curfew for Wednesday, which was extended Thursday as storm conditions continued.\n\nWARMING OCEAN\n\nThe loss of life and damage wrought by Beryl underscores the consequences of a warmer Atlantic Ocean, which scientists cite as a sign of human-caused climate change fueling extreme weather.\n\nRalph Gonsalves, prime minister of St. Vincent and the Grenadines, said in a radio interview that the country's Union Island was \"flattened\" by Beryl and that it would \"be a Herculean effort to rebuild.\"\n\nNerissa Gittens-McMillan, permanent secretary at St. Vincent and the Grenadines' agriculture ministry, warned on state media of possible food shortages after half the country's plantain and banana crops were lost, with significant losses also to root crops and vegetables.\n\nPower outages were widespread across Jamaica, while some roads near the coast were washed out.\n\n'ARMAGEDDON-LIKE'\n\nConfirmed fatalities included at least three in St. Vincent and the Grenadines, a senior official told Reuters, where Union Island suffered destruction of more than 90% of buildings.\n\nIn Grenada, Prime Minister Dickon Mitchell described \"Armageddon-like\" conditions with no power and widespread destruction, while also confirming three deaths.\n\nIn Venezuela, President Nicolas Maduro told state television that three people had died and four were missing, with over 8,000 homes damaged.\n\nBeryl is the 2024 Atlantic season's first hurricane and the earliest storm on record. The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has forecast a large number of major hurricanes in an \"extraordinary\" season this year.\n\nIn tourist epicenter Cancun, workers filled bags with sand and boarded up doors and windows of businesses for protection and officials said supplies of wooden boards were dwindling.\n\nLaura Velazquez, head of Mexico's civil protection agency, encouraged tourists in Cancun and nearby Tulum to hunker down in hotel basements as the storm approached, in comments to local broadcaster Milenio.\n\n(Reporting by Zahra Burton in Kingston, Harold

It was the earliest Atlantic storm to do so, signaling an unusually active hurricane season as hot ocean waters fuel tropical systems.\n\nThe storm surge swamping the coast could reach up to 4 feet on the Cayman Islands, and there were forecasts of as much as 6 inches of rain there. Heavy precipitation will continue in Jamaica through the morning, with flash flooding and mudslides possible.\n\nBeryl may also cause damage to oil installations as the US Gulf coast is on its potential path. Valero Energy Corp., Citgo Petroleum Corp. and Flint Hills Resources LLC all have refineries in the Corpus Christi area.\n\n\"I am encouraging all Jamaicans to take the hurricane as a serious threat,\" Prime Minister Andrew Holness said. \"It is, however, not a time for panic. It is a time for us to be very strategic and calculated in our approach.\"\n\nThe Associated Press reported at least six deaths as the hurricane raged across the southeast Caribbean. After Beryl sweeps south of the Cayman Islands, it is forecast to make landfall on Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula Friday, where a hurricane warning has been posted.\n\nConditions in the Yucatan will likely start to deteriorate Thursday, with torrential rains, strong winds, and crashing surf raking the region, according to the National Meteorological Service of Mexico.\n\nShell Plc is evacuating non-essential personnel and shutting in production from its Perdido deepwater oil platform in the Gulf of Mexico as a precaution, according to a company statement.\n\nThough earlier models had the storm edging into the northern Gulf of Mexico after hitting the Yucatan, AccuWeather meteorologist Tyler Roys said it will likely make its final landfall in northern Mexico or even near Brownsville, Texas by late Sunday or early Monday.\n\nWhile the humanitarian losses are still being assessed, there are signs Beryl is having an impact on markets.\n\nBeryl made landfall Monday on Carriacou, the second-largest of Grenada's islands. The electricity and communications system has been completely destroyed and the island's marina -- the heart of its tourism industry -- was also significantly damaged, Grenada Prime Minister Dickon Mitchell said in a national address.\n\n\"It is going to be a mammoth task to rebuild,\" Mitchell said.\n\n-With assistance from Jim Wyss, Megan Durisin, Amanda Jordan, Atul Prakash and Jack Wittels.\n\n(Updates details in second paragraph, adds refineries in fifth.)", "source": {"uri": "swissinfo.ch", "dataType": "news", "title": "SWI swissinfo.ch"}, "authors": [{"uri":

At least seven are dead in the eastern Caribbean, where Beryl first made landfall on Monday and leveled some small islands with \"98% destruction.\"\n\nEven the outermost bands of Beryl were enough to cause power outages and road closures in the Dominican Republic, but the harder hit was on Jamaica's southern coast, which got brushed by the northern eyewall of the at-the-time Category 4 hurricane.\n\nJamaicans woke up Thursday to downed power lines in Portmore, trees blocking the highway in Manchester and in south St. Elizabeth: knee-high flood waters, wet furniture and ripped-off roofs.\n\nHurricane Beryl left a trail of destruction in southern parishes where Machester and St. Elizabeth bore the brunt of Beryl's powerful winds and rain before the hurricane warning was lifted shortly before midnight and a flash flood watch went into effect.\n\nPart of the roof of the Norman Manley International Airport near Kingston was ripped off, along with roofs of homes and buildings nearby. Around 400,000 customers were without electricity overnight Wednesday, the Jamaica Public Service Company told the Jamaica Gleaner.\n\nNext stop: Mexico\n\nAs of the 8 a.m. update, Beryl was packing 120 mph sustained winds and headed west-northwest at 20 mph. It was about 385 miles east-southeast of Tulum, Mexico.\n\nThe latest forecast track from the National Hurricane Center steers Beryl over the Yucatan and into the Gulf of Mexico, where it's expected to re-strengthen a bit before making yet another landfall as a Category 1 hurricane near the border of Mexico and Texas.\n\n\"While the hurricane has been an over-performer so far, this magnitude of shear should cause notable weakening over the next day or so, but Beryl is expected to still be a hurricane near the Yucatan tomorrow,\" forecasters said in the 5 a.m. discussion.", "source": {"uri":

resorts in Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula girded Thursday for a hit from Hurricane Beryl, which is still packing ferocious winds after slamming Jamaica and then the Cayman Islands.\n\nBeryl dropped to a Category 3 storm, with winds of 185 kilometers (115 miles) per hour, and was expected to weaken further as it headed toward landfall overnight Thursday into Friday on the peninsula, the US National Hurricane Center said.\n\nAs of midday Thursday it was in the Caribbean about 530 kilometers east of Tulum, which is a about a two-hour drive from Cancun -- the two main resort cities in the region.\n\nThe storm already left a trail of destruction across the Caribbean and the coast of Venezuela, killing at least seven people and bringing with it flash floods and mudslides.\n\nIn Mexico, classes in the area bracing for a hit were suspended and shelters were set up for locals and tourists alike.\n\nIn Cancun, people have been stocking up on food and other essentials for days and hotels have boarded up their windows.\n\nBeryl is expected to slam the Yucatan as a Category 1 hurricane, emerge over the Gulf of Mexico, then hit the northern state of Tamaulipas, which borders the United States.\n\nThe storm is the first since NHC records began to reach the Category 4 level in June and the earliest to reach Category 5 in July.\n\nIn the Cayman Islands, Acting Deputy Governor Eric Bush said there have been no calls for evacuations and expressed worry that some people were leaving their homes to film the storm, the Cayman Compass news website said.\n\nIn Jamaica, more than 400,000 people were without power, according to the Jamaica Gleaner newspaper, citing a public service company.\n\nIt is extremely rare for such a powerful storm to form this early in the Atlantic hurricane season, which runs from early June to late November.\n\nWarm ocean temperatures are key for hurricanes, and North Atlantic waters are currently between two and five degrees Fahrenheit (1-3 degrees Celsius) warmer than normal, according to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).\n\nUN climate chief Simon Stiell, who has family on the island of Carriacou, said climate change was \"pushing disasters to record-breaking new levels of destruction.\"\n\n\"Disasters on a scale that used to be the stuff of science fiction are becoming meteorological facts, and the climate crisis is the chief culprit,\" he said Monday, reporting that his parents' property was damaged.\n\nbur-dw/mlm\n\nFOX28 Spokane\u00a9", "source": {"uri": "fox28spokane.com", "dataType": "news",

He said she was \"very bruised but conscious\".\n\nIn Mexico, where Hurricane Beryl is expected in the coming days, residents in Canc\u00fan have rushed to supermarkets to stock up on supplies. Some have encountered empty shelves.\n\nThe NHC said that Hurricane Beryl had formed much earlier in the hurricane season than usual.\n\nMeteorologists have also remarked on how quickly Beryl developed.\n\nThe storm strengthened from a tropical depression into a major hurricane in 42 hours, hurricane expert Sam Lillo told the Associated Press news agency.\n\nIn Texas, officials warned residents to prepare for the possibility of Beryl's arrival this weekend.\n\nOn Tuesday, Governor Greg Abbott told residents near the state's Atlantic coast to \"keep an eye on the gulf\" and \"have an emergency plan to take care of yourself and your loved ones\".\n\nThe US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has warned that the North Atlantic could get as many as seven major hurricanes this year - up from an average of three in a season. -- BBC", "source": {"uri": "saudigazette.com.sa", "dataType": "news", "title": "Saudi Gazette"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Hurricane conditions are spreading through the island, it said.\n\nPrime Minister Andrew Holness declared a curfew from 6:00 am to 6:00 pm across the island of 2.8 million and urged Jamaicans to comply with evacuation orders.\n\n\"If you live in a low lying area, an area historically prone to flooding and landslide or if you live on the banks of a river, I implore you to evacuate to a shelter, or to safer ground,\" he said in a video posted to social media.\n\nDesmon Brown, manager of the National Stadium in Kingston, said his staff has scrambled to be ready.\n\n\"We've taped up our windows, covered our equipment -- including computers, printers and that sort of thing. Apart from that, it's mainly concrete so there's not much we can do,\" Brown told the Jamaica Observer newspaper.\n\nMexican officials were meanwhile scrambling to prepare for Beryl, which is expected to hit somewhere between the well-known tourist hotspot of Tulum and the town of Felipe Carrillo Puerto, according to Civil Protection national coordinator Laura Velazquez.\n\nBeginning Thursday \"we will have intense rains and wind gusts\" she said, announcing the deployment of hundreds of military personnel, marines and electricity workers in anticipation of damage.\n\nThe government has prepared 112 shelters with a capacity for some 20,000 people and suspended school in the state of Quintana Roo where Beryl will hit.\n\n- 'No communication' -\n\nBeryl has already left a trail of death with at least three people killed in Grenada, where the storm made landfall Monday, as well as one in St Vincent and the Grenadines and three in Venezuela.\n\nGrenada's Prime Minister Dickon Mitchell said the island of Carriacou, which was struck by the eye of the storm, has been all but cut off, with houses, telecommunications and fuel facilities there flattened.\n\nThe 13.5-square mile (35-square kilometer) island is home to around 9,000 people. At least two people there died, Mitchell said, with a third killed on the country's main island of Grenada when a tree fell on a house.\n\nIn St. Vincent and the Grenadines, one person on the island of Bequia was reported dead from the storm, while a man died in Venezuela's northeastern coastal state of Sucre when he was swept away by a flooded river, officials there said.\n\n- Climate change -\n\nIt is extremely rare for such a powerful storm to form this early in the Atlantic hurricane season, which runs from early June to late November.\n\nWarm ocean temperatures are key for hurricanes, and North Atlantic waters are currently between two and five degrees Fahrenheit (1-3 degrees Celsius) warmer than normal, according to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).\n\nUN climate chief Simon Stiell, who has family on the island of Carriacou, said climate change was \"pushing disasters to record-breaking new levels of destruction.\"\n\n\"Disasters on a scale that used to be the stuff of science fiction are becoming meteorological facts, and the climate crisis is the chief culprit,\" he said Monday, reporting that his parents' property was damaged.\n\nbur-dw-bfm/des\n\nMore from this section\n\n'Artificial Wisdom' is a smash hit!\n\nCharles Symington is the New President of Primum Familiae Vini\n\nTeal in Top Best Managed Service

It is going to be a Herculean effort to rebuild.\"\n\nSpeaking to state media, Nerissa Gittens-McMillan, permanent secretary at St. Vincent and the Grenadines' agriculture ministry, warned of possible food shortages after 50% of the country's plantain and banana crops were lost, with significant losses also to root crops and vegetables.\n\nPower outages were widespread across Jamaica, while some roads near the coast were washed out.\n\nBy Wednesday evening, the eye of the spiralling hurricane was located about 100 miles (161km) west of Kingston, according to the US National Hurricane Center (NHC), as the storm's core headed towards the Cayman Islands, where hurricane conditions were expected late tonight.\n\nBeryl is packing maximum sustained winds of 130 miles per hour (209kph).\n\nThe force of the winds is expected to weaken somewhat in the next day or two, according to the NHC, though it cautioned that Beryl would remain at or near major hurricane strength as it passed the Cayman Islands.\n\nBeryl is expected to dump 4-6 inches (10-15 cm) of rain on the Cayman Islands overnight and into Thursday. Large swells were expected to \"cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions,\" the NHC said.\n\nThe centre added that a hurricane warning was in effect for Jamaica, the Cayman Islands, as well as the eastern coast of Mexico's Yucatan peninsula, including for the country's top beach resort Cancun.\n\n'ARMAGEDDON-LIKE'\n\nAdditional confirmed fatalities so far include at least three din St. Vincent and the Grenadines, a senior official told Reuters, where Union Island has suffered severe destruction of over 90% of buildings.\n\nIn Grenada, Prime Minister Dickon Mitchell described \"Armageddon-like\" conditions with no power and widespread destruction, while also confirming three deaths.\n\nIn Venezuela, President Nicolas Maduro told state television that three people had died and four were missing in the area, along with more than 8,000 homes damaged by torrential rains, including at least 400 destroyed.\n\nVenezuelan vice-president Delcy Rodriguez was injured by a falling tree on Tuesday as she surveyed an area south of Beryl where intense rainfall caused the Manzanares River in Sucre state to burst its banks, the president confirmed.\n\nThe unusually early hurricane strengthened at a record pace, which scientists argue is almost certainly fuelled by climate change.\n\nBeryl is the 2024 Atlantic season's first hurricane and the earliest storm on record to reach the highest category on the Saffir-Simpson five-stage scale. The US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has forecast a large number of major hurricanes in an \"extraordinary\" season this year.\n\nBeyond near-term impact in Jamaica and Haiti, the NHC warned that Beryl will likely make landfall as hurricane on Mexico's Yucatan peninsula as early as Thursday night.\n\nIn the fishing village of Punta Allen, in the state of Quintana Roo, residents moved boats inland for safety, while navy officers implored reluctant residents to evacuate.\n\nIn tourist epicentre Cancun, an environmental agency worked to gather eggs from sea turtles' nests for their protection. Tourists soaked up the sun's rays while they still could.\n\nMeanwhile, workers filled bags with sand and boarded up doors and windows of businesses for protection. Officials said supplies of wooden boards were dwindling as Cancun locals and tourists prepared for Beryl's arrival.\n\nLaura Velazquez, head of Mexico's civil protection agency, encouraged tourists in Cancun and nearby Tulum to hunker down in hotel basements once the hurricane approaches, in comments to local broadcaster Milenio.", "source": {"uri": "timeslive.co.za", "dataType": "news", "title":

We could not sleep normally with the wind, the water. Many people slept in the yard,\" said Pouchon Jean-Francois, who lives in an improvised camp in Port-au-Prince.\n\nVenezuelan Vice President Delcy Rodriguez was injured as she surveyed an area south of Beryl on Tuesday night, where the Manzanares River in Sucre state burst its banks.\n\nOn Tuesday night, President Nicolas Maduro told state television that three people had died and four were missing in the area, along with more than 8000 homes damaged by torrential rains, including at least 400 destroyed.\n\nThe unusually early hurricane strengthened at a record pace, which scientists argue is almost certainly fuelled by climate change.\n\nBeryl is the 2024 Atlantic season's first hurricane and the earliest storm on record to reach the highest category on the Saffir-Simpson five-stage scale. The US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has forecast a large number of major hurricanes in an \"extraordinary\" season this year.\n\nAdditional confirmed fatalities so far include at least three in St Vincent and the Grenadines, a senior official told Reuters, where Union Island has suffered severe destruction of over 90% of buildings.\n\nIn Grenada, Prime Minister Dickon Mitchell described \"Armageddon-like\" conditions with no power and widespread destruction, while also confirming three deaths.\n\nBeyond near-term impact in Jamaica and Haiti, the NHC warned that Beryl will likely make landfall on Mexico's Yucatan peninsula as early as Thursday night.\n\nIn Cancun, officials said supplies of wooden boards used to protect doors and windows were dwindling as locals and tourists prepared for Beryl's arrival.", "source": {"uri": "nzherald.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "NZ Herald"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

On Sunday it became the earliest major hurricane - defined as one that is Category 3 or higher - in the Atlantic in 58 years and the only one to reach Category 4 status in the month of June.\n\nThe hurricane was able to churn to life because the ocean is as warm now as it would normally be at the peak of hurricane season, said Jim Kossin, a hurricane expert and science advisor at the nonprofit First Street Foundation.\n\n\"Hurricanes don't know what month it is, they only know what their ambient environment is,\" Mr Kossin said. \"Beryl is breaking records for the month of June because Beryl thinks it's September.\"\n\nMr Kossin added the ocean heat fueling Beryl's unprecedented strengthening \"certainly have a human fingerprint on them\".\n\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicts the 2024 hurricane season is likely to be well above average, with between 17 and 25 named storms. The forecast calls for as many as 13 hurricanes and four major hurricanes.\n\nAn average Atlantic hurricane season produces 14 named storms, seven of them hurricanes and three major hurricanes.", "source": {"uri": "news.stv.tv", "dataType": "news", "title": "STV News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Beryl", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hurricane Beryl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saffir\u2013Simpson_scale", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Saffir\u2013Simpson scale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landfall", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Landfall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITV_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ITV News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Holness", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Holness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curfew", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Curfew"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storm_surge", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Storm surge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_emergency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "State of emergency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Caribbean"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hurricane_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Hurricane Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tropical cyclone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wales", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wales"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wales"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cayman_Islands", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cayman Islands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Cayman Islands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grenada", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grenada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Grenada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dickon_Mitchell", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dickon Mitchell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carriacou", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carriacou"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Carriacou"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Grenada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Gonsalves", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ralph Gonsalves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atlantic Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venezuela", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Venezuela"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Venezuela"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Vincent_and_the_Grenadines", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Saint Vincent and the Grenadines"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saint Vincent and the Grenadines"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_intensification", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rapid intensification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Oceanic_and_Atmospheric_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_hurricane", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlantic hurricane"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Atmospheric_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Atmospheric Sciences", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Tropical_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Tropical Health", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Environment", "label": "news/Environment", "wgt": 46}], "image": "https://images.ctfassets.net/pjshm78m9jt4/5YSJkCnVknQBHGbemBaKZX/aa585afcaddbf271182d9299c36e0f18/storm_hero_1.png?fm=jpg&w=1280&h=720&q=60", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9704864", "eventUri": "eng-9704864", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.192156862745098, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1}

Hurricane conditions are spreading through the island, it said.\n\nPrime Minister Andrew Holness declared a curfew from 6:00 am to 6:00 pm across the island of 2.8 million and urged Jamaicans to comply with evacuation orders.\n\n\"If you live in a low lying area, an area historically prone to flooding and landslide or if you live on the banks of a river, I implore you to evacuate to a shelter, or to safer ground,\" he said in a video posted to social media.\n\nDesmon Brown, manager of the National Stadium in Kingston, said his staff has scrambled to be ready.\n\n\"We've taped up our windows, covered our equipment -- including computers, printers and that sort of thing. Apart from that, it's mainly concrete so there's not much we can do,\" Brown told the Jamaica Observer newspaper.\n\nMexican officials were meanwhile scrambling to prepare for Beryl, which is expected to hit somewhere between the well-known tourist hotspot of Tulum and the town of Felipe Carrillo Puerto, according to Civil Protection national coordinator Laura Velazquez.\n\nBeginning Thursday \"we will have intense rains and wind gusts\" she said, announcing the deployment of hundreds of military personnel, marines and electricity workers in anticipation of damage.\n\nThe government has prepared 112 shelters with a capacity for some 20,000 people and suspended school in the state of Quintana Roo where Beryl will hit.\n\nMore from this section Quenneville among three reinstated by NHL after 2021 bans Democratic Congressman Calls On Biden To Withdraw From Presidential Race Tattoo Inks Can Be Contaminated With Bacteria: Study - 'No communication' -\n\nBeryl has already left a trail of death with at least three people killed in Grenada, where the storm made landfall Monday, as well as one in St Vincent and the Grenadines and three in Venezuela.\n\nGrenada's Prime Minister Dickon Mitchell said the island of Carriacou, which was struck by the eye of the storm, has been all but cut off, with houses, telecommunications and fuel facilities there flattened.\n\nThe 13.5-square mile (35-square kilometer) island is home to around 9,000 people. At least two people there died, Mitchell said, with a third killed on the country's main island of Grenada when a tree fell on a house.\n\nIn St. Vincent and the Grenadines, one person on the island of Bequia was reported dead from the storm, while a man died in Venezuela's northeastern coastal state of Sucre when he was swept away by a flooded river, officials there said.\n\n- Climate change -\n\nIt is extremely rare for such a powerful storm to form this early in the Atlantic hurricane season, which runs from early June to late November.\n\nWarm ocean temperatures are key for hurricanes, and North Atlantic waters are currently between two and five degrees Fahrenheit (1-3 degrees Celsius) warmer than normal, according to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).\n\nUN climate chief Simon Stiell, who has family on the island of Carriacou, said climate change was \"pushing disasters to record-breaking new levels of destruction.\"\n\n\"Disasters on a scale that used to be the stuff of science fiction are becoming meteorological facts, and the climate crisis is the chief culprit,\" he said Monday, reporting that his parents' property was

Hurricane Beryl first made landfall in Grenada, and has since passed through Jamaica. This is everything you need to know about what's happening in the Caribbean right now, if it's safe to travel there and whether you should cancel your holiday.\n\nWhat is happening during Hurricane Beryl in the Caribbean?\n\nAt the time of writing (Thursday 4 July), Hurricane Beryl is a category three storm. Before today, it was classed as a category five (the strongest category on the scale) and category four storm, which means experts predicted catastrophic damage to buildings and significant power damage. After Hurricane Beryl made landfall in Carriacou, Grenada, the storm passed through Jamaica on the evening of Wednesday 3 July. An island-wide overnight curfew was enacted, and a flash flood warning is currently in place. Several deaths have been reported.\n\nWhere is Hurricane Beryl currently?\n\nAt the time of writing (Thursday 4 July), the hurricane is passing south of the Cayman Islands.\n\nWhere is the path of the hurricane heading?\n\nHurricane Beryl is expected to travel from the Cayman Islands towards Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula and Belize on Thursday 4 July. From there, it is expected that the hurricane will be downgraded to a tropical storm before it emerges in the Gulf of Mexico. If Hurricane Beryl retains its strength, it could hit parts of the US, such as Louisiana and Texas.\n\nIs it safe to travel to the Caribbean?\n\nThere's little official blanket advice on travel to the Caribbean at the moment. The gov.uk website urges travellers to \"follow and monitor local and international weather updates from the US National Hurricane Center and follow the advice of local authorities, including any evacuation orders.\"\n\nAirlines such as American Airlines, JetBlue and Virgin Atlantic are permitting customers who have booked travel to some affected regions the option of rescheduling their trip further into July - this will likely change as the situation progresses, so we advise contacting your airline directly.\n\nIf your trip isn't scheduled until later in the year, consider all the options before cancelling. \"It rarely makes sense to travel into a disaster zone in the immediate aftermath of a crisis,\" Juliet Kinsman wrote after the Morocco earthquake of 2023. However, tourism is a significant source of revenue for many places impacted by Hurricane Beryl - consider if it's possible to postpone a trip rather than cancel it completely.\n\nWhat about travellers currently in affected areas of the Caribbean?\n\nWhile some flights to and from affected areas, including Virgin Atlantic flights to Jamaica, have been grounded over the past few days, these are expected to resume as the hurricane moves out of these regions. Travellers have been told to follow the advice of local authorities by sheltering in place when instructed to, and have had their hotel stays extended to allow them to remain inside safely.",

According to a Facebook post, shelters are operating on a first-come, first-served basis, and priority was given to the vulnerable - elderly, disabled and families with young children.\n\nThe current forecast track of Hurricane Beryl moving into the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula on Friday.\n\nBeryl is then expected to emerge over the southwestern Gulf of Mexico Friday night and turn northwestward.\n\nDays after Hurricane Beryl made landfall in the Windward Islands, the reality of the destruction and devastation set in.\n\nSt. Vincent and the Grenadines Prime Minister Ralph Gonsalves said in an address to the nation on Monday night that Hurricane Beryl \"devastated\" Union Island, and 90% of the homes on the island have been severely damaged or destroyed.\n\nThe airport also suffered major damage, with Gonsalves saying the facility's roof was ripped off during the storm's catastrophic winds.\n\nIn addition, at least four people were killed, and Gonsalves warned the death toll could rise as more information is received.\n\nGrenada's Prime Minister, Dickon Mitchell, reported the situation is grim, with buildings destroyed and roads impassable due to downed power lines. Mitchell added that government officials from the nearby island of Carriacou reported at least two deaths and that \"the possibility that there will be more fatalities remains a grim reality.\"\n\nAccording to reports, one person was killed in Grenada, and three were killed in Venezuela.\n\nBarbados also suffered the effects of Hurricane Beryl, but efforts to clear streets of debris and restore services began almost immediately after the storm passed.\n\nSignificant damage was reported to boats at the Bridgetown Fisheries Complex due to the storm surge flooding caused by Hurricane Beryl.\n\nBarbados Prime Minister Mia Amor Mottley toured the damage on Monday and said she would work to support those impacted by the damage to the region.\n\nShe also said all government departments, except for schools, opened on Tuesday following Hurricane Beryl's passage.\n\nAccording to officials, the Port of Bridgetown reopened for business on Tuesday morning, and flights would start to resume at Grantley Adams International Airport.\n\nCrews have also been busy restoring water to affected residents.

But the hours of heavy rain are a real concern, especially on farmland where flooding has been reported.\n\nOne resident of a rural farming community told the Reuters news agency: \"It's terrible. Everything's gone. I'm in my house and I'm scared.\"\n\n\"It's a disaster,\" said Amoy Wellington, who lives in the southern parish of St Elizabeth.\n\nOn Wednesday night I was able to go outside briefly to move my car away from overhanging trees.\n\nA full-length mirror was lying next to the car - it had probably blown off someone's balcony, a reminder that unexpected objects suddenly become missiles in winds that strong.\n\nEnergy provider, JPS, said that 65% - or about 400,000 of its customers - were without power on Thursday morning.\n\nThe hurricane has delivered \"a most devastating blow\" to parts of the island, said the MP for St Elizabeth South Western.\n\nPosting on X, Floyd Green said in his constituency \"significant numbers of roofs [have been] lost, houses destroyed, trees uprooted, light poles downed, almost all roads are impassable.\"\n\nCaribbean media is reporting that the UN has unlocked $4m (\u00a33.1m) from its emergency response fund to help the recovery in Jamaica, Grenada and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines.\n\nPrime Minister Andrew Holness thanked \"first responders, essential services, security forces and good Samaritans who have assisted others in this time of crisis\" on his X account.\n\n\"This storm will pass, and we will recover,\" he said.\n\nBeryl is now thundering towards the Cayman Islands, where \"strong winds, dangerous storm surge and damaging waves are expected\", the NHC warned.\n\nThe islands' tourism minister, Kenneth Bryan, told the BBC that while most people will be able to withstand the winds, the flood waters are also the main concern there.\n\nHurricane Beryl has already caused devastation in Grenada, St Vincent and the Grenadines, and northern Venezuela. At least seven people are known to have died.\n\nIt became the the earliest category five Atlantic hurricane in records going back around 100 years - thought to be as a result of warmer sea surface temperatures.\n\nThe storm shocked meteorologists at how fast it intensified - taking just 42 hours to go from a tropical depression to a major hurricane.", "source": {"uri": "dailynews.co.zw",

Its final chapter in the Gulf of Mexico will likely include impacts in eastern Mexico and Texas.\n\nStrong winds, heavy rain, and damaging waves are impacting the Cayman Islands as Beryl blows through. The hurricane is moving quickly through the Caribbean as the core of the storm passes Grand Cayman and heads towards the Yucatan Peninsula.\n\nLate Thursday morning, the National Hurricane Center reported Beryl was located at 19.0\u00b0N 82.6\u00b0W and was moving west-northwest at 18 mph. Maximum sustained winds were 115 mph.\n\nBeryl is the earliest hurricane to reach Category 5 strength on record in the Atlantic, and it beat the previous record by more than two weeks. The previous earliest Category 5 was Hurricane Emily on July 16 during the hyperactive 2005 Atlantic hurricane season. Record warm water temperature have likely catapulted Beryl's intensity.\n\nBeryl will continue on a west-northwest track in the Caribbean Sea through the rest of this week. Although the hurricane will eventually lose some intensity because of increasingly hostile wind shear, it will still pose a considerable danger. Here's the general timeline:\n\nThursday night and Friday: While conditions will deteriorate Thursday night, Beryl is expected to make a landfall as a hurricane in Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula early Friday morning, anywhere from the Belize border and Costa Maya to Cozumel. Storm surge flooding, potentially damaging winds and flooding rain are all possible.Friday night: Heavy rain and strong wind gusts will continue in the Yucatan Peninsula through Friday. Beryl is expected to make a northwestward turn after emerging over the southwestern Gulf of Mexico Friday night.\n\nBeryl will emerge in the southwest Gulf of Mexico Friday night or early Saturday after being steered by a heat dome of high pressure over the Southeast U.S. There is lingering uncertainty in Beryl's future once it's in the Gulf of Mexico. That Southeast U.S. upper-level heat dome will both weaken and retreat off the Southeast coast, leaving a gap between that and a western U.S. heat dome.\n\nBecause of that, Beryl is expected to take a subtle northwest curl in the western Gulf of Mexico eastern Mexico or South Texas' Gulf Coast sometime Sunday or early Monday. There is some chance Beryl could slow down its forward speed either near or after landfall. Beryl will have lost strength by the time it reaches the southwest Gulf because of wind shear and land interaction.

So far it has killed at least seven people, flattened numerous homes and destroyed crops on smaller islands as it has churned through the eastern Caribbean.\n\nWind-whipped rain pounded the island for hours as residents heeded authorities' call to shelter until the storm had passed.\n\nThe US National Hurricane Center said Beryl's eyewall was \"brushing the south coast of Jamaica.\" The eyewall is where the most damaging winds and intense rainfall from a storm is found.\n\nPower was knocked out in much of the Jamaican capital.\n\nPrime Minister Andrew Holness said on Wednesday afternoon that nearly 500 people were placed in shelters. By evening, he said that Jamaica has not seen the \"worst of what could possibly happen.\"\n\nSeveral roadways in Jamaica's interior regions were impacted by fallen trees and utility poles, while some communities in the northern section were without electricity, the government's information service reported.\n\n\"We can do as much as we can do, as humanly possible, and we leave the rest in the hands of God,\" Holness said.\n\nJamaica had announced a state of emergency and was declared a disaster zone for the next seven days, in anticipation.\n\n\"Beryl has also affected the Cayman Islands and is expected to spin up to even higher speeds by Wednesday night and Thursday,\" the US National Hurricane Center (NHC) said in an advisory.\n\nLocal authorities have issued hurricane warnings as the rapidly moving hurricane has felled power lines and unleashed flash floods across smaller islands.\n\nHaiti's capital Port-au-Prince -- currently in the grip of gang violence and experiencing an ongoing humanitarian crisis -- also saw strong winds on Tuesday afternoon.\n\nThe new Haitian Prime Minister Garry Conille has warned residents to take precautions and stay alert.\n\nMeanwhile other countries in the Carribean, which have already faced the wrath of Beryl, took stock of the situation.\n\nRalph Gonsalves, prime minister of St. Vincent and the Grenadines, said in a radio interview that the country's Union Island was \"flattened\" by Beryl. \"Everybody is homeless ... It is going to be a Herculean effort to rebuild.\"\n\n\"90% of homes had been severely damaged or destroyed on one island in the Grenadines archipelago, Union Island,\" Prime Minister Gonsalves added. He confirmed one death and said more fatalities could be confirmed in the coming days.\n\nThe situation is \"Armageddon-like,\" Grenada's Prime Minister Dickon Mitchell said in a video briefing on Tuesday. He stressed that Carriacou and Petite Martinique, two of the three islands that make up the country, were badly affected by the natural disaster.\n\n\"There is no power. There is almost complete destruction of homes and buildings,\" he said, citing impassable roads due to downed power lines and destroyed fuel stations crimping supplies.\n\nScientists have said that Beryl's arrival has come earlier than is normally the case for such powerful storms. Given how the storm is rapidly strengthening, human-caused climate change might be the culprit, scientists argue.\n\nThe weather system is this year's first Atlantic hurricane and the earliest storm on record to reach the highest category on the Saffir-Simpson Scale.\n\n\"The Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale is a 1 to 5 rating based only on a hurricane's maximum sustained wind speed.

At least seven are dead in the eastern Caribbean, where Beryl first made landfall on Monday and leveled some small islands with \"98% destruction.\"\n\nEven the outermost bands of Beryl were enough to cause power outages and road closures in the Dominican Republic, but the harder hit was on Jamaica's southern coast, which got brushed by the northern eyewall of the at-the-time Category 4 hurricane.\n\nJamaicans woke up Thursday to downed power lines in Portmore, trees blocking the highway in Manchester and in south St. Elizabeth: knee-high flood waters, wet furniture and ripped-off roofs. Around 400,000 customers were without electricity overnight Wednesday, the Jamaica Public Service Company told the Jamaica Gleaner.\n\nHurricane Beryl left a trail of destruction in southern parishes where Machester and St. Elizabeth bore the brunt of Beryl's powerful winds and rain before the hurricane warning was lifted shortly before midnight and a flash flood watch went into effect.\n\nTransport Minister Daryl Vaz confirmed that while the runway at Norman Manley International Airport was not impacted, the jet bridge roof for boarding and arrival was ripped off by the storm.\n\n\"A plan will be prepared to show how the airport will operate while that area is being repaired,\" Vaz wrote on X.\n\nDue to the damage, the airport will remain closed Thursday to allow for repairs. The proposed reopening is 5 a.m. Friday, Vaz said in a statement. The country's Sangster International Airport and Ian Fleming International Airport are operational.\n\nOfficials confirmed one death so far, a 26-year-old woman who died after a tree limb fell on her, Acting Director-General at the Office of Disaster Preparedness and Emergency Management, Richard Thompson, told the Jamaica Observer.\n\nA missing man was also washed away by floodwaters, Jamaican Information Minister Dana Morris Dixon told the Observer.\n\n\"His status is unconfirmed. We grieve with the families affected,\" she told the outlet.\n\nLike a tsunami in Haiti\n\nBeryl did not spare anyone in its path, not even Haiti. Though the hurricane didn't represent a direct threat to the environmentally vulnerable country, the head of the country's Office of Civil Protection said agriculture and roads took a hit.\n\nIn the Grand'Anse region, which is closest to Jamaica, \"the plantain fields were devastated,\" Emmanuel Pierre said during an interview Wednesday morning on Port-au-Prince Magik9 radio station.\n\nPierre said in some coastal communities along the southern region, the sea came in hundreds of feet inland, \"as if it were a tsunami,\" bringing canoes and other debris in one case all the way into the center of a village. \"Houses by the sea were hit,\" he said.\n\nAmong the major damages registered so far, a road connecting the towns of Marigot and Anse-\u00e0-Pitres, which borders the Dominican Republic. The road has been cut off, preventing passage.\n\nAt least one person is reported missing, Pierre said. A fisherman who was out in Ile a Vache, an island off the coast of Les Cayes, during the storm has disappeared. In Les Cayemites, an island off the coast, the mayor's office had to dispatch rescuers amid the winds and rains to rescue the occupants of a small boat from Port-au-Prince after they reported being in distress.\n\nSpokesman St\u00e9phane Dujarric said in a statement late Wednesday that the United Nations Secretary-General is \"deeply dismayed by the destruction wreaked by Hurricane Beryl\" and promised $4 million in aid from the Central Emergency Response Fund to \"kickstart humanitarian operations\" in Grenada, Jamaica and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines.\n\nNext stop: Mexico\n\nAs of the 11 a.m. update, Beryl was packing 115 mph sustained winds and headed west-northwest at 18 mph. It was about 330 miles east-southeast of Tulum, Mexico.\n\nThe latest forecast track from the National Hurricane Center steers Beryl over the Yucatan and into the Gulf of Mexico, where it's expected to re-strengthen a bit before making yet another landfall as a Category 1 hurricane near the border of Mexico and Texas.\n\n\"While the hurricane has been an over-performer so far, this magnitude of shear should cause notable weakening over the next day or so, but Beryl is expected to still be a hurricane near the Yucatan tomorrow,\" forecasters said in the 5 a.m. discussion.", "source": {"uri":

Life-threatening flash flooding and mudslides from heavy rainfall are expected over much of the area and southern Haiti through today.\n\nThe hurricane is then expected to hit both Mexico's Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula and Belize beginning Thursday night.\n\nLooking ahead to the weekend, the National Hurricane Center says there is uncertainty over the track and intensity of the storm as it moves over the western Gulf of Mexico, but threats could reach as far as eastern Mexico and Texas on Saturday.\n\nCurrent forecasts suggest that Beryl is likely to emerge in the southwest Gulf of Mexico by Friday night or early Saturday, driven by a heat dome of high pressure over the south-east U.S.\n\nCoastal threats from Beryl could begin as early as this weekend. Onshore winds preceding the storm could lead to increasing surf, rip currents, and coastal flooding along parts of the Gulf Coast from eastern Mexico to Texas and western Louisiana starting Saturday.\n\nThese conditions may persist until just after Beryl's landfall. The rip current threat could extend even farther east along the northern Gulf Coast, posing additional hazards for holiday beachgoers.\n\nBeryl is then anticipated to take a subtle northwest turn in the western Gulf of Mexico, with potential landfall in eastern Mexico or South Texas' Gulf Coast by Sunday or early Monday.\n\nDespite weakening somewhat due to wind shear and land interaction, Beryl could still bring significant impacts to the Gulf Coast as either a tropical storm or hurricane.\n\nSome restrengthening is expected before its final landfall, underscoring the importance of preparedness for residents along the Gulf Coast from eastern Mexico to Texas.\n\nJust a few weeks ago, Tropical Storm Alberto caused significant coastal flooding along the Texas coast.\n\nAlready, Beryl has set records as the earliest hurricane ever to reach Category 4 and Category 5 power in the Atlantic with 160 mph winds clocked on Monday. Previous records were set in 1933 and 2005, two of the most active hurricane seasons ever.\n\n\"There are so many superlatives to describe Hurricane Beryl given the time of year, the location and the strength,\" Jonathan Zawislak, a meteorologist and flight director for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, told The New York Times.\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.\n\nGet the Daily Beast's biggest scoops and scandals delivered right to your inbox.

As the death toll climbs and Hurricane Beryl makes its way towards the Caribbean, potentially hitting land today (July 3), authorities are making sure all evacuation orders are complied with.\n\nIn an official update, the Foreign Office warned: \"Weather projections forecast a major hurricane to hit Jamaica, possibly as early as the morning of Wednesday, July 3.

It has passed through Jamaica, causing power outages and chaos, along with airport closures. The Cayman Islands will experience its impact on Thursday, with a trajectory set towards Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula by Friday.\n\nYesterday, the National Hurricane Centre predicted life-threatening winds and a dangerous storm surge for Jamaica, prompting authorities to advise those in flood-prone areas to prepare for possible evacuation, according to the Mirror.\n\n\"I am encouraging all Jamaicans to take the hurricane as a serious threat,\" Prime Minister Andrew Holness said in a national address: \"It is, however, not a time to panic.\", reports Bristol Live.\n\nGet all the latest and breaking news in Yorkshire by signing up to our newsletter here.\n\nToday, the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) said the warnings remained in place for Jamaica, stating: \"Disruption to services is expected island-wide. International and domestic airports are now closed and will only reopen when assessed safe to do so.\n\n\"You should follow and monitor local and international weather updates from the US National Hurricane Center and follow the advice of local authorities including any evacuation orders. See Extreme weather and natural disasters.\"\n\nBeryl is the earliest Category 5 storm to form in the Atlantic and is caused by unusually warm waters. Officials have issued a tropical storm warning that covers the entire southern coastline of Hispaniola, a landmass divided between Haiti and the Dominican Republic.\n\nAs Beryl moves through the Caribbean Sea, search and rescue teams in the southeastern area are extending their missions across the region to assess the extent of damage caused by Hurricane Beryl after it struck Carriacou, an island within Grenada's territory, as a powerful Category 4 storm.\n\nThe islands of Carriacou and Petit Martinique have been severely affected by the storm, with urgent needs for water, food, and infant formula emerging as top priorities. Plans are underway to send a response team to Carriacou on Tuesday morning.\n\nIn a sobering press conference, Grenadian Prime Minister Dickon Mitchell has painted a stark picture of the aftermath: \"The situation is grim,\" he declared. Mr Mitchell detailed the current conditions, noting widespread power outages and significant damage to properties and infrastructure.\n\nHe also spoke about the challenges facing recovery efforts, saying: \"The roads are not passable, and in many instances, they are cut off because of the large quantity of debris strewn all over the streets.\"\n\nMr Mitchell warned of the potential for further casualties given the restricted access across the island. Meanwhile, Ralph Gonsalves, prime minister of St Vincent and the Grenadines, has already pledged early support to help rebuild the devastated islands.\n\nHe highlighted the catastrophic impact on Union Island, where a staggering 90 per cent of homes have been destroyed, and forewarned of \"similar levels of devastation\" expected on Myreau and Canouan. The southeast Caribbean has not witnessed such a calamitous storm in two decades; Hurricane Ivan wreaked havoc and caused numerous deaths in Grenada 20 years ago.\n\nBeryl has emerged as the second named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, which spans from June 1 to November 30. Earlier in the month, Tropical Storm Alberto hit northeast Mexico, resulting in the deaths of four individuals.\n\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has forecasted an exceptionally active 2024 hurricane season, predicting between 17 and 25 named storms. The outlook includes up to 13 hurricanes and potentially four major hurricanes, surpassing the average season, which typically comprises 14 named storms, with seven escalating to hurricanes and three

Hurricane conditions are spreading through the island, it said.\n\nPrime Minister Andrew Holness declared a curfew from 6:00 am to 6:00 pm across the island of 2.8 million and urged Jamaicans to comply with evacuation orders.\n\n\"If you live in a low lying area, an area historically prone to flooding and landslide or if you live on the banks of a river, I implore you to evacuate to a shelter, or to safer ground,\" he said in a video posted to social media.\n\nDesmon Brown, manager of the National Stadium in Kingston, said his staff has scrambled to be ready.\n\n\"We've taped up our windows, covered our equipment -- including computers, printers and that sort of thing. Apart from that, it's mainly concrete so there's not much we can do,\" Brown told the Jamaica Observer newspaper.\n\nMexican officials were meanwhile scrambling to prepare for Beryl, which is expected to hit somewhere between the well-known tourist hotspot of Tulum and the town of Felipe Carrillo Puerto, according to Civil Protection national coordinator Laura Velazquez.\n\nBeginning Thursday \"we will have intense rains and wind gusts\" she said, announcing the deployment of hundreds of military personnel, marines and electricity workers in anticipation of damage.\n\nThe government has prepared 112 shelters with a capacity for some 20,000 people and suspended school in the state of Quintana Roo where Beryl will hit.\n\nBeryl has already left a trail of death with at least three people killed in Grenada, where the storm made landfall Monday, as well as one in St Vincent and the Grenadines and three in Venezuela.\n\nGrenada's Prime Minister Dickon Mitchell said the island of Carriacou, which was struck by the eye of the storm, has been all but cut off, with houses, telecommunications and fuel facilities there flattened.\n\nThe 13.5-square mile (35-square kilometer) island is home to around 9,000 people. At least two people there died, Mitchell said, with a third killed on the country's main island of Grenada when a tree fell on a house.\n\nIn St. Vincent and the Grenadines, one person on the island of Bequia was reported dead from the storm, while a man died in Venezuela's northeastern coastal state of Sucre when he was swept away by a flooded river, officials there said.\n\nIt is extremely rare for such a powerful storm to form this early in the Atlantic hurricane season, which runs from early June to late November.\n\nWarm ocean temperatures are key for hurricanes, and North Atlantic waters are currently between two and five degrees Fahrenheit (1-3 degrees Celsius) warmer than normal, according to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).\n\nUN climate chief Simon Stiell, who has family on the island of Carriacou, said climate change was \"pushing disasters to record-breaking new levels of destruction.\"\n\n\"Disasters on a scale that used to be the stuff of science fiction are becoming meteorological facts, and the climate crisis is the chief culprit,\" he said Monday, reporting that his parents' property was damaged.", "source": {"uri":

That means the center of circulation for dangerous Category Three Hurricane Beryl is more than 1,000 miles away from Louisiana's coastline. But ask anyone who lives in hurricane country, they'll tell you that 1,000 miles is too close. And right now with track forecast uncertainties many residents of coastal Louisiana are still very uneasy about Beryl and where the storm might go.\n\nThe graphic above is the 0200 A.M. position plot for the storm's center of circulation. That center was situation about 100 miles or so southeast of Grand Cayman Island. The storm brushed by Jamaica on Wednesday. As you might imagine, damage is still being assessed and flooding rains are still falling over many parts of that island nation.\n\nBeryl's next stop is another popular vacation destination. That would be the Riviera Maya or the eastern coast of Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula. Hurricane Warnings have already been posted for the Yucatan. Below is the latest forecast track graphic for the Beryl.\n\nThe storm has been downgraded to a Category 3 Hurricane. That is still a major hurricane according to the Saffir-Simpson scale. Further weakening of the storm is forecast and based on the most recent discussion issued by the Hurricane Center it appears as though Beryl will be a Category 1 storm when it arrives on the Mexican coast early Friday morning.\n\nAfter Beryl crosses the Yucatan it will emerge into the Bay of Campeche or the southwestern Gulf of Mexico. Model guidance is not consistent as to whether Beryl will strengthen to a hurricane again or eventually cross the coast as a strong tropical storm. The current track projections do suggest a landfall in extreme northeastern Mexico or extreme southern Texas in the nighttime hours of Sunday.\n\nThere is still some concern that Beryl could take a more northerly track and that would create issues for the upper Texas and Louisiana coast but model guidance is fairly succinct on the notion that northern Mexico will take the landfall. But remember, models are models, they are not official forecasts so don't let the models guide your important storm decisions in this storm or any tropical situation.\n\nFor Louisiana on this Fourth of July heat will be the bigger issue. There are significant rain chances forecast for the area as well. Believe it or not, there is a cold front that is affecting our forecast even more than Beryl is this morning.

The National Weather Service Forecast Office in Lake Charles released this graphic that shows southwestern Louisiana could experience rainfall totals of seven inches or more over the next seven days.\n\nI am sure at least some of that rainfall will be attributed to the influence of Beryl or the remnants of the storm.

the astronaut as the 'vantage point helps scientists understand how climate change impacts hurricanes and learn how communities can better prepare.'\n\nThe ferocious Category 5 storm has already caused significant damage after 165mph winds battered parts of the Caribbean.\n\nStorm surges of up to nine feet above typical tide levels are likely in Jamaica, as well as heavy rainfall.\n\nNational

suggested that the hurricane could skim Texas at the weekend.\n\nNow parts of the state have been added to the hurricane's forecast cone by the National Hurricane Center.\n\nLouisiana, Arkansas, Tennessee, Mississippi and Kentucky could now also be swept up in the storm's path, one model presented by hurricane expert Dr Levi Cowan shows.\n\nAt least five spaghetti models, data broken down in

in the firing line, but one additional path suggests Louisiana could see some impact too, with one possibility of the storm sweeping all six states.\n\n'It's really dependent on where the hurricane is launching from by the time we get to Friday if it's coming off the Yucatan Peninsula far enough North, it may continue gaining latitude and threaten the Northwestern Gulf of Mexico, that could mean northern Mexico or Texas and the US Gulf Coast could be threatened,' Dr Cowan said.\n\n'But if it crosses farther down say if it's a weaker storm then it would likely continue West more into Eastern Mexico.'\n\nBeryl's path will be determined by the level of pressure over the southeast.\n\nIf this drops, it will allow the storm to move northwards potentially spelling disaster for the US.\n\nGulf

We could not sleep normally with the wind, the water. Many people slept in the yard,\" said Pouchon Jean-Francois, who lives in an improvised camp in Port-au-Prince.\n\nVenezuelan Vice President Delcy Rodriguez was injured as she surveyed an area south of Beryl on Tuesday night, where the Manzanares River in Sucre state burst its banks.\n\nPresident Nicolas Maduro confirmed the injuries caused by a falling tree to his second-in-command, along with head injuries suffered by senior officials accompanying her, after intense rainfall struck inland from the country's Caribbean coastline.\n\nOn Tuesday night, Maduro told state television that three people had died and four were missing in the area, along with more than 8,000 homes damaged by torrential rains, including at least 400 destroyed.\n\nThe unusually early hurricane strengthened at a record pace, which scientists argue is almost certainly fueled by climate change.\n\nBeryl is the 2024 Atlantic season's first hurricane and the earliest storm on record to reach the highest category on the Saffir-Simpson five-stage scale. The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has forecast a large number of major hurricanes in an \"extraordinary\" season this year.\n\nAdditional confirmed fatalities so far include at least three in St. Vincent and the Grenadines, a senior official told Reuters, where Union Island has suffered severe destruction of over 90% of buildings.\n\nIn Grenada, Prime Minister Dickon Mitchell described \"Armageddon-like\" conditions with no power and widespread destruction, while also confirming three deaths.\n\nBeyond near-term impact in Jamaica and Haiti, the NHC warned that Beryl will likely make landfall on Mexico's Yucatan peninsula as early as Thursday night.\n\nIn Cancun, officials said supplies of wooden boards used to protect doors and windows were dwindling as locals and tourists prepared for Beryl's arrival.\n\nLaura Velazquez, head of Mexico's civil protection agency, encouraged tourists in Cancun and nearby Tulum to hunker down in hotel basements once the hurricane approaches, in comments to local broadcaster Milenio.\n\n(Reporting by Zahra Burton in Kingston and Harold Isaac in Port-au-Prince; Additional reporting by David Alire Garcia in Mexico City, Deisy Buitrago in Caracas and Robertson S.

In response, the North Carolina-based evangelical relief organization Samaritan's Purse has airlifted over 24 tons of emergency supplies and a team of specialists to the affected regions.\n\nOn Wednesday, Hurricane Beryl unleashed its most intense winds along Jamaica's southern coast, while relentless heavy rain and fierce winds battered a broader region, CNN reported early Thursday. From 1 p.m. on Wednesday to 1 a.m. on Thursday, Kingston endured wind gusts approaching 50 mph for 12 straight hours, with gusts exceeding 80 mph by late afternoon, the cable channel added.\n\nEarly on Thursday morning, Hurricane Beryl was positioned about 50 miles southwest of Grand Cayman and 385 miles east-southeast of Tulum, Mexico, The Associated Press reported. The hurricane was packing maximum sustained winds of 120 mph and moving west-northwest at a speed of 20 mph.\n\nAs Hurricane Beryl moved west-northwest, it remained a formidable threat with hurricane-force winds extending 45 miles from its center.\n\nEarly Thursday, Grand Cayman experienced wind speeds with gusts exceeding 50 mph and a storm surge anticipated to reach up to 4 feet. The island was also facing heavy rainfall, with rates potentially leading to flash flooding.\n\nSamaritan's Purse has quickly mobilized its Disaster Assistance Response Team, dispatching a DC-8 from Greensboro, North Carolina, loaded with vital supplies including tarps, solar lights, water units and a mobile medical unit. The effort is part of their mission to provide immediate relief and support to the hardest-hit communities, the group said in a statement to The Christian Post.\n\n\"We started building out pallets of cargo before the hurricane even made landfall and are now on the way with life-saving aid,\" said Franklin Graham, president of Samaritan's Purse, urging believers to join him \"in praying for the families who are in the path of this storm, and for our Samaritan's Purse staff who will be serving them.\"\n\nThe Evangelical relief organization's efforts are coordinated with local church partners to ensure effective distribution of resources.\n\nGuy Vital-Herne, the communications manager for World Vision, expressed concern for regions like Haiti, predicting catastrophic impacts if the storm were to hit, given the country's vulnerability to flooding and infrastructure challenges.\n\nChristian Aid's Chief of U.K. Advocacy, Sophie Powell, drew attention to the wider implications of such storms, stressing the need to allocate more funds to rebuild in the areas devastated by natural disasters.\n\n\"These are the people that desperately need loss and damage finance to help them rebuild their lives and livelihoods,\" Relief Web quoted Powell as saying. \"You cannot simply adapt to a category 5 hurricane destroying your home or killing your family. These are losses that need to be compensated and it's why getting more finance into the Loss and Damage Fund needs to be a major priority.\"\n\nAs Beryl continues its path, the Cayman Islands brace for continued severe weather with expectations of 4- to 6-inches of rainfall throughout the day, exacerbating the risk of further flooding and damage. Meanwhile, the hurricane has already inflicted severe damage across the Windward Islands, escalating into a Category 5 storm as it hit Grenada, causing widespread destruction and power outages.\n\nThe hurricane had claimed at least 10 lives across the region, as of early Thursday, with the death toll expected to rise as recovery efforts continued.\n\nIn Jamaica, the storm led to power outages and significant agricultural damage, particularly affecting plantain and banana crops.\n\nCommunities across the Caribbean are reeling from the impact, with Hurricane Beryl roaring toward Mexico.\n\nForecasters predicted that Beryl would hit land in a lightly populated region of lagoons and mangroves south of Tulum early Friday, likely as a Category 2 storm. After crossing the Yucatan Peninsula, it was anticipated to regain strength over the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico before making a second landfall on Mexico's northeast coast near the Texas border.", "source": {"uri": "christianpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Christian Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Beryl", "type": "wiki",

Through the rest of today and tonight, the hurricane will be tracking across the open western Caribbean.\n\nThe official National Hurricane Center forecast calls for the storm to weaken during this time because the computer forecast models show Beryl moving through a hostile environment of strong headwinds and dry air.\n\nThere are questions, however.\n\nFirst, the water in the western Caribbean is extraordinarily warm so there's a lot of energy for the storm to build thunderstorms to fight back against the dry air. Second, normally, the east-to-west winds blowing across the water relax in the western Caribbean, which supports storms strengthening there. Third, Beryl fought off the dry air and strong winds yesterday, and its core is still intact after taking a battering.\n\nAn intact core means the system can more easily re-intensify if the hostile conditions relax.\n\nComputer forecast models are our best tools for predicting what a storm will do, but being aware of other factors tells us that there is some uncertainty about how strong Beryl will be when it gets to the Yucat\u00e1n.\n\nEveryone on the Caribbean side of the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula, including the large resort cities of Cancun, Cozumel, and Tulum, should pay close attention to local emergency information. The weather will deteriorate later today, with the greatest impact from Beryl coming overnight.\n\nThe hurricane is likely to weaken as it passes over the Yucat\u00e1n landmass. The center will emerge in the Gulf of Mexico late tomorrow. The National Hurricane Center forecast predicts Beryl will weaken below hurricane strength when it's over land. If the storm takes a northward jog, however, like it did yesterday, it will pass over less land before getting to the Gulf.\n\nThe predicted upper-level winds over the Gulf appear reasonably conducive for Beryl to strengthen, although there will still be dry air. By then, its forward speed will have slowed significantly, so there may well be time for Beryl to regain hurricane status. We need to be ready for the storm to be stronger than the Category 1 that is forecast.\n\nA rule of forecasting says that slow-moving storms have larger errors in their forecasts. Be ready for this rule to apply to Beryl in the Gulf.\n\nThe consensus of the computer forecast models is that the center of Beryl will come ashore near the Mexico/Texas border, plus or minus. If that's correct, there would be significant impacts in South Texas: gusty winds, heavy rain, and storm surge along the coast. That's the same coastline that was impacted by circulation around Hurricane Alberto earlier this year.\n\nThe storm is likely to arc north to one degree or the other in the Gulf because a dip in the jet stream over the Midwest will tug on it. If Beryl stays reasonably strong, the odds favor it tracking farther north and having a bigger impact on Texas. If the upper-level winds and dry air plus a trek over the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula weaken the system significantly, the center of Beryl is more likely to track into Mexico, though there will still be effects in Texas.\n\nFor now, everybody on the Texas coast should plan to stay informed over the next few days. South Texas will definitely feel some effects. The only question is degree. Farther north, impacts are possible as well, but the chances are lower at this point.\n\nThe next disturbance we have been following, which the National Hurricane Center named Invest 96L, is just a moisture surge with gusty winds. When it passed through the eastern Caribbean islands yesterday, winds gusted over 50 miles an hour.\n\nThe system is causing gusty tropical downpours in Puerto Rico today.

Continuing periods of heavy rainfall could, however, result in flash flooding over low-lying and flood-prone areas of the island; therefore, a Flash Flood Watch is now in effect until 5:00 a.m. tomorrow.\n\nAlso, the disaster management system in Jamaica is at work including tracking activities across the island, providing support for shelter and evacuation, and maintaining communication so information can be shared and aid rendered where necessary.\n\nIn another report, scientists are claiming that human caused climate change is behind the unusually early storm's strengthening which battered the Caribbean.", "source": {"uri": "wicnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WIC News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "monica_walker@wicnews.com", "name": "Monica Walker", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Beryl", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hurricane Beryl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Island_country", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Island country"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Caribbean"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Holness", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Holness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_outage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Power outage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_sustained_wind", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Maximum sustained wind"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homelessness", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Homelessness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hurricane_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Hurricane Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power_transmission", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electric power transmission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tropical cyclone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingston,_Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kingston, Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kingston, Jamaica"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanover", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hanover"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hanover"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curfew", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Curfew"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_flood", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Flash flood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone_warnings_and_watches", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tropical cyclone warnings and watches"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emergency management"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Power_Supplies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Power Supplies", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Atmospheric_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Atmospheric Sciences", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial_Disputes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial Disputes", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Substation_and_Transmission", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Substation and Transmission", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Environment", "label": "news/Environment", "wgt": 53}], "image": "https://wicnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-07-04-114640.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9704864", "eventUri": "eng-9704864", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1058823529411764, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

Apart from that, it's mainly concrete so there's not much we can do,\" Brown told the Jamaica Observer newspaper.\n\nRalph Gonsalves, prime minister of St Vincent and the Grenadines, said that it

But it will be strong enough to deliver up to 5 feet of storm surge plus strong waves within the east coast hurricane warning area on the peninsula, and as much as 3 feet of surge on the west coast of the peninsula, where a tropical storm warning is in effect.\n\nBeryl still has not shown indications of a threat to the Louisiana coastline as it crosses the southwestern Gulf of Mexico enroute to a forecasted landfall near the Mexico-Texas border at about 10 a.m. Monday. It's forecast to be a Category 1 hurricane, with winds of 75 mph, at landfall.\n\nThe biggest threat to south Texas is likely to be heavy rains, as the storm is expected to move very slowly northwest, and still be a tropical depression by 8 a.m. Tuesday with its center near Laredo.\n\nThe Associated Press is reporting at least seven deaths resulting from Beryl's fury, including four on the islands of Grenada, Carriacou and St. Vincent and the Grenadines, and three in northern Venezuela. Four people were reported missing in Venezuela.\n\n\"Beryl continues to weaken due to the effects of westerly shear,\" said Senior Hurricane Specialist Jack Beven in a 10 a.m. Thursday discussion message. \"Radar data from the Cayman Islands shows that the eyewall is open to the south and that there is very little precipitation occurring in the southwestern semicircle. This matches the asymmetric cloud pattern seen in satellite imagery.\"\n\nThe clockwise winds around a large ridge of high pressure centered over the southeastern United States - the same one causing heat warnings in Louisiana - are expected to move Beryl in a west to west-northwest direction over the next day or two towards the Yucatan Peninsula, Beven said.\n\nA trough of low pressure that's expected to be in the central U.S. in two days should help turn Beryl more to the northwest as it's moving over the Gulf.\n\nBeven warned that differing models indicate the ultimate landfall on the Gulf's west coast range from northeastern Mexico to the middle Texas coast, and pointed out that the center's average track forecast error four days out is about 150 miles.\n\n\"Thus, it is still too early to pinpoint a specific region for the worst hazards\" when Beryl's final landfall occurs, he said.\n\nMeteorologists in the Lake Charles office of the National Weather Service are taking heed of that concern.\n\n\"The most likely impacts for our area remain minor coastal flooding, but should the track get adjusted further northward in the coming days, those impacts will change/worsen...stay tuned,\" they said in an message Thursday.\n\nForecasters are also tracking a fast-moving tropical wave over the eastern Caribbean Sea that has a 20% chance of forming into a tropical depression or storm over the next seven days.\n\nThis system is producing disorganized shower and thunderstorm activity as it moves west to west-northwest at 20 to 25 mph through the weekend, with gusty winds and heavy rainfall possible in the Greater Antilles over the next few days.\n\nIt is forecast to cross the Yucatan Peninsula and enter the southwestern Gulf of Mexico by early next week, and there's a chance of some development then, according to Senior Hurricane Specialist Brad Reinhart.", "source": {"uri": "theadvocate.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Advocate"}, "authors": [{"uri":

It left a trail of devastation across the Caribbean, killing at least 10 people.\n\nSt Vincent and the Grenadines, Grenada and Venezuela reported three deaths each, while one person died in Jamaica.\n\nThe storm destroyed almost every home on two small islands in St Vincent and the Grenadines, Mayreau and Union.\n\nHere in the capital, Kingston, while the winds were extremely strong, they weren't the hurricane gusts that were expected. But the hours of heavy rain are a real concern, especially on farmland where flooding has been reported.\n\nOne resident of a rural farming community told the Reuters news agency: \"It's terrible. Everything's gone. I'm in my house and I'm scared.\"\n\n\"It's a disaster,\" said Amoy Wellington, who lives in the southern parish of St Elizabeth.\n\nOn Wednesday night I was able to go outside briefly to move my car away from overhanging trees.\n\nA full-length mirror was lying next to the car - it had probably blown off someone's balcony, a reminder that unexpected objects suddenly become missiles in winds that strong.\n\nJamaican energy provider JPS said that 65% - or about 400,000 of its customers - were without power on Thursday morning.\n\nThe hurricane has delivered \"a most devastating blow\" to parts of the island, said the MP for St Elizabeth South Western.\n\nPosting on X, Floyd Green said in his constituency \"significant numbers of roofs [have been] lost, houses destroyed, trees uprooted, light poles downed, almost all roads are impassable.\"\n\nKing Charles III, who is also monarch in several Caribbean nations, said on Thursday he was \"profoundly saddened to learn of the dreadful destruction\" left by Hurricane Beryl.\n\nThe UN has unlocked $4m (\u00a33.1m) from its emergency response fund to help the recovery in Jamaica, Grenada and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines.\n\nPrime Minister Andrew Holness thanked \"first responders, essential services, security forces and good Samaritans who have assisted others in this time of crisis\" on his X account.\n\nBeryl became the earliest category five Atlantic hurricane in records going back around 100 years - thought to be as a result of warmer sea surface temperatures.\n\nThe storm shocked meteorologists at how fast it intensified - taking just 42 hours to go from a tropical depression to a major hurricane.", "source": {"uri": "the-star.co.ke", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Star"}, "authors": [{"uri":

A few models have it near Texas by late in the weekend as a Category 1 storm with winds around 75mph.\n\nThankfully, a large area of high pressure centered over the eastern half of the US will prevent Beryl from heading towards South Carolina.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center is also watching a wave of showers and storms to the east of Beryl in the Central Atlantic.

While Kerryne James, minister of climate resilience, environment and renewable energy, reported a death in Grenada caused by a large tree falling on a house.\n\nGrenada prime minister Dickon Mitchell said 98% of buildings on two of its smaller islands - Carriacou and Petite Martinique - were destroyed by Beryl and described the storm as \"Armageddon-like\". Elsewhere, the Prince and Princess of Wales are understood to be donating privately to relief efforts as a royal source said: \"The Prince and Princess of Wales are donating privately to the relief efforts. They continue to follow the impact of Hurricane Beryl closely.\"", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "steven_white@mirror.co.uk", "name":

Here's what you need to know", "body": "The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is warning that this storm season could be the worst in decades.\n\nAt least seven people in Jamaica have been killed and thousands of others are left assessing the damage after Hurricane Beryl hit the southern coast of the island in the early hours of Thursday.\n\nWhile Beryl was downgraded from a \"potentially catastrophic\" Category 5 hurricane to a Category 4, it remains one of the most powerful ever to hit the country, bringing winds of up to 215 km an hour.\n\nJamaica's prime minister Andrew Holness has extended an island-wide curfew to 06.00 local time (11.00 GMT) on Thursday and a flash flood warning is also in effect.\n\nSince leaving the island nation, Beryl has weakened to a Category 3 storm. As of Thursday, it's rolling towards the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula in southern Mexico, according to the US National Hurricane Centre.\n\nHurricane Beryl is the first-ever such storm to reach Category 4 strength in the Atlantic during the month of July.\n\nDespite the downgrade from Category 5, Jamaica's meteorological service warned that continuing periods of rainfall from the storm could \"result in flash flooding over low-lying and flood-prone areas of the island\".\n\nOn Thursday morning, more than 400,000 people were without power, according to the Jamaica Public Service Company (JPS).\n\nTaking to X - formerly Twitter - Holness urged residents to \"take all necessary steps for your safety and the protection of your property\" and thanked \"first responders, essential services, security forces and good Samaritans who have assisted others in this time of crisis\".\n\n\"This storm will pass, and we will recover,\" the prime minister added.\n\nThe nearby, smaller islands of Mayreau and Union Island, located in the Lesser Antilles, were even worse hit.\n\nLocal reports say about 95 per cent of homes there have been damaged by Hurricane Beryl.\n\nOfficials say three people were reported killed in Grenada and Carriacou and another death was recorded in St Vincent and the Grenadines.\n\nIn northern Venezuela, three other deaths were reported and four people remain missing, while in Grenada, one person lost their life after a tree fell on a house.\n\nOn Thursday, the hurricane's path is heading west, reaching the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula of Mexico on Thursday night or Friday morning. While it is downgraded to a Category 3, parts of the Peninsula as well as Belize are expecting damaging winds as well as dangerous storm surges and heavy rainfall.\n\nFrom Friday until early next week, the US National Hurricane Service says the forecast remains uncertain but that Beryl could potentially pose a risk to coastal Mexico and the south of Texas.\n\nIf it turns north over the Gulf rather than continuing west, it could possibly hit coastal Texas and Louisiana.\n\nThe UK foreign office has recommended avoiding Jamaica and the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula, but recommends people with plans to travel there \"should follow and monitor local and international weather updates from the US National Hurricane Centre and follow the advice of local authorities including any evacuation orders\".\n\nBarbados, Dominica, Antigua and Barbuda, St Lucia, St Vincent and the Grenadines, Grenada, St Kitts and Nevis, and Trinidad and Tobago have all been issued with travel warnings too.\n\nMultiple UK and European airlines have cancelled flights to the region.\n\nA Virgin Atlantic spokesperson told the Independent newspaper, \"Due to adverse weather conditions expected from Hurricane Beryl, we are working with the relevant airports and partners to minimise disruption to our services, however some flights are subject to delays and cancellations due to the closure of Barbados airport.\n\n\"We are contacting affected customers regarding their travel arrangements.\"\n\nSt Vincent and Barbados airports remained closed - with the latter not yet offering a date for reopening.\n\nAs always, it's best to contact your flight and accommodation providers to see what can be done about cancelling or rescheduling your trip.\n\nAs some of the region is not under travel warnings, though, the likelihood of getting a refund is slightly less clear than usual.\n\nIf your flight is cancelled by the airline or travel agent, however, you have the right to choose between a refund, rerouting or return.\n\nAs soon as you choose any of these three options, you'll no longer have rights to the other two.\n\nThe airline is required to get you to your destination as soon as possible - even if it involves travelling with a different carrier.\n\nIf they're not able to offer to reroute you or provide you with a return under comparable transport conditions at the earliest opportunity, they legally have to reimburse your flight cost.\n\nIf an airline doesn't give you the choice to rebook your ticket and you instead buy another ticket to get home under comparable transport conditions, they will give you the price difference between your original ticket and the cost of the new ticket.\n\nYou are still entitled to that choice if the cancellation happens after the aircraft took off but was forced to return to the airport of departure.\n\nAirlines are also required to give you a choice between cash or a voucher when reimbursing you.", "source": {"uri":

National Weather Service says forecast will become clearer once the storm enters the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nHurricane Beryl, which on Thursday was passing the Cayman Islands after devastating Jamaica and leaving 11 dead across the region, could make its way to Austin early next week, according to the storm's latest forecast path.\n\nAustin first appeared in Beryl's cone of uncertainty, or the projected path, on Wednesday night, according to the National Hurricane Center. The NHC's Thursday morning reports showed Central Texas within the cone's northernmost boundary, with the storm potentially reaching Austin within the next five days.\n\nNational Weather Service Meteorologist Mack Morris told the American-Statesman on Thursday that Austin's inclusion within the cone far from guarantees that the city will endure the impact of what is now a Category 3 storm, which could be downgraded to a Category 1 by the time it reaches Texas. After all, the NHC's forecast cone grows larger the farther away it is from the storm due to uncertainty.\n\n\"For us it's still an uncertain forecast,\" Morris said. \"We should start to get a better idea on exactly where it's going to go once it makes its way to the Gulf (of Mexico). But that's still another day-and-a-half away.\"\n\nMore: History-making Hurricane Beryl likely to hit South Texas as Cat 1 storm next week, NWS says\n\nAfter barraging through Jamaica on Wednesday, Beryl is expected to approach and move past the Cayman Islands Thursday as it heads west toward western Cuba and Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula, which includes the resort city of Cancun.\n\nThe weather service office in Corpus Christi said Wednesday afternoon that there is a growing chance the storm could make landfall in northeast Mexico or the South Texas coast as a Category 1 hurricane.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center has cautioned those planning to travel to Texas' coastline over the Fourth of July weekend to be aware of the storm's potential to create dangerous swimming conditions, including aggressive rip currents.\n\nHurricane Beryl Tracker: See projected path of Category 4 storm as it heads toward Jamaica\n\nThe deciding factor for Central Texas, Morris said, will be the location of pressure fields, known as ridges and troughs, influencing on the hurricane.\n\nA ridge will push Beryl clockwise, largely west and away from the north. Conversely, a trough sends the storm's forces northward. If the trough weakens the ridge, Beryl could move more into Texas.\n\nIf the storm were to reach Austin, it wouldn't be until Monday or Tuesday at the earliest, Morris said.\n\nUpdates on Hurricane Beryl's trajectory can be found on the National Hurricane Center's website.", "source": {"uri": "eu.statesman.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "USA TODAY"}, "authors": [{"uri": "austin_american_statesman@eu.statesman.com", "name": "Austin American-Statesman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Beryl", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hurricane Beryl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Weather_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Weather Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hurricane_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Hurricane Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Austin, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Austin, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saffir\u2013Simpson_scale", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saffir\u2013Simpson scale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gulf of Mexico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tropical cyclone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cayman_Islands", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cayman Islands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Cayman Islands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Texas", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "South Texas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landfall", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Landfall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ridge_(meteorology)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ridge (meteorology)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rip_current", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rip current"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trough_(meteorology)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trough (meteorology)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yucat\u00e1n_Peninsula", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corpus_Christi,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Corpus Christi, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Corpus Christi, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canc\u00fan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canc\u00fan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Canc\u00fan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuba", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cuba"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Cuba"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Atmospheric_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Atmospheric Sciences", "wgt": 33}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Tukong_Moosul", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Tukong Moosul", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Moving_and_Relocating/Moving", "label": "dmoz/Home/Moving and Relocating/Moving", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Strategy_and_Forecasting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Strategy and Forecasting", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 47}], "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2024/07/04/NAAS/74300802007-beryl-july-4.jpg?auto=webp&crop=1350,759,x0,y0&format=pjpg&width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9704864", "eventUri": "eng-9704864", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 141, "relevance": 1}

However, they issued strong reminders to stay sheltered until the all-clear was given.\n\nOn Wednesday, Beryl touched down in Jamaica, forcing airports to close and sending nearly 1,000 people into government-designated shelters.\n\nThe hurricane's eyewall skirted Jamaica's southern coast as a powerful category 4 storm, ripping off roofs, uprooting electric poles and trees and causing widespread flooding.\n\n\"It's terrible. Everything's gone. I'm in my house and scared,\" said Amoy Wellington, a 51-year-old cashier who lives in Top Hill, a rural farming community in southern St Elizabeth parish. \"It's a disaster.\"\n\nAccording to the most recent reports, many people in the country are without water, and on Wednesday night, officials said 60% of the population was without electricity.\n\nOn Wednesday evening, there were reports of a man who went missing after being washed away, and confirmation that a woman had died in the parish of Hanover after a tree toppled on her house, bringing the death toll to at least nine across the countries affected by the hurricane.\n\nBut officials in the multi-island countries of Grenada and St Vincent and the Grenadines (SVG) have warned that the death toll could increase as they struggle to assess the damage on some islands.\n\nIn Venezuela, President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro told state television three people had died, four were missing, and more than 8,000 homes were damaged.\n\nMexico's tourist centres of Canc\u00fan and the wider Yucat\u00e1n peninsula lie in Beryl's predicted path. Canc\u00fan's airport was thronged with tourists hoping to catch the last flights out before the storm arrived. Workers filled bags with sand and boarded up doors and windows of businesses for protection.\n\nMexico's defence ministry opened about 120 storm shelters and asked visitors to heed instructions on evacuation or other measures.\n\nBeryl is the 2024 Atlantic season's first hurricane. At its peak earlier this week was the earliest category 5 storm on record. The prime minister of St Vincent and the Grenadines (SVG) has decried a lack of political will in western Europe and the US to tackle the global climate crisis.\n\nScientists say human-caused climate breakdown has increased the occurrence of the most intense and destructive tropical storms, because warming oceans provide more energy and increase their strength.\n\nAs the storm charts its deadly course through the region, leaders are seeking support for what they described as the \"herculean effort to rebuild\".\n\nThe SVG prime minister, Ralph Gonsalves, expressed his concern about accessing grants to rebuild, while his Grenadian counterpart, Dickon Mitchell, told reporters he was hoping to trigger his country's catastrophic risk insurance policy.\n\nSince Monday, individuals, groups, countries and regional and international organisations, including the Caribbean Community (Caricom), the UN, and the Commonwealth, have pledged support to the devastated islands.\n\nOn Thursday, the Royal Navy said it would deploy its warship HMS Trent to deliver aid, including bottled water, basic emergency supplies, and equipment to the Cayman Islands.\n\nKing Charles has asked to be kept closely informed of the developing situation, and it is understood he will be making a substantial donation to the disaster recovery and relief efforts.\n\nIn a message to the people of the Caribbean who had been affected by Beryl, he said: \"My family and I have been profoundly saddened to learn of the dreadful destruction caused by Hurricane Beryl across the Caribbean. Above all, we send our heartfelt condolences to the friends and families of those who have so cruelly lost their lives.\n\n\"I have seen the extraordinary spirit of resilience and solidarity that people across the Caribbean have shown in response to such destruction - a spirit which has been called upon too often - and so I also send my particular gratitude to the emergency services and volunteers who are supporting the rescue and recovery efforts.\n\n\"At this most difficult of times, please know that our most special thoughts and prayers are with all those whose lives, livelihoods and property have been so utterly devastated.\"", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Before Beryl slammed into the island, residents were seen safeguarding their properties by boarding up windows and trimming trees. There was also a surge in supermarkets across the country, with citizens stocking up on essential supplies.\n\nMembers of the fisherfolk community also took action to protect their vessels. After Jamaica, Beryl will close in on the Cayman Islands. The Government has issued a 'stay in place' notice in preparation for the arrival of Hurricane Beryl.\n\n\"Unnecessary travel could cause added emergencies during this period of heightened response.

Later Monday night, Beryl became the earliest Category 5 hurricane on record. Driven by record hot ocean temperatures, Beryl's rapid strengthening has stunned experts.\n\nSince developing late last week, Beryl was also the the earliest Category 4 hurricane on record - before dropping to Category 3 on Monday - and is the first June major hurricane east of the Lesser Antilles on record.\n\nBeryl will continue to track slightly north of west in the short term, according to Naples Daily News. However, the influence of high pressure to the north over the southern U.S. is likely to waver, bringing the uncertainty of exactly where Beryl will go.\n\nIn recent days, Beryl's wind field has increased, extending up to 185 miles from the center and bringing South Texas -- from Brownsville to Corpus Christi -- into the edge of the storm's impact.\n\n\"From Panama City, to New Orleans, there is a low risk of direct impacts from Beryl, but from about Corpus Christi to Brownsville, Texas, the risk increases significantly due to the potential for Beryl to have more direct impacts,\" AccuWeather Chief Meteorologist Jonathan Porter said.\n\n\"That southern portion of the Texas coast is the zone we have to really watch,\" he added.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center provided an update on YouTube Tuesday morning, urging those along the Texas coast to prepare for potential impacts from Hurricane Beryl this weekend.\n\nWhether the Texas coast takes a direct hit or not, Texas will begin to feel the impacts of the storm, according to the Weather Channel. If Texas did take a direct hit, that would occur early Monday.\n\n\"Regardless of the exact track, an increase in dangerous rip currents and tidal runup along the coast is expected over the Holiday Weekend,\" NWS Corpus Christi said in a release. \"Seas will begin to increase as well, leading to extremely dangerous swimming conditions. Any outer rainbands may be capable of producing wind gusts at, or above tropical storm force and an isolated tornado will be possible.\"\n\nThese conditions would be most prominent Sunday through

What you need to know as strong storm heads to Jamaica, Mexico, Texas", "body": "BATON ROUGE, La. (BRPROUD) -- Could Hurricane Beryl hit Louisiana next week? Here's what we know about the current projection and when we'll know more about the potential effects on Louisiana.\n\nAs of Wednesday morning, Hurricane Beryl is still a Category 4 storm. It has maximum sustained wind speeds of 145 miles per hour and its pressure is 954 mb. It's moving west-northwest at 18 miles per hour through the Caribbean.\n\nJamaica will likely take a direct hit from Beryl this afternoon. Within the next few hours, devastating hurricane-force winds, a life-threatening storm surge and damaging waves will impact Jamaica. Beryl may weaken some as it interacts with land and moves into an environment where more wind shear is present. Beryl will continue moving west through the Caribbean, and it should reach the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula at the end of this week.\n\nIt is expected to weaken once it reaches the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula on Friday. Beryl may try to gain strength as it enters the Gulf over the weekend, but there may be enough wind shear to keep it at a Category 1 level or possibly just be a tropical storm as it continues moving west-northwest.\n\nIt should make landfall near the Texas and Mexico border late Sunday night or early Monday morning. There's still some disagreement between models, but there seems to be a better consensus that Beryl will make landfall near the Texas and Mexico border.\n\nTracking the Tropics: Hurricane Beryl remains powerful Category 4 storm as it moves across the Caribbean\n\nWith Beryl expected to turn more northward, higher surf and waves could impact the southern Louisiana coastline along with increased moisture in some of the outermost rainbands associated with the storm\n\nIf Beryl turns even more northward, then more significant impacts may occur in southern Louisiana early next week.\n\nFollow brproud.com/weather for the latest updates on local weather forecasts in, near Baton Rouge.\n\nCopyright 2024 Nexstar Media, Inc.

Interesting namesakes: British writer Beryl Bainbridge and British aviatrix Beryl Markham.\"\n\nOthers, meanwhile, pointed out that the name Beryl has, in fact, been on the World Meteorological Organization's list of potential storm names for decades.\n\nWxRisk, a site that tracks weather conditions in major grain-producing areas around the world, responded to Trump's post.\n\n\"The name 'Beryl' has been in use for the Atlantic since 1979, when 6 rotating alternating boy & girl lists of names were implemented by the [World Meteorological Organization],\" WxRisk wrote.\n\n\"There's nothing new about this,\" the site added.\n\nHurricane Beryl has broken multiple records, becoming the earliest-ever Category 5 storm to form in the Atlantic thanks to rising ocean temperatures.\n\nSince Trump's June 29 post, Beryl has torn through the Caribbean, making landfall Monday on the Grenadine island of Carriacou where it reportedly \"flattened\" 98% of the buildings and killed at least three people. The storm also killed three people in Venezuela and on St. Vincent.\n\nBeryl has since been downgraded to a Category 4 storm. The Associated Press reported that at least six people were killed after Beryl hit Jamaica on Wednesday.\n\nAccording to The Weather Channel, the storm is expected to continue its destructive path through the Cayman Islands, and onto Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula in the coming days, arriving in the Gulf Coast of Texas early next week.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, has had nothing to say about the storm's devastation.", "source": {"uri": "lgbtqnation.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "LGBTQ Nation"}, "authors": [{"uri": "john_russell@lgbtqnation.com", "name": "John Russell", "type": "author",

Beryl is now a category 3 storm with winds of 120 mph and gusts of 150 mph. Still, Beryl is a major hurricane and has been for now 5 days in a row. The latest track has Beryl making landfall along the Yucatan early Friday morning south of Cozumel as a category 1 or 2 hurricane. Beryl will weaken more to a tropical storm as it tracks over the Yucatan Peninsula before making it's way into the Gulf of Mexico over the weekend. From there, Beryl will be a tropical storm but could strengthen again to a category 1 hurricane before making landfall along the north Mexico or south Texas coast near Monday.\n\nCurrently landfall along the gulf coast is just south of Brownsville in northern Mexico. However, there are some signs that landfall could shift farther north into the Texas coast, which is something we're closely watching.\n\nSoutheast Texas is not out of the woods just yet though.

The NHC's Thursday morning reports showed Central Texas within the cone's northernmost boundary, with the storm potentially reaching Austin within the next five days.\n\nNational Weather Service Meteorologist Mack Morris told the American-Statesman on Thursday that Austin's inclusion within the cone far from guarantees that the city will endure the impact of what is now a Category 3 storm, which could be downgraded to a Category 1 by the time it reaches Texas. After all, the NHC's forecast cone grows larger the farther away it is from the storm due to uncertainty.\n\n\"For us it's still an uncertain forecast,\" Morris said. \"We should start to get a better idea on exactly where it's going to go once it makes its way to the Gulf (of Mexico). But that's still another day-and-a-half away.\"\n\nMore: History-making Hurricane Beryl likely to hit South Texas as Cat 1 storm next week, NWS says\n\nAfter barraging through Jamaica on Wednesday, Beryl is expected to approach and move past the Cayman Islands Thursday as it heads west toward western Cuba and Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula, which includes the resort city of Cancun.\n\nThe weather service office in Corpus Christi said Wednesday afternoon that there is a growing chance the storm could make landfall in northeast Mexico or the South Texas coast as a Category 1 hurricane.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center has cautioned those planning to travel to Texas' coastline over the Fourth of July weekend to be aware of the storm's potential to create dangerous swimming conditions, including aggressive rip currents.\n\nHurricane Beryl Tracker: See projected path of Category 4 storm as it heads toward Jamaica\n\nThe deciding factor for Central Texas, Morris said, will be the location of pressure fields, known as ridges and troughs, influencing on the hurricane.\n\nA ridge will push Beryl clockwise, largely west and away from the north. Conversely, a trough sends the storm's forces northward. If the trough weakens the ridge, Beryl could move more into Texas.\n\nIf the storm were to reach Austin, it wouldn't be until Monday or Tuesday at the earliest, Morris said.\n\nUpdates on Hurricane Beryl's trajectory can be found on the National Hurricane Center's website.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Austin American-Statesman: Hurricane Beryl could reach Austin, Texas as per 'cone of uncertainty'", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hurricane_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Hurricane Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Austin, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Austin, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Beryl", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hurricane Beryl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cayman_Islands", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cayman Islands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Cayman Islands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saffir\u2013Simpson_scale", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saffir\u2013Simpson scale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Weather_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Weather Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Texas", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "South Texas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yucat\u00e1n_Peninsula", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canc\u00fan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Canc\u00fan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Canc\u00fan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuba", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cuba"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Cuba"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landfall", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Landfall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ridge_(meteorology)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ridge (meteorology)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rip_current", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rip current"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin_American-Statesman", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Austin American-Statesman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_Day_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independence Day (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trough_(meteorology)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trough (meteorology)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tropical cyclone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corpus_Christi,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Corpus Christi, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Corpus Christi, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Atmospheric_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Atmospheric Sciences", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Tropical_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Tropical Health", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 55}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/DD8XaGckMNqTGdPbaVbNhQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD05ODE7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/austin-american-statesman/3de77b7f5ba647cea9e98549c498d9cf", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9704864", "eventUri": "eng-9704864", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 132, "relevance": 1}

Will Louisiana see rain and waves?", "body": "BATON ROUGE, La. (BRPROUD) -- Louisiana continues to monitor Major Hurricane Beryl as of Wednesday, July 3, as it moves across the Caribbean. Landfall in Mexico or Texas is expected within the next week.\n\nThe current official forecast doesn't call for the storm to strike Louisiana. However, it will be best to continue to monitor this system throughout the week. Some tropical moisture could move northward and increase rain chances near Baton Rouge.\n\nThe strong storm continued to bring dangerous conditions across the Caribbean and was impacting the Island of Jamaica on Wednesday evening. As of the 4 PM CDT advisory from the National Hurricane Center, the storm had maximum sustained winds of Category 4 strength at 140 mph and was moving west-northwest at 20 mph.\n\nThe official track weakens Beryl to a Category 2 storm as it moves westward and battles increased wind shear and drier air. The center will likely cross over the Yucatan Peninsula just to the south of Cancun before emerging into the Southwestern Gulf of Mexico weaker as a tropical storm thanks to land impacts.\n\nPast the Yucatan, there is some uncertainty on exact details of the track, although computer models have seen a better consensus on Wednesday. High pressure over the southern U.S. will help steer the storm westward. The high will shift eastward a bit, allowing a weakness in the steering pattern to help tug the storm northward.\n\nA stronger and more structurally intact Beryl past the Yucatan might favor a more northern-leaning path, while a weaker system would move west.\n\nAs of Wednesday, the path of the center will likely move ashore in northern coastal Mexico or southern coastal Texas, and impacts would be felt outside of the center path.\n\nWith very warm sea surface temperatures and more favorable environmental winds, Beryl might intensify to become a hurricane again before landfall.\n\nWith Beryl in the Gulf, it will increase the wave heights near the center and radiate rough surf up to the Northern Gulf Coast. This would also increase the risk of rip currents, so it remains vital to keep up to date with the beach forecasts if you have any plans this weekend and look out for those beach flags.\n\nCopyright 2024 Nexstar Media, Inc.

Everything's gone. I'm in my house and scared,\" Amoy Wellington, a 51-year-old cashier who lives in Top Hill, a rural farming community in southern St. Elizabeth parish, told Reuters. \"It's a disaster.\"\n\nHoneymooners Casey and Warner Haley, of Knoxville, Tennessee, told NBC News that after their wedding on Saturday they were told to hunker down at their resort in Montego Bay.\n\n\"Yesterday morning it was perfect weather. We went snorkeling and we went kayaking, and by the time we got back, the forecast had changed,\" Casey, 23, said in a phone interview Wednesday.\n\nThe couple said they immediately contacted their travel agent but were told no flights were available. At the airport, they were told the same.\n\n\"It was quite literally doomsday-type level scenery,\" Casey said. \"We went to all the flight counters, just saying, 'Hey can you get us anywhere at all, particularly in the U.S., but literally just anywhere?' And they all said, 'No, we're all booked.'\"\n\nBeryl is expected to reach Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula on Friday as a Category 2 storm, before moving into the southern Gulf of Mexico early Saturday. It's unclear whether what effect it may have on the Gulf Coast of Texas, where people in coastal areas were urged to be \"weather aware\" over the holiday weekend.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center warned Thursday that the storm could re-strengthen over the warm waters of the Gulf and reach the U.S. at or near hurricane strength.\n\n\"Almost all of the model guidance show the system near hurricane strength as Beryl approaches the western Gulf Coast, and so does the official forecast,\" the center said early Thursday.\n\nThe center added that regardless of the hurricane's track, rip currents could cause \"life-threatening beach conditions\" from late Friday and through the weekend across the Gulf coast.\n\nThe devastation across some of the Caribbean's smaller islands has been vast. Michelle Forbes, director of the National Emergency Management Organization in St. Vincent and Grenadines, said about 95% of homes on the islands of Mayreau and Union Island were either damaged or destroyed.\n\nRalph Gonsalves, St Vincent's prime minister, said in a radio interview Wednesday that it would take a \"Herculean effort\" to rebuild Union Island.", "source": {"uri": "nbcnews.com",

Officials have stated that no flights will be taking off 'until further notice' as the hurricane has wreaked havoc across the region, resulting in at least seven fatalities.\n\nLocals and tourists alike have been moved to shelters as the Category 4 storm's powerful winds batter the islands. The Prime Minister of Grenada described the extensive destruction on the island of Carriacou as \"almost Armageddon-like,\" while the leader of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines referred to the damage on Union Island as \"a devastating spectacle.\"\n\nThe US National Hurricane Centre reported that Beryl's eyewall was \"brushing the south coast of Jamaica\". The island was subjected to hours of heavy rainfall as residents heeded the call from authorities to seek shelter until the storm had passed, reports the Express.

In a recent update for UK nationals, the Foreign Office stated: \"A major hurricane is passing Jamaica on 3 July. Disruption to services is expected island-wide. International and domestic airports are now closed and will only reopen when assessed safe to do so.\n\n\"You should follow and monitor local and international weather updates from the US National Hurricane Center and follow the advice of local authorities including any evacuation orders. See Extreme weather and natural disasters.\"\n\nGrenada Prime Minister Dickon Mitchell described the situation as dire, stating: \"Almost total damage or destruction of all buildings, whether they be public buildings, homes or other private facilities. Complete devastation and destruction of agriculture.\n\n\"Complete and total destruction of the natural environment. There is literally no vegetation left anywhere on the island of Carriacou.\"\n\nJamaican Prime Minister Andrew Holness provided an update on Wednesday afternoon, revealing that nearly 500 people had been placed in shelters. By evening, he said that Jamaica had not experienced the \"worst of what could possibly happen\".\n\n\"We can do as much as we can do, as humanly possible, and we leave the rest in the hands of God,\" Mr Holness added. He also reported that several roadways were obstructed by fallen trees and utility poles, while some communities in the northern region were experiencing power outages.\n\nIn light of the impending threat from Beryl, Jamaica was put under a state of emergency with the island being declared a disaster zone hours before the storm's impact. Mr Holness announced that the disaster zone declaration would be maintained for the following seven days.\n\nAn evacuation order was issued for Jamaican communities at risk of flooding and landslides. Mr Holness called on residents to evacuate from low-lying areas. Meanwhile, in Miami, hurricane centre director Michael Brennan advised during an online briefing for those on the island to plan to remain sheltered throughout Wednesday, anticipating that conditions would only start to improve overnight.\n\nJamaica's southern coast, home to Kingston, is bracing for the worst of Beryl with coastal water levels predicted to surge between six and nine feet (1.8 to 2.7 metres) above normal tide levels in certain areas. The island is also under threat from heavy rainfall, with four to eight inches expected, and up to a foot in isolated regions, raising fears of flash flooding and mudslides due to the mountainous terrain.", "source": {"uri": "walesonline.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "WalesOnline"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ben_hurst@walesonline.co.uk", "name": "Ben Hurst", "type": "author", "isAgency":

The announcement comes as Hurricane Beryl wreaks havoc in the Caribbean, causing widespread destruction and claiming at least seven lives.\n\nLocals and travellers alike have been moved to shelters as the Category 4 storm lashes the islands with ferocious winds. Grenada's prime minister described the devastation on the Caribbean nation's island of Carriacou as \"almost Armageddon-like,\" while the prime minister of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines referred to the damage on Union Island as \"a devastating spectacle.\"\n\nThe US National Hurricane Centre reported that Beryl's eyewall was \"brushing the south coast of Jamaica\". Torrential rain battered the island for hours, with residents heeding the call from authorities to seek shelter until the storm had passed. Power outages were widespread across the capital.\n\nIn a recent update for UK citizens, the Foreign Office stated: \"A major hurricane is passing Jamaica on 3 July. Disruption to services is expected island-wide. International and domestic airports are now closed and will only reopen when assessed safe to do so. You should follow and monitor local and international weather updates from the US National Hurricane Center and follow the advice of local authorities including any evacuation orders. See Extreme weather and natural disasters\", reports the Express.\n\nGrenada Prime Minister Dickon Mitchell remarked: \"Almost total damage or destruction of all buildings, whether they be public buildings, homes or other private facilities. Complete devastation and destruction of agriculture. Complete and total destruction of the natural environment. There is literally no vegetation left anywhere on the island of Carriacou.\"\n\nJamaican Prime Minister Andrew Holness, speaking on Wednesday afternoon, disclosed that close to 500 individuals had been placed in shelters. By evening, he noted that Jamaica had been spared from the \"worst of what could possibly happen\".\n\n\"We can do as much as we can do, as humanly possible, and we leave the rest in the hands of God,\" Mr Holness commented. The government's information service reported that several roadways in the country's interior settlements were obstructed by fallen trees and utility poles, while some northern communities experienced power outages.\n\nWith Jamaica under a state of emergency, the island was designated a disaster zone just hours before Beryl's impact. Mr Holness announced that the disaster zone status would persist for the following seven days.\n\nAn evacuation directive was issued for Jamaican communities at risk of flooding and landslides. Mr Holness called on residents to evacuate low-lying areas.\n\nHurricane centre director Michael Brennan, from Miami, during an online briefing, advised islanders to remain indoors throughout Wednesday, anticipating conditions to begin improving overnight.\n\nJamaica's southern coast, home to Kingston, is bracing for the worst of Beryl with coastal water levels predicted to surge six or nine feet (1.8 to 2.7 metres) above normal tide levels in certain areas.\n\nThe island is also under threat from heavy rains of four to eight inches, and up to a foot in isolated regions, raising fears of flash flooding and mudslides due to the mountainous terrain.", "source": {"uri": "dailyrecord.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Record"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Toronto and Jamaica were also \"proactively cancelled.\"\n\n\"We continue to monitor Hurricane Beryl's path closely and will make operational changes in the name of safety as required,\" WestJet said in its update.\n\n\"Recovery flights to support guests impacted by Hurricane Beryl, will be evaluated once it is safe to resume operations.\"\n\nSunwing has also warned its customers going to or coming back from Jamaica and Cancun about potential flight disruptions.\n\n\"Customers travelling to and from Jamaica and Cancun over the next 24-48 hours are advised that Hurricane Beryl, which is expected to bring high winds and severe thunderstorms to both regions this week, may impact their travel plans with the potential for flights to be delayed,\" Sunwing said in a Wednesday alert on its

the path of powerful storm.\n\nBeryl is forecast to make landfall in a sparsely populated area of lagoons and mangroves south of Tulum in the early hours of Friday, probably as a Category 2 storm.\n\nAfter that, it is expected to cross the Yucatan Peninsula and re-strengthen over the warm Gulf of Mexico to make a second strike on Mexico's northeast coast near the Texas

Beryl was expected to pass near or over on Wednesday night or early Thursday, according to the NHC.\n\nWarm ocean temperatures are key for hurricanes, and North Atlantic waters are currently between

As the hurricane moved menacingly toward the Gulf of Mexico, the Haiti Meteorologist Unit (UMH) lifted the orange alert in effect for the southern region.\n\n.\n\nBeryl became the earliest Category 5 Atlantic Basin hurricane overnight on July 1, after hammering the Winward islands. It was downgraded to a Category 4 hurricane Wednesday and continued its destructive path toward western Caribbean islands after brushing Jamaica, where it lashed with devastating winds and heavy rainfall.\n\nAccording to meteorologists at the Weather Channel, Beryl will soon hammer the Cayman Islands and the Yucatan Peninsula before its final chapter in the Gulf of Mexico, likely bringing devastating impacts in eastern Mexico and Texas. As the storm's core passes, destructive wind gusts, storm surges, and damaging waves will be brought to the Cayman Islands.\n\nAs of Wednesday night, according to media reports, the hurricane had left a trail of destruction across several Caribbean islands. It has uprooted trees, ripped off roofs, and destroyed farms. The death toll has reached at least seven, with fatalities reported in Venezuela, Grenada, and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. The storm had caused significant damage, including power outages and flooding in these regions.\n\nPrecautionary measures and government warnings\n\nMost regions in Haiti's southwestern peninsula, including the South, South-East and Grand'Anse departments, were under hurricane watch. However, the impact has been relatively mild, with reports of rain bands, moderate wind gusts and waves above normal levels. Government officials have urged vigilance due to the potential for flooding and mudslides.\n\n\"There is a possibility of Beryl causing damage in the area, and I ask you to stay informed and follow the civil protection weather bulletins and the authorities' instructions,\" warned Haitian Prime Minister Garry Conille in a pre-recorded video message to the people in Creole.\n\n\"Let us play our part in what concerns us to mitigate the damage. We will not risk it; we will be vigilant, and the entire government will be mobilized to help. But the best way to protect ourselves is to stay vigilant and prudent,\" Conille added.\n\nBy Wednesday afternoon, some infrastructure damage was reported in Jacmel. Journalist Danise Davida confirmed that the tourist wharf and Simon Bolivard Boulevard, also known as Lakou New York (New York Courtyard), had been damaged by high sea waves.\n\nIn Les Cayes, the capital city of the South department, it rained all night on Tuesday, but the situation was relatively calm by midday on Wednesday, Kolette Bury, a resident, told The Haitian Times.\n\nAccording to Chrisnette Saint-Georges from the Haiti Meteorological Unit (UHM), Hurricane Beryl does not currently represent an imminent danger to Haiti. However, she has urged people to be vigilant and prepared.\n\nHaiti is still facing the threats of heavy rain, strong winds with risks of landslides, strong wind swells, and coastal flooding that the system could cause before its possible final chapter in the Gulf of Mexico, which will likely include impacts in eastern Mexico and Texas.\n\nAs a precaution, the UHM, in conjunction with the General Directorate of Civil Protection (DGPC) and the Haitian Maritime and Navigation Service (SEMANAH), issued a ban on all cabotage operations, particularly along the southern coastline. Small boats were formally asked to refrain from sailing within the coastal perimeter until the evening and avoid offshore adventures.\n\nPeople living in hurricane watch areas were encouraged to seek safe shelter as the threat from Beryl's eyewall intensified from moderate to strong. The UHM, in concert with the DGPC and the Permanent Secretariat for Risk and Disaster Management, asked residents in the southern departments to be vigilant. The Civil Protection Office urged those living in risky areas to make arrangements to move to temporary shelters or to safer houses.\n\n\"Those who live in risky areas must make arrangements to move to a temporary shelter or to another house in areas that are not at risk,\" Haiti's Civil Protection Office exhorted in a press release.", "source": {"uri": "haitiantimes.com", "dataType": "news",

The hurricane, which has claimed at least seven lives, has forced local residents and tourists into shelters as it unleashed powerful winds across the islands.\n\nDescribing the situation as \"almost Armageddon-like,\" Grenada's prime minister reported extensive damage on Carriacou island, while Saint Vincent and the Grenadines' leader referred to Union Island's condition as \"a devastating spectacle.\"\n\nAs Beryl's eyewall grazed Jamaica's south coast, the US National Hurricane Centre confirmed the intense rainfall and urged residents to remain in shelters. The storm's force led to widespread power outages, particularly in the capital.\n\nIn light of these events, the Foreign Office advised: \"A major hurricane is passing Jamaica on 3 July. Disruption to services is expected island-wide. International and domestic airports are now closed and will only reopen when assessed safe to do so. You should follow and monitor local and international weather updates from the US National Hurricane Center and follow the advice of local authorities including any evacuation orders. See Extreme weather and natural disasters.\"\n\nGrenada Prime Minister Dickon Mitchell described the situation as dire, stating: \"Almost total damage or destruction of all buildings, whether they be public buildings, homes or other private facilities. Complete devastation and destruction of agriculture. Complete and total destruction of the natural environment. There is literally no vegetation left anywhere on the island of Carriacou.\", reports the Express.\n\nJamaican Prime Minister Andrew Holness provided an update on Wednesday afternoon, revealing that nearly 500 people had been placed in shelters. By evening, he tempered expectations by saying that Jamaica has not seen the \"worst of what could possibly happen\".\n\n\"We can do as much as we can do, as humanly possible, and we leave the rest in the hands of God,\" Mr Holness commented. He also reported that several roadways in the country's interior settlements were affected by fallen trees and utility poles, while some communities in the northern section were experiencing power outages, as per the government's information service.\n\nIn light of the impending threat from Beryl, Jamaica was put under a state of emergency, with the island being declared a disaster zone hours before the storm's impact. Mr Holness announced that the disaster zone declaration would stay in effect for the next seven days.\n\nAn evacuation order was issued for Jamaican communities at risk of flooding and landslides. Mr Holness called on residents to evacuate from low-lying areas.\n\nMeanwhile, in Miami, hurricane centre director Michael Brennan briefed online, advising islanders to remain sheltered throughout Wednesday, with conditions expected to start improving overnight.\n\nThe southern coast of Jamaica, home to Kingston, is bracing for the worst of Beryl with coastal water levels predicted to surge between six and nine feet (1.8 to 2.7 metres) above normal tide levels in certain areas.\n\nTorrential downpours ranging from four to eight inches, and even up to a foot in some isolated regions, pose a serious risk of flash floods and mudslides on the hilly island.", "source": {"uri": "birminghammail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Birmingham Mail"}, "authors": [{"uri":

weekend.\n\nParts of the Lone Star State have since officially been added into the hurricane's forecast cone by the National Hurricane Center, with locals in southern parts warned to brace for heavy rains and gusty winds from Monday.\n\nHowever, Louisiana, Arkansas, Tennessee, Mississippi and Kentucky could now also be swept up in the storm's path, one model presented by hurricane expert Dr Levi

Beryl, most of the five models which impact the US show Texas in the firing line, but one additional path suggests Louisiana could see some impact too, with one possibility the storm sweeping all six states.\n\n'It's really dependent on where the hurricane is launching from by the time we get to Friday if it's coming off the Yucatan Peninsula far enough North, it may continue gaining latitude and threaten the Northwestern Gulf of Mexico, that could mean northern Mexico or Texas and the US Gulf Coast could be threatened,' Dr Cowan said.\n\n'But if it crosses farther down say if it's a weaker storm then it would likely continue West more into Eastern Mexico.'\n\nBeryl's path will be determined by the level of pressure over the southeast\n\nIf this drops, it will allow the storm to move

To prepare, islanders in Kingston have boarded up their windows, fishermen have pulled up their boats, and workers have dismantled roadside advertising boards to protect them from expected lashing winds. \"I am encouraging all Jamaicans to take the hurricane as a serious threat,\" Prime Minister Andrew Holness said in a public address Tuesday. \"It is, however, not a time to panic.\" Michael Brennan with the National Hurricane Center joins LiveNOW from FOX to discuss the latest.\n\nMany travelers in the Caribbean were caught off guard when Hurricane Beryl formed earlier and further east than previous storms this early in the season.\n\nTravel agents were handed a doozy of a task this week as they helped hundreds of people attempting to get out of Caribbean islands or make new travel plans. Major cruise lines changed their sailing plans instead of canceling cruises to avoid Beryl's impact, The Cruise Guy told FOX 35 Orlando.\n\nTropical Travelers CEO Jennifer Byrne said they had to help clients in St. Lucia, Grenada and Barbados all trying to find flights out before Hurricane Beryl brought 150 mph winds to the islands.\n\n\"We had so many people down there. We had so many people heading down there. It was kind of a giant mess,\" Byrne said. \"We have to go case by case. We have to look at the track of the storm. We have to look at what the airlines are telling us. We have to look at what the hotels are recommending, which island they're on, how many flights there are to get out.\"\n\nThe National Hurricane Center is forecasting an aggressive 2024 hurricane season, and Beryl has kicked off the season with a bang. Hurricane Beryl was historic because it became a major hurricane quickly and formed early in the season.\n\nTraditionally, the Caribbean is a popular travel destination during winter, but post-COVID, Byrne said people travel nonstop to the islands throughout the year.\n\nSeveral travel agents said travel insurance is helpful if or when a natural disaster crashes your vacation.\n\n\"People think insurance is a bad bet. When it comes to travel insurance, it is not a bad bet. I've been through this. I've been in this industry for 30 years. I have definitely been through my fair share of hurricanes, and you absolutely should have insurance,\" Byrne said.\n\nChristine Hardenberger, owner of Modern Travel Professionals, said not all travel insurance policies are the same but will generally cover disruptions because of a hurricane.\n\n\"Many travel insurance companies have policies that include hurricane protection. So it's really important to read the policy that you purchase and make sure that hurricane protection is included,\" Hardenberger said. \"Most airlines in events like these do offer waivers where they'll allow you to change flights without any sort of additional fees in order to help people move around.\"\n\nHardenberger recommends purchasing travel insurance early in your travel plans, well before a tropical storm or hurricane forms.\n\nVictor and Terri Cochran, of Mississippi, own a travel company and were in Grenada when Beryl brushed the island with its Category 4 strength.\n\n\"The reason we booked Grenada was to be below the latitude of where the hurricanes normally come this time of year. We're very hurricane aware, and we try to plan our trips around that,\" Victor Cochran said. \"We've had this plan for some time, but, no, we did not expect this.\"\n\nEven with their knowledge, the couple could not leave in time for the storm. Victor Cochran recommends working with a travel professional because, even if you can't leave, they can help accommodate hiccups.\n\n\"If you use somebody planning it, they have hundreds and hundreds of people that have already been there ... all these connections that they can stay in contact with and stay up to date with all the possibilities or the things that may happen while you're there,\" he said. \"To know that is priceless.\"\n\nBeryl offered a summer reminder that a hurricane does not care how early you booked your trip.\n\n\"This is unprecedented. They keep using this word. But it's absolutely true. This does not happen this early in the season,\" Byrne said. \"We don't really understand why this is happening. Is it just because the waters are warmer in the Caribbean? We don't know. But it's not great for vacationers.\"", "source": {"uri": "fox5dc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FOX 5 DC"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Beryl", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hurricane Beryl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Byrne", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jennifer Byrne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Caribbean"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tropical cyclone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travel_insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Travel insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fox Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Holness", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Holness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hurricane_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Hurricane Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlando,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Orlando, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Orlando, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingston,_Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kingston, Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kingston, Jamaica"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grenada", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grenada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Grenada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saffir\u2013Simpson_scale", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Saffir\u2013Simpson scale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_National_(Abu_Dhabi)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The National (Abu Dhabi)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_forecasting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Weather forecasting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_disaster", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Natural disaster"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Lucia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Saint Lucia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saint Lucia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbados", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Barbados"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Barbados"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mississippi", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mississippi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mississippi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Atmospheric_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Atmospheric Sciences", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Tropical_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Tropical Health", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 67}], "image": "https://images.foxtv.com/static.livenowfox.com/www.livenowfox.com/content/uploads/2024/07/1280/720/GettyImages-2160491776.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9704864", "eventUri": "eng-9704864", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 114, "relevance": 1}

Everything's gone. I'm in my house and I'm scared.\"\n\n\"It's a disaster,\" said Amoy Wellington, who lives in the southern parish of St Elizabeth.\n\nLate on Wednesday night, Jamaica's meteorological service cancelled its hurricane warning and replaced it with the flash flood warning.\n\nIt warned that continuing periods of rainfall could \"result in flash flooding over low-lying and flood-prone areas of the

Forecasters attribute Beryl's tenacious ability to maintain its strength to the record warmth of the Caribbean Sea, which has occurred across the Atlantic for the last few months.\n\nBased on current average sea-surface temperatures, the Atlantic Basin, which includes the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico, closely resembles what the sea surface temperatures would look like in September, during the peak of the hurricane season when ocean temperatures are at their warmest.\n\nThis record warmth comes at a time when, for several consecutive months, the globe has consistently recorded record-warm months and years. This record warmth is attributed to a warming planet due to the unabated use and burning of fossil fuels, which produce greenhouse gases that warm the globe.\n\nAlthough Beryl has a warmer-than-average ocean ahead of it as it moves west, the National Hurricane Centre says moderate wind shear will lead to some weakening.\n\nHowever, Beryl should remain a hurricane as it makes landfall and weaken into a tropical storm as it moves into the Gulf of Mexico this weekend.\n\nA Hurricane Warning is in effect for the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico from Puerto Costa Maya to Cancun, with a Hurricane Watch and Tropical Storm Warning for the coast of the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico south of Puerto Costa Maya to Chetumal and north of Cancun to Cabo Catoche. A Tropical Storm Watch is also in effect for Belize's coastal areas.\n\nAfter Beryl moves into the Gulf of Mexico, the NHC said Beryl may restrengthen into a hurricane as it nears northern Mexico and southern Texas this weekend.\n\nAn active tropical wave, tracked by the NHC as Invest 96L, moved across the Windwards, including Trinidad and Tobago and Barbados, yesterday, bringing periods of heavy rainfall and gusty winds to an area still cleaning up after Hurricane Beryl's passage on Monday.\n\nAccording to the Barbados Meteorological Service, a Flash Flood Warning was issued yesterday morning across Barbados as \"periods of heavy to intense showers and thunderstorms\" occurred across the island.\n\nSimilarly, forecasters warned the public of strong winds, flooding, and landslides in St Vincent and the Grenadines, where many remain homeless following the Category 4 system.\n\nYesterday, wind gusts between 50 and 60 miles per hour, just below those observed during Hurricane Beryl, were observed in St Lucia and Barbados.\n\nIn Dominica, strong winds led to a small single-engine Cessna aircraft crash on takeoff at the Canefield Airport, just on the outskirts of the capital, on Wednesday. The pilot and his wife escaped unhurt. The authorities have since launched an investigation into the incident.\n\nIn Tobago, continued rainfall led to 19 more reports of fallen trees, seven roof-related incidents, one report of flooding, and a landslide.\n\nHeavy rainfall associated with Hurricane Beryl generally stayed north as forecast, predominantly affecting Tobago and the northern half of Trinidad.\n\nHowever, despite the heavy rainfall, reservoir levels have not markedly improved across the nation's two largest reservoirs, with significant replenishment at the Hillsborough Reservoir in Tobago.\n\nBased on data taken yesterday, the Caroni Arena Dam, the country's largest dam, remains the lowest at 23.43 per cent capacity, compared to the 58.9 per cent long-term average for this time of year.\n\nNavet Reservoir has the second-lowest current capacity, at 24.69 per cent, compared to the 50.47 per cent long-term average.\n\nCompared to the last update on June 27, 2024, before the rains began, Hollis Reservoir, located in the Northern Range, increased from 22.63 per cent to now 36.23 per cent, compared to a long-term average of 45.72 per cent, increasing by approximately 142.2 million imperial

thought to be as a result of warmer sea surface temperatures.\n\nThe storm shocked meteorologists at how fast it intensified - taking just 42 hours to go from a tropical depression to a major hurricane.", "source": {"uri": "kbc.co.ke", "dataType": "news", "title": "KBC | Kenya's Watching"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Flood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tropical cyclone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Agriculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingston,_Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kingston, Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kingston, Jamaica"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Elizabeth_Parish", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saint Elizabeth Parish"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Saint Elizabeth Parish"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wellington", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wellington"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wellington"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xiamen", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Xiamen"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Xiamen"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venezuela", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Venezuela"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Venezuela"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Vincent_and_the_Grenadines", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saint Vincent and the Grenadines"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saint Vincent and the Grenadines"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grenada", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grenada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Grenada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Member of parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_district", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electoral district"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Beryl", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hurricane Beryl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorologist", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Meteorologist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saffir\u2013Simpson_scale", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Saffir\u2013Simpson scale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_III_of_Spain", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charles III of Spain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Holness", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Holness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_surface_temperature", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sea surface temperature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Monarchy of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Caribbean"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_hurricane", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlantic hurricane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Atmospheric_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Atmospheric Sciences", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 54}], "image": "https://www.kbc.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/JAMAICA-HURRICANE.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9704864", "eventUri": "eng-9704864", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "wgt": 108, "relevance": 1}

islands in the southeast Caribbean are scrambling to stay in touch with their loved ones back home as Hurricane Beryl wreaks havoc across the region.\n\nHurricane Beryl ripped through Grenada, Barbados, St. Vincent and the Grenadines and St. Lucia this week causing damage to buildings, downing power lines and killing livestock and at least six people.\n\nThe storm reached Jamaica's coast on Wednesday, leaving some London travellers stranded.\n\nStevie Perrotte, who has family in Grenada and lives on Oneida Nation of the Thames, said his family is living without power and water with trees knocked down around their home.\n\nThey are in dire need of humanitarian aid and basic necessities, Perrotte said. \"Not getting the resources and stuff that they need - I think that's the biggest problem right now.\"\n\nHurricane Beryl is the earliest Category 5 storm ever to form in the Atlantic Ocean peaking at winds of 270 kilometres per hour on Tuesday before weakening to a still-destructive Category 4.\n\nStocking up on supplies\n\nWith the hurricane roaring by Jamaica Wednesday, islanders are busy boarding their windows and stocking up on food and water.\n\n\"I've been checking my phone every second to see what news I can listen to, [to see] what is going on,\" said Londoner Andar Brown, who is keeping close watch on his parents and siblings living in St. Thomas Parish, Jamaica.\n\n\"My mother went shopping yesterday in case the place has to be locked down if all the roads get cut off,\" said Brown, \"so they will still have food and water ... to last them for a little while.\"\n\nStuck in Jamaica after flight cancellation\n\nOne London couple on their honeymoon has been stuck in Jamaica for three days after their flight was cancelled twice due to WestJet mechanic strike and airport closures.\n\n\"We were supposed to go home on July 1, and then we got an e-mail about the WestJet strike,\" said Jeff Cain. \"We realized that the hurricane was coming in after that.\"\n\nCain and his new wife, Amanda Cain, have been paying out-of-pocket to prolong their stay at a couples resort in Negril, Jamaica.\n\nThe staff at the resort have been boarding windows, cutting down trees that may be hazardous and moving tourists to the second floor, where there is less risk of flooding.\n\n\"We're going to see a hell of a storm through here,\" Jeff said.", "source": {"uri": "cbc.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Beryl", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label":

I feel bad because we\u2019re turning a point where there\u2019s bullying happening to J.Lo,\u201d McCain said, per Entertainment Weekly. \u201cShe just is a deeply unpleasant person. She had the biggest entourage I\u2019ve ever seen [when she was on \u2018The View\u2019]. More than Kim Kardashian and the president.\u201d McCain, 39, added that she didn\u2019t \u201creally understand why it was needed.\u201d The \u201cBad Republican\u201d author then alleged that Lopez, 54, had something to do with her TikTok video getting \u201ctaken down.\u201d In the clip, McCain said the \u201cSelena\u201d star was not her \u201cfavorite\u201d guest to have appeared for an interview on \u201cThe View.\u201d \u201cShe had our video taken down,\u201d she claimed, adding the word \u201callegedly\u201d since she had no proof Lopez was the one behind the violation notice. Though McCain noted that the video was later reinstated, Wilkins joked, \u201cWe\u2019re beefing with her right now.\u201d A rep for McCain told Entertainment Weekly that they \u201cdo not know how or why we received a violation notice. We pressed \u2018appeal\u2019 and the video was reinstated in a few hours.\u201d Page Six has learned that TikTok\u2019s reporting process involves both automatic detection technology as well as a system that allows other users to report videos. Because of that procedure, there is no way for McCain or Wilkins to know who reported their video, as that process is anonymous. McCain also recalled a time when Lopez allegedly had one of her employees holding \u201ca mirror with lights while they were touching her up backstage\u201d the whole time. \u201cI was a host at \u2018The View,\u2019 she was not nice. You don\u2019t always have to be so nice, but it was surprising that people like Kim Kardashian couldn\u2019t be more delightful,\u201d the mom of two said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re coming on a show for a 10-minute segment \u2026 just fake it \u2019til you make it for 10 f\u2013king minutes.\u201d Page Six has reached out to a rep for Lopez but did not immediately hear back. While McCain may have not been a fan of Lopez, her podcast guest, Carlos King, said she was \u201cso nice\u201d when he met her earlier in her career. \u201cShe was so nice, and she didn\u2019t have a big entourage. Now look, I\u2019m not a dummy. She has since became, like, this global superstar,\u201d the producer, 44, said. \u201cMegan knows I love Vegas. I went to see J.Lo in Vegas and \u2014 top five shows I\u2019ve ever been to in my life. She performed and danced for 90 minutes straight \u2014 no break. She\u2019s a hard worker, and I was shocked that people weren\u2019t buying the tickets.\u201d Lopez has had an interesting year so far. The \u201cHustlers\u201d actress recently canceled her upcoming tour to spend more time with her kids and is reportedly heading for divorce from husband Ben Affleck. Additionally, a source told The Post last month that the Bronx-born entertainer\u2019s Las Vegas residency was in trouble after her album and tour flopped. On the bright side, Lopez\u2019s new Netflix film, \u201cAtlas,\u201d has reached No. 1 on the streaming platform.", "summary": "\"I was a host at\u00a0'The View,' she was not nice.

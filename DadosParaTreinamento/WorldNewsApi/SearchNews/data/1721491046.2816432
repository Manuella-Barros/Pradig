{"id": 237074938, "title": "\u2018Life or death': Jurors to decide fate of killer in 2012 Miami Lakes love triangle murder", "text": "A love triangle turned deadly when a man \u2013 from inside jail \u2013 ordered his girlfriend's new partner to be killed \u2014 and now that man could be sentenced to death after jurors found him guilty of murder. In April, jurors found Ysrael Granda guilty of first-degree murder in connection to the death of 42-year-old Jose Soto in Miami Lakes. \u201cLadies and gentlemen, you found this defendant guilty of first-degree murder, and that\u2019s why we are here now. Now it's about life or death,\u201d Shawn Abuhoff, an Assistant State Attorney, told jurors, who now have the responsibility to recommend a punishment to the judge. Granda was already in jail when police stated he ordered his co-defendant Jonathan Rico to shoot and kill Soto. Jurors found Rico guilty of conspiracy to commit murder, but not murder in the first degree. However after the acquittal on the murder charge, Rico avoided the death penalty and awaits his own sentencing. For the next few days, prosecutors hope to convince eight out of 12 jurors that Granda, a man with two prior convictions, should get the death sentence. However, defense attorneys will ask for mercy. Granda\u2019s attorneys claim their client came from a \u201cdysfunctional\u201d family and had a traumatic childhood. \u201cA person sentenced to life without parole will never ever be released again. That person will die in prison. So don\u2019t think there is going to be any probation or good time or anything like that, \u201c said Bruce Fleisher, an attorney representing Granda. The penalty phase continues Tuesday.", "summary": "<p>A love triangle turned deadly when a man \u2013 from inside jail \u2013 ordered his girlfriend&#8217;s new partner to be killed \u2014 and now that man could be sentenced to death after jurors found him guilty of murder.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.nbcmiami.com/news/local/2012-miami-lakes-love-triangle-murder-verdict/3282914/\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.nbcmiami.com/news/local/2012-miami-lakes-love-triangle-murder-verdict/3282914/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">April</a>, jurors found Ysrael Granda guilty of first-degree murder in connection to the death of 42-year-old Jose Soto in Miami Lakes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cLadies and gentlemen, you found this defendant guilty of first-degree murder, and that\u2019s why we are here now.

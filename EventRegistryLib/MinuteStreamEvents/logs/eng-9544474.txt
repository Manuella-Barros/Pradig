Multiple art galleries line the streets and welcome visitors to explore the scene. Edmonds is also home to Cascadia Art Museum, open Thursday to Sunday. Even if you choose to skip the art galleries and museums the art scene will become abundantly clear as you stroll the streets, thanks to the outdoor murals, courtesy of the Edmonds mural project.\n\nNot only do galleries line the streets, but an abundance of top quality restaurants also share Edmonds' city center.\n\nLocated in the heart of downtown, Salt & Iron is a great choice for delicious American Northwest Cuisine. Local oysters and steaks are just two of the delicious indulgences here. The Loft Cafe + Courtyard is a great option to grab a class of local wine and listen to live music. If you're interested in waterfront dining, Anthony's HomePort Edmonds offers sweeping views of the Olympic Mountains and diners have the opportunity to watch ferry boats sail across the Puget Sound.\n\nIf you're wanting to grab a light snack or coffee on your trip, plenty of options are available as well. Edmonds Bakery on Main Street, has cookies, donuts and other baked goods that make the perfect snack. Of course, nothing goes better with pastries than coffee.

South County executives said the contract, first approved in 2010, isn't enough to keep up with current demand. While other cities have already annexed into the fire authority, Edmonds contracts for South County Fire's services.\n\nA study commissioned by the city produced three options:\n\n* Be annexed by South County Fire. Estimated cost: $17.8 million annually and a total of $77 monthly for the average household.\n\n* Relaunch the disbanded Edmonds Fire Department. Estimated cost: $19.2 million per year, $79 monthly for the average household.\n\n* Enter into a contract with the Shoreline Fire Department. Estimated cost: $24.9 million per year, $93 monthly for the average household.\n\nOn Tuesday, South County firefighter union president Patrick Moore said: \"I think we've hopefully clearly seen what probably the best option is moving forward.\"\n\n\"We'd like to continue being that option and having a permanent place to continue serving the residents of Edmonds,\" Moore said.\n\nShoreline fire's union president Doug Loeser said South County has provided good service for the city, and Edmonds should do what it can to retain that service.\n\n\"You do whatever you can to maintain your good employees,\" Loeser said Tuesday. \"I just definitely recommend the council continue to work with the regional fire authority.\"\n\nAnnexation could reduce the city's general fund expenses by over $6.6 million, according to Fitch & Associates, the company hired by the city. The move would also require voter approval before the end of 2025.\n\nEdmonds currently pays less for fire services than the other cities served by South County Fire: Mill Creek, Brier, Mountlake Terrace and Lynnwood. The department subsidizes the city's payments to keep up with demand, South County Fire Commission Chair Jim Kenny told the City Council in April.\n\nEdmonds' fire budget for 2024 was $12.5 million, but South County says fire services could cost $17.8 million if the city were annexed, according to city documents. That cost gap is one of the major reasons why the fire department chose to terminate its contract.\n\nFormer Edmonds City Council member Ron Wambolt said the city should revive its fire department, dormant since 2009.\n\n\"Reestablishing our own fire department may require expenses and possibly a vote for higher property taxes, but that's preferable to not having full control of such a major expense,\" Wambolt said.\n\nCouncil members haven't yet stated their preference, aside from Jenna Nand who has said she favored being annexed into South County.\n\nReviving the Edmonds Fire Department would cost about $19 million annually, while an initial renovation of the city's fire stations could cost about $20 million, according to the Fitch & Associates study. The city would also have to hire more personnel and order new equipment.\n\nThe study lists Shoreline Fire as an option due to the department's proximity to Edmonds, but contracting with the department would require an agreement with King County, where residents are unlikely to want to subsidize Edmonds' fire services, Nand said in April.", "source": {"uri": "heraldnet.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Herald net"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ashley_nash@heraldnet.com", "name": "Ashley Nash", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_department", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fire department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annexation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Annexation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmonds,_Washington", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Edmonds, Washington"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Edmonds, Washington"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_authority", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fire authority"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefighter", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Firefighter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoreline,_Washington", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shoreline, Washington"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Shoreline, Washington"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property_tax", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Property tax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fire station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountlake_Terrace,_Washington", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mountlake Terrace, Washington"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mountlake Terrace, Washington"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mill_Creek,_Washington", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mill Creek, Washington"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mill Creek, Washington"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynnwood,_Washington", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lynnwood, Washington"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lynnwood, Washington"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_County,_Washington", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "King County, Washington"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "King County, Washington"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brier,_Washington", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brier, Washington"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brier, Washington"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Emergency_Services", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Emergency Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law_Enforcement", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law Enforcement", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Real_Estate/Appraisal", "label": "dmoz/Business/Real Estate/Appraisal", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads_and_Highways/Construction_and_Planning", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads and Highways/Construction and Planning", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 72}], "image": "https://www.heraldnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/36278427_web1_TSR-Firetruck-EDH-201016.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544474", "eventUri": "eng-9544474", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Edmonds, Washington"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1529411764705882, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

Some of the faculty indoctrinators at these institutions have been trying to bury the Holocaust for decades.\n\nWith that as a backdrop, let's consider what real courage looks like. What follows is the heroic account of a man who put himself between the most notorious anti-Semite regime in modern history and the Jews they sought to exterminate.\n\nNot much is known of Knoxville, Tennessee native Roderick \"Roddie\" Edmonds's childhood other than he grew up in a Christian family with three brothers. After graduating high school, he enlisted in the Army at Fort Oglethorpe, Georgia.\n\nIn December 1944, then-Master Sergeant Edmonds was deployed to the European Theater of Operations with the 106th Infantry Division (\"Golden Lions\"), 422nd Regiment. On 16 December, days after Edmonds's arrival, the 422nd was attacked by the Germans as they launched their Battle of the Bulge counteroffensive. The Regiment was surrounded and cut off, and on the afternoon of 19 December, the 422nd Commander determined he could not sustain the losses and must surrender. Some Regimental elements, including the Headquarters Company in which MSG Edmonds served, held out for two more days before surrendering.\n\nOver the course of that counteroffensive, the Nazis captured more than 20,000 GIs. The men of the 422nd Regiment were marched about 50 kilometers through brutal winter weather to Gerolstein, Germany, where they were loaded on box cars and transported to Stalag IX-B in Bad Orb, Germany. There, the American prisoners were divided into groups of officers, non-commissioned officers (NCOs), and enlisted men.\n\nThe NCOs were then transported to Stalag IX-A near Ziegenhain, Germany, where MSG Edmonds was the senior noncommissioned officer in the POW camp. That meant he was responsible for the 1,292 American camp POWs.\n\nOn 27 January 1945, as it was becoming increasingly apparent that the end of the Third Reich was just months away, the camp's German Commandant, Major Siegmann, ordered Edmonds to identify all the American POWs who were Jews and assemble them outside their barracks the next morning so that they could be segregated from the rest of the prisoners.\n\nEdmonds knew what this meant for his Jewish men, so he summoned his senior NCOs and gave them instructions. What happened after sunrise on 28 January is legendary, but until recent years, it was little known.\n\nShortly after the freezing daybreak, instead of segregating the Jews as ordered, Edmonds and his senior NCOs assembled all 1,292 POWs outside their barracks.\n\nThe Nazi Commandant was furious with Edmonds, exclaiming, \"They cannot all be Jews!\"\n\nEdmonds responded, \"We are all Jews here.\"\n\nSiegmann approached Edmonds, placed his Luger pistol at his head, and again demanded, \"You will order all Jews to step forward, or I will shoot you right now.\" But MSG Edmonds did not back down, telling Siegmann: \"Major, you will have to shoot all of us because we all know who you are. This war will soon be over, and when the war is over, you will be tried as a war criminal. ... According to the Geneva Convention, we only have to give our name, rank, and serial number.\"\n\nThe Conventions make no provision for having to disclose religion, and with an Allied Victory on the horizon, he brazenly warned Siegmann again that he would be prosecuted.\n\nSiegmann reluctantly holstered his pistol and took no further action. It is estimated that Edmonds's actions that morning saved more than 100 Jews among all the POWs in the camp.\n\nOn 30 March, the POWs were liberated from Stalag IX-A by Allied Forces. It was the second day of Passover, the Jewish holiday of liberation. However, Edmonds's actions were not recognized further, and being a brave but humble man, like many World War II Veterans, in the years that followed, he preferred not to discuss the trauma and suffering he witnessed.\n\nRoddie Edmonds died in 1985, but three decades after his death, his defense of the Jewish POWs would finally be appropriately recognized.\n\nShortly after his burial, Roddie's wife, Mary Ann, gave his son Chris several diaries Roddie kept while a POW. As Chris, a Baptist minister, read the diaries, he began researching the account of his father's steadfast refusal to identify Jewish POWs. Over the next two decades, Chris was able to find Jewish soldiers his father had saved -- and they verified his actions.\n\nMedic Paul Stern, one of those Jewish POWs, recalled: \"I knew Master Sergeant Roddie Edmonds for a very short time, but I will never forget him. ... He stood for everything good in a leader, and a compassionate human being. ... Although seventy years have passed, I can still hear the words he said to the German camp commander.\"\n\nAnother Jewish POW and fellow 422nd veteran Lester Tanner, observed, \"I have spent some time looking back and realized that probably the most significant influence on my life [was] one event in January 1945 that I have rarely spoken of but which I still recall almost word for word...\"\n\nTanner described that cold winter morning: \"I would estimate that there were more than one thousand Americans standing in wide formation in front of the barracks, with Master Sergeant Roddie Edmonds standing in front of the formation with several senior noncoms beside him, of which I was one... There was no question in my mind or that of MSG Edmonds that the Germans were removing the Jewish prisoners from the general prisoner population at great risk to their survival. The U.S. Army's standing command to its ranking officers in POW camps is that you resist the enemy and care for the safety of your men to the extent possible. MSG Edmonds, at the risk of his immediate death, defied the Germans with the unexpected consequence that the Jewish prisoners were saved.\"\n\nOf Edmonds's leadership, Tanner said: \"He did not throw his rank around. You knew he knew his stuff, and he got across to you without being arrogant or inconsiderate. I admired him for his command... We were in combat on the front lines for only a short period, but it was clear that Roddie Edmonds was a man of great courage who led his men with the same capacity we had come to know in the States.\"\n\nTheir documented accounts, including that of American television host Irwin \"Sonny\" Fox, who was among those Roddie saved, were presented to Israel's Yad Vashem Center, the national organization established to memorialize victims of the Holocaust.\n\nOn 10 February 2015, Yad Vashem officially recognized Edmonds for his defense of Jewish servicemen at Stalag IX-A. He was posthumously awarded the title of \"Righteous Among the Nations,\" Israel's highest award for non-Jews who risked their own lives to save Jews during the Holocaust. Perhaps the most famous of the recipients is Oskar Schindler, whose efforts to save more than 1,000 Jews were documented by Steven Spielberg in his 1993 film, \"Schindler's List.\"\n\nEdmonds was the fifth of only five Americans -- and the only World War II serviceman -- to receive this award. Israeli Ambassador Ron Dermer and Yad Vashem Council Chairman Rabbi Lau presented Chris Edmonds the Righteous Medal and Certificate of Honor on his father's behalf.\n\nPOW Sonny Fox declared, \"That such people can exist gives you hope for humanity.\"\n\nIndeed.\n\nThe Jewish Foundation for the Righteous made a short documentary based on Chris Edmonds's book, No Surrender: A Father, A Son, and an Extraordinary Act of Heroism That Continues to Live on Today. You can view \"Following the Footsteps of My Father\" here.\n\nA few nights ago at a National Medal of Honor Heritage Center event, I was telling some friends, the descendants of another Tennessean, Alvin York, about Roddie Edmonds's heroics. We concluded there is so much goodness across the generations of American Patriots that there is an endless supply of such accounts, but they rarely rise above the din of all the negative media that saturates our senses.\n\n(I would ask that you please share this account of that goodness using the social media links below.)\n\nAnd a final note...\n\nAt the Yad Vashem ceremony, Chairman Avner Shalev observed: \"Roddie Edmonds seemed like an ordinary American soldier, but he had an extraordinary sense of responsibility and dedication to his fellow human beings. These attributes form the common thread that binds members of this select group of Righteous Among the Nations. The choices and actions of Master Sgt. Edmonds set an example for his fellow American soldiers as they stood united against the barbaric evil of the Nazis.\"\n\nRoddie Edmonds's actions should also set an example for young American citizens on college and university campuses. They should stand united against the barbaric evil of the Hamas fascists, as some brave students have done.\n\nRoddie Edmonds: Your example of valor -- a humble American Patriot defending Liberty for all above and beyond the call of duty, and in disregard for the peril to your own life -- is eternal. \"Greater love has no one than this, to lay down one's life for his friends.\" (John 15:13)\n\nJoin us in daily prayer for our Patriots in uniform -- Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, Marines, and Coast Guardsmen -- standing in harm's way in defense of American Liberty, honoring their oath \"to support and defend\" our Constitution. Pray for our Veterans, First Responders, and their families. Please consider a designated gift to support the National Medal of Honor Sustaining Fund through Patriot Foundation Trust, or make a check payable to \"NMoH Sustaining Fund\" and mail it to:",

He averaged 7.0 points and 5.8 rebounds while shooting 55.9% from the field.\n\nOn the Gophers' roster, he now joins Dawson Garcia, Parker Fox and Canisius transfer Frank Mitchell as frontcourt players who will all be heavily involved in the rotation next season. The question is, how will it look?\n\nPotential Rotation\n\nLast season, Dawson Garcia averaged 31.9 minutes per game. In 2024-25, I expect that number to look similar if not go up by a little bit.\n\nPharrel Payne averaged 23.3 minutes per game, starting 19/32 contests. Transfer Frank Mitchell averaged 28.9 minutes per game last season at Canisius, so I would expect Mitchell's outlook to look a lot like Payne's playing time a year ago.\n\nAs for the reserves, Parker Fox (14.1), Joshua Ola-Joseph (15.7) and Isaiah Ihnen (11.4) combined to play 41.2 minutes per game. So that chunk would likely be divvied up between Fox, Trey Edmonds and Kadyn Betts next season.\n\nI could see Fox's workload going up closer to 20 minutes per game, as he averaged 22.5 in March last season. So if he is near something like that, I could see Edmonds near the 12 range and Betts filling in the Ihnen role around 10.\n\nAdding Edmonds to the fold gives Ben Johnson and his staff a lot of flexibility in the frontcourt and depth if anyone were to go down.

{"uri": "2024-05-348772384", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2024-05-08", "time": "09:27:23", "dateTime": "2024-05-08T09:27:23Z", "dateTimePub": "2024-05-08T09:13:20Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.545098066329956, "url": "https://myedmondsnews.com/2024/05/council-oks-critical-aquifer-recharge-area-code-hears-fire-service-testimony-learns-more-about-landmark-proposal/", "title": "Council OKs critical aquifer recharge area code, hears fire service testimony, learns more about Landmark proposal", "body": "After more than a year of study by staff and members of the Edmonds Planning Board, the Edmonds City Council Tuesday night approved a city code amendment regarding critical aquifer recharge areas (CARAs). The council also heard a range of opinions during a public hearing on the city's options for fire and emergency medical services (EMS) and asked many questions about a proposal for affordable housing on the Landmark 99 property.\n\nCARAs are established to protect groundwater and public drinking supplies from potential contamination and to ensure adequate groundwater availability. While the council voted 6-1 April 16 to place the code amendment on the April 23 consent agenda for approval, it was pulled from consent April 23 and then tabled until environmental issues could be reviewed. Councilmember Michelle Dostsch cited concerns expressed by the Olympic View Water and Sewer District (OVWSD) about city's proposal to allow shallow underground injection control (UIC) wells to control stormwater runoff.\n\nCARAs are treated as critical areas under the state's Growth Management Act. When city code was last updated in 2016, it stated that no areas meeting criteria for CARAs existed in the city. However, in 2022, Edmonds was alerted to two CARAs in the city's jurisdiction when the OVWSD appealed the city's SEPA (State Environmental Policy Act) Determination of Nonsignificance for a stormwater code update. While the water and sewer district's appeal was denied by the hearing examiner, staff committed to updating city code to reflect the presence of possible CARAs within city boundaries. The two drinking water wells are Deer Creek Springs near the Town of Woodway and at 228th Street Southwest -- both supplement the drinking water that Olympic View purchases from the City of Seattle.\n\nCouncil President Vivian Olson Tuesday night voted to untable the CARA code amendment so it could be further discussed and voted on. Tuesday's 6-1 vote -- Dotsch opposed -- came despite a resolution passed by the OVWSD Board of Commissioners Monday night asking local jurisdictions to adopt ordinances that protect CARAS from contamination by prohibiting any new stormwater facilities, including UIC wells.\n\nCity staff reiterated their belief Tuesday night that the CARA code amendment represents the best available science at this point, and that the shallow UIC wells will do a better job of managing stormwater runoff -- and protecting the CARAs -- than taking no action at all. Staff also stressed that the stormwater portion of the revised code would be automatically updated as the Department of Ecology gets new information about different contaminants and ways to address them.\n\nDuring a public hearing on city's fire and EMS options, the council heard from residents who both supported and opposed the idea of joining the South County Fire Regional Fire Authority (RFA) -- one of three options the council is considering. South County Fire in 2017 reorganized into what is now the South Snohomish County Fire and Rescue Regional Authority. As a fire authority, the agency can be funded directly through property taxes rather than receive payment from the individual jurisdictions that contract for fire and EMS services. In essence, this means that property owners would fund the RFA directly, rather than pay taxes to the city to fund emergency and fire services. To move from an individual contract to being part of the RFA, voters in each jurisdiction need to approve this change. So far, the cities of Lynnwood, Mill Creek, Brier and Mountlake Terrace have voted to join the RFA.\n\nEdmonds had its own fire service until 2009, when financial pressures related to operating the fire department convinced the Edmonds City Council to enter into a 10-year contract with South County Fire. The city retained ownership of its three fire stations, however.\n\nIn December. South County Fire sent a two-year termination notice to the City of Edmonds, noting that Edmonds still is \"paying less for service under the current contract than the rest of the RFA.\" The council hired consulting firm Fitch and Associates to analyze the costs of various options for fire and EMS, including South County Fire. Edmonds currently pays South County Fire $12 million annually, and fire and emergency medical services costs are a concern due to recent city budget challenges.\n\nThe council is now considering three options proposed by Fitch: joining the RFA, contracting with the Shoreline Fire Department for services or restarting Edmonds' own fire department.\n\nDuring the public hearing, resident and former City Councilmember Ron Wambolt spoke in favor of the city bringing back its own fire department, while a few other speakers urged the council to be diligent in exploring the financial ramifications of all the options before them.\n\nResident Jim Ogonowski asked what would happen to the city's existing fire stations. \"Are they going to be sold? Are they going to be given (back)?\" Ogonowski also wondered \"what happens to the revenue we are currently giving as taxpayers in the general fund and is that going to redistributed to us as taxpayers once we join (the RFA), as that's going to be an additional line item in our property taxes?\"\n\nCouncilmember Neil Tibbott, who chairs the council's public safety and personnel committee, said that his committee would be discussing the fire service questions raised during public testimony at the committee's next meeting at 3:30 p.m. Tuesday, May 14.\n\nIn other business Tuesday, councilmembers heard more details regarding a proposal the city received for developing the 10-acre Landmark 99 property located at the southern edge of Edmonds' Highway 99 neighborhood. Tuesday's update came five months after the city council voted 4-3 to continue exploring whether Edmonds should acquire the $37 million property -- home to the Burlington Coat Factory and Antique Mall businesses\n\nThe two staff members working on the Landmark project -- Community Services and Economic Development Direetor Todd Tatum and Planning and Development Director Susan McLaughlin -- shared that a request for proposal for the site was issued in January. It closed on March 22, and staff received two bids that were evaluated by a six-person committee that included McLaughlin and Tatum, City Councilmembers Olson and Will Chen, and a member of the Edmonds Planning Board and the Economic Development Commission.\n\nThe proposal preferred by the committee was from primary developer J2 Housing, a Seattle-based company that focuses on building affordable housing. It includes between 826 and 1,000 units of \"workforce housing,\" with 648 units (80%) catering to those at 30% to 80% of area median income. The submitted proposal includes a mix of retail, apartments and townhomes.\n\nAs proposed, the project consists of four multifamily buildings. Three of those buildings would be apartments while the fourth would be \"entry to ownership\" townhomes. The development also includes public open space located adjacent to the townhomes, plus 60,000 square feet of retail space at the ground level. A total of 76% of the proposal would be for private use while 24% would be for public use. Examples of that public use could be an aquatics center or a community center.\n\nBuilding construction would be phased over 36 months, McLaughlin said. \"This is all up for negotiation,\" Laughlin said of the site plan.\n\nThe J2 Housing roposal was attractive to the selection committee for several reasons, McLaughlin said. \"We appreciated that this team was committed not only to building affordable housing but also to building community,\" she said. \"They are looking at the long-term horizon, and they are able to do that based on different housing models that are coming from the affordable housing sector.\"\n\nAnother plus for the committee: J2 Housing's policy of including child care facilities in each of its projects.\n\nOne of the things J2 was drawn to in the Landmark project \"is the civic piece,\" McLaughlin said. \"They see that as a real additive for providing a heart to the community and an amenity that their residents will appreciate.\"\n\nFinally, \"it was really evident that this team was committed to a partnership,\" she said. \"They saw that their objectives were our objectives, they saw mutual benefits in each of our goals and again that was quite evident during the interview process.\"\n\nThe next step, Tatum told the council, would be for staff to engage in negotiations with J2 Housing, which would lead to a Memorandum of Agreement on Due Diligence. Staff plans to bring a request to the council in June to authorize such negotiations. This would include fleshing out the details of the partnership, the due diligence on the property and the ownership and financing model. Separately from that, the city would need to finalize its plans for its portion of the property. \"Is a community center feasible?\" Tatum said. \"Can we do a community center in conjunction with additional housing -- does that lower our costs? Does that lower the cash flow scenario over a period of 10, 20 years? Do we have municipal partners for an aquatics center and what are the timings for that?\"\n\nStaff hopes to bring that due diligence memorandum back to the council by July, showing the milestones, cost components and other elements. After that, staff would provide a progress report in November 2024 and from December 2024 to February 2025, there would be \"hearings and decisions related to property ownership, financing and phasing.\"\n\nThe next steps would be an option to purchase, which would require the city and its partners to put $1 million in earnest money down on the property by March 31, 2025, and close on the property no later than Sept. 30, 2025.\n\nCouncilmember Neil Tibbott asked if the J2 Housing preferred proposal reflected desires the community expressed for the property during the city's outreach process last fall, and McLaughlin said it did reflect that master planning process.\n\nCouncilmember Jenna Nand asked about the estimated height of the multifamily buildings and McLaughlin replied they appeared to be five to seven stories. Nand also wondered whether trees now located on the property would have to be eliminated. \"We're not at that level of design at this stage,\" McLaughlin said, although she added that \"inevitably, with the scale of development we are going to see tree removal.\" McLaughlin then noted that given the large amount of surface parking now taking up much of the Landmark site, the tree canopy is likely to increase even with development.\n\nNand also questioned the idea of placing an aquatics center on the site, noting that the Dale Turner YMCA has a pool in Shoreline, within walking distance of the Landmark property. McLaughlin replied that an aquatics facility ranked high in the city's Parks, Recreation and Open Space plan. She noted that both the cities of Mountlake Terrace and Shoreline have expressed interest in partnering with the city on such a facility.\n\nNand countered that the greater need in the Highway 99 area is for a community gathering place with green space, place rather than a pool. In looking at the preferred proposal, she said she was uncertain of the value to the city in continuing its involvement, suggesting that perhaps it should revert to being a private transaction.\n\nTatum said a key reason for the city to stay involved in the project is that the addition of community space \"increases the vibrancy of the area\" and also complements the retail planned for the site.\n\nCouncilmember Susam Paine asked whether the proposed percentage of public to private space was fixed, and McLaughlin replied that everything is open to negotiation.\n\nCouncilmember Chen said that as a member of the selection committee, he was impressed by J2 Housing's ability to aquire financing for its projects and also the company's commitment to the community where its projects are located. Chen also asked McLaughlin and Tatum to confirm that no city general fund money would be used for the planning phase of the project. Tatum replied that the city had identified two pots of money to fund 2024 Landmark expenses -- a $100,000 grant from Snohomish County and $300,000 available from the county's affordable and supportive housing sales and use tax. \"I don't anticipate coming to ask for more,\" Tatum said.\n\nCouncilmember Chris Eck said that from an economic development standpoint, \"once this gets going, there will be a domino effect and I think we've seen that in other communities. Once you start that vitality project, I believe more developers, more companies want to come in and be a part of that change that they see.\"\n\nCouncilmember Dotsch said she's concerned about possibility of cost overruns, adding that making the housing affordable for such a range of income levels \"seems very challenging without a really heavy lift of money.\" She also wondered how vehicle access would be improved into and out of the site. McLaughlin replied that site access will be looked at more closely in the next phase of the project, but also said that the one of the location's attractions it is accessibility to multimodal transportation, including Community Transit's Swift line, the Interurban Trail and the new Mountlake Terrace light rail station.\n\nCouncil President Olson, who was also on the selection committee, said that she was positively impressed by the J2 Housing team, adding it was clear \"they were not building housing, they were building community.\" She said the company is able to take advantage of long-range financing tools from the federal government at very low interest rates, which helps them control their costs.\n\nGiven the city's budget difficulties, Olson said she is hopeful the city can bring in another nonprofit like the Boys and Girls Club or even a private partner to take over the open space currently designated for the city. Adding that she has been a \"no\" on previous council votes regarding the Landmark property, \"I could be a yes if we could do it privately but in the same spirit of the amenities we were trying to get to,\" Olson said.\n\nAlso on Tuesday night, the council:\n\n- Heard Mayor Mike Rosen read a proclamation in honor of Police Week, honoring the service and sacrifice of those law enforcement officers killed in the line of duty while protecting our communities.\n\n- Approved the extension of month-to-month tenancy for two wireless carriers -- TMobile and Verizon -- while leases are being negotiated for monopoles located at the city's Five Corners water reservoir.", "source": {"uri": "myedmondsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "My Edmonds News"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Edmonds said he spoke with Spartans defensive backs coach Blue Adams.\n\nEdmonds, a 6-foot-3, 175-pound defensive back from Marietta, Georgia, is ranked the No. 11 cornerback in the class of 2026, per 247Sports' composite rankings, and the 14th-best prospect in the state of Georgia.\n\nEdmonds has also received offers from SMU, Texas A&M, South Carolina, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Wisconsin, Pitt and USC, among others. He also received an offer from Georgia a day before he received his offer from the Spartans.\n\nThe soon-to-be junior plays both cornerback and wide receiver for Sprayberry High School in Marietta, Georgia. In his sophomore season, Edmonds recorded 101 yards on five receptions, 29 kickoff return yards and 30 punt return yards in 10 games, per MaxPreps. Defensively, he posted 28 tackles, five passes defensed and two interceptions in 10 games.\n\nFirst-year Michigan State coach Jonathan Smith has made a point of recruiting in the South this spring. This endeavor is quite challenging when facing SEC juggernauts like Georgia and Alabama. It is possible, though.\n\nSome key Spartans currently on the roster who came from the south include defensive back Charles Brantley (Sarasota, Florida), defensive back Malik Spencer (Buford, Georgia), defensive lineman Kris Bogle (Fort Lauderdale, Florida), defensive back Caleb Coley (Warner Robins, Georgia), wide receiver Jaron Glover (Sarasota), wide receiver Jaelen Smith (Houston, Texas) defensive back Jaylen Thompson (Murfreesboro, Tennessee), cornerback Semar Melvin (Pembroke Pines, Florida), linebacker Darius Snow (Frisco, Texas), defensive back Chance Rucker (Houston, Texas), offensive lineman Kristian Phillips (Conyers, Georgia) and defensive lineman Quindarius Dunnigan (Chattanooga, Tennessee).\n\nAccording to 247Sports, Michigan State has extended 114 offers to recruits from the class of 2026. Edmonds is one of 18 class of 2026 cornerbacks the Spartans have offered. Of those 18, eight are from SEC territory, including Edmonds.\n\nNone of Michigan State's 2026 offers have visited yet.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports

Twenty-five businesses have new art up for May, and many will have their doors open for the Third Thursday Art Walk.\n\nFrom painting to pottery, photography to calligraphy, mixed media to illustrations and -- of course -- music, there is something for everyone to enjoy.\n\nArt lovers of all ages are welcomed and encouraged to come out, meet the artists and get inspired. Take a look at the show descriptions and walking map online -- you'll want to see them all!\n\n~ ~ ~ ~\n\nMeadowdale High School's production of \"Mamma Mia!\"\n\n7 p.m., May 9, 10, 11, 16*, 17, and 18, Meadowdale Blackbox Theater, 6002 168th St. S.W., Lynnwood\n\n* The May 16th performance will be ASL interpreted.\n\nMeadowdale High School is gearing up to produce its spring musical, Mamma Mia! ABBA's hits tell the hilarious story of a young woman's search for her birth father. This sunny and funny tale unfolds on a Greek island paradise. On the eve of her wedding, a daughter's quest to discover the identity of her father brings three men from her mother's past back to the island they last visited 20 years ago. The story-telling magic of ABBA's timeless songs propels this enchanting tale of love, laughter and friendship, creating an unforgettable show. A mother. A daughter. Three possible dads. And a trip down the aisle you'll never forget!\n\n\"This is the largest musical we've put on in my five years at the school,\" said MHS drama teacher Jacqueline Meyners. \"The show will feature around 60 students in the cast and crew. Despite district budget cuts last year and with looming budget cuts next year, Meadowdale's theatre program continues to grow steadily.

His graphic novel, We Are Not Strangers, is based on true events from the experience of Jewish immigrants living side-by-side with Japanese Americans in Seattle's Central District during WWII. The book is a beautiful look at what it means to be neighbors during divisive and harmful times. Tuininga is also an artist, graphic designer, art teacher, and musician. He lives in North Bend and has written two other picture books, Why Blue and Dream On. Find out more about his works on his website.\n\nBooks will be available for purchase at the event, and the author will be available afterward to sign copies.

The exhibition will be displayed at Lynnwood Hall from May 17 through June 14. A reception celebrating the exhibition will be held at the gallery 2:30 - 4 p.m. Friday, May 17.\n\nStudents are entirely in charge of this year's exhibition. They curated their pieces, chose what to display and how to present it. This hands-on approach allowed them to actively participate in every step of the exhibition process and express their individuality and creativity in a way that reflects their vision and passion.\n\n\"By giving students more responsibility and control over the exhibition, there's been a noticeable increase in their sense of ownership and belonging, and they feel a stronger connection to the exhibition and the gallery as a whole,\" said Audineh Asaf, faculty chair of the art department. \"I have been organizing the annual student art show for a decade, and witnessing the gallery come to life this year with such dynamic energy has been the most exciting yet.\"\n\nThe Student Art Showcase is on display on the third floor of Lynnwood Hall through June 14. The gallery is open 8 a.m. - 6 p.m. Monday through Thursday, 8 a.m. - 2 p.m. Friday, and 1 - 5 p.m. Saturday.

The HUB at Mountlake Terrace High School will serve as the gallery, showcasing a diverse range of artworks created by talented students. Family, friends, neighbors and the community are invited to stop by and support student artists.\n\n~ ~ ~ ~\n\nGiveBIG 2024: Edmonds Driftwood Players LED Theatre Lighting Project\n\nWhen you GiveBIG today, you help Edmonds Driftwood Players raise critical funds to keep the theatre lit for the future.\n\nThe Wade James Theatre, built in 1968, has hosted 500 live plays and musicals. It is also home to the Edmonds Driftwood Players and has been a hub for the community's performing arts.\n\nEvery donation made through GiveBIG 2024 will help replace the current theatre lighting equipment, which -- after 40 years of transforming the EDP stage -- has exceeded its expected useful life and is beyond repair.\n\nTwo of its five electrical panels have failed, leaving EDP's lighting system at 60% of its capacity. The loss of functional lighting equipment would have a devastating impact on the theatre company's ability to stage productions.\n\nThe choice of LEDs is safer and more reliable. It will also enhance patrons' visual experience. LEDs offer more creative lighting design options while decreasing the level of skill needed and time spent on the lighting process. The replacement eliminates the costly need to repair the current broken lights, positively impacts the environment by lowering carbon emissions, and reduces electricity usage and cost.\n\nRemember to ask your employer if they will match your donation. Many local companies participate, such as BECU, Boeing, Microsoft, and Starbucks.\n\nHelp Driftwood shine bright in 2024: GiveBIG to Edmonds Driftwood Players today.\n\n-- By Elizabeth Murray", "source": {"uri": "myedmondsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "My Edmonds News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mamma_Mia!_(musical)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mamma Mia!

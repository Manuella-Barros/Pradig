Items distributed include 14,000 day-old chicks, 560 bags of chick feed, 209 fish feed, 500 bags of fertilizer, 8 motorized sprayers, and 75 rechargable knapsack sprayers. Other supports are 24 roads, which were rehabilitated, including culvert, water drainages, and provision of boreholes for water supply at four wet markets where food processing takes place to increase hygiene and reduce food contamination. Presenting the items to the benefiting farmers at OGUN-CARES FADAMA premises, OGADEP, Idi-Aba, Abeokuta, Commissioner for Agriculture, Hon. Bolu Owotomo said the State Governor, Prince Dapo Abiodun aknowledges the plight of farmers occasioned by the COVID-19 pandemic and was passionate about alleviating their plights through various intervention programmes. Owotomo gave kudos to the farmers who, in spite of the prevailing economic challenges, plant and process food for peoples consumption, thus contributing their quota in the government's strive to ensure good security. He implored farmers who are yet to benefit from the project to be patient as the distributions are being done in batches, enjoining the beneficiaries to join hands with FADAMA Team and make judicious use of the items to maximize the inherent profits. Earlier, the Permanent Secretary in the Ministry, Mr Samuel Adeogun said over 10,000 farmers have been assisted in the previous distributions across the state and they have been sending good reports on how the project has bettered their lots. In a related development the ministry has presented seven motorcycles to field officers in the Produce Department to enhance their performance and improve revenue generation, particularly in areas with challenging terrain. At the presentation ceremony in Oke-Mosan, Abeokuta, Hon. Owotomo, emphasized the Prince Abiodun-led administration's commitment to supporting the welfare of its workers by providing necessary tools for effectiveness. He expressed confidence in the produce officers' ability to reciprocate the gesture with increased revenue generation and productivity. While acknowledging that the motorcycles may not cover all 13 zones under the department, Owotomo promised that future phases would address the needs of remaining officers and zones. Meanwhile, market stalls, lock up shops and solar powered boreholes have been commisioned by the state government to enhance the linkage and agro-processing capacity of farmers and their communities. Speaking at the commissioning of agricultural infrastructural support to farmers under OGUN (IFAD ASSISTED VCDP- AF) held at Imodi, Odogbolu, Atan, Ijebu North East and Ijebu Imusin, Ijebu East local government areas of the state, Hon. Owotomo noted that the provision of the facilities was more than physical structures because it symbolizes collective effort to empower farmers and also to provide them with the tools and resources needed to thrive. He added that access to clean water for processing activities and adequate market facilities are fundamental to the success of the agricultural sector. He said that the state government has made giant strides to boost food security, enhance agricultural productivity and improve the quality of life of rural communities, adding that the infrastructure would not only improve the health and well-being of the communities, but also stimulate economic growth and development . The commissioner highlighted some of the achievements through intervention provided by the present administration to include empowerment of 3,000 farmers with farm inputs under the Ogun N-Cares, constructive partnership with institutions and agricultural investors aimed at enhancing food system, capacity building of 12,000 farmers on sustainable agriculture under the value chain development programme, OGSTEP facilities training of stakeholders and distribution of production inputs to cassava and rice farmers amongst others.

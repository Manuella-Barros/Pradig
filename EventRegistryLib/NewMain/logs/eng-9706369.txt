It began with the opening of its first cinema in that location and has since grown to become the world's second-largest cinema chain (after AMC Theatres), with 9,139 screens across 747 sites in 10 countries.\n\nIn 2012, it acquired the Picturehouse chain, which allowed it to diversify its offerings and appeal to a broader demographic.\n\nThen in 2018, the company acquired Regal Entertainment Group in 2018, which expanded its footprint in the United States, but significantly increased its debt burden.\n\nThis large debt load has placed financial strain on the company, particularly during periods of reduced revenue and cash flow.\n\nThe group was listed on the London Stock Exchange until last year, when it was taken over by investors and hedge funds after it had been hamstrung by its multibillion-pound debt pile.\n\nThe investors exchanged billions of pounds worth of debt for equity in the business, after the group also filed for bankruptcy protection in the US.\n\nEven before the Covid-19 pandemic, Cineworld and other chains were facing challenges from the growth of streaming services., with the availability of high-quality content on streaming platforms reducing the demand for traditional cinema attendance, especially for less blockbuster-oriented films.\n\nAnd in light of recent volatile rates of inflation and interest, operating costs such as rent for cinema locations, maintenance and staffing continue to be significant expenses for Cineworld.\n\nAt the time of writing, Cineworld has not publicly commented on reports of its plans to close 25% of its UK cinemas.

sites'", "body": "A MAJOR cinema chain is in talks to close dozens of sites under new plans to shore up its finances.\n\nCineworld is considering shutting down around a quarter of its approximately 100 UK multiplexes, Sky News reports.\n\nThe prospect would mean up to 25 local cinemas could close permanently under its plans.\n\nThe chain is also seeking to renegotiate rent agreements for about 50 of its locations.\n\nStruggling businesses often do this to help lower their operating costs and help retain more of their brick-and-mortar estate.\n\nHowever, landlords don't need to accept what's put forward in these discussions.\n\nThis means that up to 50 Cineworld complexes could still be at risk of closure if the chain and its landlords cannot reach an agreement.\n\nHowever, 25 cinemas will be left unaffected by the restructuring plans and remain open for the foreseeable.\n\nThe Sun understands that Cineworld's creditors and landlords will formally receive the plans in the coming weeks.\n\nA creditor is an individual, business, or financial institution to whom the company owes money or is obligated to repay a debt.\n\nThe restructuring is expected to be carried out through a specific insolvency mechanism rather than a company voluntary arrangement (CVA).\n\nInsolvency mechanisms aim to either rescue the company, liquidate it, or achieve the best return for creditors.\n\nA CVA specifically aims to allow the company to continue trading while repaying its debts over time.\n\nAs of July 2024, the cinema chain operates out of 100 Cineworld branded screens across the UK and Ireland as well as a further 28 under the Picturehouse brand.\n\nFor now, the chain's screens remain fully operational and open as usual.\n\nA Cineworld spokesperson said, \"We continue to review our options, but we don't comment on rumours and speculation.\"\n\nEarlier this month, Cineworld was said to be weighing up its options and considering a major restructuring, which could include closures.\n\nSky News reported the chain was working with restructuring adviser AlixPartners on a plan that could lead to a sale or restructuring.\n\nAccording to the broadcaster, such a move could \"put an unspecified number of its UK cinemas at risk of closure\".\n\nA restructuring plan allows a company to rework its balance sheet, restructuring debts and releasing cash into the business.\n\nAt the time of the report, a spokesperson for Cineworld said it was \"continually reviewing\" its UK operations \"like many businesses\".\n\nIt came after Cineworld emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the US late last year.\n\nFiling for a Chapter 11 bankruptcy means a company intends to reorganise its debts and assets while remaining in business.\n\nAt the time, the future of the chain's 129 UK and Irish cinemas appeared to be in danger.\n\nThe company's shares plunged almost 99% in the five years to 2023, as it was hit particularly hard by the pandemic and the enforced closure of its cinema sites.\n\nShortly after, Cineworld's UK arm collapsed into administration on July 31.\n\nThe cinema chain was delisted from the London Stock Exchange a day later.\n\nWhen a company enters administration in the UK, all control is passed to an appointed administrator, who must be a licensed insolvency practitioner.\n\nSince then appointed administrators at Alix Partners have been assessing plans for a major restructure.\n\nThe business has posted significant losses as its come under pressure from platforms offering streaming services, such as Netflix and Amazon Prime.", "source": {"uri": "thescottishsun.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Scottish Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "james_flanders@thescottishsun.co.uk", "name": "James Flanders", "type":

carried out through a specific insolvency mechanism rather than a company voluntary arrangement (CVA).\n\nThe aim of insolvency mechanisms is to either rescue the company, liquidate it, or achieve the

contemplating shutting down around a quarter of its approximately 100 UK multiplexes, Sky News reports.\n\nThe chain is also seeking to renegotiate rent agreements for about 50 of its locations, with the remaining 25 cinemas left unaffected by the restructuring plans.\n\nSources indicate that these proposals will likely be formally presented to creditors, including landlords, in the coming weeks.\n\nThe restructuring is expected to be carried out through a specific insolvency mechanism rather than a company voluntary arrangement (CVA).\n\nA Cineworld spokesperson, in response to inquiries, stated: \"We continue to review our options, but we don't comment on rumours and speculation.\"\n\nEarlier this month, Cineworld was said to be weighing up its options and considering a major restructuring, which could include closures.\n\nSky News reported the chain was working with restructuring adviser AlixPartners on a plan that could lead to a sale or restructuring.\n\nAccording to the broadcaster, such a move could \"put an unspecified number of its UK cinemas at risk of closure\".\n\nA restructuring plan lets a company rework its balance sheet so it can restructure debts and release cash into the business.\n\nAt the time of the report, a spokesperson for Cineworld said it was \"continually reviewing\" its UK operations \"like many businesses\".\n\nIt came after Cineworld emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the US late last year.\n\nFiling for a Chapter 11 bankruptcy means a company intends to reorganise its debts and assets while remaining in

Cineworld - which has 100 sites nationwide - is set to close \"dozens\" of cinema complexes in a major blow to film buffs and movie fans up and down the UK.\n\nSky News has learnt that the company, which until last year was listed on the London Stock Exchange, is considering closing about a quarter of its roughly-100 British multiplexes. Cineworld also wants to renegotiate rent agreements at a further 50 sites, with the remaining 25 untouched by the restructuring.\n\nIn response to an enquiry, a Cineworld spokesperson said: \"We continue to review our options but we don't comment on rumours and speculation.\" Sky News reported back in June that Cineworld was holding initial talks about a sale with prospective buyers.\n\nREAD MORE UK tourists on holiday in Majorca in July and August slapped with 'water cut'\n\nSky News reported that it had then switched to a formal restructuring process. In a statement issued to Sky News earlier in the month, it said: \"Like many businesses, we are continually reviewing our UK operations.\" Sky News revealed earlier this month that Cineworld had drafted in AlixPartners to consider a sale.\n\nThe company trades from more than 100 sites in Britain, including at the Picturehouse chain, and employs thousands of people, although its public relations adviser refused to confirm either figure. Cineworld, which also trades under the Picturehouse brand, filed for hapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the US in 2022 as it grappled with a multi-billion dollar debt pile.\n\nIt delisted from the London Stock Exchange in August last year after a collapse in its share price. Alix Partners, who have reportedly been hired to advise on the restructure, declined to comment. The restructuring is expected to be carried out through a specific insolvency mechanism rather than a company voluntary arrangement (CVA).", "source": {"uri": "birminghammail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Birmingham Mail"}, "authors": [{"uri": "james_rodger@birminghammail.co.uk", "name": "James Rodger", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cineworld", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cineworld"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_News", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sky News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movie_theater", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Movie theater"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplex_(movie_theater)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Multiplex (movie theater)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Stock_Exchange", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "London Stock Exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Company_voluntary_arrangement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Company voluntary arrangement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picturehouse_Cinemas", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Picturehouse Cinemas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlixPartners", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "AlixPartners"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insolvency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Insolvency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bankruptcy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_relations", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Public relations"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://i2-prod.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/article29474347.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_popcorn.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9706369", "eventUri": "eng-9706369", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 205, "relevance": 1}

They were changing hands at 300p just five years ago.\n\nIt caused it to delist from the London Stock Exchange in August 2023 after Cineworld's UK arm collapsed into administration as its share price continued to fall and fears were raised for its survival.\n\nA deal was struck last year which exchanged several billions of dollars of debt for shares, with a significant sum of fresh cash injected into the company by a group of hedge funds and investors.\n\nThe multinational, which includes cinema brands Regal, Cinema City, Picturehouse and Planet, also operates in central and eastern Europe, Israel and the United States.\n\nAs of August 2023 the company employed 28,000 workers across its global operations in 10 countries.\n\nCineworld was devastated by pandemic lockdowns forcing it to shut down its cinemas, having already racked up enormous debts through the costly takeover of US rival Regal Cinemas in 2018.\n\nDuring the pandemic, the cinema had to reduce the capacity of each cinema by around 50 per cent.\n\nMovie start times had to be staggered to prevent the build up of too many patrons in the foyer at the one time.\n\nThe cinema company received taxpayer support through furlough and tapping up shareholders for cash to avoid collapse during the pandemic.\n\nMore than 5,000 staff were furloughed while its 127 UK cinemas, including its Picturehouse brand, were shut.",

The plan was first reported by Sky News.\n\nAlixPartners is acting as an adviser for the process.\n\nCineworld said: \"We continue to review our options.\" The company declined to comment further.\n\nThe shake-up comes as Cineworld, which owned 750 cinemas across 10 different countries as of December 2021, still remains under financial stress even after it was delisted from the LSE last year after its share price collapsed. It was then taken over by its lenders.\n\nThrough a series of debt-fuelled acquisitions, first of UK-based Cineworld in 2014 and then of US-based Regal Cinemas in 2018, the Greidinger family transformed their Israeli cinema group into a global giant.\n\nBut when the pandemic struck, shuttering the industry and leading to Cineworld abandoning a $2.1bn takeover of Canadian rival Cineplex, the cinema chain's $8.8bn in debt and lease liability quickly became an obstacle.\n\nCineworld filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the US in 2022, and investors exchanged multibillion-pounds' worth of debt for equity in the business after it emerged from the proceedings.\n\nThe cinema industry has meanwhile been marked by a lack of supply. The first joint industry strike in 60 years by Hollywood actors and screenwriters last summer brought filming to a near standstill during much of 2023.\n\nCineworld's competitor Vue warned in its annual report in June of the long-lasting impact of the strikes on the industry.\n\n\"Even though film production resumed in early 2024, the impact of the strikes will be at their most material in 2024 and into 2025 due to a lower number of completed films being available for theatrical release,\" it said.", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cineworld", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cineworld"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Stock_Exchange", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "London Stock Exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movie_theater", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Movie theater"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Company_voluntary_arrangement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Company voluntary arrangement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlixPartners", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "AlixPartners"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regal_Cinemas", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Regal Cinemas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Share_price", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Share price"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sky News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cineplex_Entertainment", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cineplex Entertainment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapter_11,_Title_11,_United_States_Code", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cinema of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filmmaking", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Filmmaking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equity_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Equity (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Studios", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Studios", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ft.com%2F__origami%2Fservice%2Fimage%2Fv2%2Fimages%2Fraw%2Fhttps%253A%252F%252Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%252Fproduction%252F2a901244-70c7-4495-b452-7e4b4fbe8223.jpg%3Fsource%3Dnext-article%26fit%3Dscale-down%26quality%3Dhighest%26width%3D700%26dpr%3D1?source=next-opengraph&fit=scale-down&width=900", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9706369", "eventUri": "eng-9706369", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

There are no longer enough films people want to see to fill them.'\n\nThe company has faced problems of people not returning to the cinema post-pandemic and instead increasingly choosing to stay at home and watch new releases on streaming services. Pictured: A boarded up Cineworld cinema in London during the pandemic\n\nA number of cinema-goers took to the internet to express their views on why Cineworld was on the rocks, with many putting the blame firmly on the pricing\n\nOne comment said: 'It is too expensive to go to the cinema with the family these days!'\n\nWhile another posted: 'Hardly surprising when it's nearly a hundred pound touch for a family of four with drinks and snacks to watch a film.'\n\nWhile someone else simply posted: 'Netflix \u00a34.99 a month.'\n\nA separate comment said: 'Going to the cinema used to be a cheap day out and great for rainy days with the kids. A family of 4 could go for less than \u00a320, and they used to do movies for juniors on Saturday mornings for \u00a31 a ticket.\n\n'Now it's \u00a312 just for 1 adult ticket. It's now a special treat for a birthday or occasion, when it used to be something you could afford once or twice a month.'\n\nThe soaring prices are in part due to the pricey popcorn and drinks, which can quickly double the cost of a ticket.\n\nA number of people commented online that Cineworld's problem was due to increasing prices\n\nIn many cases, families are choosing to stay at home and opt for a far cheaper streaming service, which often has a very wide catalogue of choices.\n\nIn March a YouGov study found the most common reason for people no attending the cinema was that tickets were too expensive.\n\nIt was by far the common answer as 57 per cent of people across the UK said it was the primary reason they have not or will not go to the theatre.\n\nIn a distant second place, at 23 per cent, was the belief that theatres don't show the kinds of things that they want to see. This figure was 17 per cent among London-based non-attendees.\n\nOthers cited logistical concerns - for 20 per cent in both the capital and the wider country said the amount of effort required to get to a theatre was a top issue, while 16 per cent said they didn't have enough time to go.\n\nCineworld has been contacted for further comment about its pricing.\n\nIn March a YouGov study found the most common reason for people no attending the cinema was that tickets were too expensive\n\nFamilies cut back on the cinema due to the cost of living crisis and instead opted for streaming services such as Disney Plus and Netflix\n\nEarlier today Sources told Sky News that the insolvency mechanism employed by Cineworld was expected to be a restructuring plan which would allow it to rework its balance sheet and restructure debts.\n\nLast month it was reported Cineworld was holding talks about a sale with potential buyers, and that it had now switched to a formal restructuring process.\n\nCineworld's plans to close some of its sites come after a tough few years for the company, which is the UK cinema market leader along with Odeon and Vue.\n\nIt has faced problems of people not returning to the cinema post-pandemic and instead increasingly choosing to stay at home and watch new releases on streaming services.\n\nFamilies also cut back due to the cost of living crisis and instead opted for streaming services such as Disney Plus, which involved a number of films being released directly on that platform - bypassing cinemas altogether.\n\nTim Richards, the founder and chief executive of the cinema operator Vue International, told the BBC's Wake up to Money programme the industry was still recovering.\n\nCineworld grew under the leadership of the Greidinger family into a global giant of the film industry, acquiring chains including Regal in the US in 2018. Pictured: A view of the Regal movie theater while it was closed due to Covid in March 2021 in Times Square, New York\n\nHe said: 'We are not going to see a return to post-pandemic levels until some time probably 12 months from now.'\n\nMr Richards said there was 35 per cent fewer films released in 2022 than in the pre-pandemic era and 20 per cent fewer in 2023.\n\nHe compared this with the period between 2017 and 2019 when there were three consecutive box office world records set.\n\nThe news of Cineworld's closures comes after Picturehouse, the UK boutique cinema arm of the company, officially confirmed the closure of two historic UK venues last month.\n\nFulham Road Picturehouse and Bromley Picturehouse theatre in outer London were both revamped prior to the Covid-19 pandemic, but will now closing their doors on July 11 and August 1 respectively.\n\nBoth cinema theatres are well-known listed buildings dating back to the 1930s and are much loved venues within their respective locations.\n\nA number of social media users expressed their dismay at the decision to close the two sites in June.\n\nFulham Road Picturehouse will closing its doors on July 11\n\nBromley Picturehouse will be closing its doors on August 1\n\nA number of social media users expressed their dismay at the decision to close the two Picturehouse sites in June\n\nOne user wrote: 'A real shame this, but not surprised when the Vue cinema in Bromley was generally a lot cheaper.\n\n'While I far prefer Picturehouse, money is tight for a lot of people and so they'll go where the cheaper options are. Sad to see you go, and hope the staff are being looked after.'\n\nAnother commented: 'Too busy watching box sets on a tiny screen to instead spend an evening being entertained in this majestic beauty of a cinema.'\n\nCineworld grew under the leadership of the Greidinger family into a global giant of the film industry, acquiring chains including Regal in the US in 2018 and the British company of the same name four years prior.\n\nHowever its multibillion-dollar debt mountain led it into crisis, and forced the company into Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the U.S. in 2022.\n\nFiling for a Chapter 11 bankruptcy means a company intends to reorganise its debts and assets to have a fresh start, while remaining in business.\n\nCineworld shares were worth just 0.6p in June last year after it was hit hard by the pandemic. They were changing hands at 300p just five years ago.\n\nCineworld struck a deal last year which exchanged several billions of dollars of debt for shares, with a significant sum of fresh cash injected into the company by a group of hedge funds and investors\n\nIt caused it to delist from the London Stock Exchange in August 2023 after Cineworld's UK arm collapsed into administration as its share price continued to fall and fears were raised for its survival.\n\nA deal was struck last year which exchanged several billions of dollars of debt for shares, with a significant sum of fresh cash injected into the company by a group of hedge funds and investors.\n\nThe multinational, which includes cinema brands Regal, Cinema City, Picturehouse and Planet, also operates in central and eastern Europe, Israel and the United States.\n\nAs of August 2023 the company employed 28,000 workers across its global operations in 10 countries.\n\nCineworld was devastated by pandemic lockdowns forcing it to shut down its cinemas, having already racked up enormous debts through the costly takeover of US rival Regal Cinemas in 2018.\n\nDuring the pandemic, the cinema had to reduce the capacity of each cinema by around 50 per cent.\n\nMovie start times had to be staggered to prevent the build up of too many patrons in the foyer at the one time.\n\nThe cinema company received taxpayer support through furlough and tapping up shareholders for cash to avoid collapse during the pandemic.\n\nMore than 5,000 staff were furloughed while its 127 UK cinemas, including its Picturehouse brand, were shut.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MailOnline", "type": "wiki", "score":

It filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the US in 2022 and lodged a reorganisation plan with an American bankruptcy court from which it emerged last year. It tried to sell its US, UK and Irish businesses last year, but did not receive any acceptable offers.\n\nCineworld was founded in 1995. It expanded under the leadership of the Greidinger family and later listed on the London Stock Exchange. Its acquisition of Regal Entertainment created the second largest cinema business in the world by number of screens, and it operates in central and eastern European markets including Poland and Hungary as well as Israel and the US.\n\nThe restructuring comes as the sector continues its recovery from the lows of pandemic lockdowns.\n\nTim Richards, the founder and chief executive of the cinema operator Vue International, told the BBC's Wake up to Money programme that the industry had been recovering slowly after the pandemic but was hit again last year by the Hollywood writers' and actors' strikes, which affected film productions.\n\nThe sector was still suffering from the impact of the stoppages, he said: \"We are not going to see a return to post-pandemic levels until some time probably 12 months from now.\" Vue had gone through a restructuring with shareholders last year and was now \"in very very good shape\", he added.\n\nRichards said there were 35% fewer films released in 2022 than in the pre-pandemic era and 20% fewer in 2023. This compared with the period between 2017 and 2019 when there were three consecutive box office world records set, he said.\n\n\"The pandemic hit and then we had a pretty slow recovery both in film production and as an industry ... and then the strikes hit,\" he said. \"It could not have been a worse time. We have a supply issue and not a demand problem.\"\n\nREAD SOURCE", "source": {"uri": "businesstelegraph.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Telegraph"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cineworld", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cineworld"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movie_theater", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Movie theater"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Stock_Exchange", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "London Stock Exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picturehouse_Cinemas", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Picturehouse Cinemas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sky News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Company_voluntary_arrangement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Company voluntary arrangement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regal_Entertainment", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Regal Entertainment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapter_11,_Title_11,_United_States_Code", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bankruptcy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Europe", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Europe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vue_International", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vue International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_lockdowns", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "COVID-19 lockdowns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_office", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Box office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cinema of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filmmaking", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Filmmaking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Poland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Poland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungary", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.businesstelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Cineworld-'considers-closing-a-quarter-of-its-100-UK-cinemas.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9706369", "eventUri": "eng-9706369", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

agreements at a further 50 sites, with the remaining 25 untouched by the restructuring.\n\nSources said the proposals were expected to be formally outlined to creditors including landlords in the coming weeks.\n\nThey added that the insolvency mechanism employed by the cinema operator was expected to be a restructuring plan rather than a company voluntary arrangement (CVA).\n\nIn response to an enquiry, a Cineworld spokesperson said: \"We continue to review our options but we don't comment on rumours and speculation.\"\n\nSky News reported last month that Cineworld was holding initial talks about a sale with prospective buyers, and that it had then switched to a formal restructuring process.\n\nThe company is being advised by AlixPartners on the process.\n\nOther cinema operators are expected to step in to take over some of Cineworld's sites if a sufficient number landlords refuse to agree to the proposed terms.\n\nThe company trades from more than 100 sites in Britain, including at the Picturehouse chain, and employs thousands of people, although its public relations adviser has refused to confirm either figure.\n\nCineworld grew under the leadership of the Greidinger family into a global giant of the industry, acquiring chains including Regal in the US in 2018 and the British company of the same name four years earlier.\n\nIts multibillion dollar debt mountain led it into crisis, though, and forced the company into Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 2022.\n\nIt delisted from the London Stock Exchange last August, having seen its share price collapse amid fears for its survival.\n\nUnder the deal struck last year, several billion dollars of debt were exchanged for shares, with a significant sum of new money injected into the company by a group of hedge funds and other investors.\n\nCineworld also operates in central and Eastern Europe, Israel and the US.\n\nSince it emerged from bankruptcy protection, Cineworld has appointed a new leadership team, installing Eduardo Acuna, who ran Mexican cinema chain Cinepolis's operations in the Americas, as its chief executive.\n\nEric Foss, a former Pepsi executive, was parachuted in as Cineworld's chairman.\n\nMajor summer film releases in Britain include Despicable Me 4, A Quiet Place: Part One, and Alien: Romulus.", "source": {"uri": "news.sky.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

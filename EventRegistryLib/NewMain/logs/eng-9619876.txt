They cited flawed study data, questionable research conduct and significant drug risks, including the potential for heart problems, injury and abuse.\n\n\"It seems like there are so many problems with the data -- each one alone might be OK, but when you pile them on top of each other ... there's just a lot of questions I would have about how effective the treatment is,\" said Dr. Melissa Decker Barone, a psychologist with the Department of Veterans Affairs.\n\nThe FDA is not required to follow the group's advice and is expected to make its final decision by August, but the negative opinion could strengthen agency's rationale for rejecting the treatment.\n\nMDMA is the first in a series of psychedelics -- including LSD and psilocybin -- that are expected to come before the FDA for review in the next few years as part of a resurgence of interest into the drugs' medical potential, which advocates claim could transform the treatment of mental health disorders.\n\nBut FDA advisers spent most of Tuesday's meeting leveling pointed criticisms at the research submitted on MDMA, which is sometimes called ecstasy or molly. Panelists pointed to flawed studies that could have skewed the results, missing follow-up data on patient outcomes and a lack of diversity among participants. The vast majority of patients were white, with only five Black patients receiving MDMA, raising questions about the generalizability of the results.\n\n\"The fact that this study has so many white participants is problematic because I don't want something to roll out that only helps this one group,\" said Elizabeth Joniak-Grant, the group's patient representative.\n\nThe FDA advisers also drew attention to allegations of misconduct in the trials that have recently surfaced in news stories and a report by the nonprofit Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, which evaluates experimental drug treatments. The incidents include a 2018 report of apparent sexual misconduct by a therapist and her husband while treating a patient.\n\nLykos Therapeutics, the company behind the study, said it previously reported the incident to the FDA and regulators in Canada, where the therapist is based.\n\nLykos is essentially a corporate spinoff of the nation's leading psychedelic advocacy group, the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies, or MAPS, which funded the studies. The group was founded in 1986 to promote the benefits of MDMA and other mind-altering substances.\n\nLykos said in a statement after the meeting that it would work with regulators to address the panel's concerns.\n\n\"While we are disappointed in the vote, we are committed to continuing to collaborate with the FDA with their ongoing review of our (drug application) over the coming weeks,\" the company stated. FDA is expected to issue its decision by Aug. 11.\n\nThe overwhelmingly negative panel ruling could further derail financial investments in the fledgling psychedelic industry, which has mainly been funded by a small number of wealthy backers. Dozens of startup companies have launched in recent years seeking to study psilocybin, ketamine and others drugs for conditions like depression and addiction, though many have struggled to raise money.\n\nMDMA doesn't cause the visual hallucinations commonly associated with psychedelics. Instead, its main effect is triggering feelings of intimacy, connection and euphoria. When used to enhance talk therapy, the drug appears to help patients process their trauma and let go of disturbing thoughts and memories.\n\nBut the panel struggled with the reliability of the results reported by Lykos, given the difficulties of objectively testing psychedelic drugs.\n\nBecause MDMA causes intense, psychological experiences, almost all patients in two key studies of the drug were able to guess whether they had received the MDMA or a dummy pill. That's the opposite of the approach generally required for high-quality drug research, in which bias is minimized by \"blinding\" patients and researchers to whether they received the drug under investigation.\n\n\"I'm not convinced at all that this drug is effective based on the data I saw,\" said Dr. Rajesh Narendran, a University of Pittsburgh psychiatrist who chaired the panel.\n\nPanelists also noted the difficulty of knowing how much of patients' improvement came from MDMA versus simply undergoing the extensive therapy, which totaled more than 80 hours for many patients. Results were further marred by other complicating factors, including a large number of patients who had previously used MDMA or other psychedelics drugs recreationally.\n\nNearly three dozen public speakers addressed the panel during a comment period, including veterans who said they benefitted from MDMA therapy, medical professionals who advised against its use and journalists and independent researchers who detailed the allegations of misconduct in the trials.\n\nThe meeting concluded with several experts encouraging Lykos and the FDA to continue studying psychedelics for PTSD, citing the field's potential to help patients.\n\n\"I think this is a really exciting treatment and I'm encouraged by the results to date,\" said Dr. Paul Holtzheimer of the VA's National Center for PTSD, \"but from a safety and efficacy standpoint I feel it's still premature.\"", "source": {"uri": "newsday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsday"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MDMA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "MDMA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Food and Drug Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychedelic_drug", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Psychedelic drug"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-traumatic_stress_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Post-traumatic stress disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LSD", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "LSD"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psilocybin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Psilocybin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multidisciplinary_Association_for_Psychedelic_Studies", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mental disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychologist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Psychologist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Experiment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoactive_drug", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Psychoactive drug"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonprofit_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nonprofit organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Efficacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketamine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ketamine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depression_(mood)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Depression (mood)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatrist", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Psychiatrist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Pittsburgh", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of Pittsburgh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euphoria", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Euphoria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreational_drug_use", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Recreational drug use"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychotherapy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Psychotherapy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_trauma", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Psychological trauma"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Drugs", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Drugs", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Drugs_and_Medications", "label": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Drugs and Medications", "wgt": 33}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Teen_Health/Drugs_and_Alcohol", "label": "dmoz/Health/Teen Health/Drugs and Alcohol", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Pharmacology", "label": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Pharmacology", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Home_Tests", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Home Tests", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 68}], "image": "https://cdn.newsday.com/ace/c:ODcxZmY3ZjEtODlmYS00:MjNkMjhj/landscape/1280", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9619876", "eventUri": "eng-9619876", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-08-11", "textStart": 3256, "textEnd": 3263}], "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 216, "relevance": 1}

The drug is the first in a series of psychedelics - including LSD and psilocybin - that are expected to come before the FDA in the next few years as part of renewed research and interest into their potential to address hard-to-treat conditions like depression, addiction and anxiety.\n\nCurrently, only antidepressants are FDA-approved for PTSD, which is closely linked to depression, anxiety and suicidal behavior. PTSD is also more prevalent among women and veterans.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut the FDA's review of MDMA highlights the challenges of studying and assessing psychedelic drugs.\n\n\"This application is both consequential and complex,\" FDA reviewer Dr. Tiffany R. Farchione said at the beginning of Tuesday's meeting.\n\nBecause MDMA causes intense psychological experiences, almost all patients in two key studies of the drug were able to guess whether they had received the MDMA or a dummy pill. That's the opposite of the objectivity usually required for high-quality drug research, in which patients can't tell whether they've received the drug being tested.\n\n\"This makes it hard to know how much of the treatment effect is a true benefit and how much is due to expectation bias,\" Farchione said.\n\nThe FDA will ask its outside panel about that issue and several others, including uncertainty about how long the benefits of MDMA might last. About 25% of patients dropped out of a follow-up study designed to track long-term outcomes.\n\nFDA regulators also have concerns about the drug's safety risks, including whether patients may injure themselves if they are still impaired by the drug's effects, which can last eight hours or more. MDMA is also associated with increased blood pressure.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause of those risks, the FDA has proposed strict limits on how and where MDMA could be used if approved. Only specially certified doctors and therapists would be able to prescribe and administer the drug. Patients would have to be registered and tracked over time. Health professionals also would need to be available to measure patients' vital signs while taking the drug.\n\nRepresentatives for drugmaker Lykos Therapeutics said Tuesday they agreed with such precautions and hoped that would hasten the drug's approval.\n\n\"It's clear that MDMA-assisted therapy would be a welcome addition to the currently available options,\" said Dr. Kelley O'Donnell, a New York University psychiatrist who helped conduct the MDMA studies. \"I've seen firsthand how this treatment can be lifesaving for some.\"\n\nLykos is essentially a corporate spinoff of the nation's leading psychedelic advocacy group, the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies, or MAPS, which funded the studies. The group was founded in 1986 to promote the benefits of MDMA and other mind-altering drugs.\n\nIn the two pivotal studies, patients received MDMA as part of an intensive, four-month course of talk therapy lasting more than a dozen sessions, only three of which involved taking the drug. Following treatment, patients who received MDMA had significantly lower PTSD scores.\n\nMDMA acts on two feel-good brain chemicals that are thought to improve talk therapy: serotonin and dopamine. Experts believe the drug helps patients confront past traumas by reducing fear and enhancing their connection and trust with therapists.\n\nCopy the Story Link\n\nInvalid username/password.\n\nPlease check your email to confirm and complete your registration.\n\nCreate a commenting profile by providing an email address, password and display name.

They cited flawed study data, questionable research conduct and significant drug risks, including the potential for heart problems, injury and abuse.\n\n\"It seems like there are so many problems with the data - each one alone might be OK, but when you pile them on top of each other ... there's just a lot of questions I would have about how effective the treatment is,\" said Dr. Melissa Decker Barone, a psychologist with the Department of Veterans Affairs.\n\nA man is silhouetted against lights reflected in the waters off Cape Neddick in 2017. A panel of advisers to the Food and Drug Administration voted 10-1 against the overall benefits of MDMA when used to treat post-traumatic stress disorder. Robert F. Bukaty/Associated Press, file\n\nThe FDA is not required to follow the group's advice and is expected to make its final decision by August, but the negative opinion could strengthen agency's rationale for rejecting the treatment.\n\nMDMA is the first in a series of psychedelics - including LSD and psilocybin - that are expected to come before the FDA for review in the next few years as part of a resurgence of interest into the drugs' medical potential, which advocates claim could transform the treatment of mental health disorders.\n\nBut FDA advisers spent most of Tuesday's meeting leveling pointed criticisms at the research submitted on MDMA, which is sometimes called ecstasy or molly. Panelists pointed to flawed studies that could have skewed the results, missing follow-up data on patient outcomes and a lack of diversity among participants. The vast majority of patients were white, with only five Black patients receiving MDMA, raising questions about the generalizability of the results.\n\n\"The fact that this study has so many white participants is problematic because I don't want something to roll out that only helps this one group,\" said Elizabeth Joniak-Grant, the group's patient representative.\n\nThe FDA advisers also drew attention to allegations of misconduct in the trials that have recently surfaced in news stories and a report by the nonprofit Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, which evaluates experimental drug treatments. The incidents include a 2018 report of apparent sexual misconduct by a therapist and her husband while treating a patient.\n\nLykos Therapeutics, the company behind the study, said it previously reported the incident to the FDA and regulators in Canada, where the therapist is based.\n\nLykos is essentially a corporate spinoff of the nation's leading psychedelic advocacy group, the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies, or MAPS, which funded the studies. The group was founded in 1986 to promote the benefits of MDMA and other mind-altering substances.\n\nLykos said in a statement after the meeting that it would work with regulators to address the panel's concerns.\n\n\"While we are disappointed in the vote, we are committed to continuing to collaborate with the FDA with their ongoing review of our (drug application) over the coming weeks,\" the company stated. FDA is expected to issue its decision by Aug. 11.\n\nThe overwhelmingly negative panel ruling could further derail financial investments in the fledgling psychedelic industry, which has mainly been funded by a small number of wealthy backers. Dozens of startup companies have launched in recent years seeking to study psilocybin, ketamine and others drugs for conditions like depression and addiction, though many have struggled to raise money.\n\nMDMA doesn't cause the visual hallucinations commonly associated with psychedelics. Instead, its main effect is triggering feelings of intimacy, connection and euphoria. When used to enhance talk therapy, the drug appears to help patients process their trauma and let go of disturbing thoughts and memories.\n\nBut the panel struggled with the reliability of the results reported by Lykos, given the difficulties of objectively testing psychedelic drugs.\n\nBecause MDMA causes intense, psychological experiences, almost all patients in two key studies of the drug were able to guess whether they had received the MDMA or a dummy pill. That's the opposite of the approach generally required for high-quality drug research, in which bias is minimized by \"blinding\" patients and researchers to whether they received the drug under investigation.\n\n\"I'm not convinced at all that this drug is effective based on the data I saw,\" said Dr. Rajesh Narendran, a University of Pittsburgh psychiatrist who chaired the panel.\n\nPanelists also noted the difficulty of knowing how much of patients' improvement came from MDMA versus simply undergoing the extensive therapy, which totaled more than 80 hours for many patients. Results were further marred by other complicating factors, including a large number of patients who had previously used MDMA or other psychedelics drugs recreationally.\n\nNearly three dozen public speakers addressed the panel during a comment period, including veterans who said they benefitted from MDMA therapy, medical professionals who advised against its use and journalists and independent researchers who detailed the allegations of misconduct in the trials.\n\nThe meeting concluded with several experts encouraging Lykos and the FDA to continue studying psychedelics for PTSD, citing the field's potential to help patients.\n\n\"I think this is a really exciting treatment and I'm encouraged by the results to date,\" said Dr. Paul Holtzheimer of the VA's National Center for PTSD, \"but from a safety and efficacy standpoint I feel it's still premature.\"\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Science and Educational Media Group.

NICHOLAS NISSEN\n\nJune 5, 2024 at 12:15 AM\n\nA panel of independent advisers for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration voted against recommending approval of psychedelic treatment -- along with therapy -- to treat post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) during a meeting on Tuesday.\n\nThe treatment, developed by Lykos Therapeutics, is a pharmaceutical version of midomafetamine, better known as MDMA and sometimes referred to as ecstasy.\n\nThe Psychopharmacologic Drugs Advisory Committee appeared to have serious doubts about the safety and efficacy of the treatment.\n\nOn the question of whether the available data shows that the drug is effective in patients with PTSD, nine of the advisers voted no and two voted yes. On the question of whether the benefits of MDMA outweigh the risks for the treatment of patients with PTSD, 10 advisers voted no and just one voted yes.\n\nMORE: How MDMA-assisted therapy could treat PTSD in ways current therapy can't\n\nThe FDA is expected to make a decision by Aug. 11, according to Lykos Therapeutics. The FDA usually follows the recommendations of the advisory panel, although the recommendations are not binding.\n\nPTSD is a disorder that develops in some people after experiencing or witnessing a traumatic event, according to the National Institute of Mental Health.\n\nPeople can experience a range of symptoms including nightmares, unwanted memories, anxiety, depression or heightened reactions, and the conditions can last for months or years.\n\nA multitude of studies have suggested that psychoactive drugs, including cannabis, ketamine magic mushrooms and MDMA, may help treat PTSD and other mental health disorders.\n\nSome psychiatrists began using MDMA for treatment in the late 1970s and early 1980s with claims that it helped promote trust and improved communication between doctors and patients, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse.\n\nMDMA was classified as a Schedule I drug, meaning it has \"no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse,\" by the Drug Enforcement Administration in 1985.\n\nIn the 1990s, the FDA approved the first human trial examining use of MDMA to relieve pain in terminally ill patients as well as being used in combination with psychotherapy.\n\nThe company said it conducted two late-stage randomized placebo-controlled trials to evaluate the safety and efficacy of MDMA when used in combination with psychological intervention, such as talk therapy.\n\nMORE: A form of 'ecstasy' could be a new treatment for post-traumatic stress\n\n\"This will be the first MDMA-assisted therapy and psychedelic-assisted therapy to be reviewed by the Psychopharmacologic Drugs Advisory Committee, a significant milestone in the field of psychedelic medicine, resulting from decades of clinical research and advocacy,\" Amy Emerson, CEO of Lykos Therapeutics, said in a press release.\n\n\"We look forward to the opportunity to discuss the comprehensive data package of investigational MDMA and how, if approved, it may be used as a prescription treatment in combination with psychological intervention in adults with PTSD,\" the statement continued\n\nIn briefing documents released on Friday, the FDA said that based on the clinical trial data submitted by Lykos Therapeutics, \"participants appear to experience rapid, clinically meaningful, durable improvement in their PTSD symptoms.\"\n\nHowever, the federal health agency also noted concerns that the drug has the risk of causing \"patient impairment\" and the potential for \"serious harm\" as a result of impairment.\n\nIn the documents, the FDA said that if the drug is approved, there must be safeguards in place to monitor patients such as seen during the clinical trial, in which participants were monitored by two therapists for eight hours in a controlled setting and had to agree to not drive until the following day.\n\nThe FDA proposed further precautions, including enrolling patients in a registry to track side effects and progress.\n\nAdditionally, the FDA raised concerns about how the studies were conducted. Although designed to be double-blind -- meaning neither the participants nor the researchers know who is receiving MDMA and who is not -- the drug produces such \"profound alterations\" that the vast majority of participants were able to guess whether they received MDMA or a placebo, the agency wrote.\n\nNicholas Nissen, M.D., is an author, host of the Brain Health with Dr. Nissen Podcast and a contributor for the ABC News Medical Unit.\n\nABC News' Sony Salzman contributed to this report.\n\nFDA advisers vote against recommending approval of MDMA as treatment for PTSD originally appeared on abcnews.go.com", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mary_kekatos@aol.com", "name": "Mary Kekatos", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-traumatic_stress_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Post-traumatic stress disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MDMA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "MDMA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Food and Drug Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medication", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Medication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychopharmacology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Psychopharmacology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Efficacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychedelic_drug", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Psychedelic drug"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institute_on_Drug_Abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Institute on Drug Abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institute_of_Mental_Health", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Institute of Mental Health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlled_Substances_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Controlled Substances Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psilocybin_mushroom", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Psilocybin mushroom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketamine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ketamine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depression_(mood)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Depression (mood)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoactive_drug", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Psychoactive drug"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatrist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Psychiatrist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nightmare", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nightmare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_Enforcement_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drug Enforcement Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychotherapy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Psychotherapy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_trauma", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Psychological trauma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mental disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ABC News"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health", "label": "dmoz/Health", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Drugs_and_Medications", "label": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Drugs and Medications", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Teen_Health/Drugs_and_Alcohol", "label": "dmoz/Health/Teen Health/Drugs and Alcohol", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Pharmacology", "label": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Pharmacology", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/mOQewf3eZfZyZhQb1ltsJw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/aol_abc_news_articles_665/da86446f3075ad631d9a005ca149ecf1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9619876", "eventUri": "eng-9619876", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-08-11", "textStart": 1092, "textEnd": 1099}], "sentiment": 0.3803921568627451, "wgt": 214, "relevance": 1}

The group was founded in 1986 to promote the benefits of MDMA and other mind-altering substances.\n\nLykos said in a statement after the meeting that it would work with regulators to address the panel's concerns.\n\n\"While we are disappointed in the vote, we are committed to continuing to collaborate with the FDA with their ongoing review of our (drug application) over the coming weeks,\" the company stated. FDA is expected to issue its decision by Aug. 11.\n\nThe overwhelmingly negative panel ruling could further derail financial investments in the fledgling psychedelic industry, which has mainly been funded by a small number of wealthy backers. Dozens of startup companies have launched in recent years seeking to study psilocybin, ketamine and others drugs for conditions like depression and addiction, though many have struggled to raise money.\n\nMDMA doesn't cause the visual hallucinations commonly associated with psychedelics. Instead, its main effect is triggering feelings of intimacy, connection and euphoria. When used to enhance talk therapy, the drug appears to help patients process their trauma and let go of disturbing thoughts and memories.\n\nBut the panel struggled with the reliability of the results reported by Lykos, given the difficulties of objectively testing psychedelic drugs.\n\nBecause MDMA causes intense, psychological experiences, almost all patients in two key studies of the drug were able to guess whether they had received the MDMA or a dummy pill. That's the opposite of the approach generally required for high-quality drug research, in which bias is minimized by \"blinding\" patients and researchers to whether they received the drug under investigation.\n\n\"I'm not convinced at all that this drug is effective based on the data I saw,\" said Dr. Rajesh Narendran, a University of Pittsburgh psychiatrist who chaired the panel.\n\nPanelists also noted the difficulty of knowing how much of patients' improvement came from MDMA versus simply undergoing the extensive therapy, which totaled more than 80 hours for many patients. Results were further marred by other complicating factors, including a large number of patients who had previously used MDMA or other psychedelics drugs recreationally.\n\nNearly three dozen public speakers addressed the panel during a comment period, including veterans who said they benefitted from MDMA therapy, medical professionals who advised against its use and journalists and independent researchers who detailed the allegations of misconduct in the trials.\n\nThe meeting concluded with several experts encouraging Lykos and the FDA to continue studying psychedelics for PTSD, citing the field's potential to help patients.\n\n\"I think this is a really exciting treatment and I'm encouraged by the results to date,\" said Dr. Paul Holtzheimer of the VA's National Center for PTSD, \"but from a safety and efficacy standpoint I feel it's still premature.\"\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Science and Educational Media Group.

The FDA will make the final decision, likely in August.\n\nAntidepressants are now the only FDA-approved drugs for post-traumatic stress disorder, which is closely linked to depression, anxiety and suicidal thinking and is more prevalent among women and veterans\n\nIf approved, MDMA would be reclassified as a prescription medicine and made available to specially certified doctors and therapists. Currently, the drug is in the same ultra-restrictive category as heroin and other substances the federal government deems prone to abuse and devoid of any medical use.\n\nMDMA, also known as ecstasy or molly, is the first in a series of psychedelics that are expected to be reviewed by the FDA in coming years. It's part of a resurgence of research into the potential of psychedelics for hard-to-treat conditions like depression, addiction and anxiety. MDMA's main effect is triggering feelings of intimacy, connection and euphoria.\n\nCompanies are studying MDMA, psilocybin, LSD and other mind-expanding drugs for numerous mental health problems.\n\nUntil recently, psychedelic research was mainly funded by a handful of nonprofit advocacy groups, including Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies, or MAPS. The company seeking approval for MDMA, Lykos Therapeutics, is essentially a corporate spinoff of MAPS, which conducted all the studies submitted for FDA review.\n\nIn two MAPS studies, patients received MDMA as part of an intensive, four-month course of talk therapy lasting more than a dozen sessions, only three of which involved taking the drug. The drug is thought to help patients come to terms with their trauma and let go of disturbing thoughts and memories.\n\nThe group studied its approach in 195 adults with moderate-to-severe PTSD who were randomly assigned to undergo the therapy with MDMA or with a dummy pill. Following treatment, patients who received MDMA had significantly lower PTSD scores and were more likely to be in remission.\n\nBut FDA reviewers noted that the vast majority of patients correctly guessed whether they had received MDMA or a dummy pill, making it \"nearly impossible\" to maintain the so-called \"blinded\" objectivity considered essential for high-quality drug research. The agency also questioned how long the drug's benefits might last. MAPS tracked some patients for up to two years, but reviewers noted that about a quarter of patients quickly dropped out of the follow-up study, limiting the usefulness of the results.\n\nThe most common side effects of MDMA included headache, nausea, muscle tightness and decreased appetite. More serious issues included heart palpitations and elevated blood pressure, which FDA reviewers said had the \"potential to trigger\" life-threatening heart problems.\n\nThey also raised concerns about the potential for patients to abuse MDMA, which functions similarly to amphetamines and other stimulants.\n\nWhile MDMA would be a first-of-a-kind approval, U.S. doctors and the FDA itself have already laid some of the groundwork for working with drugs that can cause intense, psychological experiences.\n\nHundreds of clinics across the U.S. already offer ketamine -- the powerful anesthetic sometimes used as a party drug -- to treat a host of ailments, including depression, anxiety, chronic pain and PTSD. The FDA has only formally approved the drug for use during surgery, but its availability allows doctors to prescribe it \"off-label\" for various mental and physical ailments.\n\nIn 2019, the FDA approved Johnson & Johnson's proprietary form of the drug, Spravato, a nasal spray that treats severe depression. Similar to ketamine, the drug is offered at doctor's offices and clinics where patients usually spend several hours reclining in a chair.\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Science and Educational Media Group.

The FDA usually accepts the panel's recommendations, but a final decision likely won't be issued until August.\n\nMDMA has been outlawed since 1985, when the Drug Enforcement Administration classified it as a Schedule I drug, meaning it had high potential for abuse and no accepted medical use.\n\nBut various nonprofit groups, including the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies, have spent years testing MDMA and other psychedelics as possible treatments for conditions such as depression and anxiety. MAPS was the group that applied for FDA approval of MDMA, through its corporate spinoff Lykos Therapeutics.\n\nMAPS technically applied for approval of MDMA-assisted therapy, as both clinical trials involved patients combining talk therapy with MDMA usage for treatment of PTSD. Both trials were conducted by MAPS, and their results showed MDMA-assisted therapy worked significantly better than therapy plus a placebo drug.\n\nHowever, experts have questioned some aspects of the studies. Patients who were given the placebo or given MDMA were almost all able to tell which one they received.

They cited flawed study data, questionable research conduct and significant drug risks, including the potential for heart problems, injury and abuse.\n\n\"It seems like there are so many problems with the data -- each one alone might be OK, but when you pile them on top of each other ... there's just a lot of questions I would have about how effective the treatment is,\" said Dr. Melissa Decker Barone, a psychologist with the Department of Veterans Affairs.\n\nThe FDA is not required to follow the group's advice and is expected to make its final decision by August, but the negative opinion could strengthen FDA's rationale for rejecting the treatment.\n\nMDMA is the first in a series of psychedelics -- including LSD and psilocybin -- that are expected to come before the FDA for review in the next few years as part of a resurgence of interest into the drugs' medical potential, which advocates claim could transform the treatment of mental health disorders.\n\nBut FDA advisers spent most of Tuesday's meeting leveling pointed questions and criticisms at the research submitted on MDMA, which is sometimes called ecstasy or molly. Panelists pointed to flawed studies that could have skewed the results, missing follow-up data on patient outcomes and a lack of diversity among participants. The vast majority of patients studied were white, with only five Black patients receiving MDMA, raising questions about the generalizability of the results.\n\n\"The fact that this study has so many white participants is problematic because I don't want something to roll out that only helps this one group,\" said Elizabeth Joniak-Grant, the group's patient representative.\n\nThe FDA advisers also drew attention to allegations of misconduct in the trials that have recently surfaced in news stories and a report by the nonprofit Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, which evaluates experimental drug treatments. The incidents include a 2018 report of apparent sexual misconduct by a therapist interacting with a patient.\n\nLykos Therapeutics, the company behind the study, said it previously reported the incident to the FDA and regulators in Canada, where the therapist is based. Lykos is essentially a corporate spinoff of the nation's leading psychedelic advocacy group, the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies, or MAPS, which funded the studies. The group was founded in 1986 to promote the benefits of MDMA and other mind-altering substances.\n\nLykos and MAPS did not immediately respond to requests for comment Tuesday evening.\n\nThe negative panel ruling could further derail financial investments in the fledgling psychedelic industry, which has mainly been funded by a small number of wealthy backers. Dozens of startup companies have launched in recent years seeking to study psilocybin, ketamine and others drugs for conditions like depression and addiction, though many have struggled to raise money.\n\nMDMA's main effect is triggering feelings of intimacy, connection and euphoria. When used to enhance talk therapy, the drug appears to help patients process their trauma and let go of disturbing thoughts and memories.\n\nBut the panel struggled with the reliability of those results, given the difficulties of objectively testing psychedelic drugs.\n\nBecause MDMA causes intense, psychological experiences, almost all patients in two key studies of the drug were able to guess whether they had received the MDMA or a dummy pill. That's the opposite of the approach generally required for high-quality drug research, in which bias is minimized by \"blinding\" patients and researchers to whether they received the drug under investigation.\n\n\"I'm not convinced at all that this drug is effective based on the data I saw,\" said Dr. Rajesh Narendran, a University of Pittsburgh psychiatrist who chaired the panel.\n\nPanelists also noted the difficulty of knowing how much of patients' improvement came from MDMA versus simply undergoing the extensive therapy, which totaled more than 80 hours for many patients. Results were further marred by other complicating factors, including a large number of patients who had previously used MDMA or other psychedelics drugs recreationally.\n\nNearly three dozen public speakers addressed the panel, including veterans who said they benefitted from MDMA therapy, medical professionals who advised against its use and journalists and independent researchers who reiterated the allegations of misconduct in the trials.\n\nThe meeting concluded with several experts encouraging Lykos and the FDA to continue studying psychedelics for PTSD, citing the field's potential to help patients.\n\n\"I think this is a really exciting treatment and I'm encouraged by the results to date,\" said Dr. Paul Holtzheimer of the VA's National Center for PTSD, \"but from a safety and efficacy standpoint I feel it's still premature.\"", "source": {"uri": "lasvegassun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Las Vegas Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@lasvegassun.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}, {"uri": "matthew_perrone@lasvegassun.com", "name": "Matthew Perrone", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MDMA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "MDMA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Food and Drug Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychedelic_drug", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Psychedelic drug"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-traumatic_stress_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Post-traumatic stress disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LSD", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "LSD"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psilocybin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Psilocybin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multidisciplinary_Association_for_Psychedelic_Studies", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychologist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Psychologist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoactive_drug", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Psychoactive drug"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mental disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonprofit_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nonprofit organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Efficacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketamine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ketamine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depression_(mood)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Depression (mood)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatrist", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Psychiatrist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Pittsburgh", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of Pittsburgh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euphoria", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Euphoria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreational_drug_use", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Recreational drug use"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychotherapy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Psychotherapy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_trauma", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Psychological trauma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bias"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Drugs", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Drugs", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Drugs_and_Medications", "label": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Drugs and Medications", "wgt": 33}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Teen_Health/Drugs_and_Alcohol", "label": "dmoz/Health/Teen Health/Drugs and Alcohol", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Pharmacology", "label": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Pharmacology", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Home_Tests", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Home Tests", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://assets.lasvegassun.com/media/assets/images/icons/sun-app-large.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9619876", "eventUri": "eng-9619876", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 209, "relevance": 1}

The FDA will make the final decision, likely in August.\n\nAntidepressants are now the only FDA-approved drugs for post-traumatic stress disorder, which is closely linked to depression, anxiety and suicidal thinking and is more prevalent among women and veterans.\n\nIf approved, MDMA would be reclassified as a prescription medicine and made available to specially certified doctors and therapists. Currently, the drug is in the same ultra-restrictive category as heroin and other substances the federal government deems prone to abuse and devoid of any medical use.\n\nMDMA, also known as ecstasy or molly, is the first in a series of psychedelics that are expected to be reviewed by the FDA in coming years. It's part of a resurgence of research into the potential of psychedelics for hard-to-treat conditions like depression, addiction and anxiety. MDMA's main effect is triggering feelings of intimacy, connection and euphoria.\n\nCompanies are studying MDMA, psilocybin, LSD and other mind-expanding drugs for numerous mental health problems.\n\nUntil recently, psychedelic research was mainly funded by a handful of nonprofit advocacy groups, including Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies, or MAPS. The company seeking approval for MDMA, Lykos Therapeutics, is essentially a corporate spinoff of MAPS, which conducted all the studies submitted for FDA review.\n\nIn two studies, patients received MDMA as part of an intensive, four-month course of talk therapy lasting more than a dozen sessions, only three of which involved taking the drug. The drug is thought to help patients come to terms with their trauma and let go of disturbing thoughts and memories.\n\nThe approach was studied in nearly 195 adults with moderate-to-severe PTSD who were randomly assigned to undergo the therapy with MDMA or with a dummy pill. Following treatment, patients who received MDMA had significantly lower PTSD scores and were more likely to be in remission.\n\nBut FDA reviewers noted that the vast majority of patients correctly guessed whether they had received MDMA or a dummy pill, making it \"nearly impossible\" to maintain the so-called \"blinded\" objectivity considered essential for high-quality drug research. The agency also questioned how long the drug's benefits might last. The studies tracked some patients for up to two years, but reviewers noted that about a quarter of patients quickly dropped out of the follow-up study, limiting the usefulness of the results.\n\nThe most common side effects of MDMA included headache, nausea, muscle tightness and decreased appetite. More serious issues included heart palpitations and elevated blood pressure, which FDA reviewers said had the \"potential to trigger\" life-threatening heart problems.\n\nThey also raised concerns about the potential for patients to abuse MDMA, which functions similarly to amphetamines and other stimulants.\n\nWhile MDMA would be a first-of-a-kind approval, U.S. doctors and the FDA itself have already laid some of the groundwork for working with drugs that can cause intense, psychological experiences.\n\nHundreds of clinics across the U.S. already offer ketamine -- the powerful anesthetic sometimes used as a party drug -- to treat a host of ailments, including depression, anxiety, chronic pain and PTSD. The FDA has only formally approved the drug for use during surgery, but its availability allows doctors to prescribe it \"off-label\" for various mental and physical ailments.\n\nIn 2019, the FDA approved Johnson & Johnson's proprietary form of the drug, Spravato, a nasal spray that treats severe depression. Similar to ketamine, the drug is offered at doctor's offices and clinics where patients usually spend several hours reclining in a chair.", "source": {"uri": "newstribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jefferson City News Tribune"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-traumatic_stress_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Post-traumatic stress disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MDMA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "MDMA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Food and Drug Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychedelic_drug", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Psychedelic drug"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medication", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Medication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Club_drug", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Club drug"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multidisciplinary_Association_for_Psychedelic_Studies", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antidepressant", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Antidepressant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depression_(mood)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Depression (mood)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_failure", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Heart failure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychotherapy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Psychotherapy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anxiety"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LSD", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "LSD"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychedelic_therapy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Psychedelic therapy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psilocybin", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Psilocybin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicidal_ideation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Suicidal ideation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prescription_drug", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prescription drug"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euphoria", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Euphoria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mental health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Addiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnson_&_Johnson", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Johnson & Johnson"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Drugs_and_Medications", "label": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Drugs and Medications", "wgt": 34}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Teen_Health/Drugs_and_Alcohol", "label": "dmoz/Health/Teen Health/Drugs and Alcohol", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Pharmacology", "label": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Pharmacology", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Home_Tests", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Home Tests", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 64}], "image": "https://wehco.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com/imports/adg/photos/207374972_207374972-751614c54e2343eb815a6d4071640b54_t600.jpg?4326734cdb8e39baa3579048ef63ad7b451e7676", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9619876", "eventUri": "eng-9619876", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 207, "relevance": 1}

Krieger | lkrieger@bayareanewsgroup.com | Bay Area News Group\n\nRick Doblin first dreamed of the therapeutic potential of the psychedelic drug MDMA in a hippie house in downtown Santa Cruz, in an era when fears of bad trips and ruined lives loomed large in the public imagination.\n\nOn Tuesday, 38 years later, his vision will go before a U.S. Food and Drug Administration's advisory committee of medical experts who will make a recommendation about whether the drug, when combined with talk therapy, should be a legal part of modern medicine.\n\nApproval is far from guaranteed. But it's a major step for a controversial drug, also known as Ecstasy or Molly, that has long lingered in the shadows of counterculture and shown promise in highly regulated UC San Francisco-based studies.\n\nOn its long strange trip, the drug has been transformed. This MDMA is nothing like the illegal stuff shared, for free, at all-night raves. Rather, it's a prescription capsule made by San Jose-based biotech company Lykos Therapeutics, funded by venture capital -- with patents, and profits, on the horizon.\n\n\"There's a sense of things coming to potential fruition,\" said Doblin of the nonprofit group Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS), founded in a converted three-bedroom house on Santa Cruz's Mission Street, that created Lykos Therapeutics. \"Looking back, I had no idea how long it would take. This feels incredible.\"\n\nAdditional psychedelics for therapeutic uses are expected to be reviewed by the FDA in coming years.\n\nMDMA is currently classified by the Drug Enforcement Agency as a Schedule 1 drug, like heroin, with \"no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse.\"\n\nBut a growing number of clinical trials show that MDMA-assisted therapy seems to be effective in reducing symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder. It's not a classic hallucinogen like LSD; instead, it triggers feelings of intimacy, connection, and euphoria.\n\nIn the initial review of the drug on Friday, ahead of the meeting, FDA scientists wrote that patients who received MDMA and talk therapy showed \"rapid, clinically meaningful, durable improvements in their PTSD symptoms,\" according to the Associated Press.\n\nBut they also called the research \"challenging to interpret\" because it's difficult to know whether improvement came from the drug or talk therapy. They also raised several safety concerns, including MDMA's heart risks and potential for abuse.\n\nThe FDA is due to make a decision by August 11. If approved, MDMA-assisted therapy would be the first novel treatment for PTSD, which occurs after exposure to a violent or traumatic event. Antidepressants are now the only approved drugs for PTSD. But fewer than 60% of patients respond to this approach, and only 20% to 30% of patients are cured, according to a 2009 article in the journal Progress in Neuro-Psychopharmacology and Biological Psychiatry.\n\n\"MDMA allows you to access these really deep traumatic memories in a way that is not anxiety-provoking,\" Jennifer Mitchell, a UCSF neuroscientist who led the study being presented to the FDA, told the Mercury News in 2022.\n\nDoblin, now 70, was inspired on the cliffs of Big Sur's Esalen Institute, a cathedral to the personal growth movement, where he attended a workshop in 1982 with LSD researcher Stanislav Grof. Grof and some other psychiatrists believed that, in combination with psychotherapy, psychedelics could help some patients reframe a traumatic experience. But former President Nixon's \"War On Drugs\" stifled research.\n\n***** He decided it would be more effective to work within the legal system, not outside it. He founded the scrappy grassroots nonprofit MAPS in 1986 to promote MDMA's study and legalization.\n\nThe chemical structure of the drug, invented and patented by the pharmaceutical giant Merck in 1912, had long been in the public domain.\n\nDoblin adopted an \"anti-patent\" strategy, raising money from wealthy donors to fund clinical trials. But donations weren't enough to support MDMA research, regulatory review and integration into the healthcare system.\n\nUnder a little-known FDA designation called \"new drug product exclusivity,\" designed to provide companies an incentive to develop drugs that are off patent, Doblin saw the promise of financial returns.\n\nThe organization, rebranded as Lykos Therapeutics, is now unambiguously profit-focused. Under the leadership of CEO Amy Emerson, formerly of pharma giants Novartis and Chiron, it has raised about $150 million and grown to over 120 employees.\n\nIf its product is approved, Lykos would have the sole rights to commercialize it for five years.\n\nMeanwhile, cultural norms have shifted. Once-fringe practices of yoga, meditation, and \"mindfulness\" are now mainstream. Drug laws have loosened, with decriminalization efforts in cities such as Oakland, Denver, and Seattle. With mental health problems like depression, addiction, and anxiety often resistant to treatment, a growing number of pharmaceutical companies are testing mind-altering drugs.\n\nMDMA research got the nod from the FDA in 2017 when it was granted \"breakthrough therapy\" status, which allowed experiments to be fast-tracked.\n\nIn the UCSF trial funded by Lykos, patients received MDMA as part of an intensive, four-month course of talk therapy lasting more than a dozen sessions, of which three involved taking the drug. By the end of one study, 86% of people in the MDMA group improved and 71% no longer met the criteria for a PTSD diagnosis. Of those who took the placebo, 69% improved, and 48% no longer qualified for a PTSD diagnosis.\n\nBut in criticism that could pose a major obstacle to approval, FDA's staff analysis said there are flaws in the study because it was not truly \"blinded.\" Participants and therapists were able to figure out who got MDMA versus the placebo.\n\nStill, retired Army Sgt. Jonathan Lubecky, who lives in Washington, D.C. and was a trial participant, is convinced. After a year in Iraq, loud noises and people wearing backpacks triggered flashbacks, and he regularly woke up from nightmares in a cold sweat. He tried to take his own life five times between 2006 and 2013.\n\nMDMA tamed his symptoms. \"I thought it'd be fun to do and it might help for a month or two,\" said Lubecky, 45. \"I was wrong. It's a f -- -- miracle.\"\n\nThere will be future chemical changes that improve the product, said Lykos spokesperson Caroline Rigdon. This means that a patent for the drug, once a symbol of the counterculture, is now on the horizon -- protecting and extending corporate exclusivity.\n\nThe world of psychedelics is no longer charity, said Doblin.", "source": {"uri": "eastbaytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "East Bay Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lisa_m_krieger@eastbaytimes.com", "name": "Lisa M.

Federal health advisers are considering the first request to approve the mind-altering club drug MDMA as a treatment for PTSD. The advisers to the Food and Drug Administration are scheduled to vote on the drug's safety and effectiveness Tuesday, June 4, 2024, potentially setting the stage for federal approval later this year. (AP Photo/Robert F. Bukaty, File)\n\nA first-of-a-kind proposal to begin using the mind-altering drug MDMA as a treatment for PTSD was roundly criticized Tuesday -- a potentially major setback to psychedelic advocates who hope to win a landmark federal approval and bring the banned drugs into the medical mainstream.\n\nThe panel of advisers to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration voted 10-1 against the overall benefits of MDMA when used to treat post-traumatic stress disorder. They cited flawed study data, questionable research conduct and significant drug risks, including the potential for heart problems, injury and abuse.\n\n\"It seems like there are so many problems with the data -- each one alone might be OK, but when you pile them on top of each other ... there's just a lot of questions I would have about how effective the treatment is,\" said Dr. Melissa Decker Barone, a psychologist with the Department of Veterans Affairs.\n\nThe FDA is not required to follow the group's advice and is expected to make its final decision by August, but the negative opinion could strengthen FDA's rationale for rejecting the treatment.\n\nThe vote followed hours of pointed questions and criticisms about the research submitted on MDMA -- sometimes called ecstasy or molly. Panelists pointed to flawed studies that could have skewed the results, missing follow-up data on patient outcomes and a lack of diversity among participants. The vast majority of patients studied were white, with only five Black patients receiving MDMA, raising questions about the generalizability of the results.\n\n\"The fact that this study has so many white participants is problematic because I don't want something to roll out that only helps this one group,\" said Elizabeth Joniak-Grant, the group's patient representative.\n\nThe FDA advisers also drew attention to allegations of misconduct in the trials that have recently surfaced in news stories and a report by the nonprofit Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, which evaluates experimental drug treatments. The incidents include a 2018 report of apparent sexual misconduct by a therapist interacting with a patient.\n\nLykos Therapeutics, the company behind the study, said it previously reported the incident to the FDA and regulators in Canada, where the therapist is based. Lykos is essentially a corporate spinoff of the nation's leading psychedelic advocacy group, the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies, or MAPS, which funded the studies. The group was founded in 1986 to promote the benefits of MDMA and other mind-altering substances.\n\nMDMA is the first in a series of psychedelics -- including LSD and psilocybin -- that are expected to come before the FDA in the next few years. The panel's negative ruling could further derail financial investments in the fledgling industry, which has mainly been funded by a small number of wealthy backers.\n\nMDMA's main effect is triggering feelings of intimacy, connection and euphoria. When used to enhance talk therapy, the drug appears to help patients process their trauma and let go of disturbing thoughts and memories.\n\nBut the panel struggled with the reliability of those results, given the difficulties of objectively testing psychedelic drugs.\n\nBecause MDMA causes intense, psychological experiences, almost all patients in two key studies of the drug were able to guess whether they had received the MDMA or a dummy pill. That's the opposite of the approach generally required for high-quality drug research, in which bias is minimized by \"blinding\" patients and researchers to whether they received the drug under investigation.\n\n\"I'm not convinced at all that this drug is effective based on the data I saw,\" said Dr. Rajesh Narendran, a University of Pittsburgh psychiatrist who chaired the panel.\n\nPanelists also noted the difficulty of knowing how much of patients' improvement came from MDMA versus simply undergoing the extensive therapy, which totaled more than 80 hours for many patients. Results were further marred by other complicating factors, including a large number of patients who had previously used MDMA or other psychedelics drugs recreationally.\n\nNearly three dozen public speakers also addressed the panel, including veterans who said they benefitted from MDMA therapy, medical professionals who advised against its use and journalists and independent researchers who reiterated the allegations of misconduct in the trials.\n\nThe meeting concluded with several experts encouraging Lykos and the FDA to continue studying psychedelics, citing the field's potential to help patients.\n\n\"I think this is a really exciting treatment and I'm encouraged by the results to date,\" said Dr. Paul E. Holtzheimer of the VA's National Center for PTSD, \"but from a safety and efficacy standpoint I feel it's still premature.\"", "source": {"uri": "castanet.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Castanet"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-traumatic_stress_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Post-traumatic stress disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MDMA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "MDMA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Food and Drug Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychedelic_drug", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Psychedelic drug"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Club_drug", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Club drug"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Canadian_Press", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Canadian Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maine", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Maine"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Maine"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multidisciplinary_Association_for_Psychedelic_Studies", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychologist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Psychologist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonprofit_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nonprofit organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LSD", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LSD"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psilocybin", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Psilocybin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Efficacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoactive_drug", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Psychoactive drug"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatrist", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Psychiatrist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independent film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Pittsburgh", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of Pittsburgh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euphoria", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Euphoria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreational_drug_use", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Recreational drug use"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychotherapy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Psychotherapy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_trauma", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Psychological trauma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bias"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Psychology"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Drugs", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Drugs", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Drugs_and_Medications", "label": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Drugs and Medications", "wgt": 33}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Teen_Health/Drugs_and_Alcohol", "label": "dmoz/Health/Teen Health/Drugs and Alcohol", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Pharmacology", "label": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Pharmacology", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Home_Tests", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Home Tests", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 56}], "image": "https://www.castanet.net/content/2024/6/6a950a62-617f-47a2-8587-9fc38f0f3a3d_p3813943.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9619876", "eventUri": "eng-9619876", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2017-12-11", "textStart": 163, "textEnd": 176}], "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 206, "relevance": 1}

It would also be a milestone for the broader effort to expand access to psychedelics.\n\n\"We are charting new territory,\" said Kim Witczak, a consumer representative on the FDA's advisory committee. \"We want to set it up right.\"\n\nRepresentatives of Lykos emphasized the positive findings in clinical data collected during two nearly identical randomized controlled trials.\n\nFor example, one of those studies showed 67% of participants in the MDMA treatment arm no longer met the diagnostic criteria for PTSD following three dosing sessions with MDMA, compared to about 32% in the placebo group who underwent the therapy sessions but did not receive an active drug.\n\n\"In totality, these results support [that] MDMA in combination with psychological intervention provides significant and meaningful reductions in PTSD symptoms and functional impairment in patients with PTSD,\" said Berra Yazar-Klosinski, chief scientific officer for Lykos.\n\nFDA staff and outside advisors did not dwell on those rosy results, though.\n\nWhile the study took steps to \"blind\" study participants, there was considerable discussion around the fact many of those in the study could tell they had received the experimental drug, leading to what's known as \"functional unblinding,\" which can ultimately affect the results.\n\n\"Although we do have two positive studies, the results are in the context of dramatic functional unblinding,\" says Dr. David Millis, clinical reviewer for the FDA.\n\nAnother potential sticking point could be the lack of data about how patients experienced the acute effects of the drug, including feelings like \"euphoria\" or \"elevated mood.\" That data helps inform the FDA's assessments of the drug's abuse potential.\n\n\"We noticed a striking lack of abuse-related adverse events,\" said Millis, noting that the FDA had advised the study sponsors to collect this type of data.\n\nWhile MDMA is currently listed as a Schedule III drug, the agency's review found it has the same abuse potential as a Schedule II stimulant, a category that includes cocaine.\n\n\"We're actually managing more and more severe cases of MDMA overdose, and so I'm less concerned about the safety in the acute setting, but more chronically if they go on to abuse MDMA,\" said Maryann Amirshahi, a professor of emergency medicine at Georgetown University and a member of the committee.\n\nAbout 40% of those enrolled in the MDMA study had a history of using prior to the study.\n\nAlongside its positive findings on the short-term effects of MDMA, Lykos presented data from a follow-up observational study intended to suss out the staying power of the treatment.\n\nWhile not yet published in a peer-reviewed journal, that data \"suggest evidence of MDMA's durability to at least six months,\" said Yazar-Klosinski with Lykos.\n\nHowever, the FDA staff highlighted various issues with that long-term data, including a dropout rate of 25% and the fact that some participants sought therapy and, in some cases, used illicit drugs, including MDMA..\n\nData shared from Lykos showed a range of adverse events.\n\nThe majority of those in the study had a history of suicidal ideation in their lifetime, but during the study period \"the frequency of these symptoms was comparable between the two groups, said Dr. Alia Lilienstein, senior medical director for Lykos Therapeutics.\n\n\"Of note there were no suicidal behaviors or attempts reported in the MDMA group,\" she said.\n\nThat point is particularly contentious because of recent allegations that certain adverse events were not reported. A petition filed with the FDA calling for the advisory meeting outlined these concerns and others, citing an unnamed former employee of the drug company.\n\nThere is already a well-documented case of two therapists in the Phase 2 trials with a participant who said they engaged in inappropriate contact with her while she was under the influence of MDMA. The videos of the two therapists in bed with the participant were eventually made public by a podcast.\n\n\"Let's try to not gloss over this misconduct. It was sexual misconduct. That's particularly important,\" said Elizabeth Joniak-Grant, a sociologist and a member of the panel.\n\nSeveral other panelists asked questions along those lines.\n\nLast month, a report from the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, a group that evaluates clinical data and drug prices, concluded there was insufficient evidence to assess the overall net benefit of MDMA-assisted therapy, after a lengthy investigation into the trial data.\n\nThat report stated that it's possible those involved in the trials including therapists and investigators encouraged the reporting of positive events and downplayed adverse events.\n\nThe drug company has pushed back on the allegations and said it stands behind the data.\n\nA public comment submitted to the FDA by one trial participant said her therapist encouraged her to view \"worsening symptoms as evidence of healing and 'spiritual awakening'\" and that she and other participants later struggled with suicidality following the trial.\n\nDr. Walter Dunn, a psychiatrist at UCLA and a panelist, asked about claims in the ICER report that some participants may have been discouraged from participating in the long term durability study.\n\n\"Those were investigated as well,\" said Lilienstein with Lykos, \"All participants who were interested in participating were given the opportunity to review consent, and some chose not to participate after reviewing consent, but otherwise everyone was given the opportunity.\"", "source": {"uri": "kpbs.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "KPBS"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

They cited flawed study data, questionable research conduct and significant drug risks, including the potential for heart problems, injury and abuse.\n\n\"It seems like there are so many problems with the data -- each one alone might be OK, but when you pile them on top of each other ... there's just a lot of questions I would have about how effective the treatment is,\" said Dr. Melissa Decker Barone, a psychologist with the Department of Veterans Affairs.\n\nThe FDA is not required to follow the group's advice and is expected to make its final decision by August, but the negative opinion could strengthen FDA's rationale for rejecting the treatment.\n\nThe vote followed hours of pointed questions and criticisms about the research submitted on MDMA -- sometimes called ecstasy or molly. Panelists pointed to flawed studies that could have skewed the results, missing follow-up data on patient outcomes and a lack of diversity among participants. The vast majority of patients studied were white, with only five Black patients receiving MDMA, raising questions about the generalizability of the results.\n\n\"The fact that this study has so many white participants is problematic because I don't want something to roll out that only helps this one group,\" said Elizabeth Joniak-Grant, the group's patient representative.\n\nThe FDA advisers also drew attention to allegations of misconduct in the trials that have recently surfaced in news stories and a report by the nonprofit Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, which evaluates experimental drug treatments. The incidents include a 2018 report of apparent sexual misconduct by a therapist interacting with a patient.\n\nLykos Therapeutics, the company behind the study, said it previously reported the incident to the FDA and regulators in Canada, where the therapist is based. Lykos is essentially a corporate spinoff of the nation's leading psychedelic advocacy group, the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies, or MAPS, which funded the studies. The group was founded in 1986 to promote the benefits of MDMA and other mind-altering substances.\n\nMDMA is the first in a series of psychedelics -- including LSD and psilocybin -- that are expected to come before the FDA in the next few years. The panel's negative ruling could further derail financial investments in the fledgling industry, which has mainly been funded by a small number of wealthy backers.\n\nMDMA's main effect is triggering feelings of intimacy, connection and euphoria. When used to enhance talk therapy, the drug appears to help patients process their trauma and let go of disturbing thoughts and memories.\n\nBut the panel struggled with the reliability of those results, given the difficulties of objectively testing psychedelic drugs.\n\nBecause MDMA causes intense, psychological experiences, almost all patients in two key studies of the drug were able to guess whether they had received the MDMA or a dummy pill. That's the opposite of the approach generally required for high-quality drug research, in which bias is minimized by \"blinding\" patients and researchers to whether they received the drug under investigation.\n\n\"I'm not convinced at all that this drug is effective based on the data I saw,\" said Dr. Rajesh Narendran, a University of Pittsburgh psychiatrist who chaired the panel.\n\nPanelists also noted the difficulty of knowing how much of patients' improvement came from MDMA versus simply undergoing the extensive therapy, which totaled more than 80 hours for many patients. Results were further marred by other complicating factors, including a large number of patients who had previously used MDMA or other psychedelics drugs recreationally.\n\nNearly three dozen public speakers also addressed the panel, including veterans who said they benefitted from MDMA therapy, medical professionals who advised against its use and journalists and independent researchers who reiterated the allegations of misconduct in the trials.\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Science and Educational Media Group.

Panelists pointed to flawed studies that could have biased the results, a lack of follow-up data on patient outcomes and a lack of diversity among participants. The vast majority of patients were white, with only five Black patients given MDMA, raising questions about the generalizability of the results.\n\n\"The fact that this study has so many white participants is a problem because we don't want to develop a study that is only going to help this particular group,\" said Elizabeth Joniak Grant, a patient representative for the group.\n\nFDA advisers also noted recent news reports of allegations of clinical trial misconduct. A report by the nonprofit Institute for Clinical and Economic ReviewThe National Institute for Clinical Trials and Clinical Oncology (NICU), which evaluates drug treatments, said in a 2018 report that these cases included: Sexual Misconduct A photo of a therapist and her husband taken while treating a patient.\n\nLycos Therapeutics, which led the study, said it had already reported the incident to the FDA and to regulators in Canada, where the therapists are based.\n\nLycos is essentially an offshoot of the leading US psychedelic drug advocacy group, the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Drug Studies (MAPS), which funded the research. The group was founded in 1986 to promote the benefits of MDMA and other mind-altering substances.\n\nIn a statement after the meeting, Lycos said it would work with regulators to address the committee's concerns.\n\n\"While we are disappointed with the outcome of the vote, we are committed to continuing to cooperate with the FDA as it continues its review of our drug application over the coming weeks,\" the company said. The FDA is expected to make a decision by Aug. 11.\n\nThe panel's overwhelmingly negative decision could further discourage investment in the nascent psychedelic drug industry, which has been funded primarily by a few wealthy backers. Dozens of startups have been founded in recent years to study drugs like psilocybin, ketamine and others for conditions including depression and addiction, but many of them have struggled to raise capital.\n\nMDMA does not produce the visual hallucinations common to psychedelics. Instead, its primary effect is to induce feelings of intimacy, connection, and euphoria. When used to enhance talk therapy, the drug appears to help patients process trauma and let go of unpleasant thoughts and memories.\n\nBut given the difficulty of objectively testing hallucinogens, the committee struggled with the reliability of the results reported by Lycos.\n\nBecause MDMA induces such intense psychological experiences, nearly all patients in two key studies of the drug were able to guess whether they had received MDMA or a placebo. This is the opposite of the approach typically required for quality drug research, which minimizes bias by \"masking\" patients and researchers whether they received the drug under investigation.\n\n\"Based on the data that I've seen, I'm not at all convinced that this drug is effective,\" said Dr. Rajesh Narendran, a psychiatrist at the University of Pittsburgh who chaired the committee.\n\nPanelists also noted the difficulty in determining whether the patients' improvements were due to MDMA or simply the long-term treatment, which for many patients lasted more than 80 hours. Results were further marred by other complicating factors, including the fact that many of the patients had previously used MDMA or other hallucinogens recreationally.\n\nDuring the comment period, nearly 30 public speakers addressed the committee, including military veterans who claim to have benefited from MDMA therapy, medical professionals who recommend against MDMA use, and journalists and independent researchers who detailed allegations of misconduct in the clinical trials.\n\nAt the end of the meeting, several experts encouraged Lycos and the FDA to continue researching psychedelics for PTSD, given the field's potential to help patients.\n\n\"We think this is a really great treatment and are encouraged by the results so far,\" said Dr. Paul Holzheimer of the VA's National Center for PTSD, \"but we feel it's still early in terms of safety and effectiveness.\"", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

It's the first time the FDA's advisers have considered a psychedelic drug for medical use. The novel treatment has the potential to transform a field with significant need, but critical questions loom.\n\nAbout 5% of adults in the United States - about 13 million people - experience PTSD in any given year, according estimates from the National Center for PTSD. But current treatment options - including antidepressants and some specialized forms of cognitive behavioral therapy - are limited in their scope and effectiveness, with few alternatives available to help those don't respond well to them.\n\nLykos Therapeutics has promising data from two late-stage clinical trials that used MDMA in combination with therapy to treat PTSD. MDMA is a psychedelic drug known as an entactogen, a class of psychoactive drugs that produce experiences of emotional communion, relatedness and emotional openness.\n\nAbout 200 people participated in the Lykos trials, with a treatment program that involved three eight-hour sessions where participants took MDMA in the presence of two therapists. The MDMA sessions were spaced about a month apart, along with additional therapy sessions.\n\n\"Participants appear to experience rapid, clinically meaningful, durable improvement in their PTSD symptoms,\" the US Food and Drug Administration wrote in a briefing document about the studies.\n\nBut the agency also noted that \"several factors make these data challenging to interpret and complicate the benefit-risk assessment for this application,\" posing key questions for the members of the Psychopharmacologic Drugs Advisory Committee to consider.\n\nAs they weigh the risks and benefits of the novel treatment at today's meeting, the committee members will hear presentations from Lykos and the FDA, along with comments from the public.\n\nThe FDA has final say on approving the treatment and will often follow the committee's recommendations but does not have to do so.\n\nThe studies were designed to be double-blind, meaning neither the participants nor the researchers knew who received the MDMA treatment and who didn't. This type of study is considered the gold standard because it helps reduce bias in results by minimizing the effects of external factors. But MDMA's hallucinogenic effects have \"profound alterations\" on a person's state of being, and the vast majority of participants knew which group they were in simply by the nature of their experience.\n\nThe Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, a nonprofit that conducts independent reviews of treatments, tests and procedures, also cited \"substantial concerns about the validity of the results\" of the Lykos trials in a report published in March. Those concerns centered around bias, both from the unblinding of the trial and from other influences on patient perspectives.\n\nIn addition to blurry data on efficacy, there were concerns about safety data, the FDA said.\n\nIt is known to have potential for abuse, but the FDA cautions that the research did not appropriately assess this as an adverse event in the context of the treatment program.\n\nReports from illicit use of MDMA suggest that it may pose risks to both heart and liver health. The phase III clinical trials showed \"significant increases in both blood pressure and pulse\" among participants, the FDA said, but certain related assessments were incomplete. And liver health was assessed only in small groups from earlier phases of the clinical trials.\n\nThe questions are all familiar to Lykos, and the company has had conversations with the FDA throughout its research, CEO Amy Emerson said. The advisory committee meeting is the \"next big milestone\" in the process and an opportunity to gather even more information, she said.\n\n\"There's just such an urgent patient need for new treatment options, and we really use that as our guiding light as we develop MDMA-assisted therapy,\" she said. \"All along, we've been really committed to safety, and that will always be top of mind.\"\n\nThere is growing interest and support to explore the use of psychedelics as therapeutics. Along with MDMA, drugs like ketamine and psilocybin mushrooms are being studied in clinical trials to treat a variety of mental health disorders.\n\n\"Depression, PTSD, eating disorders - they're all different. You can't just lump these together and say, 'Psychedelics are good for this,'\" Emerson said. \"You need to study it, you need to look at the safety and efficacy profiles of each, and we have to be careful to not treat these things as panaceas or like a magic bullet.\"\n\nThe Lykos treatment is the first to reach this point in the process, and the way the FDA and its advisory board proceed could set key precedents.\n\n\"It's an early but exciting moment. The promise is there, the potential is there, and we just have to find out through careful study and time how impactful these medications will be,\" said Dr. Joshua Gordon, director of the National Institute of Mental Health.\n\nMany questions remain about the specific conditions needed to achieve effective use of this treatment, and the FDA advisers could choose to endorse it under a wide range of stipulations or not at all, he said.\n\nStill, even the most supportive experts caution about the limitations of the treatment.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter\n\nSign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n\"I hope that the drug gets approved but in a way where it can be made available and monitored in a responsible manner,\" said Dr. Rachel Yehuda, director of the Center for Psychedelic Psychotherapy and Trauma Research at Mount Sinai's Icahn School of Medicine, who is not a member of the FDA advisory committee. \"My fear would be that we stop being curious, we stop asking the right questions, we stop trying to figure out mechanisms of action, we stop trying to perfect and scale like we do with any other treatment.\"\n\nIt's critical to protect vulnerable populations who may benefit from this treatment, experts say.\n\n\"There's a recognition that psychedelics are probably uniquely susceptible to the blurring of the boundaries between strictly applied medical treatments that are provided by experienced clinicians under very well-monitored circumstances versus recreational use, so there's a great interest in trying to get this as right as possible,\" said Dr. Jon Alpert, chair of the American Psychiatric Association's research council and chair of the department of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine.\n\n\"The last thing you want is for a promising treatment for a devastating condition to go off the rails in an unbounded, unmonitored kind of use.\"\n\nAlso, the trials so far have excluded people who may be most vulnerable to substantial side effects of MDMA, such as adolescents and those with coinciding conditions such as schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, and it's important to continue gathering data to understand how the treatment works in these populations, he said.\n\n\"Any FDA approval of MDMA must be accompanied by rigorous regulations, strict prescribing and dispensing controls, comprehensive patient education, and ongoing monitoring and surveillance systems,\" the American Psychiatric Association wrote in a letter to FDA's advisory committee.\n\nIn addition to potentially setting a precedent in mental health treatment, the particular treatment program that Lykos has studied is \"labor-intensive,\" she said. It requires a significant amount of investment - both logistically and emotionally - from participants and providers, which is challenged by the shortage of mental health professionals in the US.\n\n\"We never had a situation where something that the government had deemed harmful gets a 180 and becomes an approved treatment for a condition,\" Yehuda said. \"Then, the question is, 'Are we going to be able to use the moment in a way that really furthers the mental health of our population?'\"\n\nCNN's Brenda Goodman contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "cnn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNN"}, "authors": [{"uri": "deidre_mcphillips@cnn.com", "name": "Deidre McPhillips", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-traumatic_stress_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Post-traumatic stress disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlled_Substances_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Controlled Substances Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoactive_drug", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Psychoactive drug"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MDMA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "MDMA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Food and Drug Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychedelic_drug", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Psychedelic drug"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Clinical trial"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empathogen\u2013entactogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Empathogen\u2013entactogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychopharmacology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Psychopharmacology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blinded_experiment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Blinded experiment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Efficacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antidepressant", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Antidepressant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cognitive behavioral therapy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bias"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psilocybin_mushroom", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Psilocybin mushroom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallucinogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hallucinogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pulse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketamine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ketamine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_pressure", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Blood pressure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein_College_of_Medicine", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Albert Einstein College of Medicine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanjay_Gupta", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sanjay Gupta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health", "label": "dmoz/Health", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Drugs_and_Medications", "label": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Drugs and Medications", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Disorders", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-1084492068.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9619876", "eventUri": "eng-9619876", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 203, "relevance": 1}

They cited flawed study data, questionable research conduct and significant drug risks, including the potential for heart problems, injury and abuse.\n\n\"It seems like there are so many problems with the data -- each one alone might be OK, but when you pile them on top of each other ... there's just a lot of questions I would have about how effective the treatment is,\" said Dr. Melissa Decker Barone, a psychologist with the Department of Veterans Affairs.\n\nThe FDA is not required to follow the group's advice and is expected to make its final decision by August, but the negative opinion could strengthen agency's rationale for rejecting the treatment.\n\nMDMA is the first in a series of psychedelics -- including LSD and psilocybin -- that are expected to come before the FDA for review in the next few years as part of a resurgence of interest into the drugs' medical potential, which advocates claim could transform the treatment of mental health disorders.\n\nBut FDA advisers spent most of Tuesday's meeting leveling pointed criticisms at the research submitted on MDMA, which is sometimes called ecstasy or molly. Panelists pointed to flawed studies that could have skewed the results, missing follow-up data on patient outcomes and a lack of diversity among participants. The vast majority of patients were white, with only five Black patients receiving MDMA, raising questions about the generalizability of the results.\n\n\"The fact that this study has so many white participants is problematic because I don't want something to roll out that only helps this one group,\" said Elizabeth Joniak-Grant, the group's patient representative.\n\nThe FDA advisers also drew attention to allegations of misconduct in the trials that have recently surfaced in news stories and a report by the nonprofit Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, which evaluates experimental drug treatments. The incidents include a 2018 report of apparent sexual misconduct by a therapist and her husband while treating a patient.\n\nLykos Therapeutics, the company behind the study, said it previously reported the incident to the FDA and regulators in Canada, where the therapist is based.\n\nLykos is essentially a corporate spinoff of the nation's leading psychedelic advocacy group, the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies, or MAPS, which funded the studies. The group was founded in 1986 to promote the benefits of MDMA and other mind-altering substances.\n\nLykos said in a statement after the meeting that it would work with regulators to address the panel's concerns.\n\n\"While we are disappointed in the vote, we are committed to continuing to collaborate with the FDA with their ongoing review of our (drug application) over the coming weeks,\" the company stated.

There remains a large unmet need for new treatments for PTSD as existing drugs do not work on all patients.\n\nThe Lykos treatment is one among several psychedelic drugs being tested in patients with hard to treat mental health conditions such as Compass Pathways' drug, which uses the same component as magic mushrooms.\n\nThe FDA's staff proposed restrictions around its use and monitoring in their briefing documents on Friday. The FDA also flagged a rise in blood pressure and pulse in the trials and cases of liver toxicity.\n\nThe approval could offer \"a new avenue of treatment, but itself is not going to make a big dent\", due to costs and complexities associated with it, said Olson.\n\n\"It's important because it would be the first in this class of molecules, but I don't think it will be the last, it will be replaced by compounds that have superior properties to MDMA.\"\n\n(Reporting by Sriparna Roy and Pratik Jain in Bengaluru; Editing by Arun Koyyur)", "source": {"uri": "usnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "U.S. News & World Report"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-traumatic_stress_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Post-traumatic stress disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MDMA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "MDMA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Food and Drug Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychedelic_drug", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Psychedelic drug"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Placebo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mental disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsule_(pharmacy)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Capsule (pharmacy)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychotherapy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Psychotherapy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mental health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Clinical trial"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psilocybin_mushroom", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Psilocybin mushroom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatotoxicity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hepatotoxicity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pulse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jainism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jainism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Molecule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_pressure", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Blood pressure"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Drugs", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Drugs", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Drugs_and_Medications", "label": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Drugs and Medications", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Teen_Health/Drugs_and_Alcohol", "label": "dmoz/Health/Teen Health/Drugs and Alcohol", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Pharmacology", "label": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Pharmacology", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Home_Tests", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Home Tests", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 77}], "image": "https://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/ef5ceb4/2147483647/thumbnail/970x647/quality/85/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.usnews.com%2Fcmsmedia%2F93%2F33a30084e2abf564fa98ab5ac64858%2Ftag%3Areuters.com%2C2024%3Anewsml_LYNXMPEK530G0%3A12024-06-04T110701Z_1_LYNXMPEK530G0_RTROPTP_3_USA-HEALTH-PSYCHEDELICS-MDMA.JPG", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9619876", "eventUri": "eng-9619876", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 203, "relevance": 1}

The drug has been studied as a treatment for PTSD and FDA is now considering whether to approve it. Travis Dove for The Washington Post via Getty Images/The Washington Post hide caption\n\ntoggle caption Travis Dove for The Washington Post via Getty Images/The Washington Post\n\nThe psychedelic drug MDMA, which has been studied as a possible mental health treatment, may finally get a chance to enter mainstream health care.\n\nTuesday, scientific advisors to the Food and Drug Administration are deciding whether to recommend that MDMA - in combination with talk therapy - is safe and effective as a treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\nThe drug company Lykos Therapeutics, which sponsored clinical trials of the drug, has asked the FDA to approve MDMA-assisted therapy for PTSD. It's a critical step in the drug's path to market.\n\nThe committee is expected to vote on the strength of the evidence at 5:30 p.m. ET following public comment and discussion.\n\nThe FDA does not have to follow the committee's recommendation.\n\nWhile there is considerable hype around the drug's potential, remarks during the meeting from FDA staff and members of the advisory panel highlighted some major stumbling blocks -- shortcomings in the clinical research that could jeopardize its shot of being approved.\n\nAgency staff focused on uncertainties and gaps in the data, unanswered questions about its potential for abuse and a lack of evidence supporting the psychological approach used in the therapy sessions.\n\nSome on the panel have explicitly brought up allegations that have surfaced about possible misconduct and bias in the trials that could have skewed the results.\n\nScientists with the FDA didn't share details, but acknowledged the agency was investigating some of the claims, which have surfaced in a petition to the agency and outside reports on the trials.\n\nThe significance of the moment was not lost on those in attendance.\n\nThere are only two FDA-approved treatments for the condition and MDMA would be the first to come on the market in decades. It would also be a milestone for the broader effort to expand access to psychedelics.\n\n\"We are charting new territory,\" said Kim Witczak, a consumer representative on the FDA's advisory committee. \"We want to set it up right.\"\n\nRepresentatives of Lykos emphasized the positive findings in clinical data collected during two nearly identical randomized controlled trials.\n\nFor example, one of those studies showed 67% of participants in the MDMA treatment arm no longer met the diagnostic criteria for PTSD following three dosing sessions with MDMA, compared to about 32% in the placebo group who underwent the therapy sessions but did not receive an active drug.\n\n\"In totality, these results support [that] MDMA in combination with psychological intervention provides significant and meaningful reductions in PTSD symptoms and functional impairment in patients with PTSD,\" said Berra Yazar-Klosinski, chief scientific officer for Lykos.\n\nFDA staff and outside advisors did not dwell on those rosy results, though.\n\nWhile the study took steps to \"blind\" study participants, there was considerable discussion around the fact many of those in the study could tell they had received the experimental drug, leading to what's known as \"functional unblinding,\" which can ultimately affect the results.\n\n\"Although we do have two positive studies, the results are in the context of dramatic functional unblinding,\" says Dr. David Millis, clinical reviewer for the FDA.\n\nAnother potential sticking point could be the lack of data about how patients experienced the acute effects of the drug, including feelings like \"euphoria\" or \"elevated mood.\" That data helps inform the FDA's assessments of the drug's abuse potential.\n\n\"We noticed a striking lack of abuse-related adverse events,\" said Millis, noting that the FDA had advised the study sponsors to collect this type of data.\n\nWhile MDMA is currently listed as a Schedule III drug, the agency's review found it has the same abuse potential as a Schedule II stimulant, a category that includes cocaine.\n\n\"We're actually managing more and more severe cases of MDMA overdose, and so I'm less concerned about the safety in the acute setting, but more chronically if they go on to abuse MDMA,\" said Maryann Amirshahi, a professor of emergency medicine at Georgetown University and a member of the committee.\n\nAbout 40% of those enrolled in the MDMA study had a history of using prior to the study.\n\nAlongside its positive findings on the short-term effects of MDMA, Lykos presented data from a follow-up observational study intended to suss out the staying power of the treatment.\n\nWhile not yet published in a peer-reviewed journal, that data \"suggest evidence of MDMA's durability to at least six months,\" said Yazar-Klosinski with Lykos.\n\nHowever, the FDA staff highlighted various issues with that long-term data, including a dropout rate of 25% and the fact that some participants sought therapy and, in some cases, used illicit drugs, including MDMA..\n\nData shared from Lykos showed a range of adverse events.\n\nThe majority of those in the study had a history of suicidal ideation in their lifetime, but during the study period \"the frequency of these symptoms was comparable between the two groups, said Dr. Alia Lilienstein, senior medical director for Lykos Therapeutics.\n\n\"Of note there were no suicidal behaviors or attempts reported in the MDMA group,\" she said.\n\nThat point is particularly contentious because of recent allegations that certain adverse events were not reported. A petition filed with the FDAcalling for the advisory meeting outlined these concerns and others, citing an unnamed former employee of the drug company.\n\nThere is already a well-documented case of two therapists in the Phase 2 trials with a participant who said they engaged in inappropriate contact with her while she was under the influence of MDMA. The videos of the two therapists in bed with the participant were eventually made public by a podcast.\n\n\"Let's try to not gloss over this misconduct. It was sexual misconduct. That's particularly important,\" said Elizabeth Joniak-Grant, a sociologist and a member of the panel.\n\nSeveral other panelists asked questions along those lines.\n\nLast month, a report from the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, a group that evaluates clinical data and drug prices, concluded there was insufficient evidence to assess the overall net benefit of MDMA-assisted therapy, after a lengthy investigation into the trial data.\n\nThat report stated that it's possible those involved in the trials including therapists and investigators encouraged the reporting of positive events and downplayed adverse events.\n\nThe drug company has pushed back on the allegations and said it stands behind the data.\n\nA public comment submitted to the FDA by one trial participant said her therapist encouraged her to view \"worsening symptoms as evidence of healing and 'spiritual awakening'\" and that she and other participants later struggled with suicidality following the trial.\n\nDr. Walter Dunn, a psychiatrist at UCLA and a panelist, asked about claims in the ICER report that some participants may have been discouraged from participating in the long term durability study.\n\n\"Those were investigated as well,\" said Lilienstein with Lykos, \"All participants who were interested in participating were given the opportunity to review consent, and some chose not to participate after reviewing consent, but otherwise everyone was given the opportunity.\"", "source": {"uri": "npr.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "NPR"}, "authors": [{"uri": "will_stone@npr.org",

The treatment is being developed by the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS) and its public benefit Lykos, which has conducted clinical trials in a bid to have the therapy approved by the FDA. In 2017, the FDA designated the MDMA-assisted treatment for PTSD as a breakthrough therapy, indicating it may be a significant improvement over existing therapies and clearing the way for further research.\n\nThe clinical trials tested MDMA in conjunction with intense therapy administered by a pair of therapists to a group of patients with PTSD. In one stage of the trial, 94 patients were given either MDMA or a placebo during three therapy sessions spaced one month apart. Participants also completed integration sessions to help them process their experiences during the drug therapy sessions.\n\nAt the end of the trial, 71% of participants in the MDMA group had experienced an improvement in symptoms and no longer met the diagnostic criteria for PTSD. Among the placebo group, 48% of participants had similar results. Some participants in both groups experienced adverse effects such as anxiety or heart palpitations, although none of the adverse effects were characterized as serious.\n\n\"Consistent with PTSD, suicidal ideation was observed in both groups,\" the authors reported in the journal Nature Medicine, \"MDMA did not appear to increase this risk, and no suicidal behavior was observed.\"\n\nWhile the research results are promising, an independent investigation of the clinical trial has determined that the findings may not tell the whole story. In a recent draft report, the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER), a nonprofit that evaluates clinical trials and drug prices, said the investigation found \"substantial concerns about the validity of the results\" of the MDMA clinical trials. Following the report's release, a citizen petition filed with the FDA alleged that possible misconduct and ethical violations could mar the credibility of the MDMA research.\n\nThe ICER report acknowledges that the research data shows that MDMA may be an \"important addition to treatment options for PTSD.\" But it also listed several factors that could cloud the results of the study.\n\nThe report notes that it is not easy to conduct research into psychedelics because it is difficult to obscure which participants are receiving a placebo and which are receiving the active drug because of the unmistakable effects of psychoactive drugs. As a result, most of the study subjects correctly guessed which group they were in, according to a review of the research released by the FDA on Friday. Without proper blinding, the findings can be skewed by participants or researchers, many of whom see strong promise in the therapeutic potential of the compounds.\n\n\"There's the possibility that the data might not be representative of what's actually happened in clinical trials,\" Ne\u015fe Devenot, one of the authors of the citizen petition and a senior lecturer in the writing program at Johns Hopkins University who is involved in psychedelic research, told NPR. \"I don't think this has been publicly reckoned with.\"\n\nAdditionally, the report notes that \"very strong prior beliefs\" among therapists, researchers and patients influenced the results of the trial.\n\n\"Concerns have been raised by some that therapists encouraged favorable reports by patients and discouraged negative reports by patients including discouraging reports of substantial harms, potentially biasing the recording of benefits and harms,\" the report states.\n\nThe research was also marred by allegations from a study participant that two therapists- a married couple- engaged in inappropriate physical contact while the subject was under the influence of MDMA during a treatment session in Canada. An investigation by MAPS determined that the couple had \"substantially deviated\" from the treatment protocol, leading the organization to notify health authorities in Canada and the United States. Additionally, the therapists were barred from administering MDMA-assisted therapy in affiliation with MAPS.\n\nThe ICER report has not been finalized, but Dr. David Rind, the chief medical officer for the group says its investigation showed that \"there's still a lot of uncertainty\" about using MDMA to treat PTSD.\n\n\"You have a group of people who are very upset about how these trials went,\" he said. \"We couldn't tell, even though we talked with people where this happened, whether that represents a tiny fraction of bad events or a number of bad events large enough to have rendered the trial just not believable.\"\n\nInvestigators involved in the research, however, have rejected claims that the study is flawed. Jennifer Mitchell, lead author of the published papers from the Phase 3 trials, says she stands behind the study's findings.\n\n\"I didn't feel any pressure from the sponsor to come up with anything different than what the data was providing,\" said Mitchell, a professor of neurology and psychiatry at the University of California, San Francisco and associate chief of staff for research at the San Francisco VA Medical Center. \"I wouldn't have continued to work with them if I had felt that.\"\n\nThe FDA review also expressed concerns about the safety of MDMA, including the risk of abuse and possible side effects that could harm the cardiovascular system and the liver. Lykos CEO Amy Emerson said the company stands by the quality and integrity of its research and development process.\n\n\"Given there has not been a new PTSD medication approved in the United States in over two decades for the 13 million people living with PTSD, we are deeply committed to making a difference by bringing a potential new treatment to patients,\" she said in a statement cited by the Washington Post.\n\nShawn Hauser, a partner at the cannabis and psychedelics law firm Vicente LLP, said it is not surprising that the FDA's consideration of new MDMA-assisted therapies is raising questions, noting that the use of a psychedelic drug in conjunction with therapy is uncharted territory for the agency. The FDA drug evaluation process is difficult to apply to certain substances and treatments including psychedelics and other compounds including botanical cannabis, although for different reasons.\n\n\"The promising research makes clear the potential of this therapy for treating PTSD, and while there are certainly challenges in these studies (as with any study) and legitimate concerns that must be addressed, these must be considered in the broader context of the severe unmet treatment needs by patients with PTSD and the strong data on safety and efficacy,\" Hauser wrote in an email

Here's what to know\n\nIn Lykos' clinical studies, patients were given MDMA capsules made by Lykos along with talk therapy in three eight-hour session, overseen by two specially-trained therapists. The sessions were spread about four weeks apart.\n\nAccording to results from the latest trial, about 71% of participants who received MDMA-assisted therapy no longer met the criteria for PTSD after 18 weeks, compared with 48% of the patients who received a placebo.\n\nOn Friday, the FDA gave the first hint of its thinking in briefing papers posted online ahead of Tuesday's meeting. In the documents, FDA scientists said that based on the clinical trial data, \"participants appear to experience rapid, clinically meaningful, durable improvement in their PTSD symptoms.\" Still, they added that the data was \"challenging to interpret\" due to the nature of the treatment.\n\nBecause MDMA produces alterations in mood and cognition, patients know if they received the treatment or a placebo, making it nearly impossible to carry out a double-blind study.\n\nEmerson told Quartz that the studies were designed in collaboration with the FDA.\n\n\"Given the novel nature of midomafetamine (MDMA) treatment, Lykos has consistently sought and received feedback from the FDA throughout the development program,\" Emerson said.\n\nThe FDA is expected to make a final decision by August.\n\nMDMA belongs to a class of medications known as psychoplastogens. These compounds have been found to physically rebuild critical neurons in the brain, according to David Olson, director of the University of California-Davis Institute for Psychedelics and Neurotherapeutics.\n\nOlson said that these medications produce effects that are rapid and sustainable.\n\n\"They last long after the drug has been cleared from the body, and that is a paradigm shift in how the field thinks about treating neuropsychiatric disorders,\" Olsen said.\n\nHe added that the drugs can help treat the underlying causes of these illnesses and not just the symptoms.\n\nIn 2019, the FDA approved a nasal spray containing a variation of ketamine, another psychoplastogen, for treatment-resistant depression.\n\nOlson said that even if the FDA fails to approve Lykos's application, interest in using psychedelics to treat mental disorders will continue.\n\nHe said there are already other companies working on developing psychoplastogens that have been stripped of the psychoactive properties that make them a liability in clinical trials.", "source": {"uri": "qz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Quartz"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-traumatic_stress_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Post-traumatic stress disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MDMA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "MDMA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Food and Drug Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsule_(pharmacy)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Capsule (pharmacy)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Clinical trial"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_drug_application", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New drug application"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychopharmacology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Psychopharmacology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Efficacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreational_drug_use", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Recreational drug use"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Placebo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychotherapy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Psychotherapy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychedelic_drug", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Psychedelic drug"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoplastogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Psychoplastogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medication", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Medication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment-resistant_depression", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Treatment-resistant depression"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasal_spray", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nasal spray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketamine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ketamine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Davis", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of California, Davis"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoactive_drug", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Psychoactive drug"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradigm", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paradigm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Neuron"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health", "label": "dmoz/Health", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Drugs_and_Medications", "label": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Drugs and Medications", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Biotechnology_and_Pharmaceuticals/Contract_Research_Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Biotechnology and Pharmaceuticals/Contract Research Organizations", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Pharmacology", "label": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Pharmacology", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 63}], "image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fill,h_675,pg_1,q_80,w_1200/a4877c89202bdb2936c30ac116bfc414.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9619876", "eventUri": "eng-9619876", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 201, "relevance": 1}

The FDA will make the final decision, likely in August.\n\nAntidepressants are now the only FDA-approved drugs for post-traumatic stress disorder, which is closely linked to depression, anxiety and suicidal thinking and is more prevalent among women and veterans\n\nIf approved, MDMA would be reclassified as a prescription medicine and made available to specially certified doctors and therapists. Currently, the drug is in the same ultra-restrictive category as heroin and other substances the federal government deems prone to abuse and devoid of any medical use.\n\nMDMA, also known as ecstasy or molly, is the first in a series of psychedelics that are expected to be reviewed by the FDA in coming years. It's part of a resurgence of research into the potential of psychedelics for hard-to-treat conditions like depression, addiction and anxiety. MDMA's main effect is triggering feelings of intimacy, connection and euphoria.\n\nCompanies are studying MDMA, psilocybin, LSD and other mind-expanding drugs for numerous mental health problems.\n\nUntil recently, psychedelic research was mainly funded by a handful of nonprofit advocacy groups, including Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies, or MAPS. The company seeking approval for MDMA, Lykos Therapeutics, is essentially a corporate spinoff of MAPS, which conducted all the studies submitted for FDA review.\n\nIn two MAPS studies, patients received MDMA as part of an intensive, four-month course of talk therapy lasting more than a dozen sessions, only three of which involved taking the drug. The drug is thought to help patients come to terms with their trauma and let go of disturbing thoughts and memories.\n\nThe group studied its approach in 195 adults with moderate-to-severe PTSD who were randomly assigned to undergo the therapy with MDMA or with a dummy pill. Following treatment, patients who received MDMA had significantly lower PTSD scores and were more likely to be in remission.\n\nBut FDA reviewers noted that the vast majority of patients correctly guessed whether they had received MDMA or a dummy pill, making it \"nearly impossible\" to maintain the so-called \"blinded\" objectivity considered essential for high-quality drug research. The agency also questioned how long the drug's benefits might last. MAPS tracked some patients for up to two years, but reviewers noted that about a quarter of patients quickly dropped out of the follow-up study, limiting the usefulness of the results.\n\nThe most common side effects of MDMA included headache, nausea, muscle tightness and decreased appetite. More serious issues included heart palpitations and elevated blood pressure, which FDA reviewers said had the \"potential to trigger\" life-threatening heart problems.\n\nThey also raised concerns about the potential for patients to abuse MDMA, which functions similarly to amphetamines and other stimulants.\n\nWhile MDMA would be a first-of-a-kind approval, U.S. doctors and the FDA itself have already laid some of the groundwork for working with drugs that can cause intense, psychological experiences.\n\nHundreds of clinics across the U.S. already offer ketamine -- the powerful anesthetic sometimes used as a party drug -- to treat a host of ailments, including depression, anxiety, chronic pain and PTSD. The FDA has only formally approved the drug for use during surgery, but its availability allows doctors to prescribe it \"off-label\" for various mental and physical ailments.\n\nIn 2019, the FDA approved Johnson & Johnson's proprietary form of the drug, Spravato, a nasal spray that treats severe depression. Similar to ketamine, the drug is offered at doctor's offices and clinics where patients usually spend several hours reclining in a chair.\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Science and Educational Media Group.

It's a critical step in the drug's path to market.\n\nThe committee is expected to vote on the strength of the evidence at 5:30 p.m. ET following public comment and discussion.\n\nThe FDA does not have to follow the committee's recommendation.\n\nWhile there is considerable hype around the drug's potential, remarks during the meeting from FDA staff and members of the advisory panel highlighted some major stumbling blocks -- shortcomings in the clinical research that could jeopardize its shot of being approved.\n\nAgency staff focused on uncertainties and gaps in the data, unanswered questions about its potential for abuse and a lack of evidence supporting the psychological approach used in the therapy sessions.\n\nSome on the panel have explicitly brought up allegations that have surfaced about possible misconduct and bias in the trials that could have skewed the results.\n\nScientists with the FDA didn't share details, but acknowledged the agency was investigating some of the claims, which have surfaced in a petition to the agency and outside reports on the trials.\n\nThe significance of the moment was not lost on those in attendance.\n\nThere are only two FDA-approved treatments for the condition and MDMA would be the first to come on the market in decades. It would also be a milestone for the broader effort to expand access to psychedelics.\n\n\"We are charting new territory,\" said Kim Witczak, a consumer representative on the FDA's advisory committee. \"We want to set it up right.\"\n\nRepresentatives of Lykos emphasized the positive findings in clinical data collected during two nearly identical randomized controlled trials.\n\nFor example, one of those studies showed 67% of participants in the MDMA treatment arm no longer met the diagnostic criteria for PTSD following three dosing sessions with MDMA, compared to about 32% in the placebo group who underwent the therapy sessions but did not receive an active drug.\n\n\"In totality, these results support [that] MDMA in combination with psychological intervention provides significant and meaningful reductions in PTSD symptoms and functional impairment in patients with PTSD,\" said Berra Yazar-Klosinski, chief scientific officer for Lykos.\n\nFDA staff and outside advisors did not dwell on those rosy results, though.\n\nWhile the study took steps to \"blind\" study participants, there was considerable discussion around the fact many of those in the study could tell they had received the experimental drug, leading to what's known as \"functional unblinding,\" which can ultimately affect the results.\n\n\"Although we do have two positive studies, the results are in the context of dramatic functional unblinding,\" says Dr. David Millis, clinical reviewer for the FDA.\n\nAnother potential sticking point could be the lack of data about how patients experienced the acute effects of the drug, including feelings like \"euphoria\" or \"elevated mood.\" That data helps inform the FDA's assessments of the drug's abuse potential.\n\n\"We noticed a striking lack of abuse-related adverse events,\" said Millis, noting that the FDA had advised the study sponsors to collect this type of data.\n\nWhile MDMA is currently listed as a Schedule III drug, the agency's review found it has the same abuse potential as a Schedule II stimulant, a category that includes cocaine.\n\n\"We're actually managing more and more severe cases of MDMA overdose, and so I'm less concerned about the safety in the acute setting, but more chronically if they go on to abuse MDMA,\" said Maryann Amirshahi, a professor of emergency medicine at Georgetown University and a member of the committee.\n\nAbout 40% of those enrolled in the MDMA study had a history of using prior to the study.\n\nAlongside its positive findings on the short-term effects of MDMA, Lykos presented data from a follow-up observational study intended to suss out the staying power of the treatment.\n\nWhile not yet published in a peer-reviewed journal, that data \"suggest evidence of MDMA's durability to at least six months,\" said Yazar-Klosinski with Lykos.\n\nHowever, the FDA staff highlighted various issues with that long-term data, including a dropout rate of 25% and the fact that some participants sought therapy and, in some cases, used illicit drugs, including MDMA..\n\nData shared from Lykos showed a range of adverse events.\n\nThe majority of those in the study had a history of suicidal ideation in their lifetime, but during the study period \"the frequency of these symptoms was comparable between the two groups, said Dr. Alia Lilienstein, senior medical director for Lykos Therapeutics.\n\n\"Of note there were no suicidal behaviors or attempts reported in the MDMA group,\" she said.\n\nThat point is particularly contentious because of recent allegations that certain adverse events were not reported. A petition filed with the FDAcalling for the advisory meeting outlined these concerns and others, citing an unnamed former employee of the drug company.\n\nThere is already a well-documented case of two therapists in the Phase 2 trials with a participant who said they engaged in inappropriate contact with her while she was under the influence of MDMA. The videos of the two therapists in bed with the participant were eventually made public by a podcast.\n\n\"Let's try to not gloss over this misconduct. It was sexual misconduct. That's particularly important,\" said Elizabeth Joniak-Grant, a sociologist and a member of the panel.\n\nSeveral other panelists asked questions along those lines.\n\nLast month, a report from the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, a group that evaluates clinical data and drug prices, concluded there was insufficient evidence to assess the overall net benefit of MDMA-assisted therapy, after a lengthy investigation into the trial data.\n\nThat report stated that it's possible those involved in the trials including therapists and investigators encouraged the reporting of positive events and downplayed adverse events.\n\nThe drug company has pushed back on the allegations and said it stands behind the data.\n\nA public comment submitted to the FDA by one trial participant said her therapist encouraged her to view \"worsening symptoms as evidence of healing and 'spiritual awakening'\" and that she and other participants later struggled with suicidality following the trial.\n\nDr. Walter Dunn, a psychiatrist at UCLA and a panelist, asked about claims in the ICER report that some participants may have been discouraged from participating in the long term durability study.\n\n\"Those were investigated as well,\" said Lilienstein with Lykos, \"All participants who were interested in participating were given the opportunity to review consent, and some chose not to participate after reviewing consent, but otherwise everyone was given the opportunity.\"", "source": {"uri": "weku.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "weku.org"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

MDMA is a psychedelic drug known as an entactogen, a class of psychoactive drugs that produce experiences of emotional communion, relatedness and emotional openness.About 200 people participated in the Lykos trials, with a treatment program that involved three eight-hour sessions where participants took MDMA in the presence of two therapists. The MDMA sessions were spaced about a month apart, along with additional therapy sessions.\"Participants appear to experience rapid, clinically meaningful, durable improvement in their PTSD symptoms,\" the U.S. Food and Drug Administration wrote in a briefing document about the studies.But the agency also noted that \"several factors make these data challenging to interpret and complicate the benefit-risk assessment for this application,\" posing key questions for the members of the Psychopharmacologic Drugs Advisory Committee to consider.As they weigh the risks and benefits of the novel treatment at today's meeting, the committee members will hear presentations from Lykos and the FDA, along with comments from the public. The FDA has final say on approving the treatment and will often follow the committee's recommendations but does not have to do so.Video below: Psychologist discusses different causes, symptoms of PTSDThe studies were designed to be double-blind, meaning neither the participants nor the researchers knew who received the MDMA treatment and who didn't. This type of study is considered the gold standard because it helps reduce bias in results by minimizing the effects of external factors. But MDMA's hallucinogenic effects have \"profound alterations\" on a person's state of being, and the vast majority of participants knew which group they were in simply by the nature of their experience.The Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, a nonprofit that conducts independent reviews of treatments, tests and procedures, also cited \"substantial concerns about the validity of the results\" of the Lykos trials in a report published in March. Those concerns centered around bias, both from the unblinding of the trial and from other influences on patient perspectives.In addition to blurry data on efficacy, there were concerns about safety data, the FDA said.It is known to have potential for abuse, but the FDA cautions that the research did not appropriately assess this as an adverse event in the context of the treatment program. Reports from illicit use of MDMA suggest that it may pose risks to both heart and liver health. The phase III clinical trials showed \"significant increases in both blood pressure and pulse\" among participants, the FDA said, but certain related assessments were incomplete. And liver health was assessed only in small groups from earlier phases of the clinical trials.The questions are all familiar to Lykos, and the company has had conversations with the FDA throughout its research, CEO Amy Emerson said. The advisory committee meeting is the \"next big milestone\" in the process and an opportunity to gather even more information, she said.\"There's just such an urgent patient need for new treatment options, and we really use that as our guiding light as we develop MDMA-assisted therapy,\" she said. \"All along, we've been really committed to safety, and that will always be top of mind.\"There is growing interest and support to explore the use of psychedelics as therapeutics.

Panelists pointed to flawed studies that could have skewed the results, missing follow-up data on patient outcomes and a lack of diversity among participants. The vast majority of patients studied were white, with only five Black patients receiving MDMA, raising questions about the generalizability of the results.\n\n\"The fact that this study has so many white participants is problematic because I don't want something to roll out that only helps this one group,\" said Elizabeth Joniak-Grant, the group's patient representative.\n\nThe FDA advisers also drew attention to allegations of misconduct in the trials that have recently surfaced in news stories and a report by the nonprofit Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, which evaluates experimental drug treatments. The incidents include a 2018 report of apparent sexual misconduct by a therapist interacting with a patient.\n\nLykos Therapeutics, the company behind the study, said it previously reported the incident to the FDA and regulators in Canada, where the therapist is based. Lykos is essentially a corporate spinoff of the nation's leading psychedelic advocacy group, the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies, or MAPS, which funded the studies. The group was founded in 1986 to promote the benefits of MDMA and other mind-altering substances.\n\nLykos and MAPS did not immediately respond to requests for comment Tuesday evening.\n\nThe negative panel ruling could further derail financial investments in the fledgling psychedelic industry, which has mainly been funded by a small number of wealthy backers. Dozens of startup companies have launched in recent years seeking to study psilocybin, ketamine and others drugs for conditions like depression and addiction, though many have struggled to raise money.\n\nMDMA's main effect is triggering feelings of intimacy, connection and euphoria. When used to enhance talk therapy, the drug appears to help patients process their trauma and let go of disturbing thoughts and memories.\n\nBut the panel struggled with the reliability of those results, given the difficulties of objectively testing psychedelic drugs.\n\nBecause MDMA causes intense, psychological experiences, almost all patients in two key studies of the drug were able to guess whether they had received the MDMA or a dummy pill. That's the opposite of the approach generally required for high-quality drug research, in which bias is minimized by \"blinding\" patients and researchers to whether they received the drug under investigation.\n\n\"I'm not convinced at all that this drug is effective based on the data I saw,\" said Dr. Rajesh Narendran, a University of Pittsburgh psychiatrist who chaired the panel.\n\nPanelists also noted the difficulty of knowing how much of patients' improvement came from MDMA versus simply undergoing the extensive therapy, which totaled more than 80 hours for many patients. Results were further marred by other complicating factors, including a large number of patients who had previously used MDMA or other psychedelics drugs recreationally.\n\nNearly three dozen public speakers addressed the panel, including veterans who said they benefitted from MDMA therapy, medical professionals who advised against its use and journalists and independent researchers who reiterated the allegations of misconduct in the trials.\n\nThe meeting concluded with several experts encouraging Lykos and the FDA to continue studying psychedelics for PTSD, citing the field's potential to help patients.\n\n\"I think this is a really exciting treatment and I'm encouraged by the results to date,\" said Dr. Paul Holtzheimer of the VA's National Center for PTSD, \"but from a safety and efficacy standpoint I feel it's still premature.\"\n\n___", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MDMA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "MDMA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Food and Drug Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychedelic_drug", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Psychedelic drug"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psilocybin", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Psilocybin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multidisciplinary_Association_for_Psychedelic_Studies", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LSD", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "LSD"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mental disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketamine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ketamine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoactive_drug", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Psychoactive drug"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonprofit_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nonprofit organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-traumatic_stress_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Post-traumatic stress disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Efficacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depression_(mood)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Depression (mood)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatrist", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Psychiatrist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Pittsburgh", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of Pittsburgh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euphoria", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Euphoria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreational_drug_use", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Recreational drug use"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychotherapy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Psychotherapy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_trauma", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Psychological trauma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bias"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Addiction"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Drugs", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Drugs", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Drugs_and_Medications", "label": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Drugs and Medications", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Teen_Health/Drugs_and_Alcohol", "label": "dmoz/Health/Teen Health/Drugs and Alcohol", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Patient_Safety", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Patient Safety", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Pharmacology", "label": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Pharmacology", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 61}], "image": "https://bostonglobe-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/G5weFtHS0HDeW-anahDZ_mKsnuo=/506x0/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bostonglobe/FVABHJFAL4VIWN3JTJMZYAUOPA.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9619876", "eventUri": "eng-9619876", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

There remains a large unmet need for new treatments for PTSD as existing drugs do not work on all patients.\n\nThe Lykos treatment is one among several psychedelic drugs being tested in patients with hard to treat mental health conditions such as Compass Pathways' drug, which uses the same component as magic mushrooms.\n\nThe FDA's staff proposed restrictions around its use and monitoring in their briefing documents on Friday. The FDA also flagged a rise in blood pressure and pulse in the trials and cases of liver toxicity.\n\nThe approval could offer \"a new avenue of treatment, but itself is not going to make a big dent\", due to costs and complexities associated with it, said Olson.\n\n\"It's important because it would be the first in this class of molecules, but I don't think it will be the last, it will be replaced by compounds that have superior properties to MDMA.\"\n\n(Reporting by Sriparna Roy and Pratik Jain in Bengaluru; Editing by Arun Koyyur)\n\nSign Up for Springs AM Update Your morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

Here's what to know", "body": "Millions of people living with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in the United States may soon have the option to get MDMA -- also known as ecstasy or molly -- prescribed to them as part of their treatment.\n\nThe public benefit company Lykos Therapeutics submitted a new drug application late last year to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for its MDMA capsules, to be used alongside therapy to treat PTSD. The FDA fast-tracked the application, granting it priority review in February and giving itself an August deadline to make a decision on whether to approve the first-of-its-kind treatment.\n\nAs part of its review, the agency has called in an independent panel of experts to weigh in on the experimental treatment's safety and efficacy.\n\nOn Tuesday the FDA's Psychopharmacologic Drugs Advisory Committee is set to review -- in an all day session -- results from numerous studies, including two late-stage clinical trials by Lykos, and give the agency a non-binding recommendation.\n\n\"In addition to being the first FDA advisory committee meeting to review a potential new PTSD treatment in 25 years, this will be the first MDMA-assisted therapy and psychedelic-assisted therapy to be reviewed by an FDA advisory committee,\" Lykos CEO Amy Emerson told Quartz via email.\n\nIf approved, Lykos MDMA treatment would further legitimize a growing wave of interest and funding going toward research into the use of psychedelics to treat mental disorders such as PTSD and depression.\n\nPreviously, the FDA approved a nasal spray in 2019 that contains a variation of ketamine for treatment-resistant depression.\n\nLykos is a public benefit corporation that spun-off from the non-profit Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS) in 2014 to bring MDMA-assisted therapy to market.\n\nMAPS itself was founded by activist Rick Doblin in 1986 and has raised over $140 million for psychedelic research and education. Earlier this year, Lykos changed its name from MAPS Public Benefit Corporation when it announced it had raised over $100 million in funding from outside investors.\n\nLykos has outlined how its MDMA-assisted therapy for PTSD works in two phase 3 clinical trials.\n\nIn the studies, patients were given MDMA capsules made by Lykos along with talk therapy in three eight-hour session, overseen by two specially-trained therapists. The sessions were spread about four weeks apart.\n\nAccording to results from the latest trial, about 71% of participants who received MDMA-assisted therapy no longer met the criteria for PTSD after 18 weeks, compared with 48% of the patients who received a placebo.\n\nOn Friday, the FDA gave the first hint of its thinking in briefing papers posted online ahead of Tuesday's meeting.\n\nFDA scientists said that based on the clinical trial data \"participants appear to experience rapid, clinically meaningful, durable improvement in their PTSD symptoms.\" However they also said the data was \"challenging to interpret\" due to the nature of the treatment.\n\nBecause MDMA produces in alterations in mood and cognition, patients know if they received the treatment or a placebo, making it nearly impossible to carry out a double-blind study.\n\nIn March, the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review published a report with similar criticisms of the trials.\n\nEmerson told Quartz that the studies were designed in collaboration with the FDA.\n\n\"Given the novel nature of midomafetamine (MDMA) treatment, Lykos has consistently sought and received feedback from the FDA throughout the development program,\" Emerson said.\n\nIf Lykos's treatment is approved, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency will first need to reschedule MDMA from a Schedule I substance before it can be marketed. The agency will have three months from the time the treatment is approved to do so, with individual states following suit.\n\nAs Lykos prepares to take its treatment outside of a clinical setting, the company is planning to offer training programs on how to properlu administer the treatment. Emerson said that, if approved in August, the company plans to launch MDMA-assisted therapy in the first quarter of 2025.\n\nThe company will also continue researching other uses for its treatment.", "source": {"uri": "qz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Quartz"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-traumatic_stress_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Post-traumatic stress disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multidisciplinary_Association_for_Psychedelic_Studies", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MDMA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "MDMA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Food and Drug Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsule_(pharmacy)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Capsule (pharmacy)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_drug_application", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New drug application"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychopharmacology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Psychopharmacology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Efficacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Experiment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clinical trial"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartz_(publication)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quartz (publication)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Doblin", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rick Doblin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychedelic_therapy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Psychedelic therapy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment-resistant_depression", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Treatment-resistant depression"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasal_spray", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nasal spray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phases_of_clinical_research", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Phases of clinical research"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketamine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ketamine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Placebo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychotherapy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Psychotherapy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mental disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychedelic_drug", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Psychedelic drug"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health", "label": "dmoz/Health", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Drugs_and_Medications", "label": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Drugs and Medications", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Disorders", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 48}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 49}], "image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fill,h_675,pg_1,q_80,w_1200/64c9622881dc9ef38cc4eaf45c5d0520.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9619876", "eventUri": "eng-9619876", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3333333333333333, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

If approved by the FDA, it would be the first new treatment for PTSD in more than two decades.\n\nThe votes reflected panel members' struggle to balance the need for new PTSD treatments against serious concerns about the data submitted by drugmaker Lykos Pharmaceuticals, which was marred by inconsistencies, poor study design and allegations of misconduct.\n\n\"It sounds like MDMA has really impacted a number of people in positive ways, but it seems that there are so many problems with the data,\" said Melissa Decker Barone, an adjunct assistant professor in the department of psychiatry at the University of Maryland School of Medicine.\n\nThe panel's decision was based on the results of two phase 3 clinical trials that included nearly 200 patients, in total, with moderate to severe PTSD. In both trials, researchers found that a treatment approach that consisted of MDMA given during three eight-hour therapy sessions, space four weeks apart, worked better than a placebo in reducing the severity of their symptoms. People also had a number of shorter talk therapy sessions before and after getting the drug or the placebo.\n\nIn the most recent trial, published last September, about 86% of participants who got the MDMA treatment along with talk therapy saw a reduction in the severity of their symptoms after 18 weeks. About 71% of participants who got the treatment met the diagnostic criteria for PTSD, compared to about 48% who also got therapy but took a placebo instead.\n\nThe vote came after an analysis from FDA scientists, published last week, raised concerns about how the trials were carried out.\n\nA double-blinded, randomized clinical trial is considered the gold standard for determining whether a drug works better than a placebo. \"Double-blinded\" means that neither the patient nor the researcher administering the drug knows whether it is a placebo or the real thing.\n\nIn the MDMA trials, however, due to the \"profound alterations in mood, sensation, suggestibility and cognition,\" the vast majority of the participants were able to accurately guess which treatment they had received after the study ended, the FDA scientists wrote. \"As a result, studies are nearly impossible to blind.\"\n\nThis could \"artificially inflate\" the results, Dr. David Millis, an FDA official who oversaw Lykos approval application, said during Tuesday's meeting, because participants may feel the treatment is working if they know they are on the drug, or conversely not working if they are on a placebo.\n\n\"We expressed continued concern about the adequacy of blinding,\" he said.\n\nLast week, the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, a non-profit group that evaluates the cost of drugs, said patients and providers in the trial treated psychedelics \"more like a religious movement than like pharmaceutical products.\"\n\nIndeed, panel members had reservations about the trials, including that many patients had used MDMA before, and that some therapists may have encouraged favorable reports from patients.\n\n\"The data was promising but given the 40% of people who had previously used MDMA, limited information about recruitment and recruitment coming through referrals, and I really wonder how much that impacted the efficacy,\" said Elizabeth Joniak-Grant, a patient representative and sociologist at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill.\n\nPanel members also expressed serious concerns about potential risks to patients at the hands of providers following allegations of sexual misconduct during an earlier trial.\n\nLykos recommended that two therapists be present for the therapy sessions. Panel members wanted to ensure that both therapists were licensed, and that patient concerns would be addressed.\n\n\"We need a clear pathway for reporting,\" said Kim Witczak, a consumer representative and the executive director of Woody Matters, a drug safety organization. \"I've been around drug safety issues for a long time and I hear from harmed all the time and the reality is patients report, nothing gets done.\"\n\nThe decision will now go to the FDA, which is expected to make a final ruling by August 11. The committee's vote is only a recommendation, and the agency doesn't have to follow its advice, although it usually does.\n\nAbout 13 million people in the U.S., many of whom are veterans, have PTSD, according to the FDA. The condition, which develops in some people exposed to serious injury or violence, can be debilitating: People often experience intrusive memories and nightmares that can cause high levels of anxiety, suicidal thoughts, self-destructive behavior and trouble sleeping.\n\nTalk therapy is the first-line treatment for the condition, either alone or in combination with one of two antidepressants, sertraline (Zoloft) or paroxetine (Paxil). However, data presented by the agency at Tuesday's meeting found patients often drop out with talk therapy alone. What's more, response rates to the medications rarely exceed 60% and less than 20% to 30% of patients with PTSD achieve full remission of their symptoms.\n\nResearchers are still trying to understand exactly how MDMA helps people with PTSD, but the drug is thought to work in part by quieting the fear and anxiety response in the brain, said David Olson, director of the U.C. Davis Institute for Psychedelics and Neurotherapeutics.", "source": {"uri": "nbcnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-traumatic_stress_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Post-traumatic stress disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medication", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Medication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Placebo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MDMA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "MDMA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Food and Drug Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychedelic_drug", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Psychedelic drug"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Maryland_School_of_Medicine", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of Maryland School of Medicine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychopharmacology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Psychopharmacology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlled_Substances_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Controlled Substances Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Efficacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phases_of_clinical_research", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Phases of clinical research"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychotherapy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Psychotherapy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mental disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Psychiatry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blinded_experiment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Blinded experiment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cognition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Medical diagnosis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_impairment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Visual impairment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Randomized controlled trial"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remission_(medicine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Remission (medicine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paroxetine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paroxetine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_North_Carolina_at_Chapel_Hill", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Davis", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of California, Davis"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health", "label": "dmoz/Health", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Biotechnology_and_Pharmaceuticals", "label": "dmoz/Business/Biotechnology and Pharmaceuticals", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Drugs_and_Medications", "label": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Drugs and Medications", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Pharmacology", "label": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Pharmacology", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1024-512,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-04/240408-fda-building-al-0851-5e03d2.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9619876", "eventUri": "eng-9619876", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-08-11", "textStart": 4716, "textEnd": 4725}], "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

They also voted 10 to 1 that the risks of MDMA, also known as ecstasy, outweigh its benefits. The FDA does not have to follow its advisory committee's recommendations when deciding whether to approve a drug, but often does.\n\nThe vote highlighted the difficulty of assessing psychedelic drugs and the FDA's limited ability to evaluate psychiatric treatments. \"It felt strange to vote no,\" said committee member and statistician Satish Iyengar at the University of Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania, given that the drug's effects seemed so strong. \"There were just too many problems with it.\"\n\nThe meeting was held 4 June in Silver Spring, Maryland.\n\nMDMA is a synthetic compound that can evoke euphoria and raise energy levels. It has already been approved for limited use in Australia to treat post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression.\n\nFor decades, the nonprofit group Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS) in San Jose, California, has been running MDMA clinical trials and campaigning for drug legalization worldwide. The association's commercial arm, Lykos Therapeutics in San Jose, has developed an MDMA treatment protocol involving a series of psychotherapy sessions, along with three sessions in which a team of two therapists administers MDMA. The idea, the company has said, is that MDMA is not a treatment in itself, but rather helps people open up to their therapists about traumatic events that might otherwise be difficult to confront.\n\nIn its application to the FDA, Lykos cited two clinical trials in which a total of around 200 people with PTSD received either MDMA or a placebo. More than 80% of those who received MDMA saw significant improvements in their symptoms. And the effect seemed to persist when investigators followed up with a portion of these participants between 6-24 months later.\n\nBut FDA scientists themselves had a number of concerns about Lykos's studies, which they felt were lacking crucial psychological and physiological safety data. A major concern was the fact that participants -- and their therapists -- could almost always tell whether they had received MDMA or a placebo. An FDA report released ahead of the meeting called the data \"challenging to interpret.\"\n\n\"The fact is you just can't blind these studies,\" FDA psychiatry division director Tiffany Farchione said at the meeting. In 2016, MAPS and the FDA agreed on a protocol in which an independent assessor who had not taken part in the trial would evaluate each person's psychiatric progress. But both FDA staff and the advisory committee remained worried that people's expectations of receiving a drug would affect their response to it.\n\nOther concerns included the fact that around 40% of the trial participants had taken illicit MDMA before the trial, potentially biasing the sample. And many sought other treatments -- including psychedelic drugs -- between the initial trial and the follow-up, suggesting that their symptoms might have continued and that their improvement might not have been due entirely to MDMA.\n\nMany of the advisory committee members' questions centered on the role of psychotherapy. Lykos has developed a therapy protocol that would be administered along with the drug. But the FDA does not regulate therapy. The most it can do is ensure that medical practitioners overseeing the drug's administration provide some therapy.\n\nLykos's protocol gives therapists substantial discretion in how they treat their clients, which left some committee members concerned that trial participants might have received different therapy experiences depending on whether they received a drug or placebo. They pointed out that a good therapist could make a useless drug seem effective, and there is no way to disentangle the two effects. Panel members also worried about how therapists would be trained, and called for strong regulations to protect people from abuse by clinicians when under the influence of the drug.\n\nFarchione said she hoped the advisory committee would help the agency to address these issues, particularly given that many other companies are studying psychedelic therapies that the FDA will eventually need to evaluate. \"I think we are charting new territory, and we want to set it up right,\" she said.\n\nFurther raising concerns, a report from the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, a nonprofit group in Boston, Massachusetts, that analyses medical procedures, reported allegations that people who'd had bad experiences in the initial trials had been discouraged from participating in the follow up study. Lykos denied this at the committee meeting, and the FDA is conducting an investigation that will conclude before it makes a decision on the drug.\n\n\"I was absolutely shocked\" by the committee's vote, says psychiatrist Rachel Yehuda at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City, who was not on the committee. \"It was very disappointing.\" She says the experts brought up good points over the eight-hour hearing, particularly about safety of people receiving treatment. She hopes that the FDA will look for ways to address these concerns instead of simply denying the drug. \"I want us to have learned from the committee's wisdom.\" The FDA is expected to issue a decision in August.\n\nIn a statement Lykos said, \"While we are disappointed in the vote, we are committed to continuing to collaborate with the FDA with their ongoing review of our [new drug application] over the coming weeks.\"", "source": {"uri": "nature.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Nature"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

It also flagged \"significant increases\" in blood pressure and pulse rates that could \"trigger cardiovascular events.\"\n\nThe staff analysis was conducted for an independent advisory panel that will meet Tuesday to consider an application by Lykos Therapeutics for the use of MDMA-assisted therapy. The agency's concerns highlight the unique and complex issues facing regulators as they weigh the therapeutic value of an illegal drug commonly known as Ecstasy that has long been associated with all-night raves and cuddle puddles.\n\nApproval would mark a seismic change in the nation's relationship with psychedelic compounds, most of which the Drug Enforcement Administration classifies as illegal substances that have \"no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse.\"\n\nResearch like the current studies on MDMA therapy have corralled the support of various groups and lawmakers from both parties for treatment of PTSD, a condition affecting millions of Americans, especially military veterans who face an outsize risk of suicide. No new therapy has been approved for PTSD in more than 20 years.\n\n\"What's happening is truly a paradigm shift for psychiatry,\" said David Olson, director of the University of California Davis Institute for Psychedelics and Neurotherapeutics. \"MDMA is an important step for the field because we really lack effective treatments, period, and people need help now.\"\n\nAmy Emerson, CEO of Lykos Therapeutics, said the company stood behind the data and the design of its studies, which were developed in consultation with FDA staff members. \"Functional unblinding,\" in which study participants can determine whether they've been given a placebo, often influences research on psychoactive medications because patients are acutely aware of the effects, she said.\n\nA rejection of the application would shake the nascent field of psychedelic medicine, which has been drawing millions of dollars in private investment.

While he had concerns about the drug, he noted that \"we are in dire need of treatments for PTSD.\"\n\n\"There's no free lunch in medicine,\" Dunn said. \"What has the potential for benefit has the potential for harm.\"\n\nThe panel's decision was based on the results of two Phase 3 clinical trials that included nearly 200 patients with moderate to severe PTSD. In both trials, researchers found that a treatment approach that consisted of MDMA given in three eight-hour therapy sessions, four weeks apart, worked better than a placebo in reducing the severity of their symptoms. People also had a number of shorter talk therapy sessions before and after getting the drug or the placebo.\n\nIn the most recent trial, published last September, about 86% of participants who got the MDMA treatment along with talk therapy saw a reduction in the severity of their symptoms after 18 weeks. About 71% of participants who got the treatment met the diagnostic criteria for PTSD, compared to about 48% who also got therapy but took a placebo instead.\n\nThe vote came after an analysis from FDA scientists, published last week, raised concerns about how the trials were carried out.\n\nA double-blinded, randomized clinical trial is considered the gold standard for determining whether a drug works better than a placebo. \"Double-blinded\" means that neither the patient nor the researcher administering the drug knows whether it is a placebo or the real thing.\n\nIn the MDMA trials, however, due to the \"profound alterations in mood, sensation, suggestibility and cognition,\" the vast majority of the participants were able to accurately guess which treatment they had received after the study ended, the FDA scientists wrote. \"As a result, studies are nearly impossible to blind.\"\n\nThis could \"artificially inflate\" the results, Dr. David Millis, an FDA official who oversaw Lykos' approval application, said during Tuesday's meeting, because participants may feel the treatment is working if they know they are on the drug, or conversely not working if they are on a placebo.\n\n\"We expressed continued concern about the adequacy of blinding,\" he said.\n\nLast week, the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, a nonprofit group that evaluates the cost of drugs, said patients and providers in the trial treated psychedelics \"more like a religious movement than like pharmaceutical products.\"\n\nIndeed, panel members had reservations about the trials, including that many patients had used MDMA before and that some therapists may have encouraged favorable reports from patients.\n\n\"The data was promising but given the 40% of people who had previously used MDMA, limited information about recruitment and recruitment coming through referrals -- I really wonder how much that impacted the efficacy,\" said Elizabeth Joniak-Grant, a patient representative and sociologist at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill.\n\nPanel members also expressed serious concerns about potential risks to patients at the hands of providers, following allegations of sexual misconduct during an earlier trial.\n\nLykos recommended that two therapists be present for the therapy sessions. Panel members wanted to ensure that both therapists were licensed, and that patient concerns would be addressed.\n\n\"We need a clear pathway for reporting,\" said Kim Witczak, a consumer representative and the executive director of Woody Matters, a drug safety organization. \"I've been around drug safety issues for a long time and I hear from harmed patients all the time and the reality is patients report, nothing gets done.\"\n\nThe decision will now go to the FDA, which is expected to make a final ruling by Aug. 11. The committee's vote is only a recommendation and the agency doesn't have to follow its advice, although it usually does.\n\nAbout 13 million people in the U.S., many of whom are veterans, have PTSD, according to the FDA. The condition, which develops in some people exposed to serious injury or violence, can be debilitating: People often experience intrusive memories and nightmares that can cause high levels of anxiety, suicidal thoughts, self-destructive behavior and trouble sleeping.\n\nTalk therapy is the first line of treatment for the condition, either alone or in combination with one of two antidepressants, sertraline (Zoloft) or paroxetine (Paxil). However, data presented by the agency at Tuesday's meeting found patients often drop out with talk therapy alone. What's more, response rates to the medications rarely exceed 60% and less than 20% to 30% of patients with PTSD achieve full remission of their symptoms.\n\nResearchers are still trying to understand exactly how MDMA helps people with PTSD, but the drug is thought to work in part by quieting the fear and anxiety response in the brain, said David Olson, director of the U.C.

PTSD", "body": "The US Food And Drug Administration is weighing whether MDMA, also known as ecstasy, can be used to treat post-traumatic stress disorder\n\nA panel of US health experts convened by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are meeting Tuesday to weigh the benefits and risks of using MDMA, commonly known as ecstasy, to treat post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\nPTSD, a debilitating mental health condition that develops after a person experiences or is threatened by traumatic events such as death, combat, or sexual assault, affects an estimated five percent of Americans in any given year.\n\nBut treatment options are so far limited to two antidepressants that require three months of dosing to take effect, and response rates to the medications have been found to be uneven.\n\nCalifornia-based Lykos Therapeutics is basing their request for regulatory approval on two clinical studies, each of which enrolled around 100 people, to evaluate MDMA used together with other psychological interventions such as talk therapy, against a placebo with talk therapy.\n\nThese two studies, published in the prestigious journal Nature Medicine, indicated MDMA was indeed both safe and highly effective at treating PTSD.\n\nBut a briefing document put together by the FDA ahead of the meeting suggested its staff were not as convinced.\n\nIn particular, they were concerned that although the studies were nominally \"double-blinded\" -- meaning neither those being tested nor their health care workers knew who received the treatment versus the placebo -- most people were able to accurately guess what they received.\n\nThis \"functional unblinding,\" they argued, introduces bias and uncertainty into study outcomes.\n\nWhat's more, they criticized Lykos for not gathering sufficient side effect data, including whether participants experienced \"euphoria\" or \"elated mood,\" which, the FDA argued, \"would be informative for an assessment of abuse potential or characterization of anticipated effects of the drug.\"\n\nReports from recreational use suggest MDMA has harmful impacts on heart and liver health -- but the company did not gather enough data in these areas, the FDA said.\n\nMDMA -- Methylenedioxymethamphetamine -- is a Schedule 1 drug under the Controlled Substances Act, and approving it for medical use would represent a major shift.\n\nBut even if the FDA advisers endorse MDMA, their vote is non-binding and the final decision on whether to approve the treatment rests with the agency.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType":

The panel also voted 10-1 that a safety program wouldn't be sufficient to protect patients from potential risks of the therapy.\n\nThe FDA will spend the next several weeks deciding whether to grant clearance for the medication before the deadline of August 11. The agency doesn't have to follow the counsel of its advisers, but it frequently does. In cases when the FDA decides not to approve, the agency and the sponsor discuss potential next steps such as providing additional data.\n\nThe strongly negative vote puts the regulator in a tough spot. Some of the panel's efficacy concerns relate the design of Lykos' clinical trials, which the agency signed off on back in 2017. The committee had concerns across the board, from how the trials was designed and conducted to the potential for vulnerable patients to be harmed or abused. Worries also arose about MDMA-related cardiac side effects and the potential an approval would lead to increased diversion of MDMA for recreational use.\n\n\"There's a lot of holes in this data set,\" Rajesh Narendran, a psychiatrist from the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center who chairs the panel, said during a discussion period. \"I'm not convinced at all this drug is effective based on the data I saw.\"\n\nThe FDA has been under pressure to approve medications that treat PTSD, a mental illness that sometimes develops after patients witness or experience a life-threatening or traumatic event. Some 13 million Americans have PTSD in any given year, according to the Department of Veterans Affairs, and the few treatment options include two approved drugs that aren't effective for many people.\n\nWith its large PTSD patient population, the VA has been \"proactively preparing for a potential approval of MDMA-assisted therapy by the FDA,\" a spokesperson said in an email last month. The government agency has already put together a task force to prepare for the MDMA rollout in veterans.\n\nCompanies including Mind Medicine Inc., Atai Life Sciences and Compass Pathways are developing psychedelic drugs for medical purposes. Clearance of MDMA, known more commonly as ecstasy or molly, could add to the push for recreational drugs into mainstream applications. Shares of Mind Medicine fell 2.5% after U.S. markets closed, while Compass Pathways' fell 9% in after-market U.S. trading following the negative vote.\n\nPowerful drugs\n\nPsychedelics are powerful drugs that affect mood, perception and cognitive processes. Currently MDMA is deemed a schedule 1 drug by the Drug Enforcement Administration, on the same level as heroin and LSD, meaning it has high risk for abuse or addiction. Schedule 3 drugs like ketamine and anabolic steroids, which have medical uses, have a lower risk.\n\nCritics have raised concerns about whether studies of MDMA can be taken at face value. A key issue is that patients may be aware of whether they received the drug or a placebo because of MDMA's pyschedelic effects. There are also controversies around underreported patient safety events and questions about whether therapists involved in the trials were too invested in its success.\n\n\"We already have evidence-based treatments for PTSD,\" said Melissa Barone, a psychologist with the VA Maryland Health Care System who sits on the panel. \"There's just a lot of questions still, that I would have about how effective the treatment is and how durable it is.\"\n\nIn documents published ahead of the meeting, FDA staff said that \"several factors make these data challenging to interpret and complicate the benefit-risk assessment.\"\n\nThe drug may also raise the risk of heart attacks and strokes by increasing patients' pulse and blood pressure, the FDA staff said in their report, and cited the vulnerability of patients under the influence of the drug.\n\n\"We are particularly concerned that serious harm could result while patients are impaired,\" they wrote.\n\nOther medical groups, including the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review and review panel of the American Psychological Association, have said that there's insufficient data to show the benefit of MDMA for PTSD treatment. The ICER report also said study participants may have felt pressured to report good outcomes and suppress bad ones, and acknowledged an allegation of sexual misconduct during an early trial.\n\n\"We certainly take those allegations very seriously and are quite concerned by them,\" Tiffany Farchione, FDA's psychiatry division director, said in the meeting. \"We do have inspections ongoing at this point.\"\n\nLykos' drug is taken in studies in conjunction with 42 hours of talk therapy, including three daylong sessions during which patients are under the influence of the drug.\n\nIf the FDA acts against the panel's advice and approves the drug, it could take up to three months for the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration to move it from the strictest category of controlled substances to a less restrictive one. And even then, the process is further complicated by state laws.\n\n_____", "source": {"uri": "sacbee.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Sacramento Bee"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-traumatic_stress_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Post-traumatic stress disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MDMA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "MDMA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Food and Drug Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medication", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Medication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Veterans_Affairs", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Veterans Affairs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mental disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychedelic_drug", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Psychedelic drug"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Efficacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreational_drug_use", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Recreational drug use"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clinical trial"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_effect", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Side effect"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatrist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Psychiatrist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Pittsburgh", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of Pittsburgh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cognition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Perception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_trauma", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Psychological trauma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LSD", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LSD"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Evidence-based medicine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketamine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ketamine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Psychological_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American Psychological Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_Enforcement_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drug Enforcement Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Maryland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Maryland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Drugs_and_Medications", "label": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Drugs and Medications", "wgt": 43}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Teen_Health/Drugs_and_Alcohol", "label": "dmoz/Health/Teen Health/Drugs and Alcohol", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Pharmacology", "label": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Pharmacology", "wgt": 32}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Home_Tests", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Home Tests", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://www.mcclatchy-wires.com/incoming/g20ugl/picture289019674/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/f7edc1e7-ba19-4855-8349-7afa24c4c00b", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9619876", "eventUri": "eng-9619876", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-08-11", "textStart": 724, "textEnd": 733}], "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

Worries also arose about MDMA-related cardiac side effects and the potential an approval would lead to increased diversion of MDMA for recreational use.\n\n\"There's a lot of holes in this data set,\" Rajesh Narendran, a psychiatrist from the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center who chairs the panel, said during a discussion period. \"I'm not convinced at all this drug is effective based on the data I saw.\"\n\nThe FDA has been under pressure to approve medications that treat PTSD, a mental illness that sometimes develops after patients witness or experience a life-threatening or traumatic event. Some 13 million Americans have PTSD in any given year, according to the Department of Veterans Affairs, and the few treatment options include two approved drugs that aren't effective for many people.\n\nWith its large PTSD patient population, the VA has been \"proactively preparing for a potential approval of MDMA-assisted therapy by the FDA,\" a spokesperson said in an email last month. The government agency has already put together a task force to prepare for the MDMA rollout in veterans.\n\nCompanies including Mind Medicine Inc., Atai Life Sciences and Compass Pathways are developing psychedelic drugs for medical purposes. Clearance of MDMA, known more commonly as ecstasy or molly, could add to the push for recreational drugs into mainstream applications.\n\nPowerful Drugs\n\nPsychedelics are powerful drugs that affect mood, perception and cognitive processes. Currently MDMA is deemed a schedule 1 drug by the Drug Enforcement Administration, on the same level as heroin and LSD, meaning it has high risk for abuse or addiction. Schedule 3 drugs like ketamine and anabolic steroids, which have medical uses, have a lower risk.\n\nCritics have raised concerns about whether studies of MDMA can be taken at face value. A key issue is that patients may be aware of whether they received the drug or a placebo because of MDMA's pyschedelic effects. There are also controversies around underreported patient safety events and questions about whether therapists involved in the trials were too invested in its success.\n\n\"We already have evidence-based treatments for PTSD,\" said Melissa Barone, a psychologist with the VA Maryland Health Care System who sits on the panel. \"There's just a lot of questions still, that I would have about how effective the treatment is and how durable it is.\"\n\nIn documents published ahead of the meeting, FDA staff said that \"several factors make these data challenging to interpret and complicate the benefit-risk assessment.\"\n\nThe drug may also raise the risk of heart attacks and strokes by increasing patients' pulse and blood pressure, the FDA staff said in their report, and cited the vulnerability of patients under the influence of the drug.\n\n\"We are particularly concerned that serious harm could result while patients are impaired,\" they wrote.\n\nOther medical groups, including the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review and review panel of the American Psychological Association, have said that there's insufficient data to show the benefit of MDMA for PTSD treatment. The ICER report also said study participants may have felt pressured to report good outcomes and suppress bad ones, and acknowledged an allegation of sexual misconduct during an early trial.\n\n\"We certainly take those allegations very seriously and are quite concerned by them,\" Tiffany Farchione, FDA's psychiatry division director, said in the meeting. \"We do have inspections ongoing at this point.\"\n\nLykos' drug is taken in studies in conjunction with 42 hours of talk therapy, including three daylong sessions during which patients are under the influence of the drug.", "source": {"uri": "bnnbloomberg.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "BNN"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-traumatic_stress_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Post-traumatic stress disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MDMA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "MDMA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Food and Drug Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychedelic_drug", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Psychedelic drug"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Veterans_Affairs", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Veterans Affairs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mental disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_effect", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Side effect"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatrist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Psychiatrist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Pittsburgh_Medical_Center", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of Pittsburgh Medical Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreational_drug_use", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Recreational drug use"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LSD", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "LSD"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medication", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Medication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketamine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ketamine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cognition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_Enforcement_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drug Enforcement Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Perception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_trauma", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Psychological trauma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Addiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heroin", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Heroin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Evidence-based medicine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Psychological_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American Psychological Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Maryland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Maryland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Drugs_and_Medications", "label": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Drugs and Medications", "wgt": 42}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Teen_Health/Drugs_and_Alcohol", "label": "dmoz/Health/Teen Health/Drugs and Alcohol", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Pharmacology", "label": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Pharmacology", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Home_Tests", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Home Tests", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 90}], "image": "http://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/polopoly_fs/1.2081161!/fileimage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_620/white-oak-md-july-20-a-sign-for-the-food-and-drug-administration-is-seen-outside-of-the-headquarters-on-july-20-2020-in-white-oak-maryland-photo-by-sarah-silbiger-getty-images.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9619876", "eventUri": "eng-9619876", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

It's the first time the FDA's advisers have considered a psychedelic drug for medical use. The novel treatment has the potential to transform a field with significant need, but critical questions loom.\n\nAbout 5% of adults in the United States - about 13 million people - experience PTSD in any given year, according estimates from the National Center for PTSD. But current treatment options - including antidepressants and some specialized forms of cognitive behavioral therapy - are limited in their scope and effectiveness, with few alternatives available to help those don't respond well to them.\n\nLykos Therapeutics has promising data from two late-stage clinical trials that used MDMA in combination with therapy to treat PTSD. MDMA is a psychedelic drug known as an entactogen, a class of psychoactive drugs that produce experiences of emotional communion, relatedness and emotional openness.\n\nAbout 200 people participated in the Lykos trials, with a treatment program that involved three eight-hour sessions where participants took MDMA in the presence of two therapists. The MDMA sessions were spaced about a month apart, along with additional therapy sessions.\n\n\"Participants appear to experience rapid, clinically meaningful, durable improvement in their PTSD symptoms,\" the US Food and Drug Administration wrote in a briefing document about the studies.\n\nBut the agency also noted that \"several factors make these data challenging to interpret and complicate the benefit-risk assessment for this application,\" posing key questions for the members of the Psychopharmacologic Drugs Advisory Committee to consider.\n\nAs they weigh the risks and benefits of the novel treatment at today's meeting, the committee members will hear presentations from Lykos and the FDA, along with comments from the public.\n\nThe FDA has final say on approving the treatment and will often follow the committee's recommendations but does not have to do so.\n\nThe studies were designed to be double-blind, meaning neither the participants nor the researchers knew who received the MDMA treatment and who didn't. This type of study is considered the gold standard because it helps reduce bias in results by minimizing the effects of external factors. But MDMA's hallucinogenic effects have \"profound alterations\" on a person's state of being, and the vast majority of participants knew which group they were in simply by the nature of their experience.\n\nThe Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, a nonprofit that conducts independent reviews of treatments, tests and procedures, also cited \"substantial concerns about the validity of the results\" of the Lykos trials in a report published in March. Those concerns centered around bias, both from the unblinding of the trial and from other influences on patient perspectives.\n\nIn addition to blurry data on efficacy, there were concerns about safety data, the FDA said.\n\nIt is known to have potential for abuse, but the FDA cautions that the research did not appropriately assess this as an adverse event in the context of the treatment program.\n\nReports from illicit use of MDMA suggest that it may pose risks to both heart and liver health. The phase III clinical trials showed \"significant increases in both blood pressure and pulse\" among participants, the FDA said, but certain related assessments were incomplete. And liver health was assessed only in small groups from earlier phases of the clinical trials.\n\nThe questions are all familiar to Lykos, and the company has had conversations with the FDA throughout its research, CEO Amy Emerson said. The advisory committee meeting is the \"next big milestone\" in the process and an opportunity to gather even more information, she said.\n\n\"There's just such an urgent patient need for new treatment options, and we really use that as our guiding light as we develop MDMA-assisted therapy,\" she said. \"All along, we've been really committed to safety, and that will always be top of mind.\"\n\nThere is growing interest and support to explore the use of psychedelics as therapeutics. Along with MDMA, drugs like ketamine and psilocybin mushrooms are being studied in clinical trials to treat a variety of mental health disorders.\n\n\"Depression, PTSD, eating disorders - they're all different. You can't just lump these together and say, 'Psychedelics are good for this,'\" Emerson said. \"You need to study it, you need to look at the safety and efficacy profiles of each, and we have to be careful to not treat these things as panaceas or like a magic bullet.\"\n\nThe Lykos treatment is the first to reach this point in the process, and the way the FDA and its advisory board proceed could set key precedents.\n\n\"It's an early but exciting moment. The promise is there, the potential is there, and we just have to find out through careful study and time how impactful these medications will be,\" said Dr. Joshua Gordon, director of the National Institute of Mental Health.\n\nMany questions remain about the specific conditions needed to achieve effective use of this treatment, and the FDA advisers could choose to endorse it under a wide range of stipulations or not at all, he said.\n\nStill, even the most supportive experts caution about the limitations of the treatment.\n\n\"I hope that the drug gets approved but in a way where it can be made available and monitored in a responsible manner,\" said Dr. Rachel Yehuda, director of the Center for Psychedelic Psychotherapy and Trauma Research at Mount Sinai's Icahn School of Medicine, who is not a member of the FDA advisory committee. \"My fear would be that we stop being curious, we stop asking the right questions, we stop trying to figure out mechanisms of action, we stop trying to perfect and scale like we do with any other treatment.\"\n\nIt's critical to protect vulnerable populations who may benefit from this treatment, experts say.\n\n\"There's a recognition that psychedelics are probably uniquely susceptible to the blurring of the boundaries between strictly applied medical treatments that are provided by experienced clinicians under very well-monitored circumstances versus recreational use, so there's a great interest in trying to get this as right as possible,\" said Dr. Jon Alpert, chair of the American Psychiatric Association's research council and chair of the department of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine.\n\n\"The last thing you want is for a promising treatment for a devastating condition to go off the rails in an unbounded, unmonitored kind of use.\"\n\nAlso, the trials so far have excluded people who may be most vulnerable to substantial side effects of MDMA, such as adolescents and those with coinciding conditions such as schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, and it's important to continue gathering data to understand how the treatment works in these populations, he said.\n\n\"Any FDA approval of MDMA must be accompanied by rigorous regulations, strict prescribing and dispensing controls, comprehensive patient education, and ongoing monitoring and surveillance systems,\" the American Psychiatric Association wrote in a letter to FDA's advisory committee.\n\nIn addition to potentially setting a precedent in mental health treatment, the particular treatment program that Lykos has studied is \"labor-intensive,\" she said. It requires a significant amount of investment - both logistically and emotionally - from participants and providers, which is challenged by the shortage of mental health professionals in the US.\n\n\"We never had a situation where something that the government had deemed harmful gets a 180 and becomes an approved treatment for a condition,\" Yehuda said. \"Then, the question is, 'Are we going to be able to use the moment in a way that really furthers the mental health of our population?'\"\n\nCNN's Brenda Goodman contributed to this report.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Several veterans groups have already submitted public comments urging the FDA to approve MDMA-AT. About 7% of veterans will experience PTSD during their lifetime (compared with 6% of the general population), but for some service members this proportion is reportedly as high as 29%. Indeed, the US Department of Veterans Affairs has thrown its weight behind the promise of psychedelics with a request for proposals to study the compounds -- including MDMA -- in treating PTSD.\n\nCritics and supporters will converge on the FDA expert panel, which will evaluate the scientific evidence. If approved, MDMA-AT would be the first psychedelic-based therapeutic cleared by the FDA for any condition in the US and the first PTSD medication to receive approval in 24 years.\n\nPatented by Merck in 1914, MDMA was never formally studied but was used by psychiatrists and therapists over the years. It became a popular street drug in the 1980s, known as \"ecstasy\" or \"molly.\"\n\nDoblin formed the nonprofit MAPS in 1986 in the wake of a failed legal challenge to stop the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) from criminalizing MDMA, which the agency did in 1985 by regulating it as a schedule 1 controlled substance with no accepted medical use. Multiple attempts during the late 1980s to get the FDA to approve formal clinical studies were rejected, but the logjam at the agency began to break in the early 1990s.\n\nMAPS embarked on its clinical studies and became a public benefit company in 2014. In 2017, the FDA designated MDMA-AT as a breakthrough therapy, putting it on a fast track for approval.\n\nIn 2021, investigators presented data from the company's first clinical trial of MDMA-AT, MAPP1, at the European Psychiatric Association congress and published the research in Nature Medicine. The study evaluated 90 patients with PTSD randomly assigned to receive MDMA 80 mg or 120 mg or placebo, followed by three integrative psychotherapy sessions lasting a total of 8 hours.\n\nPatients could receive a supplemental dose of MDMA after the first dose. The company reported that 82% of patients reported a significant improvement, with more than half saying they no longer had PTSD. Eleven patients (12%) experienced relapse within 12 months.\n\nA few years later, findings from the second trial, MAPP2, were published in Nature Medicine, with similar results in 104 patients.\n\nDespite widespread and mostly positive media coverage, the research has had its critics. Chief among them has been the Boston-based independent nonprofit Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER).\n\nICER first delved into the trials last fall, David Rind, MD, chief medical officer, told Medscape Medical News. Several experts reported concerns about safety to the organization and claimed that some abuse had occurred during the trials.\n\nWhen ICER published its initial report in March, a lack of blinding in the studies was cited as a main issue. MAPP2 researchers reported that 49 of 52 (94%) of people in the MDMA treatment arm \"were certain or thought that they received MDMA.\"\n\n\"Lots of people, including clinical experts, separate from any of the concerned citizens who might have talked to us on this report, raised concerns about bias,\" Rind said. And 40% of the trial participants had prior exposure to MDMA, he added.\n\nICER investigators \"heard from multiple experts about the very strong prior beliefs of those involved in the trials (as investigators, therapists and patients) about the benefits of MDMA-AT,\" the report claimed.\n\nLykos waved away bias charges, noting in its response to ICER that it \"has consistently sought and received feedback from the FDA throughout the development program.\"\n\nBut others also took issue.\n\n\"If you wanted to design the worst possible study in the world, you couldn't do better,\" Allen Frances, MD, professor emeritus of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Duke University, Durham, North Carolina, told Medscape Medical News. \"This is something that should never be considered for FDA approval on the basis of the very limited data available.\"\n\nThe lack of blinding and \"a hot-house therapy environment\" are two critical issues, Frances noted.\n\n\"There's no research environment more exotic than this study with two therapists spending 8 hours with a single patient,\" he said. Even though no serious adverse events were reported in the studies, \"that doesn't mean that there won't be problems in the real world,\" said Frances.\n\nNe\u015fe Devenot, a senior lecturer at Johns Hopkins University's writing program who had been affiliated with MAPS in the mid-2000s, has been vocal about her concerns.\n\nLykos has \"essentially misrepresented what they're doing to the FDA,\" Devenot told Medscape Medical News.\n\nIn comments that will be submitted to the FDA expert panel on June 4 that Devenot shared with Medscape Medical News, she wrote that MAPS is \"a therapy cult\" that indoctrinates therapists and participants into \"an ideological system of 'true beliefs.'\"\n\nIn this model, therapists and clients form unusually close relationships, wrote Devenot, also a research affiliate with the Petrie-Flom Center's Project on Psychedelics Law and Regulation (POPLAR) at Harvard Law School. She said several episodes of alleged abuse that occurred during trials reflect this therapy model.\n\n\"There are several well-documented cases of high-profile therapists who have exploited the increased vulnerability of patients in MDMA therapy, including incidents of entrapment, sexual abuse, and coercive control,\" wrote Devenot and more than 70 researchers, clinicians, and others in a citizen's petition filed with the FDA in late April, calling on the agency to convene an advisory panel to look at the Lykos trials and to have an extended open public hearing. The petition alleged the company committed data fraud and withheld information about adverse events.\n\nUnethical conduct was also cited by the ICER report authors who noted that \"sexual boundaries were severely crossed with at least one patient in a phase 2 trial.\"\n\nA 2023 paper in the Canadian Journal of Bioethics described that case, which involved Meaghan Buisson and has since been widely covered in the media. Buisson co-authored a JAMA Psychiatry viewpoint with Devenot that highlighted some other alleged lapses in the MAPS/Lykos trials, and she also signed the citizen's petition.\n\nDevenot alleges other ethical violations in her comments to the FDA, including that MAPS board chair Vicky Dulai \"was part of a community of MAPS associates\" that exploited \"psychedelics' known ability to increase vulnerability to 'love bombing' and other forms of psychological manipulation\" to swindle money from wealthy patients.\n\nThe citizen's petition and ICER investigators also cited a number of reports of severe harms that were not disclosed in the published studies.\n\nIn a statement to Medscape Medical News, Lykos denied that anything had gone unreported. \"All adverse events and serious adverse events were reported to the FDA,\" officials wrote in the statement.\n\nIn addition, in public comments on the ICER report, about 70 of the 109 clinical investigators, clinicians, supervisors, trainers and medical monitors who worked on the MAPS/Lykos studies defended their work.\n\n\"One hundred and nine therapists and principal/co-investigators contributed to the Phase 3 trials of MDMA-AP [MDMA-assisted psychotherapy] for PTSD. To our knowledge, none of them were consulted before the preliminary report was issued,\" the investigators wrote in their response. \"However, this group is in the strongest position to describe the studies and address accusations related to inappropriate study design and conduct. In the absence of such input, a number of assertions in the ICER report represent hearsay and should be weighted accordingly.\"\n\nParticipants were \"invited to access and process traumatic memories,\" which meant that \"short-term destabilization\" could be expected, they added. They also noted that therapists were guided by the \"MAPS Code of Ethics,\" which prescribes that practitioners should \"respect the inner healing intelligence of participants to guide their experience.\"\n\nICER said that Lykos never offered direct access to its researchers and that there were reports that patients feared being shunned or denied MDMA in the future if they reported bad outcomes. \"This is a particular problem in people receiving MDMA as it makes them particularly suggestible and susceptible to context,\" authors of the ICER report wrote.\n\nFrances and Devenot said that FDA approval could open the door to more unprescribed and unsupervised use of MDMA.\n\nDevenot believes that MDMA has potential but said that given that Doblin has been touting MDMA for years, \"a lot of people have really taken him at his word and are doing this outside of a formal medical context.\" FDA approval would lead people to \"think that it's useful and safe\" and would probably increase illegitimate use, she said.\n\nEven if the FDA restricts use of the Lykos therapy to the trial conditions -- as the American Psychiatric Association has urged the agency to do -- the risk for misuse remains, said Frances.\n\nIf you're someone who does not meet eligibility requirements or can't afford the drug, \"you're likely to buy the drug on the street and take it yourself,\" said Frances.\n\nThe company has not yet determined a price for the treatment, a Lykos spokesperson told Medscape Medical News, but has worked with the American Medical Association to establish a code for the combination therapy, in part to lay the groundwork for insurance coverage.\n\nRind wants MDMA-AT to get a thorough vetting by the FDA and its advisers. \"I'm hoping that the FDA looks carefully at the evidence in ways that we certainly were unable to do,\" he said.\n\nThe FDA is due to make a decision on the MDMA-AT's fate by August 11. If the drug is approved, the DEA would still have to reschedule the drug so that physicians can prescribe it.\n\nThe agency is under no legal obligation to change MDMA's status unless it is directed to do so by the US Department of Health and Human Services. The DEA would have 90 days to act on the request, according to an analysis from the Harvard Law School's Petrie-Flom Center. A similar path was followed for the cannabis-based pharmaceutical Epidiolex.\n\nLykos said it would make its therapy available in 2025 if it is approved and the DEA reschedules MDMA.", "source":

Research indicates its potential benefits in alleviating symptoms of depression, anxiety, PTSD, addiction and eating disorders.\n\nA panel of advisers to the U.S. health regulator on Tuesday voted against a therapy based on the party drug MDMA for patients with post-traumatic stress disorder, in a major setback to the nascent field of psychedelic treatments.\n\nThe panel voted 10-to-1 against the therapy, saying the benefits did not outweigh its risks, while nine of the 11 members said the available data did not show the effectiveness of the drug in PTSD patients. MDMA, commonly known as ecstasy or molly, has been long seen as a potential therapy for mental health disorders, despite being known for its illicit use.\n\nThe treatment, a capsule form of MDMA made by public-benefit corporation Lykos Therapeutics, was meant to be administered in combination with talk therapy sessions by a licensed mental health provider.\n\nOver 190 patients, who received doses of MDMA in addition to therapy, showed a significant reduction in PTSD scores compared to placebo. The FDA's staff reviewers on Friday raised concerns that patients in the trials were aware of whether they were given MDMA or a placebo due to its psychedelic effects, preventing an objective view of how well the drug worked.\n\nThe FDA, during the panel meeting, said there was a \"striking lack\" of documentation of abuse-related adverse events, which may limit the agency's ability to explain the effects of MDMA or determine its abuse liability.\n\nScrutiny into Lykos' drug has increased in recent months after an influential nonprofit, the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER), said there was \"insufficient\" evidence for the benefits of MDMA-based therapy. In a letter dated Monday, the American Psychological Association echoed those comments, saying its panel of experts could not determine the balance of benefits and potential harms.\n\nPTSD affects 13 million Americans and is especially common among war veterans. There is a large unmet need for new treatments for the disorder as existing drugs do not work on all patients.\n\nThe FDA's staff on Friday proposed restrictions around Lykos' drug and a need to monitor its usage in briefing documents. The staff also flagged a rise in blood pressure and pulse in the trials, and in cases of liver toxicity.", "source": {"uri": "usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "USA Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-traumatic_stress_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Post-traumatic stress disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MDMA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "MDMA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Food and Drug Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mental disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychedelic_therapy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Psychedelic therapy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depression_(mood)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Depression (mood)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eating disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreational_drug_use", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Recreational drug use"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychedelic_drug", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Psychedelic drug"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Addiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anxiety"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsule_(pharmacy)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Capsule (pharmacy)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Placebo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychotherapy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Psychotherapy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mental health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatotoxicity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hepatotoxicity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Psychological_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American Psychological Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_pressure", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Blood pressure"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Drugs_and_Medications", "label": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Drugs and Medications", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Disorders", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Teen_Health/Drugs_and_Alcohol", "label": "dmoz/Health/Teen Health/Drugs and Alcohol", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Pharmacology", "label": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Pharmacology", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2024/06/05/USAT/73978830007-20240521-t-134802-z-735222073-rc-20-v-7-az-6-mv-3-rtrmadp-3-healthusaguardanthealth.JPG?auto=webp&crop=6600,3714,x0,y343&format=pjpg&width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9619876", "eventUri": "eng-9619876", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

The FDA will make the final decision, likely in August.\n\nAntidepressants are now the only FDA-approved drugs for post-traumatic stress disorder, which is closely linked to depression, anxiety and suicidal thinking and is more prevalent among women and veterans.\n\nIf approved, MDMA would be reclassified as a prescription medicine and made available to specially certified doctors and therapists. Currently, the drug is in the same ultra-restrictive category as heroin and other substances the federal government deems prone to abuse and devoid of any medical use.\n\nMDMA, also known as ecstasy or molly, is the first in a series of psychedelics that are expected to be reviewed by the FDA in coming years. It's part of a resurgence of research into the potential of psychedelics for hard-to-treat conditions like depression, addiction and anxiety. MDMA's main effect is triggering feelings of intimacy, connection and euphoria.\n\nCompanies are studying MDMA, psilocybin, LSD and other mind-expanding drugs for numerous mental health problems.\n\nUntil recently, psychedelic research was mainly funded by a handful of nonprofit advocacy groups, including Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies, or MAPS. The company seeking approval for MDMA, Lykos Therapeutics, is essentially a corporate spinoff of MAPS, which conducted all the studies submitted for FDA review.\n\nIn two studies, patients received MDMA as part of an intensive, four-month course of talk therapy lasting more than a dozen sessions, only three of which involved taking the drug. The drug is thought to help patients come to terms with their trauma and let go of disturbing thoughts and memories.\n\nThe approach was studied in nearly 195 adults with moderate-to-severe PTSD who were randomly assigned to undergo the therapy with MDMA or with a dummy pill. Following treatment, patients who received MDMA had significantly lower PTSD scores and were more likely to be in remission.\n\nBut FDA reviewers noted that the vast majority of patients correctly guessed whether they had received MDMA or a dummy pill, making it \"nearly impossible\" to maintain the socalled \"blinded\" objectivity considered essential for high-quality drug research. The agency also questioned how long the drug's benefits might last. The studies tracked some patients for up to two years, but reviewers noted that about a quarter of patients quickly dropped out of the follow-up study, limiting the usefulness of the results.\n\nThe most common side effects of MDMA included headache, nausea, muscle tightness and decreased appetite. More serious issues included heart palpitations and elevated blood pressure, which FDA reviewers said had the \"potential to trigger\" life-threatening heart problems.\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up!

I'm really encouraged by the results to date,\" said one of the experts, Paul Holtzheimer of the National Center for PTSD.\n\n\"But I feel that both from an efficacy and a safety standpoint, it is still premature.\"\n\nThe vote by the panel of experts is non-binding, but the FDA rarely goes against their recommendations.\n\nMDMA -- methylenedioxymethamphetamine -- is a schedule 1 drug under the Controlled Substances Act, and approving it for medical use would have represented a major shift.\n\nIn a briefing document put together ahead of the meeting, FDA staff raised concerns that although the studies were nominally \"double-blinded\" -- meaning neither those being tested nor their health care workers knew who received the treatment versus the placebo -- most people were able to accurately guess what they received.\n\nThis \"functional unblinding,\" they argued, introduces bias and uncertainty into study outcomes.\n\nFDA staff also criticized Lykos for not gathering sufficient side effect data, including whether participants experienced \"euphoria\" or \"elated mood,\" which, they argued, \"would be informative for an assessment of abuse potential or characterization of anticipated effects of the drug.\"\n\nReports from recreational use suggest MDMA has harmful impacts on heart and liver health -- but the company did not gather enough data in these areas, the FDA said.\n\nThen there were troubling allegations of research impropriety linked to the trials that surfaced in a draft report by the nonprofit Institute for Clinical and Economic Review.\n\nThese include claims that the trials \"pulled heavily from the existing community of those interested and involved in the use of psychedelics for possible psychological benefits.\"\n\nSome patients told the nonprofit they were allegedly prevented from entering the long follow-up study \"and felt this was done to keep these negative outcomes out of the data set.\"\n\n\"We certainly take those allegations very seriously and are quite concerned by them,\" the FDA's Tiffany Farchione said during the meeting, adding a probe was ongoing.\n\nLykos has said a final decision from the FDA on authorization should come by mid-August.\n\nIf the agency were to authorize the treatment over the advisory panel's objections, there could be certain strict stipulations attached -- for example, that

The therapy in question involved administering MDMA capsules to patients undergoing psychotherapy sessions with a licensed professional.\n\nDespite some early promise, the FDA's panel voted 10-1 against approval, raising concerns about the drug's safety and effectiveness. Specifically, they questioned whether the benefits outweighed the risks. During the Tuesday meeting, the FDA said there was a \"striking lack\" of documentation of abuse-related adverse events, which would limit the agency's ability to explain the effects of MDMA or determine its abuse liability, reported Reuters.\n\nMelissa Barone, another panelist and psychologist with the VA Maryland Health Care System agreed. \"It seems like there are so many problems with the data,\" she said per NPR. \"Each one alone might be okay, but when you pile them up on top of each other...\"\n\nThere are only two FDA-approved treatments for PTSD and MDMA would be the first to come on the market in decades. Tuesday's decision comes at a time when there is growing interest in the use of psychedelic drugs to treat various mental health conditions, including depression and anxiety.\n\nRepresentatives of Lykos emphasized the positive findings in clinical data collected in two nearly identical randomized controlled trials. In one, over 190 patients, who received doses of MDMA in addition to therapy, showed a significant reduction in PTSD symptoms compared to placebo.\n\n\"In totality, these results support [that] MDMA in combination with psychological intervention provides significant and meaningful reductions in PTSD symptoms and functional impairment in patients with PTSD,\" said Berra Yazar-Klosinski, chief scientific officer for Lykos.\n\nThe decision by the FDA's panel is a setback for proponents of psychedelic medicine, but it does not necessarily mean the end of research into MDMA-assisted therapy for PTSD.

I'm really encouraged by the results to date,\" said one of the experts, Paul Holtzheimer of the National Center for PTSD.\n\n\"But I feel that both from an efficacy and a safety standpoint, it is still premature.\"\n\nThe vote by the panel of experts is non-binding, but the FDA rarely goes against their recommendations.\n\n- Not enough side effect data -\n\nMDMA -- methylenedioxymethamphetamine -- is a Schedule 1 drug under the Controlled Substances Act, and approving it for medical use would have represented a major shift.\n\nIn a briefing document put together ahead of the meeting, FDA staff raised concerns that although the studies were nominally \"double-blinded\" -- meaning neither those being tested nor their health care workers knew who received the treatment versus the placebo -- most people were able to accurately guess what they received.\n\nThis \"functional unblinding,\" they argued, introduces bias and uncertainty into study outcomes.\n\nFDA staff also criticized Lykos for not gathering sufficient side effect data, including whether participants experienced \"euphoria\" or \"elated mood,\" which, they argued, \"would be informative for an assessment of abuse potential or characterization of anticipated effects of the drug.\"\n\nReports from recreational use suggest MDMA has harmful impacts on heart and liver health -- but the company did not gather enough data in these areas, the FDA said.\n\n- Research misconduct allegations -\n\nThen there were troubling allegations of research impropriety linked to the trials that surfaced in a draft report by the nonprofit Institute for Clinical and Economic Review.\n\nThese include claims that the trials \"pulled heavily from the existing community of those interested and involved in the use of psychedelics for possible psychological benefits.\"\n\nSome patients told the nonprofit they were allegedly prevented from entering the long term-follow up study \"and felt this was done to keep these negative outcomes out of the data set.\"\n\n\"We certainly take those allegations very seriously and are quite concerned by them,\" the FDA's Tiffany Farchione said during the meeting, adding a probe was ongoing.\n\nLykos has said a final decision from the FDA on authorization should come by mid-August.\n\nIf the agency were to authorize the treatment over the advisory panel's objections, there could be certain strict stipulations attached -- for example, that the drug only be dispensed in health care settings, with subjects carefully monitored and enrolled in a registry to document side effects.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Among recreational users, MDMA is commonly known as molly or Ecstasy.\n\nIn 1985, as the drug became a staple at dance clubs and raves, the Drug Enforcement Administration classified MDMA as a Schedule I substance, a drug defined as having no accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-traumatic_stress_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Post-traumatic stress disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MDMA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "MDMA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Food and Drug Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoactive_drug", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Psychoactive drug"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_synthesis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chemical synthesis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychotherapy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Psychotherapy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Suicide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychedelic_drug", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Psychedelic drug"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Clinical trial"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LSD", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LSD"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empathogen\u2013entactogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Empathogen\u2013entactogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Shulgin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Shulgin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psilocybin", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Psilocybin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlled_Substances_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Controlled Substances Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-awareness", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Self-awareness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rave", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_Enforcement_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drug Enforcement Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empathy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Empathy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mental disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallucination", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hallucination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_dance_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electronic dance music"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Drugs", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Drugs", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Drugs_and_Medications", "label": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Drugs and Medications", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Teen_Health/Drugs_and_Alcohol", "label": "dmoz/Health/Teen Health/Drugs and Alcohol", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Pharmacology", "label": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Pharmacology", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Home_Tests", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Home Tests", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 50}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/05/31/science/00MDMA-EXPLAINER/00MDMA-EXPLAINER-videoSixteenByNine3000.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9619876", "eventUri": "eng-9619876", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

The novel treatment has the potential to transform a field with significant need, but the committee had concerns about the integrity of the particular trials up for review.\n\nAfter hearing presentations from the US Food and Drug Administration, treatment sponsor Lykos Therapeutics and members of the public, the independent committee voted on recommendations to be made to the FDA. Two of 11 committee members said that they considered the treatment effective, while nine said that it was not. Only one committee member said that the benefits of the treatment outweigh the risks as presented, while 10 voted that they did not.\n\nThis was the first time FDA advisers have considered a psychedelic drug for medical use. MDMA is known as an entactogen, a class of psychoactive drugs that produce experiences of emotional communion, relatedness and emotional openness. The drug is currently classified as a schedule I drug under the Controlled Substances Act, and changing this status would be a marked shift.\n\nThe FDA has final say on whether the treatment is formally approved. The agency often follows recommendations from its independent advisory committees but does not have to do so.\n\nAbout 5% of adults in the United States - about 13 million people - experience PTSD in any given year, according estimates from the National Center for PTSD. But current treatment options - including antidepressants and some specialized forms of cognitive behavioral therapy - are limited in their scope and effectiveness, with few alternatives available to help those don't respond well to them.\n\nLykos Therapeutics presented positive data from two late-stage clinical trials that used MDMA in combination with therapy to treat PTSD. Many of the committee members applauded the exploration of this line of treatment and lauded the potential it holds, but several shortcomings - notably regarding bias in efficacy data and missing information about safety - raised critical doubts.\n\nAbout 200 people participated in the Lykos trials, with a treatment program that involved three eight-hour sessions where participants took MDMA in the presence of two therapists. The MDMA sessions were spaced about a month apart, along with additional therapy sessions.\n\n\"Participants appear to experience rapid, clinically meaningful, durable improvement in their PTSD symptoms,\" the FDA wrote in a briefing document about the studies.\n\nBut the agency also noted that \"several factors make these data challenging to interpret and complicate the benefit-risk assessment for this application,\" posing key questions for the members of the Psychopharmacologic Drugs Advisory Committee to consider.\n\nThe studies were designed to be double-blind, meaning neither the participants nor the researchers knew who received the MDMA treatment and who didn't. This type of study is considered the gold standard because it helps reduce bias in results by minimizing the effects of external factors. But MDMA's hallucinogenic effects have \"profound alterations\" on a person's state of being, and the vast majority of participants knew which group they were in simply by the nature of their experience.\n\nThe Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, a nonprofit that conducts independent reviews of treatments, tests and procedures, also cited \"substantial concerns about the validity of the results\" of the Lykos trials in a report published in March. Those concerns centered around bias, both from the unblinding of the trial and from other influences on patient perspectives.\n\nIn addition to blurry data on efficacy, there were concerns about safety data, the FDA said.\n\nIt is known to have potential for abuse, but the FDA cautions that the research did not appropriately assess this as an adverse event in the context of the treatment program.\n\nReports from illicit use of MDMA suggest that it may pose risks to both heart and liver health. The phase III clinical trials showed \"significant increases in both blood pressure and pulse\" among participants, the FDA said, but certain related assessments were incomplete. And liver health was assessed only in small groups from earlier phases of the clinical trials.\n\nThe questions are all familiar to Lykos, and the company has had conversations with the FDA throughout its research, CEO Amy Emerson said. The advisory committee meeting is the \"next big milestone\" in the process and an opportunity to gather even more information, she said.\n\n\"There's just such an urgent patient need for new treatment options, and we really use that as our guiding light as we develop MDMA-assisted therapy,\" she said. \"All along, we've been really committed to safety, and that will always be top of mind.\"\n\nThere is growing interest and support to explore the use of psychedelics as therapeutics. Along with MDMA, drugs like ketamine and psilocybin mushrooms are being studied in clinical trials to treat a variety of mental health disorders.\n\n\"Depression, PTSD, eating disorders - they're all different. You can't just lump these together and say, 'Psychedelics are good for this,'\" Emerson said. \"You need to study it, you need to look at the safety and efficacy profiles of each, and we have to be careful to not treat these things as panaceas or like a magic bullet.\"\n\nThe Lykos treatment is the first to reach this point in the process, and the way the FDA and its advisory board proceed could set key precedents.\n\n\"It's an early but exciting moment. The promise is there, the potential is there, and we just have to find out through careful study and time how impactful these medications will be,\" said Dr. Joshua Gordon, director of the National Institute of Mental Health.\n\nMany questions remain about the specific conditions needed to achieve effective use of this treatment, and even the most supportive experts caution about the limitations of the treatment and recommend additional research.\n\n\"I hope that the drug gets approved but in a way where it can be made available and monitored in a responsible manner,\" said Dr. Rachel Yehuda, director of the Center for Psychedelic Psychotherapy and Trauma Research at Mount Sinai's Icahn School of Medicine, who is not a member of the FDA advisory committee. \"My fear would be that we stop being curious, we stop asking the right questions, we stop trying to figure out mechanisms of action, we stop trying to perfect and scale like we do with any other treatment.\"\n\nIt's critical to protect vulnerable populations who may benefit from this treatment, experts say.\n\n\"There's a recognition that psychedelics are probably uniquely susceptible to the blurring of the boundaries between strictly applied medical treatments that are provided by experienced clinicians under very well-monitored circumstances versus recreational use, so there's a great interest in trying to get this as right as possible,\" said Dr. Jon Alpert, chair of the American Psychiatric Association's research council and chair of the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine.\n\n\"The last thing you want is for a promising treatment for a devastating condition to go off the rails in an unbounded, unmonitored kind of use.\"\n\nAlso, the trials have excluded people who may be most vulnerable to substantial side effects of MDMA, such as adolescents and those with coinciding conditions such as schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, and it's important to continue gathering data to understand how the treatment works in these populations, he said.\n\n\"Any FDA approval of MDMA must be accompanied by rigorous regulations, strict prescribing and dispensing controls, comprehensive patient education, and ongoing monitoring and surveillance systems,\" the American Psychiatric Association wrote in a letter to the FDA's advisory committee.\n\nIn addition to potentially setting a precedent in mental health treatment, the particular treatment program that Lykos has studied is \"labor-intensive,\" Yehuda said. It requires a significant amount of investment - both logistically and emotionally - from participants and providers, which is challenged by the shortage of mental health professionals in the US.\n\n\"We never had a situation where something that the government had deemed harmful gets a 180 and becomes an approved treatment for a condition,\" she said. \"Then, the question is, 'Are we going to be able to use the moment in a way that really furthers the mental health of our population?'\"\n\nCNN's Brenda Goodman contributed to this report.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

The one expert who voted \"yes\" said afterward that his confidence in that vote was low.\n\nThe votes come after a full-day meeting in which the independent expert advisors heard detailed reviews of clinical trial data from the company that proposed the therapy -- Lykos, formerly MAPS -- as well as internal FDA reviews.\n\nThe top-line results from two clinical trials had impressively positive results, with MDMA therapy in combination with psychotherapy showing statistically significant, clinically meaningful improvements for PTSD symptoms. But, as the discussion dove deeper into the data, the experts identified a damningly large number of trial flaws, including missing data and bias, that threw the validity of those positive results into serious question.\n\nFor one thing, the experts, along with the FDA, found that the double-blind trials were essentially unblinded -- both therapists and participants knew whether participants received MDMA, given the potent effects of the drug. This introduces significant bias. Therapists may expect to see bigger effects if they know MDMA was given or lesser effects if they know a participant received a placebo. Further, about 40 percent of trial participants had prior MDMA exposure, making them more likely to be able to identify and anticipate the effects of the treatment. Experts also worried that it would likely have introduced significant selection bias. That is, those who had used MDMA in the past and had negative or neutral experiences with it would be less likely to enroll in such a trial.\n\nThe FDA and the experts also called out a plethora of missing data. Lykos did not collect laboratory data on the biological effects of MDMA in the participants. In response to this point, the FDA stunningly admitted in the meeting that it had overlooked the fact that the company didn't plan on collecting that data while it was designing the trial. Lykos also did not collect enough data on the known cardiovascular effects of MDMA, which could pose significant risks to patients with high blood pressure and heart arrhythmias. Last, the trial did not collect data on the positive effects of MDMA, such as the feeling of \"euphoria,\" which could indicate abuse potential. This was something the FDA had specifically advised Lykos to collect prior to conducting the trials.\n\nIn a nearly two-hour public comment hearing in the afternoon, the experts heard from various participants, experts, and advocates. Some people who said they participated in the trials relayed their positive experiences, while others said the trial was devastating for them. A few researchers who offered public comment noted that the psychotherapy technique used along with MDMA is not evidence-based. They also claimed that the touch-based psychotherapy technique that Lykos used for the trial ties to dubious cult-like new-age psychospiritual therapy, which, among other things, intends to bring about a \"global spiritualized society\" and suggests suicidal ideation stems from suffering that occurred in the birth canal. This therapy has the potential to allow for abuse and exploitation, the researchers claimed in their public comment. At least one participant in the trial has accused a therapist involved with the trial of sexual assault during the trial's therapy sessions.\n\n\"Unfortunately, there potentially has been some misconduct ... that has really polluted or corrupted our ability to interpret the data,\" advisor and psychiatry expert Walter Dunn, of the University of California Los Angeles, said at the end of the meeting.\n\nThe FDA does not regulate psychotherapy, and the advisory committee members had several questions about how to standardize a therapy technique that is not yet based on evidence. One advisor called that aspect of the trial a \"black box.\"\n\nAdvisor and psychologist Melissa Decker Barone, of the VA Maryland Health Care System, summarized the general feeling of the committee in the discussion period. \"I think that there are a number of things that make me question how robust the results are, \" she said. \"It sounds like MDMA and this treatment have really impacted a number of people in positive ways, but it seems like there are so many problems with the data. Each one alone might be kind of OK, but when you pile them up on top of each other ... there's just a lot of questions still.\"\n\nThe FDA will now make its own decision on whether to approve MDMA for PTSD therapy. Although it often follows the advice of its advisory committees, it is not obligated to do so. The FDA said it was also still conducting its own investigation into some of the accusations of possible data manipulation during the trials. A representative for the FDA said the agency would not make a determination on MDMA until that investigation is complete.", "source": {"uri": "arstechnica.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Ars Technica"}, "authors": [{"uri": "beth_mole@arstechnica.com", "name": "Beth Mole", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-traumatic_stress_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Post-traumatic stress disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MDMA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "MDMA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Food and Drug Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blinded_experiment", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Blinded experiment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychotherapy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Psychotherapy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bias"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Clinical trial"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Age", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Age"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Statistical significance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cult", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cult"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrhythmia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arrhythmia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_bias", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Selection bias"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hypertension"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euphoria", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Euphoria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Placebo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Substance abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Circulatory system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicidal_ideation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Suicidal ideation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Evidence-based medicine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Los_Angeles", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of California, Los Angeles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vagina", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vagina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Maryland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Maryland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Biotechnology_and_Pharmaceuticals", "label": "dmoz/Business/Biotechnology and Pharmaceuticals", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Drugs_and_Medications", "label": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Drugs and Medications", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Biotechnology_and_Pharmaceuticals/Contract_Research_Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Biotechnology and Pharmaceuticals/Contract Research Organizations", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Data_Centers", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Data Centers", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 45}], "image": "https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-566464211-760x380.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9619876", "eventUri": "eng-9619876", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

commonly known as ecstasy or molly - has been touted as having therapeutic benefits for people suffering from some mental health disorders.\n\nBut advisers to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) voted 10-1 against the overall benefits of MDMA when used to treat PTSD.\n\nNine of the 11 said the available data did not show the effectiveness of the drug in PTSD patients.\n\nThe vote followed analysis of research by drugmaker Lykos Therapeutics, which advised that treatment be administered in combination with talk therapy sessions by a licensed mental health provider.\n\nOne of its trials found 71% from the treatment group no longer met PTSD criteria, compared to 48% from a group taking a placebo.\n\nBut panellists voiced numerous concerns with the data.\n\nIssues included that the treatment may not offer long-lasting benefits, concerns about the ways the studies were designed, and the potential risk for heart problems, injury and abuse.\n\n\"It seems like there are so many problems with the data,\" Dr Melissa Decker Barone, a psychologist with the Department of Veterans Affairs, told the Associated Press.\n\n\"Each one alone might be OK, but when you pile them on top of each other ... there's just a lot of questions I would have about how effective the treatment is.\"\n\nThe FDA is not required to follow the committee's votes, but the agency often follows the panel's feedback.\n\nA final decision is expected by 11 August.\n\nLast year, Australia's traditionally conservative medicines regulator approved the use of drugs - including MDMA - to assist therapy sessions.", "source": {"uri": "bbc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "BBC"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-traumatic_stress_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Post-traumatic stress disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MDMA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "MDMA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreational_drug_use", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Recreational drug use"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mental disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_and_control_groups", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Treatment and control groups"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Placebo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychotherapy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Psychotherapy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Food and Drug Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mental health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Veterans_Affairs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Veterans Affairs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychologist", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Psychologist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health", "label": "dmoz/Health", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Drugs_and_Medications", "label": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Drugs and Medications", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Disorders", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Teen_Health/Drugs_and_Alcohol", "label": "dmoz/Health/Teen Health/Drugs and Alcohol", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 69}], "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/32af/live/5efe7830-22cd-11ef-80aa-699d54c46324.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9619876", "eventUri": "eng-9619876", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-08-11", "textStart": 1631, "textEnd": 1640}], "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

Lykos has for years been testing MDMA -- also known as midomafetamine or ecstasy -- in clinical trials, with two late-stage studies showing it offered significant benefits to PTSD patients when given alongside certain psychological interventions.\n\nBut concerns about how Lykos conducted the trials, as well as the safety of MDMA, swayed the advisers, who voted 9-2 that the therapy doesn't appear effective for PTSD, and 10-1 that its risks outweigh its likely benefit.\n\n\"I'm not convinced at all that this drug is effective based on the data I saw,\" said Rajesh Narendran, a psychiatry professor at the University of Pittsburgh and the committee's chair, during the meeting.\n\nWhile the FDA isn't required to follow the guidance of its advisory committees, it typically does. The agency should make a decision on Lykos' application by Aug. 11.\n\nIf approved, MDMA would become the first psychedelic-assisted therapy available in the U.S. It would also mark the first time in more than two decades the FDA cleared a new treatment for PTSD, a disease that, by some estimates, affects roughly 13 million people in the country in any given year.\n\nPanelists were keenly aware of this, and of the standard they might set as more investment flows into psychedelics and their application to mental health disorders. \"A lot of what we may do may become precedent,\" said Maryann Amirshahi, a panelist and a professor of emergency medicine at Georgetown University. \"So I think we need to proceed cautiously.\"\n\nPTSD is currently treated with so-called SSRI medications. While these drugs can address the depression and anxiety often experienced by patients, their full effects usually aren't felt for several months and, even then, research indicates that response rates rarely exceed 60%.\n\n\"So many people with PTSD are really suffering. And that unmet need has enormous consequences,\" said Kelly O'Donnell, director of clinical training at the NYU Langone Center for Psychedelic Medicine, during a presentation Lykos gave as part of Tuesday's meeting.\n\nTogether, Lykos' two trials evaluated close to 200 people with moderate to severe PTSD. Both hit their main goals, which revolved around an 80-point scale where higher scores signal more severe symptoms. Participants underwent three treatment sessions over the course of 18 weeks and, by the end, those in the MDMA arm had a roughly 10-point greater reduction in their scores compared to the control group.\n\n\"It's been so rewarding to see how quickly and meaningfully patients improved,\" said O'Donnell, who worked with the physicians and therapists on the studies. She claims participants who received MDMA-assisted therapy appeared to \"visibly brighten\" over the treatment period, experiencing benefits like better sleep, reduced symptoms and improved self worth.\n\nSeveral people who participated in Lykos' studies spoke at Tuesday's meeting of the benefits they experienced from receiving MDMA therapy.\n\nDespite such testimony, approval now looks less likely after the panel's vote. Both the FDA and its advisers identified a lengthy list of issues with the ways Lykos collected and analyzed clinical data. Among them were concerns the trials didn't enroll a diverse enough group of participants or adequately characterize the therapy's addictive potential.\n\nFDA staff also questioned the overall strength of Lykos' results. Typically, the strongest support for a drug comes from placebo-controlled studies in which participants don't know what treatment they've been assigned. But compounds like MDMA alter mood and cognition, and can elicit unmistakeable psychedelic effects that make it near impossible to keep patients in the dark.\n\nIndeed, the vast majority of participants in Lykos' studies figured out their treatment arm before the study concluded. The fear, according to the FDA, is that this \"functional unblinding\" swayed trial results to be more positive than they actually were.\n\nAdditionally, all participants in the key studies received psychotherapy. Experts said they aren't sure how much that contributed to the results, or how Lykos and the FDA plan to standardize the psychotherapy protocol should the drug gain approval.\n\nFDA staff have been troubled, too, by the safety data Lykos submitted. They argue the company hasn't provided a clear enough picture of how its drug affects heart and liver function -- known health concerns tied to MDMA use.\n\nMore broadly, Lykos' case has been marred by ethics violations. In one of the company's earlier studies, a participant reported sexual misconduct by the psychiatrist and her unlicensed therapist husband who were administering treatment.\n\nThe prominent drug pricing watchdog ICER also recently claimed that it had heard some therapists in Lykos' studies had encouraged patients to report favorable outcomes but not report any \"substantial harms\" they experienced.\n\nTiffany Farchione, an official in the FDA's psychiatry drugs division, said the agency is taking these allegations \"very seriously\" and has been conducting \"inspections,\" but didn't provide many more details.", "source": {"uri": "biopharmadive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "BioPharma Dive"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jacob_bell@biopharmadive.com", "name": "Jacob Bell", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-traumatic_stress_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Post-traumatic stress disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MDMA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "MDMA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Food and Drug Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Clinical trial"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Pittsburgh", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of Pittsburgh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biotechnology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Biotechnology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychedelic_drug", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Psychedelic drug"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Psychology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medication", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Medication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selective_serotonin_reuptake_inhibitor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_and_control_groups", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Treatment and control groups"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgetown_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Georgetown University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_medicine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Emergency medicine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depression_(mood)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Depression (mood)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mental disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Psychiatry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anxiety"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blinded_experiment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Blinded experiment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatrist", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Psychiatrist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cognition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychotherapy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Psychotherapy"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health", "label": "dmoz/Health", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Drugs_and_Medications", "label": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Drugs and Medications", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Pharmacology", "label": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Pharmacology", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 69}], "image": "https://www.biopharmadive.com/imgproxy/RMuPCugk0O-1fAJgpRBTfXlDLE61fT8VfksjVhEzus4/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/bG9jYWw6Ly8vZGl2ZWltYWdlL0dldHR5SW1hZ2VzLTEyMjc3MTA0NzJfZXo2Yk1vRi5qcGc=.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9619876", "eventUri": "eng-9619876", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-08-11", "textStart": 1416, "textEnd": 1423}], "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

experts review MDMA as treatment for PTSD", "body": "A panel of US health experts convened by the Food and Drug Administration are meeting Tuesday to weigh the benefits and risks of using MDMA, commonly known as ecstasy, to treat post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\nPTSD, a debilitating mental health condition that develops after a person experiences or is threatened by traumatic events such as death, combat, or sexual assault, affects an estimated five percent of Americans in any given year.\n\nBut pharmaceutical treatment options are so far limited to two antidepressants that require three months of dosing to take effect, and response rates to the medications have been found to be uneven.\n\nCalifornia-based Lykos Therapeutics is basing their request for regulatory approval on two clinical studies, each of which enrolled around 100 people, to evaluate MDMA used together with other psychological interventions such as talk therapy, against a placebo with talk therapy.\n\nThese two studies, published in the prestigious journal Nature Medicine, indicated MDMA was indeed both safe and highly effective at treating PTSD.\n\nBut a briefing document put together by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) ahead of the meeting suggested its staff were not as convinced.\n\nIn particular, they were concerned that although the studies were nominally \"double-blinded\" -- meaning neither those being tested nor their health care workers knew who received the treatment versus the placebo -- most people were able to accurately guess what they received.\n\nThis \"functional unblinding,\" they argued, introduces bias and uncertainty into study outcomes.\n\nWhat's more, they criticized Lykos for not gathering sufficient side effect data, including whether participants experienced \"euphoria\" or \"elated mood,\" which, the FDA argued, \"would be informative for an assessment of abuse potential or characterization of anticipated effects of the drug.\"\n\nReports from recreational use suggest MDMA has harmful impacts on heart and liver health -- but the company did not gather enough data in these areas, the FDA said.\n\nMore from this section Authorities urge Pride month celebration attendees to be extra vigilant about security #TheMoment a fan became a caddie at the Canadian Open 99% of Wisconsin State Park Visitors Skip Park Full of Rare Treasures - Research misconduct allegations -\n\nThen there are troubling allegations of research impropriety linked to the trials that surfaced in a draft report by the nonprofit Institute for Clinical and Economic Review.\n\nThese include claims that the trials \"pulled heavily from the existing community of those interested and involved in the use of psychedelics for possible psychological benefits.\"\n\nSome patients told the nonprofit they were allegedly prevented from entering the long term-follow up study \"and felt this was done to keep these negative outcomes out of the data set.\"\n\n\"We certainly take those allegations very seriously and are quite concerned by them,\" the FDA's Tiffany Farchione said during the meeting, adding a probe was ongoing.\n\nMDMA -- methylenedioxymethamphetamine -- is a Schedule 1 drug under the Controlled Substances Act, and approving it for medical use would represent a major shift.\n\nBut even if the FDA advisers endorse MDMA, their vote is non-binding and the final decision on whether to approve the treatment rests with the agency.\n\nAnd final authorization may come with certain strict stipulations attached, for example that the drug only be dispensed in health care settings, with subjects carefully monitored and enrolled in a registry to document side effects.\n\nia-la/st", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com",

The FDA will soon weigh in", "body": "Lori Tipton is among the growing number of people who say that MDMA, also known as ecstasy, saved their lives.\n\nRaised in New Orleans by a mother with untreated bipolar disorder who later killed herself and two others, Tipton said she endured layers of trauma that eventually forced her to seek treatment for crippling anxiety and hypervigilance. For 10 years nothing helped, and she began to wonder if she was \"unfixable.\"\n\nThen she answered an ad for a clinical trial for MDMA-assisted therapy to treat post-traumatic stress disorder. Tipton said the results were immediate, and she is convinced the drug could help a lot of people. But even as regulators weigh approval of the first MDMA-based treatment, she's worried that it won't reach those who need it most.\n\n\"The main thing that I'm always concerned about is just accessibility,\" the 43-year-old nonprofit project manager said. \"I don't want to see this become just another expensive add-on therapy for people who can afford it when people are dying every day by their own hand because of PTSD.\"\n\nMDMA is part of a new wave of psychoactive drugs that show great potential for treating conditions such as severe depression and PTSD. Investors are piling into the nascent field, and a host of medications based on MDMA, LSD, psychedelic mushrooms, ketamine, the South American plant mixture ayahuasca, and the African plant ibogaine are now under development, and in some cases vying for approval by the Food and Drug Administration.\n\nProponents hope the efforts could yield the first major new therapies for mental illness since the introduction of modern antidepressants in the 1980s. But not all researchers are convinced that their benefits have been validated, or properly weighed against the risks. And they can be difficult to assess using traditional clinical trials.\n\nThe first MDMA-assisted assisted therapy appeared to be on track for FDA approval this August, but a recent report from an independent review committee challenged the integrity of the trial data from the drug's maker, Lykos Therapeutics, a startup founded by a psychedelic research and advocacy group. The FDA will convene a panel of independent investigators on June 4 to determine whether to recommend the drug's approval.\n\nProponents of the new therapies also worry that the FDA will impose treatment protocols, such as requiring multiple trained clinicians to monitor a patient for extended periods, that will render them far too expensive for most people.\n\nTipton's MDMA-assisted therapy included three eight-hour medication sessions overseen by two therapists, each followed by an overnight stay at the facility and an integration session the following day.\n\n\"It does seem that some of these molecules can be administered safely,\" said David Olson, director of the University of California-Davis Institute for Psychedelics and Neurotherapeutics. \"I think the question is can they be administered safely at the scale needed to really make major improvements in mental health care.\"\n\n...continued", "source": {"uri": "arcamax.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ArcaMax"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-traumatic_stress_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Post-traumatic stress disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MDMA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "MDMA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypervigilance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hypervigilance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bipolar disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Food and Drug Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clinical trial"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anxiety"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Orleans", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Orleans"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Orleans"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LSD", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "LSD"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medication", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Medication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibogaine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ibogaine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjuvant_therapy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Adjuvant therapy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayahuasca", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ayahuasca"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psilocybin_mushroom", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Psilocybin mushroom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antidepressant", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Antidepressant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketamine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ketamine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoactive_drug", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Psychoactive drug"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mental disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonprofit_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nonprofit organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "South America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major depressive disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_wave_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New wave music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Davis", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of California, Davis"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Drugs", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Drugs", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Drugs_and_Medications", "label": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Drugs and Medications", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Disorders", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Pharmacology", "label": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Pharmacology", "wgt": 20}], "image": "https://resources.arcamax.com/newspics/292/29201/2920167.gif", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9619876", "eventUri": "eng-9619876", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-04", "textStart": 2197, "textEnd": 2203}], "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

Still, its recommendation could hold great weight as the FDA decides for the first time whether the mind-altering compound - better known by its street name, ecstasy, and long categorized among the riskiest of controlled substances - can be legally used as a medical treatment in the United States.\n\nDuring the all-day meeting, committee members praised the promise of the drug but struggled with gaps in the research data, potential for abuse of MDMA and how the psychotherapy, which is not regulated by the FDA, would be incorporated into the drug's approval.\n\n\"The therapy itself is still, I would consider, experimental,\" said Paul Holtzheimer, deputy director for research at the National Center for PTSD, who voted against approval.\n\nThe sponsor of the MDMA treatment, Lykos Therapeutics, conducted two late-stage clinical trials showing that patients treated with the drug experienced a significant improvement in their PTSD symptoms relative to those who got a placebo. The data, however, is uncommonly messy. Participants in the clinical trials also received various forms of psychotherapy, whose role wasn't specifically measured in the results. The consciousness-distorting properties of MDMA also complicate the gold standard for clinical trials, which requires that participants not know whether they received a drug or a placebo.\n\n\"While we are disappointed in the vote, we are committed to continuing to collaborate with the FDA with their ongoing review,\" Amy Emerson, Lykos's CEO, said in a statement. She added: \"There is an urgent need for new, effective and accessible therapies to address this unmet need for those living with PTSD.\"\n\nAn approval would mark a watershed moment for advocates who believe psychedelic drugs best known for mind-bending trips or partying can successfully treat an array of mental health disorders. MDMA's potential has been championed by veterans and others who suffer from PTSD, a condition afflicting an estimated 13 million in the United States but for which there are few drugs approved for treatment.\n\nShould the drug fail to win approval, it would be a monumental setback for the field of psychedelic medicine and investors who have poured hundreds of millions of dollars into companies developing psychedelics to treat mental health conditions.\n\nAhead of Tuesday's advisory meeting, the FDA's own staff raised extensive questions about the potential skewing of pivotal late-stage trials because patients figured out whether they had actually received the drug. The agency also highlighted cardiovascular and substance abuse risks. On Tuesday, the committee voted 9-2 that the data doesn't show the drug is effective in treating PTSD, and 10-1 that the benefits don't outweigh the risks - even with the FDA's proposed plan to mitigate them.\n\nJason Pyle, an independent doctor who serves as an unpaid member of Lykos's board, cautioned against missing the larger picture. \"In any pharmaceutical there are risks and questions, which is why we need the regulatory framework,\" he said. \"In the face of a veteran suicide epidemic and a community mental health crisis, we have to confront this with compassion, clarity and bravery.\"\n\nAn FDA official, Tiffany R. Farchione, told the panel Tuesday that while the agency had asked Lykos to report impacts associated with abuse, the company did not note effects such as \"euphoria\" or \"elated mood.\" That will make it challenging for the FDA, if it approves the drug, to describe MDMA's effects for labeling or for treatment recommendations, said Farchione, director of the agency's psychiatry division.\n\nFarchione said the lack of data collection \"may have the greatest impact\" on the agency's decision.\n\nLykos's senior medical director, Alia Lilienstein, acknowledged Tuesday that the company didn't record euphoria and related effects but said it's prepared to study that data if MDMA-assisted therapy is approved. She also allowed that Lykos's application was complicated, adding, \"Patients deserve us to work hard to figure out how to move something complicated forward.\"\n\nThe federal government categorizes MDMA as a Schedule I controlled substance with no accepted medical use and a high risk of abuse, in the same class as heroin and LSD.\n\nLilienstein stressed that while MDMA has a \"moderately high\" abuse potential, it remains lower than drugs such as methamphetamine and produces no withdrawal symptoms.\n\nFarchione also raised concerns about the effectiveness of the psychotherapy itself - which the FDA does not regulate. She added that while the agency could not label MDMA for use on its own, \"we also don't have strong evidence therapy is necessary.\"\n\nCommittee members pressed Lykos officials on the company's manual for therapy and how therapists were evaluated. They also raised concerns about the case of a female trial patient who said that in 2015 she was sexually abused by a male therapist, whose wife was also a therapist, during sessions that crossed ethical boundaries.\n\n\"Let's try to not gloss over this misconduct - it was sexual misconduct,\" said Elizabeth Joniak-Grant, a University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill sociologist and panel member who serves as a patient representative.\n\nThat patient, Meaghan Buisson, testified via a surrogate on Tuesday, pointing to a publicly available video of her session, which shows the therapists pinning her down, cuddling and stroking her. In an earlier interview with The Post, Buisson criticized the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies, or MAPS - the nonprofit parent of Lykos - for failing to keep her safe, glossing over harms and calling the therapy employed in the trials as \"completely bunk.\"\n\n\"How much information does the world need to recognize that MAPS cannot be trusted with these substances?\" Buisson said.\n\nA nonprofit affiliated with the American Psychological Association said in a letter to the FDA on Monday that it determined there is \"insufficient evidence\" for the advisory panel to recommend MDMA-assisted therapy for PTSD, citing concerns that the results may have been biased by participants who knew whether they received the actual drug or a placebo. That echoed concerns from the influential nonprofit Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, which published a draft report this year voicing \"substantial concerns\" about the research supporting the drug's approval.\n\nCommittee members repeatedly grappled with allegations of clinical trial misconduct raised by public speakers and the ICER report, including claims that therapists discouraged patients from reporting adverse effects. The FDA's Farchione said the agency could not speak about \"what we are looking into\" but added officials are aware of the report and \"certainly take those allegations seriously.\"\n\nLykos officials said that rollout of the drug would be limited and that the FDA's proposed restrictions would include that the drug could be dispensed only in certain health-care settings - with a doctor available while the drug is administered, and at least two health-care providers to monitor a patient's physical and psychological state for at least eight hours.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [{"uri": "daniel_gilbert@washingtonpost.com", "name": "Daniel Gilbert", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "david_ovalle@washingtonpost.com", "name": "David Ovalle", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-traumatic_stress_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Post-traumatic stress disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MDMA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "MDMA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychotherapy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Psychotherapy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Food and Drug Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychedelic_drug", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Psychedelic drug"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Clinical trial"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Independent film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Placebo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mental health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Experiment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mental disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlled_substance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Controlled substance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medication", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Medication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Waldo_Emerson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ralph Waldo Emerson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Epidemic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euphoria", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Euphoria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Substance abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Suicide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Psychiatry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Circulatory system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_North_Carolina_at_Chapel_Hill", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Drugs_and_Medications", "label": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Drugs and Medications", "wgt": 36}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Teen_Health/Drugs_and_Alcohol", "label": "dmoz/Health/Teen Health/Drugs and Alcohol", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Pharmacology", "label": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Pharmacology", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Home_Tests", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Home Tests", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://thumb.spokesman.com/l2sMHX5ZvY-IivJJOF8GNS33NSY=/600x0/media.spokesman.com/graphics/2020/08/sr_placeholder.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9619876", "eventUri": "eng-9619876", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

The panel also voted 10-1 that a safety program wouldn't be sufficient to protect patients from potential risks of the therapy.\n\nThe FDA will spend the next several weeks deciding whether to grant clearance for the medication before the deadline of August 11. The agency doesn't have to follow the counsel of its advisers, but it frequently does. In cases when the FDA decides not to approve, the agency and the sponsor discuss potential next steps such as providing additional data.\n\nThe strongly negative vote puts the regulator in a tough spot. Some of the panel's efficacy concerns relate the design of Lykos' clinical trials, which the agency signed off on back in 2017. The committee had concerns across the board, from how the trials was designed and conducted to the potential for vulnerable patients to be harmed or abused. Worries also arose about MDMA-related cardiac side effects and the potential an approval would lead to increased diversion of MDMA for recreational use.\n\n\"There's a lot of holes in this data set,\" Rajesh Narendran, a psychiatrist from the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center who chairs the panel, said during a discussion period. \"I'm not convinced at all this drug is effective based on the data I saw.\"\n\nThe FDA has been under pressure to approve medications that treat PTSD, a mental illness that sometimes develops after patients witness or experience a life-threatening or traumatic event. Some 13 million Americans have PTSD in any given year, according to the Department of Veterans Affairs, and the few treatment options include two approved drugs that aren't effective for many people.\n\nWith its large PTSD patient population, the VA has been \"proactively preparing for a potential approval of MDMA-assisted therapy by the FDA,\" a spokesperson said in an email last month. The government agency has already put together a task force to prepare for the MDMA rollout in veterans.\n\nCompanies including Mind Medicine Inc., Atai Life Sciences and Compass Pathways are developing psychedelic drugs for medical purposes. Clearance of MDMA, known more commonly as ecstasy or molly, could add to the push for recreational drugs into mainstream applications. Shares of Mind Medicine fell 2.5% after U.S. markets closed, while Compass Pathways' fell 9% in after-market U.S. trading following the negative vote.\n\nPowerful drugs\n\nPsychedelics are powerful drugs that affect mood, perception and cognitive processes. Currently MDMA is deemed a schedule 1 drug by the Drug Enforcement Administration, on the same level as heroin and LSD, meaning it has high risk for abuse or addiction. Schedule 3 drugs like ketamine and anabolic steroids, which have medical uses, have a lower risk.\n\n...continued", "source": {"uri": "arcamax.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ArcaMax"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MDMA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "MDMA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Food and Drug Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-traumatic_stress_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Post-traumatic stress disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mental disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medication", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Medication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychedelic_drug", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Psychedelic drug"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_effect", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Side effect"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Efficacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatrist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Psychiatrist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Pittsburgh", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of Pittsburgh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreational_drug_use", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Recreational drug use"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Veterans_Affairs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Veterans Affairs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Clinical trial"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LSD", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LSD"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketamine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ketamine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cognition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_Enforcement_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drug Enforcement Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Perception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anabolic_steroid", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anabolic steroid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_trauma", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Psychological trauma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Addiction"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Drugs_and_Medications", "label": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Drugs and Medications", "wgt": 40}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Teen_Health/Drugs_and_Alcohol", "label": "dmoz/Health/Teen Health/Drugs and Alcohol", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Pharmacology", "label": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Pharmacology", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Home_Tests", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Home Tests", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 63}], "image": "https://resources.arcamax.com/newspics/292/29227/2922716.gif", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9619876", "eventUri": "eng-9619876", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-08-11", "textStart": 627, "textEnd": 636}], "sentiment": -0.08235294117647063, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

Functional blinding, selection bias, lack of diversity, and the lack of management of expectation bias were significant factors in the vote.\n\n\"I do think there is potential for this, but based on selection bias [and] functional unblinding, it just didn't feel right, and the potential for some misconduct and manipulating the trial results,\" said global drug safety advocate Kim Witczak.\n\nOn the second voting question, 10 members voted against MDMA's safety, and one member voted in favor of the drug.\n\nThe treatment is designed to be administered in three doses given at least three weeks apart in supervised treatment sessions with a licensed mental health provider over a four-month course of treatment. Each session would coincide with psychological interventions, and patients would be monitored for 8 hours or more, as outlined during the meeting.\n\nDuring the meeting, Lykos Therapeutics presented data from its two late-stage randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials using MDMA in combination with therapy to treat PTSD, along with an exploratory observational study consisting of a six-month follow-up visit.\n\nThe first trial, MAPP1, evaluated 90 patients with PTSD who were randomly assigned a single divided dose of 80-180 mg of MDMA or a placebo, followed by three psychotherapy sessions lasting a total of eight hours. Participants could receive an additional dose of MDMA after the first dose.\n\nOne issue raised by the FDA and its advisors during the meeting was the functional unblinding of the clinical trials. First, because MDMA produces \"profound alterations\" in mood, sensation, suggestibility, and cognition, it is \"nearly impossible\" to blind the clinical trial, the agency said in its briefing document.\n\nFunctional blinding can introduce bias in clinical studies and expectation bias among those who believe they were given the active treatment.\n\nApproximately 90 percent of participants assigned to MDMA and 75 percent of those assigned to the placebo were able to guess their treatment assignment accurately.\n\nThere's also a possibility of expectation bias. This occurs when participants who believed they received active treatment anticipated experiencing clinical benefits, while those receiving a placebo may have felt worse due to disappointment from not experiencing expected treatment effects or a combination of both scenarios.\n\nMoreover, therapists or monitors during sessions could infer a participant's treatment based on their behavior, making participants and study staff aware of the participant's treatment arm.\n\n\"It's reasonable to assume that both functional unblinding and expectation bias have influenced the treatment effects observed in MDMA clinical trials to some degree,\" the FDA stated.\n\nDr. Holtzheimer raised concerns about functional blinding during the meeting.\n\n\"Functional unblinding clearly occurred. That leads to the strong reality that expectation bias played a part in the outcomes of the study,\" he said. \"Stating the obvious expectation bias can work in two ways: It can exaggerate the effect of the active treatment. It can also blunt the effect of the placebo treatment.\"\n\nDr. Holtzheimer, speaking specifically about the second clinical trial, said the difference between the active and placebo groups was \"statistically significant\" by Lycos Therapeutic's own analyses but relatively small enough that expectation bias could not be discounted and could potentially explain the difference between the true groups. This left him \"unconvinced by the acute efficacy of the treatment.\"\n\n\"I'm also not convinced by the durability data again because of the use of other treatments by a substantial portion of the follow-up group. And then I think the psychological intervention is still, for me, a bit of a black box. It's not clear exactly what was done in each [therapy] session,\" Dr. Holtzheimer said.\n\n\"I believe the company, the sponsor, that they assessed this in the trials, however, what's described is really a relatively vague ill-defined treatment psychosocial intervention that I think it would be hard to standardize across arms, and I'm not convinced was equal across arms which could further contribute to differences and outcomes between groups,\" he added.\n\nMs. Elizabeth Joniak-Grant, a patient representative for the FDA with a doctorate in sociology, expressed concerns over the lack of diversity in the study population, the safety profile, and the manufacturer's failure to disclose why some participants dropped out of the study. Additionally, she raised concerns over the potential cardiovascular adverse events associated with the drug.\n\n\"With COVID, we've seen quite a rise in dysautonomia diagnosis and POTS [postural tachycardia syndrome], and I'm wondering how that would come into play with elevated blood pressure and heart rate and tachycardia, so I think that's something that needs to be looked at more,\" she said.\n\nMs. Joniak-Grant also expressed concern that adverse events were reported in participants that were ongoing for seven days or more, but no data was provided as to whether those side effects ever resolved.\n\nData from both humans and animals suggest that regular MDMA use produces adaptations in the serotonin and dopamine systems that are associated with substance use disorder and related behaviors, such as increased impulsivity.\n\nDr. Maryann Amirshahi, a medical toxicologist, asked Lycos about MDMA's addictive qualities:\n\n\"One of the things that you pointed out is that 46 percent of your patients with PTSD have substance use disorder, and 40 percent of them, you said, had also used MDMA illicitly prior to the study. So my question for you is, it doesn't seem that we evaluated if they went on to use illicit MDMA after the fact and how these therapy sessions by introducing somebody that already has SUD or is at high risk of SUD in multiple sessions using MDMA -- why didn't we follow up to see if there was a subsequent uptick in illicit use?\" she asked.\n\n\"The reason I say that as a medical toxicologist is that we're managing more and more severe cases of MDMA overdose, and so I'm less concerned about the safety in the acute setting but more chronically if they go on to abuse MDMA -- that drug is much less safe on the street.\"\n\nLow serotonin may cause poor memory and depression, which could explain why some who use MDMA regularly experience confusion, depression, paranoia, anxiety, and impaired memory.\n\nBrian Dempsey, director of government affairs at the Wounded Warrior Project, spoke positively on the adoption of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for the treatment of veterans with PTSD. He said the organization is \"wholly committed to finding new options for care for veterans who want and need care that they deserve.\"\n\nMr. Michael Abrams, a senior health researcher from the Public Citizen's Health Research Group, emphasized the \"functionally unblinded\" nature of the manufacturer's clinical trials and its ability to influence favorable drug effects.\n\n\"The two pivotal randomized clinical trials were functionally unblinded and thus likely biased towards favorable drug effects. Patients and therapists likely knew who received the drug, and anecdotes suggest some therapists abused that knowledge to manipulate patient beliefs,\" Mr. Abrams said.\n\nDr. Alpert cited concerns over the clinical trial data's functional unblinding, the high rate of MDMA use among study participants, the nature of eight-hour intensive psychotherapy sessions and how that could be practically implemented, and the lack of long-term data regarding safety outcomes and relapse data two months post-treatment.\n\n\"The APA supports research and therapeutic discovery into psychedelic agents that's pursued with the same scientific integrity, rigor, and regulatory standards applied to other promising therapies in medicine,\" he added.", "source": {"uri": "theepochtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.theepochtimes.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-traumatic_stress_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Post-traumatic stress disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blinded_experiment", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Blinded experiment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_bias", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Selection bias"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacovigilance", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pharmacovigilance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Placebo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MDMA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "MDMA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Food and Drug Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bias"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Clinical trial"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo-controlled_study", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Placebo-controlled study"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Observational study"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cognition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mental health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Psychology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_event", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Adverse event"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychosocial", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Psychosocial"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Efficacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_use_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Substance use disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tachycardia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tachycardia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychotherapy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Psychotherapy"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health", "label": "dmoz/Health", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Drugs_and_Medications", "label": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Drugs and Medications", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Biotechnology_and_Pharmaceuticals/Contract_Research_Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Biotechnology and Pharmaceuticals/Contract Research Organizations", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Men's_Health/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Men's Health/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Pharmacology", "label": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Pharmacology", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 58}], "image": "https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/04/24/id5636533-fda-eet-10.13-LSedit-1080x720.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9619876", "eventUri": "eng-9619876", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

Still, its recommendation could hold great weight as the FDA decides for the first time whether the mind-altering compound -- better known by its street name, ecstasy, and long categorized among the riskiest of controlled substances -- can be legally used as a medical treatment in the United States.\n\nThe sponsor of the MDMA treatment, Lykos Therapeutics, conducted two late-stage clinical trials showing that patients treated with the drug experienced a significant improvement in their PTSD symptoms relative to those who got a placebo. The data, however, is uncommonly messy. Participants in the clinical trials also received various forms of psychotherapy, whose role wasn't specifically measured in the results. The consciousness-distorting properties of MDMA also complicate the gold standard for clinical trials, which requires that participants not know whether they received a drug or a placebo.\n\n{snip}\n\nRead more: https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2024/06/04/mdma-fda-review-ptsd-treatment/", "source": {"uri": "democraticunderground.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Democratic Underground"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-traumatic_stress_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Post-traumatic stress disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Food and Drug Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MDMA", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "MDMA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Washington Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mental health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychedelic_drug", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Psychedelic drug"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlled_substance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Controlled substance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Clinical trial"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Placebo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychotherapy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Psychotherapy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health", "label": "dmoz/Health", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Drugs_and_Medications", "label": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Drugs and Medications", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Biotechnology_and_Pharmaceuticals/Contract_Research_Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Biotechnology and Pharmaceuticals/Contract Research Organizations", "wgt": 14}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9619876", "eventUri": "eng-9619876", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1}

In a second vote, the panel also concluded the benefits of the treatment did not outweigh the risks, with the vote carried by a margin of 10 to 1.\n\nThe agency is due to make its final decision by mid-August. The panel's vote is non-binding but typically holds huge sway with the agency and therefore will dramatically reduce the likelihood of the treatment getting approved, nixing the hopes of psychedelic advocates as well as investors who have poured hundreds of millions of dollars into the sector in recent years.\n\nEarlier this year, Lykos raised $100mn from a group of 10 investors, including the charitable foundation run by hedge fund billionaire Steven Cohen and his wife, Alexandra. Lykos did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the FDA panel decision.\n\nIf approved, Lykos's MDMA-based therapy treatment would have become the first new PTSD treatment in more than two decades. It also would have marked the first time a so-called Schedule 1 drug, which the government deems as having no medical application and high potential for abuse, was deployed as a regulated mental health treatment.\n\nIn the second of two phase 3 trials, Lykos -- which was spun out of the Multidisciplinary Association of Psychedelic Studies, a non-profit -- showed 71 per cent of people who had received its MDMA-based therapy improved sufficiently to no longer meet the criteria for PTSD diagnosis, compared with 48 per cent in the placebo group. Patients received the drug over three eight-hour therapy sessions.\n\nBut the FDA panel was unconvinced, voting against endorsing the effectiveness of the treatment, citing issues with the trial design and data collection.\n\nRajesh Narendran, professor in radiology and psychiatry at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine who chaired the panel, said issues with the trial design made the data \"meaningless\". \"There was just too many problems with [the study],\" added Satish Iyengar, a statistics professor at the University of Pittsburgh.\n\nTiffany Farchione, an FDA official, earlier told the panel that Lykos had failed to collect data on side-effects of the drug associated with abuse such as \"euphoria\" or \"elated mood\", meaning it would be difficult to accurately label the drug. Farchione said the data collection issues \"may have the greatest impact\" on the agency's decision.\n\nDavid Millis, a clinical reviewer for the FDA, also raised concerns about \"double-blinding\" trial participants because of the powerful hallucinatory effects of MDMA. \"Although we do have two positive studies, the results are in the context\" of participants knowing they were on the drug, Millis said. Farchione also noted the trial had not adequately assessed the effect of psychotherapy on the treatment as well as the potential cardiology risks from the treatment.\n\nAlia Lilienstein, Lykos's senior medical director, pushed back against the criticism during the evidence session.

It was the first FDA advisory committee meeting to evaluate a new PTSD treatment in 25 years, and the first time that committee members considered a psychedelic treatment for PTSD.\n\nDespite the widespread prevalence of PTSD, there are \"very few medications approved for this indication,\" which has driven interest in new treatment possibilities among both patients and providers, David Millis, MD, a clinical reviewer for the agency, said.\n\n\"Off-label treatment for PTSD is common, with a number and range of off-label treatment options, possibly a reflection of the limitations of the approved treatments,\" Mills said. \"The applicant is proposing a novel treatment paradigm.\"\n\nIn mid-February, the FDA granted priority review to the new drug application, which states that the drug would be used in combination with a psychological intervention.\n\nThe application generated some controversy, which was reflected in the public comment portion of the meeting. While some endorsed the application -- a few veterans described firsthand experiences of the drug's benefits, even crediting it as a life-saving medication -- others heavily criticized Lykos, arguing that the research is spiritually based and citing inappropriate behavior in clinical trials that is currently under investigation.\n\nIn the following discussion, several committee members also expressed concerns about the alleged misconduct, as well as gaps in data, the diversity of the study population, functional unblinding in the trials and inconsistencies in the proposed psychological intervention.\n\nElizabeth Joniak-Grant, PhD, a sociologist and qualitative research consultant with the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill's Injury Prevention Research Center, said that, while she is \"somewhat convinced of MDMA's effectiveness,\" she had concerns regarding the specific evidence presented to the committee.\n\n\"I think this is a promising pathway; I think most of us probably think that,\" Joniak-Grant, temporary voting member of the committee, said. \"But also, I can't in good conscience support something where this many harms are being reported and just say, 'Oh, someone somewhere is investigating it and I'm sure it will be taken care of.'\"\n\nWhen asked whether the available data show MDMA-assisted psychotherapy is effective in patients with PTSD, nine committee members voted \"no\" and two members voted \"yes.\"\n\nWhen asked whether the benefits of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy outweigh its risks, 10 members voted \"no\" and one voted \"yes.\"\n\nThe FDA is expected to make its final decision in August.\n\n\"Similar to many of my colleagues, I felt that the large positive effect was denoted by the significant confounders,\" Maryann Amirshahi, PharmD, MD, MPH, PhD, a professor of emergency medicine at Georgetown University School of Medicine and co-medical director of the National Capital Poison Center, said. \"Although I do

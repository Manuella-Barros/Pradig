{"id": 243234198, "title": "'Stop this': Texas GOP lawmaker roasted for 'cheesy' concealed carry holster infomercial", "text": "Rep. Dan Crenshaw (R-TX) posted a lengthy infomercial diatribe on X Friday evening, promoting \"Endex Fitness\" brand concealed carry holsters for guns. This follows some other controversial product plugs by Republican lawmakers, including Gov. Kristi Noem (R-SD) promoting a Texas dental practice that fixed her teeth \u2014 which actually led to her facing a false advertising lawsuit. \"No better way to celebrate Independence Day than stylishly exercising your 2nd Amendment rights,\" wrote Crenshaw, accompanying the post with a video demonstrating the holster. \"So many brands try to sell you 'sleek' holsters and belt systems for 'concealed' carry. But there\u2019s nothing sleek about an extra inch of plastic or leather or metal clips, plus the belt. Our design keeps it simple with an improved belly band elastic holster that integrates into the pants perfectly. Or you can use the holster by itself. It\u2019s removable.\" ALSO READ: Rep. Byron Donalds, his gigantic Jim Crow myth and a forgotten fact about Black voters Crenshaw went on to disclaim, \"No, I don\u2019t make a dime off of this ... The profits for this clothing line go almost entirely to funding US House races around the country and growing the Republican majority,\" and urged supporters to \"Get it soon. This is our first drop and we didn\u2019t produce all that much. Enjoy!\" Crenshaw's post didn't go down on social media the way he might have been hoping. \"What is with this trend of elected Republicans doing these product infomercials?\" wrote anti-Trump conservative activist Heath Mayo. \"Like, how do they sit there and think: 'Yeah, this is a good idea.' What are we doing here? I\u2019m begging you guys \u2014 stop this, please.\" \"AND it acts as a girdle, which you seem to need,\" wrote former congressional candidate Pat Bryan. \"We're not a serious political party,\" wrote the account @robertjalberts. \"No, it's cheesy,\" wrote the account @bikesalsa. \"What are you doing, bro?\" wrote the account @IsntChrisL. \"The Congress pipeline already allows you to get rich with insider trading and then continue the corruption with a lobbying gig once your voters finally boot you. You're screwing up the whole system and doing infomercials while you're still in office.\" Crenshaw, ironically, has been accused of insider trading himself by Fox News anchor Jesse Watters, and didn't respond to it gracefully.

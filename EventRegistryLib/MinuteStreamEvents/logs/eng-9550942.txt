Thomas Guerry was conducting an investigation and driving on Chapala Street, the detective noticed two wanted men walking in the area of Ortega Street and Bradbury Avenue.\n\n\"As he approached the intersection the wanted men split apart from one another and began to walk back to each side of the front of the police vehicle. As the detective stepped from his vehicle, both wanted subjects opened fire with handguns, fatally wounding Detective Guerry.\n\n\"The death of Detective Tom Guerry ripped through the heart of Santa Barbara, as well as the entire region.\n\n\"In memory of Tom, the Santa Barbara Citizens Council on Crime established the H.

To receive Matt Kettmann's food newsletter in your inbox each Friday, sign up at independent.com/newsletters.\n\nBack in 2019, I was asked to be on the advisory board for a Santa Barbara-based offshoot of the Julia Child Foundation for Gastronomy and the Culinary Arts. (Yes, that's as much of a mouthful as her food was.) We decided to call ourselves the Santa Barbara Culinary Experience, and set about planning what was going to be one of the most epic and eclectic food and drink events in memory during the middle of March 2020. (Among other highlights, I was especially proud of the wine programming that I helped to develop, including pinot noir through the ages and charcuterie paired with cool-climate syrah.)\n\nBut we all know what happened next. COVID forced us to cancel the event, the first of many cancellations to come.\n\nIn the still-pandemic daze of 2021, we hosted a virtual event around my Vines & Vision book about Santa Barbara County winemakers, and then came back to life in 2022, specifically branding the weeklong series of events as the Taste of Santa Barbara. In that year and last, we co-hosted classes with A to Z Cooking School, led farm tours, crafted special dinners, put on screenings of Julia Child shows, and threw wine festivals at the Presidio.\n\nMy family enjoyed the Paperboy x The Lark brunch last Sunday, where we met Paperboy founder, and Lark alum, Ryan Harms. A really nice guy, and the food and cocktails were tasty.\n\nThat formula is again in play for Taste of Santa Barbara 2024, and you'd better jump on the ticket train if you haven't already, as many of the events are already selling out. But as I wrote this one Tuesday night, there were still plenty of tickets for a few of the smaller classes and meals, including the hyperlocal vegetarian event with Emma West from Satellite S.B., brunch at The Lark, and tours of The Cultured Abalone, Wanderment Farms, and Las Cumbres Ranch.\n\nThe big-tent events this year include the wine festival at the Presidio on Saturday, May 18, where the list of producers continues to grow; I'll be running a few panels during that one for those seeking a bit of education with their imbibing. And that night is the Lights, Camera, Julia! screening at the Metro 4, where members of the team who produced the MAX series Julia -- which I loved, personally -- will regale the crowd with memories of that experience.\n\nThe new and most ambitious course for Taste of Santa Barbara, however, is the Friday-night Soiree at the Casa de la Guerra. A small curated gathering of chefs, including Massimo Falsini from Caruso's, Alex Bollinger from El Encanto, Sergei Simonov of Loquita, Justin West of Market Forager, and Sandra Adu Zelli of Gipsy Hill Bakery, will be preparing special dishes for attendees. Cutler's Artisan Spirits will be making cocktails, and a wide variety of wines will be provided by the Santa Barbara Vintners, including stalwarts like Star Lane and Tyler and newcomers like MarBeso. The tickets are a bit steep at $200+, but the team is doing all possible to ensure it will be money well spent.\n\nWine Week\n\nHere's your reminder to go snag some $10 glasses of wine at more than a dozen establishments around town celebrating our second annual Santa Barbara Wine Week. I wrote about it in last week's newsletter, and can now direct you to the larger feature I wrote for the issue.\n\nIt's about Chris Hammell, the longtime manager of Bien Nacido Vineyard, and the fact that he's departing this fall after almost 25 years at the helm of that historic property. In reporting the story, I realized that his career arc reflects much of the same path for Santa Barbara County's wine industry. After years of steady growth, many vintners are having to ask hard questions about what the future holds.\n\nMexico City\n\nI'm on the third day of a five-day blast through Mexico City, the destination for my annual trip with friends from elementary, high school, and college. No doubt I am posting photos as you read this.

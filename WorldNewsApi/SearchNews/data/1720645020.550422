Now, he feels like the restaurant violated his rights. \u201cWhy is this like slave labor camp? This is a job, OK? Not like freakin\u2019 prison,\u201d TikTok user Cade Alex (@cadealex) said in his clip, which has more than 350,000 views. \u201cLike, is this legal?\u201d In the TikTok, Alex said he got a job at a steakhouse that would hold him over for a few months until he started grad school. But he just completed his first day at work, and it was rather hellish. A brutal shift \u201cThey do not give us breaks or food,\u201d Alex recounted. Alex said he worked a 9-hour shift (from 3pm to midnight) and didn\u2019t get a single break, not even to scarf down a quick dinner. On top of that, he said the steakhouse workers aren\u2019t allowed to eat the food at the restaurant unless they go two hours before or after their shift. Management doesn\u2019t want customers to recognize their servers as fellow restaurant patrons. And if you want to bring in your own food, whether from another restaurant or from home, you can\u2019t do that either. This is strange for a restaurant, given that many give employees are given one comped meal per shift or a heavy discount to get them to eat where they work (at this steakhouse, they get 25% off). Alex recalled that back when he worked at Target, the retail giant was strict about ensuring employees went on break since they didn\u2019t want to get sued. \u201cI\u2019m not very excited working here after day one,\u201d Alex said about his new steakhouse gig. And Alex isn\u2019t the only employee being withheld from his basic right to eat. According to Aex, one of his co-workers said that when the restaurant first opened, they had 12-hour training days, again with no food. \u201cThis cannot be legal,\u201d Alex said. Additionally, Alex said employees aren\u2019t allowed to park in the restaurant lot because they don\u2019t want customers to see workers\u2019 cars parked next to their \u201cnice cars.\u201d Instead, they\u2019re forced to park in the mall across the street and walk over. \u201cAnd I know this steakhouse is very like high-end, and they care about their image a lot, but it\u2019s kinda to the point where they treat us like we\u2019re garbage,\u201d Alex said. \u201cEvery day feels like I\u2019m in The Bear,\u201d Alex said. @cadealex HOW IZ THIS LEGAL?\u200d? #job #jobs #jobsearch #jobtips #jobinterview #jobforme #jobless #minimumwage #serverlife #serverproblems #servertiktok \u266c original sound \u2013 Cade Alex Unfortunately (but not surprisingly), there is no federal law that requires employers to provide a meal break. However, about 20 states, plus Guam and Puerto Rico, have laws that require adults to get a meal break, according to the United States Department of Labor. Alex lives and works in Illinois, where state law mandates that workers who have a 7.5-hour or more shift are entitled to a meal break of at least 20 minutes. And that food break has to happen within the first five hours of the work shift. Plus, workers who pull a 12-hour shift get another 20-minute meal break. Violating these laws can result in a fine of $250 or $500 per offense (depending on company size), paid to the employee. Viewers weigh in A ton of people chimed in in the comments section of the viral video. \u201cIs it legal? no. is it standard in this industry? MMM YEAHHHH,\u201d a person wrote. \u201cThe people in the comments saying they\u2019d sue have NEVER worked in the food industry,\u201d another said. \u201cIf you file a complaint with the Dept of Labor they\u2019ll investigate to see if any laws are being broken. It\u2019s free and confidential,\u201d a commenter suggested. The Daily Dot reached out to Alex for comment via Instagram direct message.

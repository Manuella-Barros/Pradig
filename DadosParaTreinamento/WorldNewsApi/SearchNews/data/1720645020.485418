In Letterkenny, Tom\u00e1s Se\u00e1n Devine looks set to shake things up in the seven-seater constituency. Angela Ward of the Mica Action Group says the electorate is speaking loud and clear on the ballot paper. \u201cIt\u2019s an amazing day for us, I am delighted with the message it\u2019s going to send to Dublin \u2013 that we are not going to sit back and take this any longer,\u201d the PRO said. The voting trends from Inishowen shine a light on the dissatisfaction with the government\u2019s attempts at two redress schemes, which have both been labelled as not fit for purpose. The support for 100% Redress candidates, all newcomers to politics, gives MAG more power to effect change as laid out in The People\u2019s Document. Angela told : \u201cAny progress that has been made has been from homeowners pushing and pressing. We would never have come to this position if we had proper representation in the first place. \u201cWe now have ordinary homeowners who not alone are dealing with the trauma of having their homes collapsing around them, but having to go out canvassing for weeks on end to have their voices represented on the council should never have been the case.\u201d Watch the interview here", "summary": "<p>Featured Photo: Angela Ward and Tricia Sullivan &#8211; Mica Action Group The Mica Action Group is set to be boosted&#8230;</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.donegaldaily.com/2024/06/08/elections-2024-mica-action-group-to-be-empowered-by-new-council-allies/\">Elections 2024: Mica Action Group to be empowered by new council allies</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.donegaldaily.com\">Donegal Daily</a>.</p>", "url": "https://www.donegaldaily.com/2024/06/08/elections-2024-mica-action-group-to-be-empowered-by-new-council-allies/", "image": "https://www.donegaldaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_7888.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 15:55:09", "author": "Rachel McLaughlin", "authors": ["Rachel McLaughlin"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "ie", "sentiment": -0.047}

Kohli played a fine knock in the final to score a 59-ball 76. His knock proved crucial as India got the better of South Africa by seven runs to win their second T20 World Cup title.\n\nFollowing the triumph, Kohli announced his retirement from the format along with Rohit Sharma and Ravindra Jadeja.

Robin Uthappa drops a sensational statement", "body": "It's Just Matter Of Time Virat Kohli Will Become No.1 - Robin Uthappa\n\nFormer Indian wicketkeeper-batter Robin Uthappa has shared his thoughts on modern-day legend Virat Kohli reclaiming the top spot in both ODI and Test rankings. Robin Uthappa stated that it's just a matter of time before Virat Kohli becomes the No. 1 ranked batter in both ODIs and Test cricket in the world.\n\nThe Indian team recently completed a 3-0 whitewash over Sri Lanka in the T20I series. Virat Kohli was not part of that series as he had already retired from T20Is after the World Cup 2024 win. He was expected to miss the three-match ODI series in Sri Lanka but was included in the squad along with Rohit Sharma.\n\nThe first ODI match between India and Sri Lanka is Virat Kohli's first game in the ongoing calendar year. He was India's second-highest run-scorer in ODIs last year behind Shubman Gill. He scored 1,377 runs from 27 matches and won the Player of the Tournament during the ODI World Cup 2023 at home.\n\nRobin Uthappa said that Virat Kohli will regain the top spot in both ODI and Test rankings. Uthappa is confident that it's only a matter of time before Kohli becomes the number-one batter in both formats globally.\n\n\"Do you think Virat Kohli will ever climb back to the first rank in the ODI and Test rankings?\" a fan asked.\n\n\"I think Virat Kohli will climb and it's just matter of time Virat Kohli will becomes No.1 ranked Test and ODI batter in the World,\" Robin Uthappa said.\n\nVirat Kohli and Robin Uthappa played together for the Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) in the Indian Premier League (IPL) during the 2009 and 2010 seasons. The Bengaluru-based team reached the final in 2009 and the semi-final in 2010. The duo also played together for the Indian national cricket team.\n\nVirat Kohli made his international debut during India's tour of the island nation in 2008. The right-handed batter scored 12 runs from 22 balls in his first ODI match in Dambulla. However, Kohli has since excelled against Sri Lanka. He delivered standout performances against Sri Lanka in the 50-over format.\n\nThe Delhi-born batter is fifth in all-time run-scorers in ODIs between India and Sri Lanka. He has scored 2,594 runs from 53 matches at an average of 63.26 and a strike rate of 93.91. He is behind Sachin Tendulkar, who is first on the list, by over 500 runs. Kohli also has impressive stats in other formats against Sri Lanka.\n\nThe former Indian skipper has scored over 1,000 runs in 11 Tests against Sri Lanka at an average of 67.81 with five centuries. In T20Is, his performance is even more impressive. He scored 339 runs across eight matches with an average of 67.80 and a strike rate of 138.36.", "source": {"uri": "cricketaddictor.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CricketAddictor"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Uthappa", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Robin Uthappa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virat Kohli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Test cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Day_International", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "One Day International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lanka", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sri Lanka"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sri Lanka"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20_International", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Twenty20 International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_national_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "India national cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cricket World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rohit_Sharma", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rohit Sharma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shubman_Gill", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shubman Gill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladeshi_cricket_team_in_Sri_Lanka_in_2020\u201321", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2020\u201321"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challengers_Bangalore", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Royal Challengers Bangalore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sachin_Tendulkar", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sachin Tendulkar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strike rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limited_overs_cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Limited overs cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Statistics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://static.cricketaddictor.com/images/2024/RobinUthappaRohitSharmaViratKohli.webp?q=80", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9785713", "eventUri": "eng-9785713", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 202, "relevance": 1}

Kohli is in India's squad for the ODI series against Sri Lanka.\n\nHe is currently playing the first ODI of the series, which is his first international game since the historic T20 World Cup 2024 final played more than a month ago. He was earlier supposed to be rested for the series but since India will play a limited no. of ODIs before next year's Champions Trophy, new head coach Gautam Gambhir asked for a full-strength ODI team.\n\nWatch: 'IPL wala rule hai kya'? - KL Rahul's hilarious reaction to a wide call during 1st IND vs SL ODI\n\nBefore the start of the first ODI between Sri Lanka and India, Russel Arnold predicted that it is just a matter of time before Kohli becomes the No. 1 ranked batter in Tests and ODIs. The renowned commentator also lauded Kohli for his dedication and commitment to the game.\n\n\"Virat Kohli's passion, dedication and commitment is just second to none. He is just phenomenal. Yes, I think it's just a matter of time that Virat Kohli will become the No.1 ranked Batter in the World in ODIs & Tests,\" Russel Arnold was quoted as saying by Sony Sports Network.\n\nVirat Kohli is likely to bat at his usual No. 3 batting spot against Sri Lanka. His last ODI match was the ODI World Cup 2023 final match against Australia, where India suffered a heartbreaking loss. Since then, he has only played either Tests or T20Is.\n\nAlong with Kohli, Rohit Sharma is also back in the team after the T20 World Cup 2024 final against South Africa in Barbados. Rohit Sharma is also the captain of the ODI side. His last ODI was also the World Cup 2023 final against Australia.\n\nVirat Kohli and Rohit Sharma announced their retirements from the T20I format after India's title win in the T20 World Cup 2024. Both the players want to concentrate on the Test and ODI formats which will be crucial in India's plans for next year's Champions Trophy and the WTC final.\n\nKohli had a disappointing run in the T20 World Cup 2024 but made a huge impact in the final with a crucial 77 off 59 balls. Meanwhile, Rohit Sharma had a brilliant tournament and finished as the second-highest run-scorer of the tournament and India's highest run-getter.\n\nVirat Kohli has a fantastic record in all the formats of the game but his record in ODI cricket stands out the most. The 35-year-old has outstanding numbers in ODIs with 13848 runs in 292 ODIs at an average of 58.67 and a strike rate of 93.58. He has already scored 50 hundreds and 72 fifties in the format.", "source": {"uri": "cricketaddictor.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CricketAddictor"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russel_Arnold", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russel Arnold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virat Kohli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Test cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Day_International", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "One Day International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lanka", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sri Lanka"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sri Lanka"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_Men's_T20_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "ICC Men's T20 World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rohit_Sharma", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rohit Sharma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_Champions_Trophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ICC Champions Trophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gautam_Gambhir", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gautam Gambhir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_national_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India national cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20_International", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twenty20 International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cricket World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_national_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Australia national cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuala_Lumpur", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kuala Lumpur"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kuala Lumpur"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Malaysia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strike rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbados", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Barbados"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Barbados"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Statistics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://static.cricketaddictor.com/images/2024/Russel%20Arnold%20Virat%20Kohli.jpg?q=80", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9785713", "eventUri": "eng-9785713", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 200, "relevance": 1}

Virat Kohli has the opportunity to break Master Blaster Sachin Tendulkar's 18-year-old record and become the fastest player to reach 14,000 runs in ODI cricket.\n\nVirat Kohli made his comeback during the first ODI between India and Sri Lanka after a break following the T20 World Cup 2024 victory. Kohli scored 24 runs off 32 balls before being dismissed by Wanindu Hasaranga. He failed to convert the start into a big score during the 231-run chase in Colombo on August 2.\n\nThe Rohit Sharma-led team managed to score 230 runs in 47.5 overs, leading to a tie. The Indian team had the chance to secure a victory with just one run needed and two wickets in hand. Sri Lanka skipper Charith Asalanka dismissed Shivam Dube and Arshdeep Singh on consecutive deliveries to bowl out India.\n\nVirat Kohli is just 128 runs away from breaking Sachin Tendulkar's record for the fastest to reach 14,000 ODI runs. Tendulkar set the record in 350 innings during an ODI against Pakistan in Peshawar in 2006. Sri Lanka's Kumar Sangakkara reached the milestone of 378 innings during the 2015 ODI World Cup.\n\nThe 35-year-old made his ODI debut against Sri Lanka in August 2008 and is considered one of the greatest number three batsmen in the format. Kohli is the third-highest run-scorer in ODI history, having scored 13,872 runs in 293 ODIs. Kohli boasts an average of 58.53 and 50 centuries to his name.\n\nThe Delhi-born cricketer has a strong record against Sri Lanka. He has scored 2,618 runs in 54 ODIs at an average of 62.33, including 10 centuries and 12 fifties, with a best score of 166*. Overall, he has amassed 4,042 runs in 72 international matches at an average of 64.15, with 15 centuries and 18 fifties.\n\nThe second ODI between India and Sri Lanka will be played at the R. Premadasa Stadium in Colombo on August 4, Sunday. The Men in Blue will be hoping to regain their winning momentum after a tie in the first match.

And notably, India is in Sri Lanka, playing the ODI series there currently. However, whether they are on the playing field, or back home, some players are always in the news. We are of course, referring to Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma, and MS Dhoni. Check out why these 3 strong cricketing personalities are in the news today.\n\nOh yes, one more thing. It just crossed the mind that these great cricket players can be bracketed into some categories: Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma are the current icons powering Indian cricket, and MS Dhoni, the legend, is the past. However, both Kohli and Sharma have retired from T20 recently. Notably, retired or not, the interest in them never dies. The same applies to many others, including Sachin Tendulkar, Sourav Ganguly, Rahul Dravid and others.\n\nVirat Kohli is in the news specifically for the way he was seen smiling, and not believing at the blunder committed by the Sri Lankan batsman Liyanage. Virtually committing hara kiri! The batsman in question \"walked\" even though the umpire had given him not out in the first ODI. The replay also showed he was not out! Kohli and Sharma's reactions' video clip went viral, sending internet into meltdown. Joining Kohli and Sharma in the mirthful episode was Axar Patel too.\n\nNot just this. Both Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma are hitting the headlines because of some very important records they are about to shatter.\n\nKohli needs 92 runs to become the fastest to the 27000-run score in international cricket. Wait, there is more! To become the fastest to score 14000 runs in ODIs, Virat Kohli needs just 128 runs. Sachin Tendulkar and Kumara Sangakkara are the only batsmen to have achieved this feat.\n\nAnd one more thing that has caught the eye! Today, during the 2nd ODI, Kohli grabbed the catch of Sameera Samarawickrama in Colombo and did a fascinating Bihu dance.\n\nRohit Sharma is also on the cusp of breaking some records. The free-scoring batsman requires 2 runs to break former coach and iconic batsman Rahul Dravid's record to become India's 4th leading run-scorer. He is also set to surpass MS Dhoni.

(Image courtesy: BCCI)\n\nIndia is taking on Sri Lanka today in what is set to be an exciting match, especially after the amazing conclusion to the last one the two played recently. And getting in tune for the same was iconic batsman Virat Kohli. An amazing video released by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) on its X handle showed the batsman virtually tearing the bowlers apart in the nets.\n\nIn some out-of-this-world scenes, Virat Kohli walked up to the nets wearing his kit looking supremely confident and fit. Kohli did not just walk, he actually strutted to the batting crease. Rohit Sharma too walked onto the ground kitted up and a big smile on his face, but the effect, and the impact, were not the same.\n\nMeanwhile, in the nets, taking up his batting position, Kohli slammed the bowlers all across the stadium with lofted shots going high and far in the air. Each impeccably executed shot was followed by another and yet another one.\n\nStanding behind the hapless bowler was the dour figure of new coach Gautam Gambhir. Now, both Kohli and Gambhir have had their falling out moments, but this time, with both on the same side, there were some reactions elicited from the coach at the spectacle that were simply superb to watch.\n\nSome deft work done by the cameraman revealed Gautam Gambhir's reactions to Kohli's shots. The focus was first on Kohli as he confidently blasted the bowler back over his head. As soon as the shot was made, the camera zoomed onto Gambhir's face. The coach followed the line of the ball and you could see his eyes get wide!\n\nWatch the Virat Kohli video below:\n\nThe show did not end there. Virat even danced down the wicket to hit a lofted shot, followed by a reverse sweep of sorts and pretty soon the frown on Gambhir's face turned into a big smile. Clearly, the coach was not only impressed with Virat Kohli, he was delighted.\n\nAfter Kohli's stint at the crease was over, both could be seen engaged in conversation.\n\nIf Kohli carried this kind of confidence and form into the ODI series with Sri Lanka and performs at the level he is known to, the hosts will have a tough time.

With this, he reached closer to achieving a big milestone in the ODI format of the game.\n\nJust months after surpassing Sachin Tendulkar's record for most ODI centuries, Kohli now has his sights set on another of Tendulkar's long-standing records. During the ongoing series against the Lankan side, Kohli needs only 128 runs to break Tendulkar's 18-year-old record for most runs scored in ODI cricket.\n\nThe batter is poised to become only the third player in history to reach the big milestone of 14000 runs in ODI cricket. If the 35-year-old prolific player does so, he will follow the footsteps of cricket legends Tendulkar and former Sri Lanka skipper Kumar Sangakkara.\n\nApart from this, the star Indian batter will also become the fastest player to reach this remarkable record in the 50-over format in terms of number of innings taken.

During the second ODI against Sri Lanka on Sunday, Kohli's exuberant celebration after taking a catch quickly became the talk of social media. The moment unfolded in the 27th over of Sri Lanka's innings, when Axar Patel, newly introduced into the attack, lured Sadeera Samarawickrama into a lofted shot. Samarawickrama, attempting to hit against the spin, danced down the track, only to see his effort thwarted by Kohli.\n\nPositioned at the covers, Kohli backtracked to take a comfortable catch. However, it was his celebration that captured the spotlight. After securing the dismissal, Kohli turned towards the dugout and broke into a spontaneous Bihu dance, an Assamese folk dance. This unexpected move delighted fans and quickly went viral, sparking a flurry of reactions on social media.\n\nThe gesture appeared to be a nod to his teammate Riyan Parag, who is also part of the Indian ODI squad and hails from Assam.\n\nParag is known to idolise Kohli, and has cheered for the Indian batting stalwart on multiple occasions on his official social media accounts. The Sri Lankan tour marked Parag's maiden call-up in the ODI squad, and the first time he shares the dressing room with Kohli.\n\nHowever, the Assam batter continues to wait for a maiden cap in the format. He has earlier played in T20Is against Zimbabwe and Sri Lanka.\n\nKohli, meanwhile, made a return to the ODI format for the first time since the ODI World Cup last year, where India faced a crushing defeat to Australia in the final. In the first ODI of the series, Kohli endured a quiet outing, scoring only 24 in the 231-run chase as the match ended in a thrilling tie in Colombo.\n\nThe series also marked the return of captain Rohit Sharma to the format.\n\nEarlier in the second ODI, Sri Lankan captain Charith Asalanka opted to bat, but the side lost wickets at regular intervals in the opening stages of the game. India had earlier secured a 3-0 clean-sweep victory over the Lankans in the T20Is, which marked the beginning of a new era with Gautam Gambhir as head coach, and Suryakumar Yadav as the side's T20I captain.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virat Kohli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Day_International", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "One Day International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lanka", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sri Lanka"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sri Lanka"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sadeera_Samarawickrama", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sadeera Samarawickrama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axar_Patel", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Axar Patel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spin bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bihu_dance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bihu dance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assamese_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assamese language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riyan_Parag", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Riyan Parag"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assam", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assam"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Assam"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charith_Asalanka", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charith Asalanka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suryakumar_Yadav", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Suryakumar Yadav"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zimbabwean_cricket_team_in_Sri_Lanka_in_2017", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zimbabwean cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2017"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gautam_Gambhir", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gautam Gambhir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rohit_Sharma", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rohit Sharma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20_International", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twenty20 International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cricket bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cricket World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_national_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australia national cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombo", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Colombo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colombo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sri Lanka"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://images.hindustantimes.com/img/2024/08/04/1600x900/kohli_bihu_1722773387236_1722773395539.jfif", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9785713", "eventUri": "eng-9785713", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

The Indian batter has emerged as the most popular name in cricket due to his on-field achievements and off-field life. On the field, Kohli holds a plethora of records and off it, his connection with Anushka Sharma, the Bollywood actress, keeps him in the limelight.\n\nKohli's immense stature in world cricket makes him a brand magnet. The biggest brands in the market want only the best to endorse their products. And when it comes to the biggest face in world cricket, there is none bigger than Kohli.\n\nThe Indian cricketer is one of the richest athletes in the world. He mainly earns through his contract with the Board of Cricket in India (BCCI), brand endorsement and business ventures.\n\nLooking at the riches of Kohli, a common question by the common man would be: What is the salary of Virat Kohli?\n\nKohli is one of the select few with an A+ category contract in the Indian cricket team. He earns a massive amount from his contract with the BCCI and receives an annual salary of approximately $850,000 (INR 7 crore).

Back in the Indian ODI setup after a long gap of 8 months, Kohli would be eagerly wishing to get back to his natural form in the 50-over format. The first ODI against Sri Lanka on Friday in Colombo marks Kohli's return in the one-day setup after he last played the ODI World Cup in 2023.\n\nVirat Kohli, who plays remarkable well against all the teams, holds an impressive record against Sri Lanka especially at the R Premadasa Stadium in Colombo. The ongoing three-match ODI series will take place at the same venue so the star batter holds an extra edge over the other players in the team.\n\nThe phenomenal batter has a fine record at the R Premadasa Stadium in Colombo. In 11 matches and 10 innings, Kohli has scored 644 runs at an impressive average of 107.33. The swashbuckling batter has smashed four centuries and also hit a lone fifty with his best score being 131 at the venue. In his last five ODI innings at Colombo, he has scored four hundreds.\n\nThe Indian batter, who recently retired from the T20 format, loves playing against Asian rivals Sri Lanka. In a total of 53 one-day matches against the island nation, Kohli has amassed 2594 runs at an average of 63.26. He has also smashed 10 centuries and 12 half-centuries with his best score being 166 not out.\n\nAcross all formats in Colombo, Kohli has scored 911 runs in 16 innings at an average of 82.81, with four centuries and four fifties. His best score is 131. Meanwhile, the star batter is on the cusp of breaking a big record in the ODI series as he is just 152 runs away from getting to his 14,000 ODI runs. If he completes 14,000 runs, he will be only the third player after the Indian icon Sachin Tendulkar and Sri Lankan legend Kumar Sangakkara to get to this milestone.", "source": {"uri": "news9live.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News9live"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sumit_channa@news9live.com", "name": "Sumit Channa", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virat Kohli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Day_International", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "One Day International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombo", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Colombo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colombo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sri Lanka"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lankan_cricket_team_in_Bangladesh_in_2017\u201318", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sri Lankan cricket team in Bangladesh in 2017\u201318"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R._Premadasa_International_Cricket_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "R.

Even last year, they were involved in a furious altercation against each other and other players had to separate them.\n\nUnsurprisingly, there were concerns that Gautam Gambhir and Virat Kohli might not get along. However, the former India teammates have allayed those fears in no time. Recently pictures of Gambhir and Kohli sharing a laugh with each other went viral. In the photo, Gambhir could be seen laughing uncontrollably after Kohli seemingly said something to him.\n\nAnd now another video has surfaced that shows everything is alright between the two. In the video that is going viral on social media, Gambhir and Kohli were involved in an intense discussion in the dressing room during the first ODI against Sri Lanka on Friday (August 2). Kohli was sitting with his pads, helmet, and gloves on and was listening to his new head coach.\n\nLast month, Gambhir had also opened up on his relationship with Kohli, saying that it was not public. The former India opener had stated that he shares a good relationship with Kohli.\n\n\"Good for TRP. My relationship is not public. It's a relationship between two mature individuals. On the field, I am sure we have got to be on the same page. I share a very good relationship with him,\" Gambhir had said in his first press conference as India head coach.\n\nTalking about the first ODI between India and Sri Lanka, the latter finished their innings on 230/8.

Kohli's last significant appearance was in the T20 World Cup final, where he scored a crucial 76 runs off 59 balls, helping India secure a narrow seven-run victory over South Africa. Following that tournament, Kohli and captain Rohit Sharma announced their retirement from T20 Internationals, creating space for fresh talent in the shorter format.\n\nThe first ODI of the series is set for August 2 in Colombo, marking Kohli's first ODI since the 2023 World Cup final, where India fell short. This series provides Kohli a chance to demonstrate his skill and form once again, as the team aims to regain its momentum.\n\nDuring a recent training session, Kohli's character shone brightly. After finishing his practice, he noticed a group of fans waiting eagerly for him. True to his approachable nature, he took the time to greet them. One fan, in particular, caught his attention with what Kohli initially thought was a gift. However, the fan simply wanted an autograph. He clarified that the photographs were meant for Kohli's signature, not a gift.\n\nThis small but heartfelt interaction underscores Kohli's genuine connection with his fans. Even with his fame, Kohli's willingness to personally engage with supporters highlights his respect and appreciation for their loyalty. This gesture not only strengthens his bond with his followers but also reflects his humility and gratitude.\n\nAs Kohli returns to ODI cricket, both fans and analysts will be watching closely. His experience and leadership are crucial for Team India as they face Sri Lanka. Meanwhile, this recent gesture is a touching reminder of the personal side of sports, showing that behind the competitive world of cricket, there's a real connection between players and their supporters.\n\nSEE ALSO: Paris Olympics 2024: Italian Boxer Refuses To Shake Hands With 'Biological Male' Imane Khelif After 46-Sec Loss", "source": {"uri": "in.mashable.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mashable India"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virat Kohli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Day_International", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "One Day International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_Men's_T20_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ICC Men's T20 World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lankan_cricket_team_in_Bangladesh_in_2017\u201318", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sri Lankan cricket team in Bangladesh in 2017\u201318"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rohit_Sharma", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rohit Sharma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20_International", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twenty20 International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_national_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India national cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombo", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Colombo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colombo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sri Lanka"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imane_Khelif", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Imane Khelif"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lanka", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sri Lanka"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sri Lanka"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://sm.mashable.com/mashable_in/seo/7/76962/76962_wj2e.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9785713", "eventUri": "eng-9785713", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-02", "textStart": 598, "textEnd": 606}], "sentiment": 0.4352941176470588, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

The match between the two teams is being played at the R Premadasa Stadium in Colombo on Sunday, August 4.\n\nVirat Kohli is known for doing some exceptional stuff on the field and he was fully charged up in the second ODI against Sri Lanka. The former India captain also showed the fun side of him when he pulled off a Bihu dance while looking at Riyan Parag to celebrate the wicket of Sadeera Samarawickrama.\n\nHowever, his best was witnessed in the last over of the innings. On the very last ball, Arshdeep Singh bowled a fullish-length delivery to the Sri Lankan player Jeffrey Vandersay, who drove it to mid-off and ran for a single.\n\nThe Indian fielder Rohit Sharma aimed at the stumps at the bowler's end but missed it. The ball went to Virat Kohli, who collected it and raced to the stumps with the ball to whip off the bails to run Akila Dananjaya out. The Sri Lankan player was back in the hut after scoring 15 runs off 13 balls, with 2 fours.\n\nNotably, many felt that the run-out pulled off by Virat Kohli was very similar to the one that the India great MS Dhoni pulled off against Bangladesh in 2016.\n\nIn the end, the hosts posted a great total on the board. They scored 240 for 9 with almost every batter chipping in with crucial runs.\n\nThe India National Cricket Team batting unit showcased a poor performance in the series-opening clash on Friday. Almost every batter of the visiting team got starts but no one of them managed to register a big score, which eventually cost India the game.\n\nIndia restricted Sri Lanka to 230/8 and it looked it they would comprehensively complete the run-chase. The confidence in the Indian dressing room grew further after Rohit Sharma played his natural attacking brand of cricket and took his team off to a flying start.\n\nThe Indian captain led from the front and smashed a terrific half-century. His opening partner Shubman Gill, however, was too slow and managed just 16 off 35.\n\nAfter the openers got out, many expected the strong Indian middle order to get the job. However, that didn't happen. Virat Kohli (24), Shreyas Iyer (23), and KL Rahul (31) - all of whom were returning to the side after a significant break - failed to score big.\n\nAxar Patel (33) and Shivam Dube (25) batted well from the lower order with the latter remaining in the middle till the very end. But, with India needing one run with more than 2 overs remaining, Dube and Arshdeep Singh got out on back-to-back deliveries, and the match got tied.", "source": {"uri": "cricketaddictor.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CricketAddictor"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virat Kohli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Day_International", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "One Day International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lanka", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sri Lanka"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sri Lanka"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lankan_cricket_team_in_Bangladesh_in_2017\u201318", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sri Lankan cricket team in Bangladesh in 2017\u201318"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Run out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fielding_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fielding (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sadeera_Samarawickrama", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sadeera Samarawickrama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R._Premadasa_International_Cricket_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "R.

When it comes to this limited-overs format, he is the third highest run-getter, with 13848 runs in 280 innings at an average of nearly 60, with a strike rate of 93.58, besides celebrating 72 half-centuries and 50 centuries, with the best score of 183-run knock.\n\nThere was a point of time in his career when he was struggling for runs, but he backed it up quite beautifully in recent times and looked to be in sharp touch going into the upcoming years, where he aims to break so many records in the 50-over format.\n\nWhen it comes to the most centuries in ODIs, Virat Kohli sits at the top of the ladder with 50 hundreds, the very recent of which came during the semifinal of the 2023 ODI World Cup 2023 against New Zealand at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai.\n\nAlso Read: \"F Ka Matlab

the fourth leading run-getter in international cricket, with 26884 runs in 530 games, at an average of 45.95 and a strike rate of nearly 70, with 140 fifties and 80 centuries, as he chased Sachin Tendulkar's rare record 100 centuries.\n\nDuring the pre-match show of the first ODI game between India and Sri Lanka, one of the fans used the 'X' handle to ask former Indian opening batter Robin Uthappa if Virat Kohli could get back to his top rank in ODI and Test cricket.\n\nThe best period for Kohli in international cricket was during the period between January 2016 and November 2019, when he nailed 10331 runs across formats in 180 innings, at an average of 71.2, besides celebrating 36 centuries and 43 half-centuries.\n\nThen he started to struggle in all forms of the game, which saw him collecting 2554 runs in 79 innings, at an average of 35.5, besides notching up only 24 fifties and going a century less.\n\nAlso Read: Irfan Pathan Tells Harbhajan Singh To Ignore Pakistani Fan

The virtual series decider between the teams is underway at the R Premadasa Stadium in Colombo.\n\nVirat Kohli didn't have a great outing with the bat in the ongoing game against Sri Lanka. The batter started pretty well with the bat as he slammed a few glorious boundaries, and it seemed that he would take the team home and play the special innings, having not made a mark in the first game.\n\nBut that wasn't the case, as Virat Kohli couldn't set the stage on fire yet again after having a start. The batter had a short stay at the crease, which was also marred by the massive controversy and saw the tempers of the Sri Lanka National Cricket Team players getting high.\n\nDuring the last ball of the 15th over, Akila Dananjaya bowled an off-break that pitched outside off and spun in to beat the inside edge of Virat Kohli. The batter tried to work it into the leg side off the back foot. He was quite deep in the crease and the ball spun a long way to hit the batter on the pads.\n\nUmpire raised his finger immediately but Virat Kohli was quick to go for DRS. The ultra edge showed a spike when the ball was close to the bat. There was enough evidence for TV umpire Wilson to overturn the on-field call. But the players of the Sri Lanka National Cricket Team were fuming at the decision of the umpire.\n\nKusal Mendis removed his helmet and threw it onto the ground in disappointment. Skipper Charith Asalanka was left dejected as he was seen fighting with umpire Raveendra Wimalasiri, arguing with the official over the decision of the third umpire.\n\nEven head coach Sanath Jayasuriya didn't look happy and came out from the dressing room and had a chat with the reserve umpire. The Sri Lankan players weren't amazed with the decision as they were left shocked.\n\nEven before the UltraEdge, there was a slight deviation as the ball passed the bat and then the technology showed the spike. The reaction from the Sri Lanka players was quite expected because even Virat Kohli wasn't confident about the edge.\n\nHowever, thankfully, the umpire's call didn't cost Sri Lanka much, as Jeffrey Vandersay then went on to remove Virat Kohli. The wrist spinner bowled a flipper to which the batter leaned forward to defend the ball but he missed it completely.\n\nThe Impact was in front of the middle stump, and the ball would have crashed into the leg stump at least. The batter scored 14 runs off 19 balls and slammed 2 fours in his innings. With his wicket, India was left tottering at 123/4.", "source": {"uri": "cricketaddictor.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CricketAddictor"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cricket bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virat Kohli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lanka", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sri Lanka"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sri Lanka"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lankan_cricket_team_in_Bangladesh_in_2017\u201318", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sri Lankan cricket team in Bangladesh in 2017\u201318"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R._Premadasa_International_Cricket_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "R.

After his net session, he noticed some fans who were waiting for him, so he decided to greet them before leaving for the dressing room.\n\nKohli thought that one fan got a gift for him, but on approaching he realized that the person just wanted an autograph. Feeling tricked, he grinned and said, \"Sign karu kya? Aapne bola mere liye hai, abhi aake bol rhe ho sign. (Should I sign? You said it was for me, now you are asking for a sign.)\"\n\nThen the fan said that he didn't trick Kohli, and the photographs were for him, while he wanted an autograph in exchange. In response, Kohli said, \"Oh, acha, acha (oh, okay).\"\n\nSpeaking ahead of the match, Rohit Sharma said, \"It's not a practice ground this (series), it's still an international game.

However, thanks to Gambhir (150*) and Virat Kohli's (107) centuries, India was able to achieve the target with 11 balls to spare. The 224-run stand between Gambhir and Kohli is still one of the highest partnerships ever formed between Indian batters in ODI cricket.\n\nThe Master Blaster's heroic knock in the first innings along with half-centuries from MS Dhoni and Yuvraj Singh carried India to a humongous total of 319/5 after 50 overs. In reply, the Indian bowlers were able to bowl out the Lankan Lions for 273 runs to win the match by 46 runs.

Dhawan (132*) and Kohli (82*) formed a brilliant 197-run stand to take India home in only 28.5 overs.\n\nAnother match where the Men in Blue proved to be too good for the Lankan Lions at their home.

Shubman Gill looks to continue Virat Kohli's ODI legacy - Inside Sport India", "body": "After 45 matches, Shubman Gill (2287) has scored more runs than Virat Kohli (1814) in ODIs. But can the Prince of Indian Cricket emulate King Kohli's greatness?\n\nFor almost 20 years, Sachin Tendulkar dominated all the batting charts. While his Test game was extraordinary, he was extremely consistent in the ODIs as well, gaining the peripheral title of 'God of Cricket'. Then came Virat Kohli, who has been synonymous with the 50-over format ever since his debut.\n\nIn fact, since 2009, he has been topping the run-scoring charts almost every year for India and took his game to such heights that the former Indian skipper was adjudged the Cricketer of the Decade (2010-2020). However, it looks like the 2-time ODI World Cup champions now have an heir to King Kohli, and that is none other than Shubman Gill.\n\nSince 2022, Shubman Gill has been lighting up the cricket world like a Diwali fireworks display. The young gun from Punjab has been consistently opening for India in ODIs, and boy, has he made the most of it. Despite his current okay-ish batting form, Gill has easily outscored everyone in the batting charts. No other batter has amassed more ODI runs than Gill's 2,238 in this period.\n\nGill's ascent to the top of the ODI batting charts has been nothing short of meteoric. In just two years, he's gone from \"promising talent\" to \"The Prince of Indian Cricket!\" When Gill is on song, there are hardly any better looking batter than him. Cricket lovers can watch him hit those sumptuous drives over and over again.\n\nBut it's not just about the quantity of runs - it's the way he's scoring them. Gill's batting is impeccably smooth and pleasing to eyes. He's got most of the shots in the book. Whether he's dancing down the track to spinners or effortlessly driving the quicks through the covers, Gill makes it look easier than anything.\n\nNow, let's address the elephant in the room - the Kohli comparison. For years, Virat Kohli has been the benchmark for ODI batting excellence. The man's records are more numerous than stars in the sky. But here's the kicker - Gill isn't just living up to those lofty standards; he's threatening to surpass them. Gill, who has played 45 ODIs thus far has scored 2,287 runs. In comparison to Kohli, Gill is miles ahead. In fact, by the time Kohli played his 45th innings, he was standing at 1,814 runs. This is a different matter than Kohli went on a 'God Mode' especially in the 2016-2018 period. If Gill can come close to that heroic stature is remained to be seen.", "source": {"uri": "insidesport.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "Inside Sport India"}, "authors": [{"uri": "naman_jain@insidesport.in", "name": "Naman Jain", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virat Kohli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Day_International", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "One Day International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shubman_Gill", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shubman Gill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_national_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "India national cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sachin_Tendulkar", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sachin Tendulkar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limited_overs_cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Limited overs cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Test cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cricket World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diwali", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Diwali"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab,_Pakistan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Punjab, Pakistan"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spin bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://d16f573ilcot6q.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/virat-shubman.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9785713", "eventUri": "eng-9785713", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 144, "relevance": 1}

Nehra's main disagreement is that Gambhir missed an opportunity to test new talent in this series.\n\n\"The next series India play is 2-3 months later, a rare thing for us. So for players like Rohit and Kohli...I feel there was a better chance of giving opportunities to other players during this series. I know Gambhir is a new coach, and he wants to spend some time with the experienced players, but it isn't like he doesn't know the two of them,\" Nehra said on Sony Sports Network.\n\nAlso read: Virat Kohli breaks into Bihu dance after grabbing Sadeera Samarawickrama's catch\n\nThe former bowler emphasized that the head coach who is familiar with Rohit and Kohli, didn't need to establish a rapport with them. Nehra feels the former opener is not a foreign coach and is not alien to the star duo.\n\n\"He is not a foreign coach who wants to get his equation right with Kohli and Rohit. So it was a good opportunity for him to try out the new players, and Rohit and Kohli could play when the home season begins. I'm not saying it is a wrong approach, but it could have been one of the strategies in this series,\" Nehra added\n\nHowever, Gambhir's decision to include the two seems to come from their recent retirement from T20Is and the limited ODI fixtures before the 2025 Champions Trophy. This series provides valuable match practice for experienced players in the 50-over format.\n\nAlso read: Rohit Sharma firm on keeping up aggressive batting approach\n\nThe results so far have been mixed. While Rohit has been in excellent form, scoring consecutive fifties, Kohli has struggled against Sri Lankan spinners. The team's performance has been inconsistent, with a tie in the first match and a 32-run defeat in the second, despite a strong start in the chase.

However, Virat Kohli's DRS decision in one of the LBW reviews grew heat among the host camp, where their head coach, Sanath Jayasuriya, wasn't satisfied with the decision.\n\nWinning the toss the home side decided to bat on a slow surface where they posted 240/9 in their allotted 50 overs, thanks to the vital 72-run partnership for the seventh wicket between Kamindu Mendis and Dunith Wellalage.\n\nIndia made a flying start thanks to the 97-run opening partnership between Rohit and Shubman Gill. The former took the aggressive route to nail the big and aggressive shots all around the park. But once they lost Gill at the team score of 116, the rest of the batting line-up fell without hardly any contribution from the middle order.\n\nVirat Kohli struggled in the first game of the series, where he wasn't able to read the ball from the spinners and was adjusted LBW while trying to punch the ball on the back foot.\n\nAlso Read: Virat Kohli Gets Angry At A Fan For His 'Chokli' Taunt In Front Of India Teammates; Watch Video\n\nOn the very second ball of the chase, the former Indian captain went back deep into the crease and pulled Jeffrey Vandersay through the midwicket region for a boundary. Akila Dhananjaya went short at him, to which the Delhi-born punched hard off the back foot to bet the long-on fielder to earn another boundary.\n\nAfter watching the delivery from a few angles, he checked for the ultra-edge, which showed a slight spike in the technique meant Kohli perhaps got a tiny little edge on the ball, which he wasn't aware of. The decision was reversed, as the confident-looking Sri Lankan players couldn't believe it. Captain Charith Asalanka had a slight interaction with the stand-in umpire as wicket-keeper Kushal Mendis threw his helmet into the ground.\n\nTheir head coach, Sanath Jayasuriya, didn't look satisfied and came down from the dressing room to have a chat with the fourth umpire regarding the decision. The camera at the end found Virat Kohli with a smile on his face.\n\nFour overs later, in between which the visiting side had already lost two more wickets, the 35-year-old was adjusted leg before the stumps on another occasion, this time against Vandersay. Kohli leaned forward to the flipper to defend but missed the delivery completely. The impact was in front of the middle stump and would have been crashed into the leg stump.\n\nAlso Read: Younis Khan Namedrops Virat Kohli, Urges To Keep Politics Away From Sports\n\nVirat Kohli made his way into the dressing room for his score of 14 off 19 balls.

The 35-year-old's Australian-like attitude has undoubtedly been one of the reason's for his stunning batting records, scoring more than 26 thousand international runs so far. Recently, Gautam Gambhir was appointed as the head coach of Indian men's cricket team and the two Delhi boys' fights in the past IPL's have been the talk of the town, more than his brawls with the Aussies.\n\nIn a candid chat during an interview, the clip of which is going viral on social media, Kohli is heard telling the interviewer \"mai kabhi ladai nahi karta kisi se (I never fight with anyone), physical to chance nahi. koi mujhe maar ke nikal jayega (never physically, somebody can hit me an leave)\".\n\nThe former India captain's comments were contrary to his aggressive body language on the field and when asked about it, the 2011 ODI World Cup winner smiled and said: \"Muh se kuchh bhi bulva lo, but mai physical ladai nahi karta (I can say things verbally but never get involved in a physical fight)\" Kohli added \"Even that (aggression) I do on the ground because i know it won't lead to a fight as the umpires would intervene.\"\n\nThe first major altercation between Kohli and Gambhir happened in 2013 during an IPL match. Kohli, who was leading Royal Challengers Bangalore at the time, got into an heated argument with the then Kolkata Knight Riders captain Gambhir after a fielding incident. The two Delhi boys had a heated exchange of words and even pushed each other before being separated by their teammates.\n\nCurrently Kohli and Gambhir are in Sri Lanka for a three match ODI series. The first match was a thrilling low-scoring encounter which ended in a draw. The second ODI at R. Premadasa stadium on Sunday is a crucial one in the context of the series. Kohli, who scored 24 runs in the first 50-over match, will be hoping to come up with a big show and help India take a 1-0 lead.", "source": {"uri": "newsable.asianetnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Asianet News Network Pvt Ltd"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virat Kohli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gautam_Gambhir", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gautam Gambhir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cricket World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challengers_Bangalore", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Royal Challengers Bangalore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolkata_Knight_Riders", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kolkata Knight Riders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umpire_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Umpire (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limited_overs_cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Limited overs cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Day_International", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "One Day International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lanka", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sri Lanka"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sri Lanka"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://static-ai.asianetnews.com/images/01j2r4qxaghj940mdqy6174mb5/virat-kohli-web-story.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9785713", "eventUri": "eng-9785713", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 139, "relevance": 1}

He said that even the batter knew that he hadn't hit the ball and it became the big issue.\n\nIndia batter Virat Kohli was the middle man in the controversy that unfolded in the second ODI against Sri Lanka National Cricket Team. The batter was adjudged LBW when he missed the flick against spinner Akila Dananjaya in the 15th over of the chase.\n\nVirat Kohli, however, was quick to take the DRS after a discussion with Gill. The ultra edge showed a spike when the ball was close to the bat, and the decision was overturned. There was clear daylight between bat and ball, and the Sri Lanka National Cricket Team players were fuming at the decision of the umpire as they couldn't believe what happened.\n\nHowever, thankfully, the umpire's call didn't cost Sri Lanka much, as Jeffrey Vandersay then went on to remove Virat Kohli. The India batter got out for 14 runs and after his wicket, the visitors quickly got all out for 208 runs to lose the game by 32 runs and go 1-0 down in the series.\n\nAakash Chopra while talking about Virat Kohli's controversial LBW, said that it was Akila Dananjaya's wicket. He also talked about the poor batting display of the batters, saying that players are struggling because they are no longer used to turning tracks. Speaking in a video posted on his YouTube channel, he explained:\n\n\"Kohli's dismissal was very interesting. The ball hit his back-pad and he reviewed immediately. But he also knew the ball hadn't hit the bat. But Ultra Edge said it had! It became a big issue because everyone felt it could have been Akila Dananjaya's wicket.\n\n\"Even if the opposition bowlers aren't of great quality, we are struggling. Do you know why? Because we are no longer used to these wickets. We play very well on flat tracks, even spin, better than most teams. We also bowl better spin on flatter tracks. But when the ball is turning, we fall on our knees.\"\n\nAakash Chopra further credited India skipper Rohit Sharma for his innings. He said that the opening batter proves that footwork is overrated and added that the captain is doing his job to perfection. He explained:\n\n\"Rohit has been batting well, hitting sixes while standing still. He has hit 302 sixes as an opener which is only behind Chris Gayle in ODIs. Sometimes he even shows that footwork is overrated... He's even doing it against spin.\n\n\"He has hit two half-centuries in consecutive matches so he's doing his job and scoring quickly so others can take their time.\"\n\nRohit Sharma scored 64 runs in the second ODI, and this was his second half-century in the series, having scored 57 in the first game.

But it has been anything but easy for Kohli.\n\nThe batter started things well enough but was bamboozled by Wanindu Hasaranga and had to walk back to the pavillion with just 24 to his name. Not the worst start to a series by any means, but Kohli would've expected more from him. It'd hurt even more by the time the match ended, with the game ending in a tie.\n\nWhen Hasaranga was ruled out of the series, Kohli might have thought that he'd no longer have a leg-spinner troubling him. What he didn't know was that another wrist spinner was waiting in the wings. Jeffrey Vandersay, who'd last played against Zimbabwe in January, was brought in as a like-for-like replacement.\n\nThe 34-year-old, who had just 22 ODI caps to his name, would start with Rohit Sharma's wicket and wouldn't stop until he had gotten the top six batters into the hut. A truly incredible feat. But it was Kohli's wicket that was the most important. The run-chase machine hardly if ever disappoints when batting second, and here he was getting dismissed by a leg-spinner for the second consecutive time while chasing a sub-par total.\n\nKohli averages a astonishing 70.4 against leg spin in ODIs and strikes at 102.4, so what went wrong? The simple answer would be rustiness. He hasn't played an ODI match since November 19, 2023. Naturally he'd need some time to find his form. In the past couple of years, his perform against spin has went down a little bit and the spin friendly pitches in Sri Lanka don't help either.\n\nBut an issue might be developing. Both times, he got out to a ball that wasn't a conventional leg spin. Hasaranga got him with a flipper, and Vandersay got him with a googly. Considering the slowness of the pitch, he definitely wasn't hurried and most probably failed to read the ball from the hand. One would hope that he's just scratchy and that his reflexes are as good as before.", "source": {"uri": "insidesport.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "Inside Sport India"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ansh_athani@insidesport.in", "name": "Ansh Athani", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virat Kohli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Day_International", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "One Day International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spin bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wanindu_Hasaranga", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wanindu Hasaranga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_Champions_Trophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ICC Champions Trophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gautam_Gambhir", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gautam Gambhir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Cricket_Council", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International Cricket Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leg_spin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Leg spin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leg_before_wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Leg before wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zimbabwean_cricket_team_in_Pakistan_in_2020\u201321", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Zimbabwean cricket team in Pakistan in 2020\u201321"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rohit_Sharma", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rohit Sharma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Vandersay", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jeffrey Vandersay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_pitch", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cricket pitch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Googly", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Googly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lanka", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sri Lanka"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sri Lanka"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://d16f573ilcot6q.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Virat-Kohli-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9785713", "eventUri": "eng-9785713", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2019-11-", "textStart": 1615, "textEnd": 1626}], "sentiment": -0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 137, "relevance": 1}

In a dramatic turn of events, Kohli successfully overturned an lbw decision against Akila Dananjaya, leading to a wave of disbelief and frustration among the Sri Lankan players.\n\nThe incident occurred in the 15th over of the chase when Dananjaya's well-pitched off-break spun in sharply, beating Kohli's inside edge as he attempted to work the ball into the leg side from the back foot. Initially adjudged lbw, Kohli opted for a review. The UltraEdge took a moment to load, eventually revealing a spike when the ball was close to the bat.\n\nThis was enough evidence for TV umpire Joel Wilson to overturn the on-field decision, much to Kohli's satisfaction, who smiled as the call was reversed.\n\nThe decision, however, did not sit well with the Sri Lankan team. Wicketkeeper Kusal Mendis, in a display of frustration, removed his helmet and threw it to the ground, while Asalanka voiced his displeasure to umpire Raveendra Wimalasiri.\n\nEven Sri Lankan coach Sanath Jayasuriya descended from the dressing room to discuss the decision with the reserve umpire. The Sri Lankan players continued to debate the decision-making process, clearly unsettled by the reversal that allowed Kohli to continue his innings.\n\nHowever, Kohli couldn't make the most of the reprieve, as he was dismissed four overs later when Jeffrey Vandersay - the spinner who replaced the injured Wanindu Hasaranga after the first ODI - outfoxed the batting stalwart. He bowled a flipper, and while Kohli leaned forward to defend, he missed the ball with the impact in front of the middle stump.\n\nThe Indian batter did walk up to his partner, Axar Patel, to discuss whether it warranted a review, who wasn't too keen.\n\nVandersay troubled the Indian batters since he was introduced into the attack, dismissing the dangerous Rohit Sharma on 64 before removing his deputy, Shubman Gill on 35. The spinner, then, outfoxed Shivam Dube with a delivery that spun sharply into the left-hander before dismissing Kohli.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virat Kohli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leg_before_wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Leg before wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lanka", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sri Lanka"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sri Lanka"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akila_Dananjaya", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Akila Dananjaya"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_national_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India national cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off_spin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Off spin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Day_International", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "One Day International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kusal_Mendis", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kusal Mendis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanath_Jayasuriya", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sanath Jayasuriya"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Wilson_(umpire)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joel Wilson (umpire)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_umpire", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Third umpire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cricket bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umpire_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Umpire (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket-keeper", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wicket-keeper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lanka_national_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sri Lanka national cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wanindu_Hasaranga", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wanindu Hasaranga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shivam_Dube", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shivam Dube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axar_Patel", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Axar Patel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rohit_Sharma", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rohit Sharma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowled", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bowled"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Vandersay", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jeffrey Vandersay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_umpire", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fourth umpire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spin bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stump_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stump (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shubman_Gill", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shubman Gill"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://images.hindustantimes.com/img/2024/08/04/1600x900/kohli_lbw_1722785650248_1722785670466.jfif", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9785713", "eventUri": "eng-9785713", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 133, "relevance": 1}

But what happens if the team trails after the first few games and is pushed into a do-or-die situation? Will testing the bench strength still be a priority? The Indian team will be facing a similar dilemma on Tuesday when they gear up to take on Sri Lanka in the last and final ODI match of the series in Colombo after the home team held the visitors to a tie in the opener and won by 32 runs in the second game to push India into a must-win situation.\n\nIndia did not change their playing XI for the second game, meaning the likes of Rishabh Pant, Khaleel Ahmed, Riyan Parag, and Harshit Rana are yet to make an appearance in the series. Should they make the playing XI for the third match, Harshit and Riyan will be making their ODI debuts. On the other hand, Pant awaits his first game in the format since December 2022, while for Khaleel, he has been absent from ODIs since 2019.\n\nOn Sunday, after the end of the second ODI match, former India fast bowler Ashish Nehra was asked on Sony Sports whether he does see new head coach Gautam Gambhir making any changes to the playing XI. While he did not get into specifics, he reckoned that the former India World Cup-winner got his strategy wrong by getting the likes of Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli play in the series, when the approach should have been focusing on the fresh faces. He felt the two experienced batters were not required for the contest and could have rather prolonged their break to resumed at the start of the home season in September.\n\n\"The next series India play is 2-3 months later, a rare thing for us. So for players like Rohit and Kohli...I feel there was a better chance of giving opportunities to other players during this series. I know Gambhir is a new coach, and he wants to spend some time with the experienced players, but it isn't like he doesn't know the two of them. He is not a foreign coach who wants to get his equation right with Kohli and Rohit. So it was a good opportunity for him to try out the new players, and Rohit and Kohli could play when the home season begins. I'm not saying it is a wrong approach, but it could have been one of the strategies in this series,\" he said.\n\nKohli and Rohit were reportedly set to extend their break from cricket after the T20 World Cup, but on Gambhir's insistence, the two cut short their break and arrived in Colombo for the ODI series.\n\nThe move only seemed logical from Gambhir's point of view, who wanted to get a better view of the possible line-up India could have for the Champions Trophy next year given that the team will only play one other series in the format, in February 2025, against England at home.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Day_International", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "One Day International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rohit_Sharma", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rohit Sharma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_national_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India national cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Virat Kohli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lanka", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sri Lanka"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sri Lanka"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rishabh_Pant", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rishabh Pant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashish_Nehra", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ashish Nehra"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gautam_Gambhir", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gautam Gambhir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fast bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khaleel_Ahmed", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Khaleel Ahmed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riyan_Parag", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Riyan Parag"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombo", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Colombo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colombo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sri Lanka"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_Men's_T20_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ICC Men's T20 World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_Champions_Trophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ICC Champions Trophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "England cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cricket"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Players", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Players", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://images.hindustantimes.com/img/2024/08/05/1600x900/gambhir_ro_ko_sl_1722834828572_1722834834966.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9785713", "eventUri": "eng-9785713", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3411764705882352, "wgt": 124, "relevance": 1}

Rohit attained the milestone in the first ODI versus Sri Lanka in Colombo. He ended up scoring 58 off 47 balls with the help of seven fours and three sixes. Here we look at the Indian batters with 1,000 or more ODI fours.\n\nThe highest run-getter in ODI history, Sachin Tendulkar is the only batter with over 1,600 fours in the format (2,016). He also clobbered a total of 195 sixes. The Master Blaster played 463 games in his illustrious ODI career, accumulating a total of 18,426 runs at an average of 44.83. He went on to register 49 hundreds and 96 fifties (200: 1).\n\nHaving played 293 games, Virat Kohli has smashed 1,296 fours as he also owns 151 sixes. Kohli is the third-highest run-scorer in ODI cricket, having slammed 13,872 runs. His average of 58.53 is the best among batters with at least 2,500 runs. Kohli also owns 72 half-centuries in ODI cricket besides 50 tons. No other player owns more ODI hundreds.\n\nVirender Sehwag, who is credited to have redefined the opener's role, showed his prowess in 251 ODI matches. He scored 8,273 runs at 35.05 with the help of 15 tons and 38 fifties. His strike rate reads a sensational 104.33. Meanwhile, the former opener hammered 1,132 fours in his celebrated ODI career. He also cleared the fence 136 times.\n\nFormer Indian skipper Sourav Ganguly is next on this list, having tallied 1,122 fours (190 sixes). The batting genius went on to amass 11,363 runs from 311 ODIs at 41.02. The tally includes 22 tons and 72 fifties. Ganguly's 183 in the 1999 Cricket World Cup is still the highest score by an Indian at the biggest stage.\n\nRohit is the latest entrant on this list as he has smashed 1,001 fours. His tally of 326 ODI sixes is the third-most for any batter. Having played 263 ODI matches, the veteran opener has completed 10,767 runs at an average of 49.16. He owns 31 tons and 56 fifties.

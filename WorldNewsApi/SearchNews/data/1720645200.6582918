All four captives are in good medical condition and have been taken to Sheba Tel-HaShomer Medical Center in Tel Aviv for further examination, he said. Mr. Hagari said they will soon be reunited with their loved ones after 246 days in Hamas captivity. The military spokesman noted that all four had been \u201cbrutally kidnapped\u201d from the Nova Musical Festival in southern Israel during the attack by Hamas-led terrorists on Oct. 7 that sparked the ongoing war. Israeli forces relied on \u201cprecise intelligence\u201d to carry out the rescue operation conducted in daylight at about 11 a.m. local time in two separate buildings, he said. \u201cWhile under fire inside the buildings, under fire on the way out from Gaza, our forces rescued our hostages,\u201d Mr. Hagari said, adding that one Israeli special forces soldier was \u201ccritically wounded\u201d during the operation. Saturday\u2019s rescue operation is the largest recovery effort of living captives since the war started. A total of seven people have been rescued by Israeli forces so far. \u201cNoa, Shlomi, Almog, and Andrey\u2014welcome back home. With God\u2019s help and thanks to our fighters, we will return all our abductees,\u201d Mr. Netanyahu wrote in the caption of the post. Ms. Argamani had been one of the most widely recognized hostages after being abducted from the music festival. A video of her abduction was among the first to surface, showing her between two men on a motorcycle as she screamed, \u201cDon\u2019t kill me!\u201d Hamas took some 250 hostages during the Oct. 7, 2023, attack that killed more than 1,200 people. Israel believes that about 120 of them are still being held in the Palestinian enclave, while at least 43 have been pronounced dead by authorities. Survivors include about 15 women, two children under the age of 5, and two men in their 80s. The latest rescue operation occurred amid pressure from the Biden administration for the Israeli government to accept a proposed three-part deal for a cease-fire in exchange for Hamas releasing the remainder of the hostages. President Joe Biden, currently in France for a state visit that included talks about the Middle East, celebrated the return of the hostages at a news conference with French President Emmanuel Macron. \u201cWe won\u2019t stop working until all the hostages come home and a cease-fire is reached,\u201d the president said.", "summary": "The rescued individuals have been identified as Noa Argamani, 25, Almog Meir Jan, 21, Andrey Kozlov, 27, and Shlomi Ziv, 40.", "url": "https://www.theepochtimes.com/world/israel-rescues-4-hostages-in-gaza-in-largest-recovery-operation-since-oct-7-post-5665106", "image": "https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/06/08/id5665108-Israel-Rescue-300x180.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 17:34:16", "author": "Lorenz Duchamps", "authors": ["Lorenz Duchamps"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.248}

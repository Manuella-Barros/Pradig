Investigators said Kingston and Turner then kept over $1 million worth of fraudulently purchased items despite not paying for them.\n\nThe warrants for the state charges say that from October to March, they stole almost $500,000 in jewelry, more than $200,000 from Bank of America, $160,000 from a Cadilac Escalade dealer, more than $100,000 from First Republic Bank and $86,000 from the maker of customized beds.\n\nThe Jamaican American performer had a No. 1 hit with \"Beautiful Girls\" in 2007 and collaborated with Justin Bieber on the song \"Eenie Meenie.\"\n\nRobert Rosenblatt, an attorney for Kingston and his mother, didn't immediately respond to a message seeking comment from The Associated Press. He previously said they looked forward to addressing the charges and were \"confident of a successful resolution.\"\n\nKingston, whose legal name is Kisean Anderson, was already serving a two-year probation sentence for trafficking stolen property.\n\nHis mother pleaded guilty in 2006 to bank fraud for stealing over $160,000 and served nearly 1.5 years in prison, according to federal court records.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

If convicted, they could spend decades in prison.\n\nThe 34-year-old Jamaican-born Kingston, whose real name is Kisean Anderson, and his 61-year-old mother Janice Turner, were charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud and wire fraud charges stemming from their involvement in a scheme to defraud sellers of high-end specialty vehicles, jewelry, and other goods purchased through the use of fraudulent documents, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida said in a press release.\n\nKingston and Turner each face one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and five counts of wire fraud.\n\nIf convicted, both face up to 20 years in prison on each count.\n\nThe U.S. Attorney's Office said that Kingston and his mother \"unjustly enriched themselves by falsely representing that they had executed bank wire or other monetary payment transfers as payment for vehicles, jewelry, and other goods purchased.\"\n\nWhen federal authorities checked the veracity of the money transfers, they found that \"no such bank wire or other monetary payment transfers had been executed by the purported banks.\"\n\nIn total, Kinston and his mother kept over $1 million in assets that they didn't fully pay for, the U.S. Attorney's Office said.\n\nIn May, Kingston and his mother were charged with conducting an organized scheme to defraud, grand theft, identity theft, and related crimes, according to arrest warrants released by the Broward Sheriff's Office.\n\nKingston was arrested May 23 at Fort Irwin, an Army training base in California's Mojave Desert where he was performing. He waived his right to fight the extradition and was returned to Florida.\n\nTurner was also taken into custody that same day, when police raided a South Florida mansion her son had been renting.\n\nThe warrants in the case said that from October 2023 to March of this year they stole almost $500,000 in jewelry, more than $200,000 from Bank of America, $160,000 from an Escalade dealer, more than $100,000 from First Republic Bank and $86,000 from the maker of customized beds. Specifics were not given.\n\nAt the time of his arrest, Kingston was on two years' probation for trafficking stolen property.\n\nTurner pleaded guilty in 2006 to bank fraud for stealing over $160,000 and served nearly 1 1/2 years in prison, according to federal court records.\n\nThe Jamaican American performer had a No. 1 hit with \"Beautiful Girls\" in 2007 and collaborated with Justin Bieber on the song \"Eenie Meenie.\"\n\nBob Rosenblatt, an attorney for the singer and his mom, said in early June that his client committed no crime.\n\n\"Well, I don't know who is claiming they owe money. You know, we were aware of the watches, we are aware of the TV issue,\" Rosenblatt said. \"If there are other issues I'm not sure about... It's a breach of contract. There's no fraud here. There's no organized fraud at all.\"\n\nRosenblatt planned to file a not-guilty plea and ask for a jury trial. Kingston's attorney said at the time that he was \"very confident\" that the singer would get the charges against him dismissed.", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS

Investigators said Kingston and Turner then kept over US$1 million worth of fraudulently purchased items despite not paying for them.\n\nThe warrants for the state charges say that from October to March, they stole almost US$500,000 in jewellery, more than US$200,000 from Bank of America, US$160,000 from a Cadilac Escalade dealer, more than US$100,000 from First Republic Bank and US$86,000 from the maker of customised beds.\n\nThe Jamaican American performer had a No 1 hit with Beautiful Girls in 2007 and collaborated with Justin Bieber on the song Eenie Meenie.\n\nRobert Rosenblatt, an attorney for Kingston and his mother, didn't immediately respond to a message seeking comment from The Associated Press. He previously said they looked forward to addressing the charges and were \"confident of a successful resolution.\"\n\nKingston, whose legal name is Kisean Anderson, was already serving a two-year probation sentence for trafficking stolen property.", "source": {"uri": "cnalifestyle.channelnewsasia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNA Lifestyle"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

If convicted, both face decades in prison.\n\nThe Jamaican-born Kingston, whose real name is Kisean Anderson, 34, and his mother, 61, who live in Southwest Ranches were charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud and wire fraud charges stemming from their involvement in a scheme to defraud victim sellers of high-end specialty vehicles, jewelry, and other goods purchased by the defendants through the use of fraudulent documents.\n\nAnderson and Turner each face one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and five counts of wire fraud.\n\nIf convicted, both face up to 20 years in prison on each count.\n\n\"According to allegations in the indictment, the defendants unjustly enriched themselves by falsely representing that they had executed bank wire or other monetary payment transfers as payment for vehicles, jewelry, and other goods purchased by the defendants, when in fact no such bank wire or other monetary payment transfers had been executed by the purported banks, and thereafter the defendants retained or attempted to retain the vehicles, jewelry and other goods despite non-payment. Through the execution of this scheme, the defendants obtained in excess of $1 million in property,\" officials said.\n\nBob Rosenblatt, an attorney for the singer and his mom, had earlier said, \"Whatever the circumstance,\" his client committed no crime. \"Well, I don't know who is claiming they owe money. You know, we were aware of the watches, we are aware of the TV issue.\"\n\n\"If there are other issues I'm not sure about... It's a breach of contract. There's no fraud here. There's no organized fraud at all.\"\n\nRosenblatt plans to file a not-guilty plea and ask for a jury trial and when CBS News Miami asked, \"How confident is he in getting these charges dismissed?\" He told us, \"very confident.\"\n\nKingston and his mom have been charged with conducting an organized scheme to defraud, grand theft, identity theft, and related crimes, according to arrest warrants released by the Broward Sheriff's Office.\n\nKingston was arrested in May at Fort Irwin, an Army training base in California's Mojave Desert where he was performing. He waived his right to fight the extradition.\n\nOn the same day of his arrest, Turner was taken into custody when police raided a Southwest Ranches mansion he had been renting.\n\nThough it's been years since Kingston had a hit, fans who knew him said Kingston had a concert at Florida State University that was packed.\n\n\"When I was growing up, he was on the Disney channel. I've always been a fan of his,\" said Laura, a fan.\n\nThe warrants in the case say that from October to March they stole almost $500,000 in jewelry, more than $200,000 from Bank of America, $160,000 from the Escalade dealer, more than $100,000 from First Republic Bank, $86,000 from the maker of customized beds. Specifics were not given.\n\nAt the time of his arrest, Kingston was on two years' probation for trafficking stolen property.\n\nTurner is facing eight counts of fraud and theft. Kingston is facing the same charges plus a probation violation.\n\nHis mother pleaded guilty in 2006 to bank fraud for stealing over $160,000 and served nearly 1.5 years in prison, according to federal court records.\n\nThe Jamaican American performer had a No. 1 hit with \"Beautiful Girls\" in 2007 and collaborated with Justin Bieber on the song \"Eenie Meenie.\"\n\n___", "source": {"uri":

The two were each formally charged by a Miami grand jury with five counts of wire fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, the U.S. Attorney's Office said on Friday. Each count carries a potential sentence of 20 years in prison.\n\nKingston, whose real name is Kiesean Anderson, is a Jamaican-American music artist who was born in Miami. He is known for his May 2007 song \"Beautiful Girls\", which became a summer anthem, staying at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 for three weeks.\n\nCelebrity news: Who is Kai Trump? What we know about Trump's oldest grandchild who lives in Florida\n\nKingston, his mother fraudulently obtained more then $1 million worth of property, authorities allege\n\nAccording to allegations in the indictment, the mother and son unjustly enriched themselves by falsely representing that they had executed bank wire or other monetary payment transfers as payment for vehicles, jewelry, and other goods purchased by the defendants, when in fact no such bank wire or other monetary payment transfers occurred.\n\nKingston and Turner either retained or attempted to retain vehicles, jewelry and other goods despite non-payment. Through the execution of this scheme, they obtained in excess of $1 million in property, federal prosecutors said.\n\nIn May, a SWAT team raided the home that Kingston rents in a neighborhood within the South Florida town of Southwest Ranches that is home to several rich families and celebrities. They arrested Turner there. Kingston himself was taken into custody in California, where he was at the time.\n\n\"People love negative energy!\" Kingston briefly posted on his Instagram following his arrest. \"I am good, and so is my mother! ...

If convicted, both face up to 20 years in prison for each of the six charged counts.\n\nThe 34-year-old entertainer, born Kisean Anderson, appeared in court alongside his 61-year-old mother after their arrest in May. They are charged with one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and five counts of wire fraud related to their involvement in a scheme to defraud sellers of high-end specialty vehicles, jewelry, and other goods using fraudulent documents.\n\nThe United States Attorney's Office of the Southern District of Florida stated that the defendants \"unjustly enriched themselves by falsely representing that they had executed bank wire or other monetary payment transfers.\"\n\nAccording to the office, the alleged scheme involved making payments through banks that never actually went through, resulting in the accrual of over $1 million in property.\n\nKingston was initially arrested in California on May 24 on theft charges following a SWAT raid of his South Florida mansion. His mother was arrested during the raid of his lavish Fort Lauderdale suburb home, and Kingston was taken into custody a few hours later without incident.\n\nThe raids were conducted following a lawsuit filed against Kingston for allegedly not paying for luxury items. Meanwhile, Turner has faced legal issues in the past over false loan applications and bank fraud.\n\nKingston is best known for his 2007 No. 1 hit song \"Beautiful Girls\" and collaborations with Justin Bieber. An attorney for the individual suing Kingston over the unpaid items noted that Kingston uses \"basically a script, he says that he works with Justin Bieber, and obviously puts on a big show here. This is a rental house; he doesn't own it, and he lures people using his celebrity into having them release things without him paying for it and then he simply never pays.\"", "source": {"uri": "caribbeannationalweekly.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Caribbean News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sheri_kae_mcleod@caribbeannationalweekly.com", "name": "Sheri-kae McLeod", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Kingston", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sean Kingston"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mail_and_wire_fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mail and wire fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_conspiracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Criminal conspiracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turner_Broadcasting_System", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Turner Broadcasting System"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_district_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States district court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indictment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingston,_Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kingston, Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kingston, Jamaica"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_District_Court_for_the_Southern_District_of_Florida", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theft", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Theft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beautiful_Girls_(Sean_Kingston_song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Beautiful Girls (Sean Kingston song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bank fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Florida", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South Florida"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SWAT", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "SWAT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Bieber", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Justin Bieber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Lauderdale,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fort Lauderdale, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Fort Lauderdale, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prisons", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prisons", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 48}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 48}], "image": "https://www.caribbeannationalweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/sean-kingston.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9748240", "eventUri": "eng-9748240", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-24", "textStart": 1075, "textEnd": 1081}], "sentiment": -0.2862745098039216, "wgt": 207, "relevance": 1}

I am good and so is my mother!\n\n'My lawyers are handling everything as we speak.'\n\nBorn in Miami, Kingston shot to fame after releasing his debut single, Beautiful Girls, in 2007, which peaked at the top of the Billboard Hot 100 chart.\n\nHe is also known for the top 20 follow-up single Eenie Meenie, featuring Justin Bieber.\n\nKingston has won several accolades throughout his career,

California back in May, the same day Turner was arrested during a raid on the Southwest Ranches mansion where the singer lives.\n\nArrest warrants said that from October 2023 to March of this year, Kingston, Turner and others defrauded multiple businesses, including a jeweler, a luxury furniture maker, a high-end auto dealer and a company that specializes in TV and entertainment systems.\n\nProsecutors said they purchased the items using fraudulent documents including bank wires and payment transfers, then kept or tried to keep the items despite not paying.\n\nIn one instance, Kingston allegedly fraudulently obtained a bed valued at more than $86,000 from a company named Maree, whose website said it \"designs and creates the world's largest luxury beds.\"\n\nIn another, a Cadillac Escalade valued at $159,701.49 was fraudulently obtained from an exotic car dealership, the warrants said.\n\nAlso fraudulently obtained was jewelry valued at $480,000, the warrants said.\n\nThe total value of the items obtained exceeded $1 million, prosecutors said.\n\nAfter their arrests, Robert Rosenblatt, an attorney representing the rapper and his mother, said, \"Sean and Janice deny their guilt and we look forward to trying this case before a jury in Broward County.\"\n\nKingston had some major hits including his 2007 debut single \"Beautiful Girls.\" He's

If convicted, both face up to 20 years in prison for each of the six charged counts.\n\nThe 34-year-old singer, born Kisean Anderson, appeared in court with his 61-year-old mother Janice Turner after their arrest in May. Today, they were charged with one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and five counts of wire fraud charges from their involvement in a scheme to defraud victim sellers of high-end specialty vehicles, jewelry and other goods purchased via fraudulent documents.\n\nThe United States Attorney's Office of the Southern District of Florida stated that the defendants \"unjustly enriched themselves by falsely representing that they had executed bank wire or other monetary payment transfers.\" According to the Office, the alleged scheme involved making payments through banks that never actually went through, resulting in them accruing an excess of $1 million in property.\n\nKingston was initially arrested in California on May 24 on theft charges following a SWAT raid of his South Florida mansion and the arrest of his mother. The arrest came without incident a few hours after his mother's arrest during the raid of his lavish Fort Lauderdale suburb home.\n\nThe raids were conducted following a lawsuit filed against Kingston for allegedly not paying for luxury items. Meanwhile, his mother has been embroiled in legal issues in the past over false loan applications and bank fraud.\n\nKingston is best known for his 2007 No. 1 hit song \"Beautiful Girls\" as well as collaborations with Justin Bieber. An attorney for the individual who is suing Kingston over the unpaid items noted that Kingston \"basically a script, he says that he works with Justin Bieber, and obviously puts on a big show here, this is a rental house, he doesn't own it, and he lures people using his celebrity into having them release things without him paying for it and then he simply never pays.\"", "source": {"uri": "variety.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Variety"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Kingston", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sean Kingston"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mail_and_wire_fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mail and wire fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donda", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conspiracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turner_Broadcasting_System", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Turner Broadcasting System"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_district_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States district court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indictment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanye_West", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kanye West"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingston,_Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kingston, Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kingston, Jamaica"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_District_Court_for_the_Southern_District_of_Florida", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beautiful_Girls_(Sean_Kingston_song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Beautiful Girls (Sean Kingston song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bank fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Florida", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South Florida"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SWAT", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "SWAT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theft", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Theft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Bieber", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Justin Bieber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Lauderdale,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fort Lauderdale, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Fort Lauderdale, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prisons", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prisons", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 58}], "image": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-171907452-e1721426158314.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9748240", "eventUri": "eng-9748240", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-24", "textStart": 1171, "textEnd": 1177}], "sentiment": -0.4274509803921569, "wgt": 195, "relevance": 1}

They were both released only a few days after their arrests, but now, they're facing federal charges.\n\nAccording to TMZ, a Grand Jury in Miami indicted Kingston and his mother today. They were hit with multiple charges including one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and five counts of wire fraud. They're both accused of scamming various businesses out of goods like jewelry, luxury vehicles, and more. Allegedly, they racked up over $1 million worth of property without paying anything for it.\n\nRead More: Sean Kingston Breaks His Silence After Being Released On Bond\n\nThe outlet also notes that if convicted, the two of them might be looking at some serious time behind bars. Reportedly, each count could earn them a maximum sentence of 20 years, and they're facing six each. Despite this, Kingston's lawyer Robert Rosenblatt appears confident and reportedly looks forward to battling things out in court. The news comes just over a month after Kingston was released on a $100K bond.

The rapper and his mom, Janice Turner, are now facing federal charges. Authorities arrested the mother-duo son in May after they raided Kingston's home as part of a criminal investigation.\n\nNow, months later, Kingston and Turner were each charged with one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and five counts of wire fraud. A grand jury in Miami indicted the family duo and announced the charges on Friday. Federal prosecutors accused the pair of spearheading a fraudulent scheme where they swindled businesses out of valuables. Kingston and his mother allegedly acquired jewelry, luxury vehicles, and more by falsifying money transfer processes. They then kept the goods even when informed that the payment never went through.\n\nThe deceptive ploy allowed the twosome to gain personal property worth more than $1 million. The pair's amassed valuables include Jewelry pieces worth $480,000 and a $160,000 Cadillac Escalade. TMZ reports that if Kingston and Janice are found guilty, they will face a maximum of 20 years per count.\n\nThe Reason Behind Sean Kingston's Florida Home Raid\n\nKingston's life began unfolding in late May when men of the Broward Sheriff's Office stormed his home in Southwest Ranches, Florida. The team of SWAT police officers, detectives, and deputies executed a search warrant. They arrested his mother on \"numerous fraud and theft charges.\" A day later, authorities ambushed the Beautiful Girls singer in Fort Irwin, California, after a performance.

The accusations center on a scheme in which the pair allegedly defrauded sellers of high-end vehicles, jewelry, and other luxury items using fake documentation.\n\nAccording to the indictment, Mr. Anderson and Ms. Turner deceived sellers by falsely claiming to have sent bank wires or other monetary transfers as payment for their purchases. In reality, no payments were made, but the duo allegedly attempted to keep the vehicles, jewelry, and other goods despite not having paid for them. This fraudulent activity allegedly netted them over $1 million worth of property.\n\nConviction on these charges could result in each defendant serving up to 20 years in prison for each count.\n\nIn May, Mr. Anderson was arrested during a performance near Fort Irwin National Training Center. Before his arrest, the Broward County Sheriff's Office raided his luxury rental property in Southwest Ranches, and his mother was also arrested.\n\nThe indictment is related to a lawsuit filed by Ver Entertainment LLC. Attorney Dennis Card represents Ver Entertainment and alleges that Mr. Anderson never paid for luxury items, including a 232-inch TV and premium sound system. Additionally, Ms. Turner is also involved in a separate civil lawsuit seeking $100,000 in unpaid rent for a different Florida home, although it's unclear if her arrest is directly related to that particular lawsuit.\n\nThe \"Beautiful Girls\" singer has a history of similar allegations. In December 2020, Mr. Anderson faced grand theft charges for unpaid jewelry bills, and in 2018, a judge ordered him to pay $301,500 to a New York City jewelry store for unpaid items and bounced checks.\n\nThe Broward County Sheriff's Office plans to continue its investigation at Mr. Anderson's rental home.\n\nMr. Anderson was already serving a two-year probation sentence for trafficking stolen property. His mother previously pleaded guilty in 2006 to bank fraud and served nearly 1.5 years in prison.\n\nThe Epoch Times contacted Mr. Anderson's legal team for a statement.\n\nThe announcement was made by U.S. Attorney Markenzy Lapointe for the Southern District of Florida, alongside Special Agent in Charge Rafael Barros of the U.S. Secret Service's Miami Field Office, and Broward Sheriff Gregory Tony. The investigation was conducted by the U.S. Secret Service and the Broward County Sheriff's Office, with the case being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Marc Anton and Trevor Jones.", "source":

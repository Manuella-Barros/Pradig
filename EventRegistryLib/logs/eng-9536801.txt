Here's what happened when a few Lancaster County restaurants tried adding service charges\n\nGuests will sometimes wait for an hour at Gracie's on West Main in Upper Leacock Township just because they specifically want to be served by Deanna Coker. With a dedicated following of 30 or so regulars, she is, in the words of her bosses, a professional.\n\nYet, until recently, in a decade of working full-time as a restaurant server Coker never got a paid day off or had health insurance. Most restaurant employees don't.\n\nWhen Gracie's on West Main added a service fee, it boosted worker pay and added some benefits. Coker still relies on tips, but she has paid days off, money towards health care and a retirement savings plan to which the restaurant contributes.\n\nLocal Business\n\nHere's what happened when a few Lancaster County restaurants tried adding service charges\n\nLISA SCHEID | Business Trends Reporter\n\n4.

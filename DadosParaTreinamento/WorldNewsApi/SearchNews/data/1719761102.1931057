{"id": 225046280, "title": "High-waisted jeans that are as comfortable as they are fashionable", "text": "High-waisted jeans are one of the few silhouettes with a universally flattering fit. Nevertheless, even if you find the pair of your dreams, they\u2019ll collect dust on the hanger if they\u2019re uncomfortable. To get a pair of high-waisted jeans that are as comfortable as they are fashionable, find a pair with added elastane, Lycra or spandex. They\u2019ll look and feel great from the first time you put them on. You should also pick your size by comparing your measurements to the manufacturer\u2019s sizing chart because sizing differs by brand. What makes high-waisted jeans comfortable? High-waisted jeans have a rise that ranges from 9.5 to 10.5 inches, and the rise on ultra-high-waisted jeans is 11 inches or higher. They can have any silhouette, inseam length and wash. The most comfortable pairs have stretch, aren\u2019t too tight and don\u2019t ride up at the groin or backside. They should also be well-made with pre-washed material that won\u2019t shrink after you launder them. Styles of high-waisted jeans High-waisted jeans are commonly found in five primary styles. function dfm_stn_player_script_id_g7yNjOE5( getS2NApiForPlayer ) { if( typeof window.MNGAuthentication !== \u2018undefined\u2019 ){ const s2nApi = getS2NApiForPlayer( document.querySelector(\u2018.k-g7yNjOE5\u2019) ); s2nApi.float = ! window.MNGAuthentication.isUserSubscriber(); } } Mom: This has a tapered waist, loose fit and tapered ankle.

Inseams on high-waisted jeans Inseam classifications base lengths on averages, and it\u2019s common for each to land differently on everyone. For example, ankle-length jeans might fit like a full-length design on you if you have a long torso. Therefore, using your inseam measurements to guide your selection is best. There are four general length classifications to consider for your high-waisted jeans. cnxps.cmd.push( function() { cnxps( { playerId: \u20182628d265-2e02-4ab5-9092-d579a5ae32b7\u2019, settings: { playbackMode: cnxps.configEnums.PlaybackModeEnum.AutoPlay, defaultSoundMode: cnxps.configEnums.DefaultSoundModeEnum.Off, customization: { closeButtonMode: cnxps.configEnums.CloseButtonModeEnum.On }, rendering: { scrollHijackingProtection: true } } } ).render( \u20186ee34222ee36449785dd166ae88c4223\u2019, ( renderError, playspaceApi ) => { if ( undefined !== renderError ) { console.error( \u2018DFM CNXPS Player \u2013 Render Error!\u2019, renderError ); return; } console.log( \u2018DFM CNXPS Player \u2013 Successfully rendered player!\u2019, playspaceApi.getStoryMetadata() ); } ); } ); Cropped: This style is 26 inches or shorter. Ankle length: This fit measures around 27 to 29 inches. Full-length: This is 30 to 31 inches long. Tall: This is 32 inches or longer. How to find your measurements Have a cloth measuring tape, pencil and paper ready. Once found, use your measurements to guide your size selection, as sizing charts vary by brand. There are four steps to recording your most accurate measurements. Waist: Find the narrowest part of your midsection, typically around your navel, and measure its circumference. Hips: Stand with your feet hip-width apart, then find the fullest part of your backside and measure its circumference. Rise: Measure from the center of your crotch toward your navel or the point you wish to have your waistband land. Inseam: Start at the highest point of your inner thigh and bring the measuring tape to the bottom of your ankle. What are the best high-waisted jeans to buy?

James Clyburn, D-S.C., sent a resounding message to the president and elected officials across the nation that it may be time to move on.\n\nClyburn, a Biden campaign co-chair, outlined a process to replace Biden during an interview with CNN. Should Biden step aside, Clyburn said, he expects a \"mini-primary\" featuring Vice President Kamala Harris, governors and others in the run-up to the Democratic National Convention in August.\n\n\"You can actually fashion the process that's already in place to make it a mini-primary and I would support that,\" said Clyburn, who also spoke to Biden on Wednesday in a conversation his office refused to discuss.\n\nClyburn's decision to spell out in detail how Biden might be replaced was viewed as a clarion call by some top donors, party insiders and even members of Biden's campaign who increasingly believe that the 81-year-old president will be forced to step aside following a debate performance that shook the party's confidence in his ability to defeat Republican former President Donald Trump in November.\n\nThe extraordinary remarks echoed throughout the private conversations of donors, Democratic National Committee members and even Biden's campaign staff, according to multiple participants who spoke on the condition of anonymity to share sensitive discussions. In response to Clyburn's latest comments, at least one member of Biden's finance committee predicted that the president would not survive the political crisis.\n\nIndeed, the conversation among many insiders has begun to shift from whether Biden should stay in the race to the logistics of his departure.\n\nClyburn spokesperson Brianna Frias later clarified that he was responding to a hypothetical question and not trying to restart the nomination contest.\n\n\"He was not calling for a 'mini primary,'\" Frias said. \"Instead, he was explaining the existing process. The congressman fully supports this president at the top of the ticket and it would be irresponsible to report anything otherwise.\"\n\nA significant group of party insiders wants the incumbent president to stay in the race, believing he remains the party's best hope to defeat Trump.\n\n\"I'm for Joe Biden. I encourage Joe Biden to continue to run for president and I believe that he will be reelected,\" said Dick Harpootlian, a South Carolina state senator and Biden supporter. \"Even in this weakened condition, I do believe he will beat Donald Trump.\"\n\nClyburn's comment came a day after former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi sent shockwaves across the party by raising questions about Biden's fitness to serve. \"It's a legitimate question to say, is this an episode or is this a condition?\" Pelosi said on MSNBC.\n\nBiden vowed on Wednesday to stay in the race.\n\n\"I am running. I am the leader of the Democratic Party. No one is pushing me out,\" Biden said in a call with staffers on his reelection campaign, according to a top aide who posted his comment on the X social media platform.\n\nPrivately, however, Biden's allies shared increasing concern that he would undermine their chances to win the House and the Senate if he's on the ballot this fall. And top donors fear that Biden's fundraising, while strong in June, will slow considerably this month, especially among high-dollar donors.\n\nNew polling also shows warning signs.\n\nTrump had a slight lead over Biden in two polls of voters conducted after the debate. But one of the polls -- conducted by SSRS for CNN -- found that three-quarters of voters, including more than half of Democratic voters, said the party has a better chance of winning the presidency in November with a candidate other than Biden.\n\nRecommended Stories\n\nAround 7 in 10 voters -- and 45% of Democrats -- said that Biden's physical and mental ability is a reason to vote against him.\n\nMeanwhile, an increasing number of Democratic officials believe that Harris should be the favorite to replace Biden. Those involved in private discussions also acknowledge that California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer remain viable alternatives.\n\nBut for some insiders, Harris is viewed as the only nominee who would quickly unify the party and avoid a messy and divisive convention fight.\n\nClyburn, who described Biden's debate performance as \"concerning,\" said in a MSNBC interview on Tuesday that he would support Harris if Biden were to step aside.\n\n\"This party should not in any way do anything to work around Ms. Harris,\" Clyburn said. \"We should do everything we can to bolster her whether she's in second place or at the top of the ticket.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Trump's campaign cheered on the Democratic dysfunction in a statement predicting victory.\n\n\"President Trump will beat any Democrat on Nov. 5 because he has a proven record and an agenda to Make America Great Again,\" said senior advisers Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles.", "source": {"uri": "thegrio.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TheGrio"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@thegrio.com",

He also blasted those who might want to \"work around\" her and choose someone else at the top of the ticket considering her low polling.\n\n\"We should do everything we can to bolster her, whether it's in second place or the top of the ticket,\" Clyburn said.\n\nBIDEN SENIOR ADVISER CLASHES WITH CNN ANCHOR OVER PRESIDENT'S DEBATE PERFORMANCE\n\nMitchell prompted the discussion by mentioning ongoing calls among voters, Democratic officials and members of the liberal media to replace Biden as the party's presidential nominee following his widely criticized debate performance last week.\n\nShe specifically asked what he thought about Harris replacing Biden at the top of the ticket, though she mentioned that some were wary of her due to her low polling numbers.\n\n\"Congressman, how would you feel if there is a decision for him to step down?

James Clyburn, D-S.C., sent a resounding message to the president and elected officials across the nation that it may be time to move on.\n\nClyburn, a Biden campaign co-chair, outlined a process to replace Biden during an interview with CNN. Should Biden step aside, Clyburn said, he expects a \"mini-primary\" featuring Vice President Kamala Harris, governors and others in the run-up to the Democratic National Convention in August.\n\n\"You can actually fashion the process that\u00b4s already in place to make it a mini-primary and I would support that,\" said Clyburn, who also spoke to Biden on Wednesday in a conversation his office refused to discuss.\n\nClyburn's decision to spell out in detail how Biden might be replaced was viewed as a clarion call by some top donors, party insiders and even members of Biden's campaign who increasingly believe that the 81-year-old president will be forced to step aside following a debate performance that shook the party's confidence in his ability to defeat Republican former President Donald Trump in November.\n\nThe extraordinary remarks echoed throughout the private conversations of donors, Democratic National Committee members and even Biden\u00b4s campaign staff, according to multiple participants who spoke on the condition of anonymity to share sensitive discussions. In response to Clyburn\u00b4s latest comments, at least one member of Biden\u00b4s finance committee predicted that the president would not survive the political crisis.\n\nFILE - Rep. Jim Clyburn, D-S.C., speaks, Nov. 18, 2023, in Charleston, S.C. Senior Democratic figures rallied with a show of unwavering public support for President Joe Biden on Sunday, June 30, 2024, amid private angst within the party about his Thursday debate performance. \"I do not believe that Joe Biden has a problem leading for the next four years,\" Clyburn, a close ally of Biden, said on CNN's \"State of the Union.\" \"Joe Biden should continue to run on his record.\" (AP Photo/Meg Kinnard, File)\n\nIndeed, the conversation among many insiders has begun to shift from whether Biden should stay in the race to the logistics of his departure.\n\nClyburn spokesperson Brianna Frias later clarified that he was responding to a hypothetical question and not trying to restart the nomination contest.\n\n\"He was not calling for a 'mini primary,\u00b4\" Frias said. \"Instead, he was explaining the existing process. The congressman fully supports this president at the top of the ticket and it would be irresponsible to report anything otherwise.\"\n\nA significant group of party insiders wants the incumbent president to stay in the race, believing he remains the party\u00b4s best hope to defeat Trump.\n\n\"I\u00b4m for Joe Biden. I encourage Joe Biden to continue to run for president and I believe that he will be reelected,\" said Dick Harpootlian, a South Carolina state senator and Biden supporter. \"Even in this weakened condition, I do believe he will beat Donald Trump.\"\n\nClyburn's comment came a day after former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi sent shockwaves across the party by raising questions about Biden\u00b4s fitness to serve. \"It\u00b4s a legitimate question to say, is this an episode or is this a condition?\" Pelosi said on MSNBC.\n\nBiden vowed on Wednesday to stay in the race.\n\n\"I am running. I am the leader of the Democratic Party. No one is pushing me out,\" Biden said in a call with staffers on his reelection campaign, according to a top aide who posted his comment on the X social media platform.\n\nPrivately, however, Biden's allies shared increasing concern that he would undermine their chances to win the House and the Senate if he\u00b4s on the ballot this fall. And top donors fear that Biden\u00b4s fundraising, while strong in June, will slow considerably this month, especially among high-dollar donors.\n\nNew polling also shows warning signs.\n\nTrump had a slight lead over Biden in two polls of voters conducted after the debate. But one of the polls -- conducted by SSRS for CNN -- found that three-quarters of voters, including more than half of Democratic voters, said the party has a better chance of winning the presidency in November with a candidate other than Biden.\n\nAround 7 in 10 voters - and 45% of Democrats - said that Biden\u00b4s physical and mental ability is a reason to vote against him.\n\nMeanwhile, an increasing number of Democratic officials believe that Harris should be the favorite to replace Biden. Those involved in private discussions also acknowledge that California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer remain viable alternatives.\n\nBut for some insiders, Harris is viewed as the only nominee who would quickly unify the party and avoid a messy and divisive convention fight.\n\nClyburn, who described Biden's debate performance as \"concerning,\" said in a MSNBC interview on Tuesday that he would support Harris if Biden were to step aside.\n\n\"This party should not in any way do anything to work around Ms. Harris,\" Clyburn said. \"We should do everything we can to bolster her whether she's in second place or at the top of the ticket.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Trump's campaign cheered on the Democratic dysfunction in a statement predicting victory.\n\n\"President Trump will beat any Democrat on Nov. 5 because he has a proven record and an agenda to Make America Great Again,\" said senior advisers Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles.\n\nAssociated Press writers Lisa Mascaro in Washington, Meg Kinnard in Charlotte and Jill Colvin in New York contributed.",

James Clyburn, D-S.C., sent a resounding message to the president and elected officials across the nation that it may be time to move on.\n\nClyburn, a Biden campaign co-chair, outlined a process to replace Biden during an interview with CNN. Should Biden step aside, Clyburn said, he expects a \"mini-primary\" featuring Vice President Kamala Harris, governors and others in the run-up to the Democratic National Convention in August.\n\n\"You can actually fashion the process that's already in place to make it a mini-primary and I would support that,\" said Clyburn, who also spoke to Biden on Wednesday in a conversation his office refused to discuss.\n\nClyburn's decision to spell out in detail how Biden might be replaced was viewed as a clarion call by some top donors, party insiders and even members of Biden's campaign who increasingly believe that the 81-year-old president will be forced to step aside following a debate performance that shook the party's confidence in his ability to defeat Republican former President Donald Trump in November.\n\nThe extraordinary remarks echoed throughout the private conversations of donors, Democratic National Committee members and even Biden's campaign staff, according to multiple participants who spoke on the condition of anonymity to share sensitive discussions. In response to Clyburn's latest comments, at least one member of Biden's finance committee predicted that the president would not survive the political crisis.\n\nIndeed, the conversation among many insiders has begun to shift from whether Biden should stay in the race to the logistics of his departure.\n\nClyburn spokesperson Brianna Frias later clarified that he was responding to a hypothetical question and not trying to restart the nomination contest.\n\n\"He was not calling for a 'mini primary,'\" Frias said. \"Instead, he was explaining the existing process. The congressman fully supports this president at the top of the ticket and it would be irresponsible to report anything otherwise.\"\n\nA significant group of party insiders wants the incumbent president to stay in the race, believing he remains the party's best hope to defeat Trump.\n\n\"I'm for Joe Biden. I encourage Joe Biden to continue to run for president and I believe that he will be reelected,\" said Dick Harpootlian, a South Carolina state senator and Biden supporter. \"Even in this weakened condition, I do believe he will beat Donald Trump.\"\n\nClyburn's comment came a day after former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi sent shockwaves across the party by raising questions about Biden's fitness to serve. \"It's a legitimate question to say, is this an episode or is this a condition?\" Pelosi said on MSNBC.\n\nBiden vowed on Wednesday to stay in the race.\n\n\"I am running. I am the leader of the Democratic Party. No one is pushing me out,\" Biden said in a call with staffers on his reelection campaign, according to a top aide who posted his comment on the X social media platform.\n\nPrivately, however, Biden's allies shared increasing concern that he would undermine their chances to win the House and the Senate if he's on the ballot this fall. And top donors fear that Biden's fundraising, while strong in June, will slow considerably this month, especially among high-dollar donors.\n\nNew polling also shows warning signs.\n\nTrump had a slight lead over Biden in two polls of voters conducted after the debate. But one of the polls -- conducted by SSRS for CNN -- found that three-quarters of voters, including more than half of Democratic voters, said the party has a better chance of winning the presidency in November with a candidate other than Biden.\n\nAround 7 in 10 voters -- and 45% of Democrats -- said that Biden's physical and mental ability is a reason to vote against him.\n\nMeanwhile, an increasing number of Democratic officials believe that Harris should be the favorite to replace Biden. Those involved in private discussions also acknowledge that California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer remain viable alternatives.\n\nBut for some insiders, Harris is viewed as the only nominee who would quickly unify the party and avoid a messy and divisive convention fight.\n\nClyburn, who described Biden's debate performance as \"concerning,\" said in a MSNBC interview on Tuesday that he would support Harris if Biden were to step aside.\n\n\"This party should not in any way do anything to work around Ms. Harris,\" Clyburn said. \"We should do everything we can to bolster her whether she's in second place or at the top of the ticket.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Trump's campaign cheered on the Democratic dysfunction in a statement predicting victory.\n\n\"President Trump will beat any Democrat on Nov. 5 because he has a proven record and an agenda to Make America Great Again,\" said senior advisers Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Lisa Mascaro in Washington, Meg Kinnard in Charlotte and Jill Colvin in New York contributed.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

To all of the other governors who may be interested, and there's some that I would be interested in hearing from as well. Because if [Harris] were to be the nominee we need to have a running mate. And need a strong running mate,\" he said.\n\nClyburn's wish to hear more from the president is slowly coming true. As the Biden campaign seeks to calm fears about his candidacy, they've arranged for the president to meet with concerned Democratic governors and sit down for an extended interview this week.\n\nThe president's team has pushed back on suggestions that he would leave the race. On Wednesday, White House Senior deputy press secretary Andrew Bates wrote on X, formerly Twitter, that it is \"absolutely false\" that Biden is reconsidering his candidacy.", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "katherine_fung@newsweek.com", "name": "Katherine Fung", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Clyburn", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jim Clyburn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Primary election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "South Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shontel_Brown", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shontel Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Cuellar", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Henry Cuellar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Town_hall_meeting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Town hall meeting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bates_College", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bates College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House_Press_Secretary", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House Press Secretary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2421993/democrat-kingmaker-biden-clyburn.webp?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=e998d0edfc40ffce8a80182adcc14046", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9701829", "eventUri": "eng-9701829", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3647058823529412, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

Instead, he was explaining the existing process. The Congressman fully supports President Biden at the top of the ticket and it would be irresponsible to report anything otherwise.\"\n\nStill, Mr. Clyburn did further muse in Wednesday's CNN interview about the possibility of a contested primary and noted the uncommitted status of hundreds of \"superdelegates\" -- mostly Democratic elected officials unplugged to vote for any candidate.\n\n\"It would seem to me that any one of these people who aspire to be president, who would like to see a contest taking place -- look at those 700 delegates who are now uncommitted and get into the action,\" he said.\n\nMr. Clyburn was influential in making Mr. Biden president in the first place.\n\nHis endorsement of Mr. Biden before the 2020 South Carolina primary is widely credited with sealing a big victory for Mr. Biden in the third state to vote.\n\nThat win let Mr. Biden recover from disappointing finishes in both Iowa (fourth) and New Hampshire (fifth) and he went on to secure the Democratic nomination.", "source": {"uri": "washingtontimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "victor_morton@washingtontimes.com", "name": "Victor Morton", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Clyburn", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jim Clyburn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congressional_Black_Caucus", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Congressional Black Caucus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_nominating_convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States presidential nominating convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "South Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "General election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politico", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Politico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superdelegate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Superdelegate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Hampshire", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Hampshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Hampshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Beauty_Pageants", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Beauty Pageants", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Buzkashi", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Buzkashi", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2023/02/26/Election_2024_South_Carolina_89340_c0-312-7457-4659_s1770x1032.jpg?910997cdb16077248c39b91292fe034533f88069", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9701829", "eventUri": "eng-9701829", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

In response to Clyburn's latest comments, at least one member of Biden's finance committee predicted that the president would not survive the political crisis.\n\nIndeed, the conversation among many insiders has begun to shift from whether Biden should stay in the race to the logistics of his departure.\n\nClyburn spokesperson Brianna Frias later clarified that he was responding to a hypothetical question and not trying to restart the nomination contest.\n\n\"He was not calling for a 'mini primary,'\" Frias said. \"Instead, he was explaining the existing process. The congressman fully supports this president at the top of the ticket and it would be irresponsible to report anything otherwise.\"\n\nA significant group of party insiders wants the incumbent president to stay in the race, believing he remains the party's best hope to defeat Trump.\n\n\"I'm for Joe Biden. I encourage Joe Biden to continue to run for president and I believe that he will be reelected,\" said Dick Harpootlian, a South Carolina state senator and Biden supporter. \"Even in this weakened condition, I do believe he will beat Donald Trump.\"\n\nClyburn's comment came a day after former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi sent shockwaves across the party by raising questions about Biden's fitness to serve. \"It's a legitimate question to say, is this an episode or is this a condition?\" Pelosi said on MSNBC.\n\nBiden vowed on Wednesday to stay in the race.\n\n\"I am running. I am the leader of the Democratic Party. No one is pushing me out,\" Biden said in a call with staffers on his reelection campaign, according to a top aide who posted his comment on the X social media platform.\n\nPrivately, however, Biden's allies shared increasing concern that he would undermine their chances to win the House and the Senate if he's on the ballot this fall. And top donors fear that Biden's fundraising, while strong in June, will slow considerably this month, especially among high-dollar donors.\n\nNew polling also shows warning signs.\n\nTrump had a slight lead over Biden in two polls of voters conducted after the debate. But one of the polls -- conducted by SSRS for CNN -- found that three-quarters of voters, including more than half of Democratic voters, said the party has a better chance of winning the presidency in November with a candidate other than Biden.\n\nAround 7 in 10 voters -- and 45% of Democrats -- said that Biden's physical and mental ability is a reason to vote against him.\n\nMeanwhile, an increasing number of Democratic officials believe that Harris should be the favorite to replace Biden. Those involved in private discussions also acknowledge that California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer remain viable alternatives.\n\nBut for some insiders, Harris is viewed as the only nominee who would quickly unify the party and avoid a messy and divisive convention fight.\n\nClyburn, who described Biden's debate performance as \"concerning,\" said in a MSNBC interview on Tuesday that he would support Harris if Biden were to step aside.\n\n\"This party should not in any way do anything to work around Ms. Harris,\" Clyburn said. \"We should do everything we can to bolster her whether she's in second place or at the top of the ticket.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Trump's campaign cheered on the Democratic dysfunction in a statement predicting victory.\n\n\"President Trump will beat any Democrat on Nov. 5 because he has a proven record and an agenda to Make America Great Again,\" said senior advisers Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles.\n\n___", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Lloyd Doggett became the first Democrat lawmaker to publicly call for Biden to end his campaign.\n\nBrian Freeman \u2709\n\nBrian Freeman, a Newsmax writer based in Israel, has more than three decades writing and editing about culture and politics for newspapers, online and television.", "source": {"uri": "newsmax.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NewsMax"}, "authors": [{"uri": "brian_freeman@newsmax.com", "name": "Brian Freeman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Clyburn", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jim Clyburn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hakeem_Jeffries", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hakeem Jeffries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Coons", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chris Coons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politico", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Politico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "South Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaware", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axios_(website)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Axios (website)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lloyd_Doggett", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lloyd Doggett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Party_Supplies", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Party Supplies", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Christian_Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Christian Democracy", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://www.newsmax.com/CMSPages/GetFile.aspx?guid=e3f9e5b5-4443-489b-a6c8-73805c7cb7e8&SiteName=Newsmax&maxsidesize=280", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9701829", "eventUri": "eng-9701829", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

If she gets it, the Obamas and Clintons likely would follow, making any challenge an affront to the sitting president and two former presidents.\n\nThe big picture: If she gets Biden's endorsement, the only way a top-tier Democrat could challenge her would be to risk their future by saying \"not your turn\" to the first woman vice president, first Black American vice president and first South Asian vice president.\n\nOf course, all this may take a while. Biden stunned -- and annoyed -- lots of powerful Democrats on Wednesday by digging in ahead of his interview with ABC's George Stephanopoulos (now being shown as a prime-time special at 8pm ET Friday).\n\nThe intrigue: Biden and his closest advisers have long felt Trump would beat Harris. They question her political skills and likability beyond the liberal bases. But polls show her running no worse than Biden in a hypothetical match-up with Trump.\n\nHow it works: We gamed out potential scenarios with some of the nation's most experienced Democratic operatives. Most feel strongly that for both political and practical reasons, Harris looks all but unbeatable.\n\nBehind the scenes: Let's say Biden didn't endorse, or Democratic leaders insisted on a process. At the highest levels of the party, there's talk of a series of, say, five regional debates before the convention. The candidates would debate live before the Democratic delegates, gathered in cities throughout the country (e.g., New York, Baltimore, Atlanta, Chicago, Phoenix and L.A.).\n\nA \"mini-primary\": Rep. James Clyburn (D-S.C.), a Biden campaign co-chair, said in response to a question from Andrea Mitchell on MSNBC that he'd support Harris if Biden dropped out, although he wants the ticket to continue to be Biden-Harris. \"This party should not, in any way, do any thing to work around Ms. Harris,\" he said. \"We should do everything we can to bolster her.\"\n\nBetween the lines: Some party elders tell us the drama in all these scenarios would electrify an exhausted, disconsolate party, and engage a nation that otherwise would be tuned out for the summer.\n\nThe math is simple for a new ticket to win: Both parties agree the winner will be decided by a few hundred thousand voters in seven states -- Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Georgia, Arizona and Nevada.\n\nThe bottom line: Replacing Biden for the Democratic nomination in the coming weeks would be messy and wildly unpredictable -- but highly doable.", "source": {"uri": "axios.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

That was the message for World Health Organization (W.H.O.) chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on Friday after his proposed global pandemic treaty was rejected after two years of closed-door meetings in Geneva, Switzerland. AP reports Roland Driece, co-chair of W.H.O.\u2019s negotiating board for the agreement, acknowledged countries were unable to deliver an agreed proposal. W.H.O. had hoped a final draft treaty could be agreed on at its yearly meeting of health ministers starting Monday in Geneva. \u201cWe are not where we hoped we would be when we started this process,\u201d he said, adding that finalizing an international agreement on how to respond to a pandemic was critical \u201cfor the sake of humanity\u201d even as a host of countries disagreed with the basic principle that unelected, unaccountable, health bureaucrats could somehow decide major global decisions on government policies. Earlier this month, U.S. Republican senators wrote to the Biden administration, arguing the draft treaty focused on issues like \u201cshredding intellectual property rights\u201d and \u201csupercharging the WHO.\u201d They urged Biden not to sign off. The House Freedom Caucus sent Biden a letter demanding he stand against the W.H.O.\u2019s push for a \u201cglobal pandemic treaty.\u201d https://t.co/3l9IUel17X \u2014 Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) May 24, 2022 Driece said the World Health Assembly next week would urge participants to make \u201cthe right decisions to take this process forward\u201d to one day reach a pandemic agreement \u201cbecause we need it.\u201d Addressing a sullen final day of negotiations, the W.H.O. chief insisted, \u201cThis is not a failure.\u201d \u201cWe will try everything \u2014 believing that anything is possible \u2014 and make this happen because the world still needs a pandemic treaty,\u201d Tedros said. \u201cBecause many of the challenges that caused a serious impact during COVID-19 still exist.\u201d Despite the desire of W.H.O. career bureaucrats to push ahead with the scheme, Britain\u2019s department of health had already said it would only agree to an accord if it adhered to British national interest and sovereignty. \u2018Undermines Sovereignty\u2019 \u2014 UK Rejects Signing W.H.O.

Precious Matsoso, the other co-chair of W.H.O.\u2019s negotiating board for the pandemic treaty, said there was still an opportunity to reach agreement and efforts would go on \u2014 despite the inability to reach a deal on Friday. \u201cWe will make sure that this happens, because when the next pandemic hits, it will not spare us,\u201d she said.

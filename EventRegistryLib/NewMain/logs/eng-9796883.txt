They reach an average of 27 points per game with players like Amy O'Connor (4-28), Katrina Mackey (3-19) and Orlaith Cahalane (3-07) all shooting well.\n\nCrucially, they only concede around 8.33 points per game.\n\nIt has made them favourites for every piece of silverware they have fought for this season.

We have seen a number of scenarios on the field this year and have responded to them and we will look to deal with what we see on the field again on Sunday.\"\n\nCork are also hoping to be victorious in the Intermediate Championship.

I reckon it will be 3.15 to 1.17 (on Sunday),\" she said.\n\nAcross the city at another famous Cork club, St. Finbarr's GAA in Togher, official Claire Harrington is busily recording young supporters' messages of good luck to the club's five senior players and three intermediate players taking part in two of Sunday's three finals at Croke Park.\n\n\"It is great for the girls to have such positive role models here\", she said.\n\nAsked if she had any advice for her heroes, Kyra Maher said she would tell them to \"keep your head up in the game and bring it (O'Duffy Cup) home\".\n\nNine-time All-Ireland Camogie medal winner Gemma O'Connor - who knows only so well what it is like to walk out onto that pitch in Croke Park - said it could go either way, \"I think Galway are starting to come right. It will be an interesting battle, but you would have to favour Cork\".\n\nAt the Kabin on Cork's northside, some of the young rappers involved in this year's unexpected summer internet and chart hit 'The Spark' say they've no doubt that these Cork sides have 'the spark'.\n\nZoey Dennehy said: \"Yeah, anything is possible, as Sophia (one of her fellow rappers) said: just search for your spark and you will find it - C'mon on the rebels!\".\n\nCork plays Kilkenny in the Intermediate All-Ireland Camogie championship final at 3.00pm with Cork taking on old rivals Galway for the double in the Senior final at 5.15pm.", "source": {"uri": "rte.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "RTE.ie"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jennie_o_sullivan@rte.ie", "name": "Jennie O'Sullivan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camogie", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Camogie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cork_(city)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cork (city)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cork (city)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarsfields_GAA_(County_Cork)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sarsfields GAA (County Cork)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O'Duffy_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "O'Duffy Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-Ireland_Minor_Hurling_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "All-Ireland Minor Hurling Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaelic_Athletic_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gaelic Athletic Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galway_GAA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Galway GAA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-Ireland_Senior_Hurling_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croke_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Croke Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_Cork", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "County Cork"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "County Cork"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glanmire", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Glanmire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Glanmire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashling_Thompson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ashling Thompson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Finbarr's_National_Hurling_&_Football_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "St Finbarr's National Hurling & Football Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Togher,_Cork", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Togher, Cork"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilkenny_GAA", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kilkenny GAA"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Part-Time_Employment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Part-Time Employment", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Rounders", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Rounders", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://img.rasset.ie/0020be8f-1600.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9796883", "eventUri": "eng-9796883", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.6941176470588235, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

We have performed very well, so we are really happy but like we have to bring it to the next level again.\"\n\nBeing a second choice goalkeeper is always tough - given you've got to be at your best in the case of an emergency, but Lynch is proud to be there in reserve for Amy Lee, who was outstanding in their dominant semi-final victory over Dublin.\n\n\"We're like sisters at this stage, we've trained together so long,\" Molly explains. \"But then no, you have to be so proud of her. It's a tough position, but if anything happens to her you have to step up to the mark too.\n\nShe's been brilliant all year, so you couldn't fault her.\n\n\"We've done a lot of sports psychology with our sports psychologist Michelle O'Connor.

I suppose that is their All-Ireland final.\n\n\"It's so important, like my two medals are identical. The only difference is the Cork one is engraved with Corcaigh on the back, so it's really important to go up to that and give it a shot, but an amazing competition.\n\n\"So it cut the celebrations short, I got a couple of hours sleep and went up,\" she remarks. \"I think a few of them were a bit shocked and I wasn't there the following morning, but I'm so glad I did, it was a really great day.\n\nPRIDE\n\nCaptaining your county to an All-Ireland title is what every player dreams of - and Lynch has the chance to do that this weekend against Galway.\n\nIt's such an honour.

However, Cork have gone on to contest each final since then, including winning the championship last year.\n\nAs defending champions, Cahalane is aware their may always be a \"target\" on Cork's backs.\n\nShe said: \"At the end of the day we're going in as reigning All-Ireland champions but I don't think as players we're thinking about that too much.\n\n\"The hunger is still there, I don't think this team is finished yet and happy with one All Ireland. We're really hungry to get success again and it's something we've been striving for all year.\"\n\nCork defeated Galway earlier in the championship 2-16 to 1-07, however, Cahalane is not taking anything for granted.\n\nShe said: \"Ourselves and Galway know each other quite well - we played each a number of times over the last couple of years.\n\n\"Since the final in 2021 we have some new players on the panel and I think the panel is stronger than then.\n\n\"We also know Galway are a very strong side and they seem to come alive when they get to Croke Park so we're under no illusions that it's going to be a tough test.\n\n\"We were really happy with our performance that day, Galway came to Cork and that day they were missing a couple of players.\n\n\"The last day when they played Tipperary they were much better and they had a very strong performance and finished strongly. I feel they're building as they're coming into the final as well so we're going to have to be ready for another tough test the next day.\"\n\nCahalane is hoping for a \"complete performance\" from the Rebels when they take to the Croke Park pitch on Sunday.\n\nShe said: \"The days that you're training December, January, February, these are the days you're training in that hard slog.\n\n\"There's huge competition for places in our panel every night we go out training - battles all over the field - and I think that shows the hunger that everyone has going into the final the next day.\n\n\"Everyone's bursting to get that jersey and get out on the field and we just can't wait for it.\"\n\nWe need your consent to load this YouTube contentWe use YouTube to manage extra content that can set cookies on your device and collect data about your activity.

We didn't show up. Our work rate wasn't in it. They ran at us, got all the scores they needed. They were just the better team that day.\n\n\"We had to sit down and have a look at ourselves after that. A performance like that is not going to win us any games. We had a six-day turnaround to play Waterford in the quarter-final so we really had to dust ourselves down and go again.\n\n\"We didn't have any time to feel sorry for ourselves. And we had great victories over Waterford and Tipperary so hopefully that defeat will stand to us, that we'll learn a lot from those games.\"\n\nGalway did beat Cork in the league, on their way to the final.\n\n\"They've kicked on another notch since the league,\" claimed Black. \"They had a great victory over Dublin so it will be a tough battle.

Black's father is an Armagh man and both of them went to the men's decider last Sunday week.\n\n\"I'd the Galway jersey on, he had the Armagh jersey on,\" she said. \"He was in the Nally and I was in the Lower Hogan, we actually saw eachother. At least one of us went home happy.\"\n\nRoisin's aunt, Mary Black, captained Armagh to an All-Ireland intermediate camogie title in 1994 so a precedent exists within the family for small ball success.\n\nBut Galway will still be significant underdogs against a Cork side on the crest of a wave right now.\n\n\"They're deserving of having that pressure on them because of their performances in the Championship,\" said primary school teacher Black of Cork.\n\n\"They've beaten everyone by a considerable amount this year.\"\n\nBlack, from the Oranmore Maree club, was part of the Galway panel when they beat Cork in the 2021 decider.\n\n\"We beat Cork that day in a thrilling game,\" she recalled. \"It's a feeling you want to get back soon.\"", "source": {"uri": "irishexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Irish Examiner"}, "authors": [{"uri": "paul_keane@irishexaminer.com", "name": "Paul Keane", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cork_(city)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cork (city)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cork (city)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galway", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Galway"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Galway"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterford", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Waterford"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Waterford"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ger_Manley", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ger Manley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O'Duffy_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "O'Duffy Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P\u00e1irc_U\u00ed_Chaoimh", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "P\u00e1irc U\u00ed Chaoimh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munster_Senior_Football_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Munster Senior Football Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tipperary_GAA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tipperary GAA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-Ireland_Senior_Hurling_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dublin", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dublin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dublin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croke_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Croke Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armagh", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Armagh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Armagh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(Gaelic_games)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "County (Gaelic games)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camogie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Camogie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oranmore", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oranmore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oranmore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Part-Time_Employment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Part-Time Employment", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Holidays/Thanksgiving", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Holidays/Thanksgiving", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Rounders", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Rounders", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://www.irishexaminer.com/cms_media/module_img/8476/4238419_5_articlelarge_2537375-MN_BB1_5795.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9796883", "eventUri": "eng-9796883", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-02-16", "dateEnd": "-01-07", "textStart": 371, "textEnd": 382}], "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

I have never seen anything like it. You couldn't see the ball at times,\" remarked Molly. \"It's a brilliant competition. I get a good kick out of it. It's something different. It's so well organised. There's great people involved in running it.\"\n\nThe former Galway 'keeper Susan Earner was runner-up. \"She was runner-up last year too. She has a fabulous strike of the ball. We had a bit of a chat about Sunday after the competition.\"\n\nTalk of the Olympics was also in the Louth air.\n\n\"My mum's background is in athletics. My Dad's is in GAA, so we have the best of both worlds. I do a bit of cross-country in the winter months to keep fit. It's a tough sport, you really can appreciate the athletes in the Olympics.\"\n\nLike the Irish in Paris, Cork are camogie's history-makers. They are seeking their 30th O'Duffy Cup.\n\nThey have been in blistering form this season and produced a commanding show against Dublin in the semi-final.\n\nBut Molly is not counting any sliotars. \"Galway are an outstanding side. They have made us bring our game to the next level. If we are favourites, it won't be by much. It will be a very, very tough match.\n\n\"We beat them in the Championship group stage, but they beat us in the league.\n\n\"So we're level going into it if you want to look at it that way. It's knock-out championship and an All-Ireland final is completely different to a round-robin stage. It will be very, very close. We're under no illusions.\n\n\"We lost to them in the 2021 All-Ireland final, so we've seen both sides of it when it comes to All-Ireland finals. To lose one is incredibly tough and we lost two in a row. We finally got over the line last year. Hopefully again on Sunday we'll be on the right side of it.\"\n\nMolly will keep on the toe, as understudy to Cork's No 1 Amy Lee.\n\n\"Amy is a superb goalkeeper. She learned from Aoife Murray, so to get the opportunity to learn from Amy is marvellous.\n\n\"I always have to make sure I'm ready. Something could happen Amy in the warm-up or the first minute of the match and you could be in.\n\n\"You have to keep training away. I'd always be at the ball wall at home - you have to have a good touch.\n\n\"We have a sports psychologist in Michelle O'Connor, and you pull on all of that stuff. Just being ready, concentrating, using all the tips she gave you - it's all important.\"\n\nMolly is hoping to soothe the defeat of the Cork hurlers in the All-Ireland final.\n\n\"It was an incredible match. I'd know Pat Ryan very well and a couple of Sars lads on the panel.\n\n\"They were so unlucky. When it comes to finals, sometimes you need that bit of luck to get over the line. But they left everything on the pitch.\n\n\"The noise level and the atmosphere was incredible. I was really lucky to have been there because the tickets were like gold dust.\n\n\"People in Cork have been so good. Everyone left up their flags. I know in my own housing estate at home there were flags left up, and a few more put up as well. It is always nice to have people backing the girls.\n\n\"So there's flags everywhere.

We always love playing each other.\n\n\"It's always a really tough game, very competitive and free-flowing which are the best games players want to play.\n\n\"Coming into the final there is a lot to be answered so we will see who comes out on top.\n\n\"We have played Galway twice this year in league and championship. They beat us in league and we beat them in championship. It's definitely level pegging and this one is winner takes all.\"\n\nIt hasn't all been plain sailing for Cork this year after a slow start to the season.\n\nLike many great sides, they have timed their campaign right to peak in the latter stages.\n\nHayes is pleased that they have left their best until last.\n\n\"During the league we probably weren't going too well,\" she admitted.\n\n\"We wouldn't have been happy at the standard we were playing at. We didn't get out of the group into the final so there was definitely a lot of work to be done.\n\n\"But I think we had a good run in the Munster Championship and that set us up for championship. Since then I've felt we've been going quite well, building on every game.\n\n\"There is definitely lots to improve on. We got opened up a small bit against Dublin at times so lots to work on going into the final at the same time.\"\n\nThe Rebels will be fancied to emerge victorious on the day\n\nOne of the most impressive factors in reaching Croke Park was utilising their substitutes when the result was secured against Dublin.\n\nThe Cork subs scored 1-04 from play, including two points from Clodagh Finn and Sorcha McCartan.\n\nHayes believes that shows how much the panel has developed over time.\n\n\"A lot of our team are very strong. Probably our key thing at the moment is our bench. The people coming off the bench are very strong and they probably have a lot of impact.\n\n\"We rely a lot on them because when they come on they give us a big boost.\n\n\"Training is very competitive so you don't know which XV will be starting or who will be the five coming off the bench. I think that's a testament to the strenght of the panel in general.\"\n\nCork are seeking a third title this decade and a 30th in all.\n\nThey have been in every final in the last four years, including losing to Galway in 2021.\n\nDespite the familiarity, the occasion does not lose its gloss for one of Cork's stars.\n\n\"The final is probably the thing you dream about as a child,\" Hayes explained.\n\n\"It's definitely something you want every year and when you come to training this week you count yourself lucky that we are the ones running out in Croke Park.\n\n\"Although there will be a bit of nerves it's real excitement and goosebumps and it's a moment you'll remember forever.\n\n\"We're just taking it game by game.

When her team-mates eventually arrived down in dribs and drabs for breakfast, many wondered as to the whereabouts of the Sarsfields player.\n\nAs her colleagues snoozed, Lynch had travelled to the Annaverna Mountain on the Cooley Peninsula to defend her All-Ireland camogie Poc Fada title, which she did so successfully.\n\nShe hadn't told many of her team-mates about the expedition. But when the triumphant Cork team arrived back at Kent Station later that day, Lynch was waiting to greet them having collected her second All-Ireland in as many days.\n\nAnd so, despite Lynch captaining Cork at Croke Park on Sunday in the 2024 All-Ireland senior camogie decider against Galway, there was never any question of her not turning up for the Poc Fada competition on Monday.\n\n\"It was a busy day on Monday but it's an incredible competition, so I never second guess going up,\" says Lynch. \"It's always in my calendar. Extremely tough conditions on Monday, I'd never seen anything like it up there, we struggled to see the ball on the way back.\"\n\nBut the elements weren't enough to deny Lynch a fourth successive All-Ireland Poc Fada title.\n\n\"I was delighted to get over the line. It's a great competition and I don't think it gets the recognition it deserves. Every interview you do might put it on the map for somebody else.\n\n\"You get to go up and defend your title every year, so I'll keep going as long as I can. I get a great kick out of it, it's something different, when are you ever going to be hitting a ball over a mountain like that?\n\n\"I had to cut the celebrations a small bit short last year after the All-Ireland final, so I kind of snuck off to bed about 12 o'clock to get some sleep.\n\n\"I was delighted I did it last year the morning after the final though because my two medals are equal at the end of the day, it's an All-Ireland medal, you are never going to pass up an opportunity to try win one.\"\n\nLynch has been understudy to Amy Lee in the battle for the Cork goalkeeping spot for most of the season, and with the pair vying for just one available spot on the team it has made the chance of getting game-time difficult for the current captain.\n\nHaving won the Cork senior camogie title last October, Sarsfields nominated Lynch to lead the county in 2024.\n\n\"I suppose it's an honour to be captain and I suppose I'm really lucky by the way it's done, whatever club wins the county gets to have captain. It is an honour,\" she says.\n\n\"Amy has been a brilliant goalkeeper. I suppose she learned from Aoife Murray so to get the opportunity to learn from Amy is brilliant. But, yeah, it is tough. I suppose you just have to be ready, something could happen Amy in the warm-up or the first minute of the match and you could be in.\"\n\nLynch actually played outfield until under-16 but carrying such a long strike, it was a weapon various team managers were keen to use as a launch pad from between the sticks.\n\n\"I probably wouldn't have made the standard out the field so it's given me great opportunity,\" adds Lynch. \"I probably wouldn't be sitting here unless I was a goalkeeper so I've gotten so much out of it. I really do enjoy it, it's something so unique.\"\n\nCork have already beaten Galway in this year's championship, dishing out a 2-16 to 1-7 hammering at P\u00e1irc U\u00ed Chaoimh during the group stages at the end of June. But Galway did beat Cork 0-14 to 0-9 in the league when the sides met at Duggan Park in March.\n\nStill, the reigning champions enter Sunday's final as favourites to win the O'Duffy Cup.\n\n\"We'll be under pressure on Sunday, Galway are an outstanding side,\" says Lynch. \"They have made us bring our game to the next level, to push on and try and be better. If we are favourites it won't be by much. It will be a very tough match.\n\n\"They beat us in the league, so we're level going into it if you want to look at it that way. It's knockout championship and an All-Ireland final is completely different from a round-robin stage. It will be very close.\"\n\nBoth counties have experienced All-Ireland final heartache in recent weeks - Cork lost the hurling decider, while Galway failed to get over the line in both the men's and women's football showpiece events.\n\n\"People in Cork have been brilliant,\" continues Lynch. \"Everyone left up their flags [after the hurling final]. I know in my own housing estate at home there were flags left up, and a few more put up as well, which is always nice to have people backing the girls. Coming up the motorway you see the flags still left up, so it's a nice buzz.\"", "source": {"uri": "irishtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Irish Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-Ireland_Poc_Fada_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "All-Ireland Poc Fada Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camogie", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Camogie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-Ireland_Senior_Hurling_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croke_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Croke Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cork_(city)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cork (city)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cork (city)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarsfields_GAA_(County_Cork)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sarsfields GAA (County Cork)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(Gaelic_games)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Captain (Gaelic games)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooley_Peninsula", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cooley Peninsula"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galway_GAA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Galway GAA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dublin", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dublin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dublin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-Ireland_Minor_Hurling_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "All-Ireland Minor Hurling Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counties_of_Ireland", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Counties of Ireland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goalkeeper_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Goalkeeper (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-Ireland_Under-16_Ladies'_Football_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "All-Ireland Under-16 Ladies' Football Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballinasloe_GAA", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ballinasloe GAA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aoife_Murray", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aoife Murray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O'Duffy_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "O'Duffy Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P\u00e1irc_U\u00ed_Chaoimh", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "P\u00e1irc U\u00ed Chaoimh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hurling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round-robin_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Round-robin tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Part-Time_Employment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Part-Time Employment", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.irishtimes.com/resizer/v2/5LYW5A7YS2KH2UZTSZYYSBEU3Y.jpg?smart=true&auth=5e2e10cf302d3f768d9f65cb3561e8ed94b422db9c53e0315baba1ac30e2c817&width=1200&height=630", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9796883", "eventUri": "eng-9796883", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-02-16", "dateEnd": "-01-07", "textStart": 3578, "textEnd": 3589}], "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

And they are determined that Cork will have to work hard if they are to retain their All-Ireland title against the Tribeswomen at HQ on Sunday evening.\n\nLast Thursday evening in Athenry, hundreds of young players turned out to support the squad as their countdown to the final continued -- their appearance the legacy of six years of Galway camogie success which has seen the senior squad assume elite status.\n\nPathways have been been established to ensure that a conveyor belt of top talent makes its way through to the senior ranks and another success on Sunday would go a long way towards sending interest levels to sky-high levels among young players.\n\nBut it won't be easy for Murray's squad and they'll have to use every ounce of their nous, youth and experience against a Cork side who will arrive full of hope and confidence.\n\nLosing run\n\nWhen Cork played Galway in the Glen Dimplex All-Ireland senior hurling semi-final just over 12 months ago, the Rebels were on a lengthy losing run against their rivals going back eight games.\n\nIt started at the same stage of the 2019 campaign, when the westerners ended Cork's three-in-a-row bid in a pulsating encounter and went on to claim the first of two All-Irelands garnered under the stewardship of manager, Cathal Murray.\n\nThree of those eight successes had come in that same calendar year so there is no overplaying the importance of laying that particular bogey to the Leesiders. Manic workrate and aggression were the trademarks of the triumph, nowhere more evidenced than by Aoife Healy chasing down Aoife Donohue despite being without a hurley and forcing a turnover that prompted a huge roar from the terraces.\n\nThat day Galway managed to breach the Cork defences for two goals but overall, they were outscored 15-8 and never led on the way to a three-point defeat.\n\nCork went on to end their six-year wait for a return to the winner's rostrum in the Hogan Stand and have been imperious through this year's Championship, with only Wexford getting to within a single-digit margin of the champions.\n\nGalway were among their victims in the group stages, when a dozen points separated them at SuperValu P\u00e1irc U\u00ed Chaoimh. It was a margin and performance that brooked no argument.\n\nGalway were already qualified to the knockout rounds at that point, however, and were without the dynamic Aoife Donohue, as well as Ann Marie Starr, a veteran who was first involved in an All-Ireland final with Galway in 2010 and had re-established herself this year after a lengthy absence from the first 15.\n\nDonohue was back for the three-point defeat of last year's runners-up Waterford in the quarter-final and Starr returned to the fold for the dramatic semi-final victory over a Tipperary team that had edged them out in the League final earlier in the year.\n\nNot for the first time, Carrie Dolan illustrated her courage when faced with pressure placed balls as Galway trailed by two points with time running out. The joint vice-captain halved the deficit and after Donohue equalised from play, split the posts to secure a return to the final for Galway for the first time since their 2021 triumph.\n\nIt was a far smoother progression for Cork against Dublin, though the 20-point margin was a bit flattering as the Dubs did create a number of goal chances and Amy Lee was forced into a few top-class saves. Saoirse McCarthy's speed and accuracy caused carnage however, while youngster Orlaith Cahalane also enjoyed her day with two goals.\n\nCahalane's older sister, M\u00e9adhbh, a current All-Star, is winning her battle to be fit for the final, having not played since the group stages due to a hamstring strain, though the youngest Cahalane on the squad, Gr\u00e1inne is a major doubt after picking up an ankle injury in training. Dual star Libby Coppinger is definitely ruled out with a hamstring injury that required surgery.\n\nOn form, Cork are hot favourites and Murray was more than happy to place that tag on Ger Manley's crew, but we know Galway will produce their best performance on the biggest day.\n\nIf they can get enough of a supply into Niamh Mallon, they will certainly have a huge chance, while Cork will hope Laura Treacy and co can cut off the supply and that their rich forward talent will do the rest.", "source": {"uri": "advertiser.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "Advertiser Newspaper Group"},

Only the Galway is up.\"\n\nThe hope out west is that after two final failures for Galway teams over the last two Sundays, it will be third time lucky when the camogie team face Cork.\n\nP\u00e1draic Joyce and the men's football team suffered that loss to Armagh and the pain of defeat was compounded by their female counterparts' loss to Kerry last Sunday.\n\n\"I went up with Dad,\" says Black of the men's narrow defeat to Armagh. \"I'd the Galway jersey on, he had the Armagh jersey on. He was in the Nally, I was in the lower Hogan. We actually saw each other. At least one of us went home happy.\"\n\nMaybe it's a good omen that Mary Black, who captained Armagh to All-Ireland intermediate camogie success in 1994, is R\u00f3is\u00edn's auntie. Armagh beat Kildare 7-11 to 3-11 in that final exactly 30 years ago, though a one-point win for Galway would do just fine for primary schoolteacher Black this time.\n\nThey are considerable underdogs to bring the O'Duffy Cup back to Galway, partly because Cork are champions, partly because the Munster title holders have blitzed all comers so far in the championship. When the sides met just six weeks ago, Cork beat Galway 2-16 to 1-7.\n\nThat was a final round group game at P\u00e1irc U\u00ed Chaoimh and Cork's 12-point win secured top spot in the table, easing them through to the championship's last four.\n\nAs if to underline Cork's quality, Ger Manley's side demolished Dublin by 4-17 to 0-9 in their semi-final, while Galway have battled beyond Waterford and Tipperary to reach the decider.\n\nThey simply can't afford a repeat of the performance they gave against Cork in late June, Black says.\n\n\"We had a lot of games on the road, one after the other,\" she says, reflecting on the build-up to that last meeting. \"But Cork wanted it more that day. We didn't show up. Our work rate wasn't in it. They ran at us, got all the scores they needed. They were just the better team that day.\n\n\"We had to sit down and have a look at ourselves after that. A performance like that is not going to win us any games. We had a six-day turnaround to play Waterford in the quarter-final so we really had to dust ourselves down and go again.\n\n\"We didn't have any time to feel sorry for ourselves. And we had great victories over Waterford and Tipperary, so hopefully that defeat will stand to us, that we'll learn a lot from those games.\"\n\n[ Cork camogie captain Molly Lynch aiming for two All-Ireland titles in one weekOpens in new window ]\n\nGalway did beat Cork in the league, on their way to the final.\n\n\"They've kicked on another notch since the league,\" Black says. \"They had a great victory over Dublin, so it will be a tough battle. We're saying to just treat it like any other game. We have a lot of girls with experience of All-Irelands, and from winning in 2021, we've had league finals as well and experience of playing in Croke Park so hopefully the occasion won't get to the girls.\"\n\nBlack has been enjoying the Olympics and the success of so many Irish athletes.\n\n\"The boxing, the swimming, you could go on for a long time with how amazing they all are,\" she says. \"No more than ourselves, they are athletes trying to juggle everything so you get motivation from them as well.\"\n\nBlack won gold herself with Galway three years ago, when they beat Cork in the 2021 All-Ireland decider.\n\n\"Just a great win for Galway,\" she says. \"We beat Cork that day in a thrilling game.

All the focus is on Sunday for the moment anyway.\"\n\nA debutant under Paudie Murray in 2014, Looney is one of the most experienced members of a Cork team aiming to strengthen their county's position atop the roll of honour by claiming a 30th title.\n\nThe 27-year-old said: \"It's actually crazy now when I reflect on it. I think I was brought into the panel when I was 17 and I was really grateful for that experience.\n\n\"I played very little of that Championship in 2014 but just to be in that high-performance environment and around so many great players.\n\n\"It showed you exactly what's required, what success means and how you get there.\n\n\"I think that has really stood to me in terms of the standards that I like to drive within the current set-up.\"\n\nNow bidding to bag her SIXTH All-Ireland senior camogie medal, dual star Looney was also part of the Cork football panel that landed the Brendan Martin Cup in 2016.\n\nHer continued importance to her county's cause was illustrated last November when she was recognised with her third All-Star award.\n\nShe said: \"It's been a rollercoaster. I do wonder if 17-year-old me would be proud if they could have foreseen the journey that I've been on - and I think they would.\n\n\"I've obviously developed as a player, probably starting out as a corner-forward, playing in nearly every position and now maybe landing on half-back, midfield.\n\n\"I suppose you grow up as a player but as a person as well. Paudie Murray probably had his hands full dealing with me living my best life during my college years but I don't regret any of that.\n\n\"Things become a bit simpler as you get older. Things change but the hunger is still there.\"\n\nTheir progress to another All-Ireland final via a series of comprehensive wins suggests that Cork are a side ready to kick on from last year's triumph.\n\nThey had 12 points to spare against Galway in the group stages, before booking their place in the decider with a 20-point hammering of Dublin.\n\nLooney said: \"I don't think I've been in a team that's as competitive as this one has been for the last couple of years.\n\n\"I might be around a lot longer than a lot of other players but I still have a point to prove every time I go training. That's what drives our standards.\"\n\nAlthough they comfortably overcame Galway when the teams last met, Looney insists that the 2-16 to 1-7 win at SuperValu P\u00e1irc U\u00ed Chaoimh will have no bearing when they clash again on Sunday.\n\nWith the 2021 All-Ireland final loss to the Tribe fresh in her memory, she told SunSport: \"It's Cork versus Galway at Croke Park and we've seen how that can go.\n\n\"Any time we play them in a semi-final or a final there's never more than a score between us.\n\n\"To be honest, when I saw that Galway beat Tipp in their semi-final I was nearly happy with that because you just know what you're getting.\n\n\"It's going to be a ding-dong battle, hell for leather and we won't look into what happened down the P\u00e1irc at all.\n\n\"An experienced Galway team with the players that they have, they'll bring something that we haven't experienced all year.\"", "source": {"uri": "thesun.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Irish Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "paul_dollery@thesun.ie", "name": "Paul Dollery", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galway_GAA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Galway GAA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterford_GAA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Waterford GAA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cork_(city)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cork (city)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cork (city)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camogie", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Camogie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-Ireland_Senior_Hurling_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paudie_Murray", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paudie Murray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aghada_GAA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aghada GAA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-Ireland_Minor_Hurling_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "All-Ireland Minor Hurling Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-Ireland_Senior_Ladies'_Football_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "All-Ireland Senior Ladies' Football Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GAA_GPA_All_Stars_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "GAA GPA All Stars Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SuperValu_(Ireland)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "SuperValu (Ireland)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaelic_football,_hurling_and_camogie_positions", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gaelic football, hurling and camogie positions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P\u00e1irc_U\u00ed_Chaoimh", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "P\u00e1irc U\u00ed Chaoimh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croke_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Croke Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dublin", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dublin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dublin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Part-Time_Employment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Part-Time Employment", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.thesun.ie/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/08/crop-13578603.jpg?strip=all&quality=100&w=1920&h=1080&crop=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9796883", "eventUri": "eng-9796883", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-02-16", "dateEnd": "-01-07", "textStart": 3164, "textEnd": 3175}], "sentiment": 0.4588235294117646, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

Black admitted: \"At the start of the year when you're asked to be captain, collecting the O'Duffy Cup in the Hogan Stand is probably the first thing you visualise.\n\n\"That's a good thing to do when you're trying to build that belief that you're capable of winning a final.\"\n\nGalway have twice been crowned All-Ireland champions since Black first joined the senior panel in 2016.\n\nBut this Sunday will mark her first appearance in a decider.\n\nOwing to a trajectory that has seen her categorised as a late bloomer, she has been a key player since nailing down her place as a regular starter in 2022.\n\nHaving learned what is required to thrive at the highest level of the game, the primary school teacher at Scoil Mhuire in Oranmore was a star pupil last term as she ended the 2023 campaign as Galway's only All-Star.\n\nShe explained: \"I suppose it just comes down to giving it my all in regards to training, the gym and looking after my nutrition.\n\n\"I've put everything into it over the last few years and I suppose I've seen the benefits of that.\n\n\"Confidence and belief in myself is a huge thing as well.\n\n\"All of those things coming together has allowed me to establish myself further on the team.\"\n\nDefending champions Cork, who go into Sunday's final as odds-on favourites, trounced Waterford to win last year's All-Ireland.\n\nBut within the Rebels' camp, the preceding semi-final was widely acknowledged as the monkey-off-the-back moment that paved the way for their 29th title. Cork had suffered EIGHT consecutive defeats to Galway in all competitions before finally prevailing by 0-15 to 2-6 at UPMC Nowlan Park.\n\nThe outcome was the same when the teams met earlier in this year's campaign, with the home side easing to a 12-point triumph at SuperValu P\u00e1irc U\u00ed Chaoimh.\n\nBlack insisted: \"All those other games didn't matter at that stage last year because they beat us in an All-Ireland semi-final and knocked us out of the Championship.\n\n\"The past was irrelevant then and that's the same going into this weekend.\n\n\"They've had one up on us since then and they beat us in the group game very well recently too. We're the ones trying to get at them now. That's the challenge for us now on Sunday.\"\n\nRegaining the upper hand over Cork would see boss Cathal Murray steer Galway to All-Ireland success for the third time since he was appointed in 2018.\n\nAnd Black, who is an hour away from becoming just the fourth player to captain her county to camogie's biggest prize, is glowing in her praise of the gaffer.\n\nShe said: \"Cathal has instilled a lot of belief and confidence into all of us.\n\n\"Himself and his management team have got that extra bit of professionalism about them. You really feel like you're being looked after when you're playing for Cathal.\n\n\"He puts his life and soul into this team and we're forever grateful for everything he has done for us already.\n\n\"His passion is clear to see and he really believes in us.\"\n\nA rampant Cork side have posted an average winning margin of more than 18 points per game in their six outings en route to a fourth straight All-Ireland final.\n\nBlack added: \"The fact that they're going for back-to-back All-Irelands tells you what a great team they are.\n\n\"It's hard to pinpoint one thing about them because they're strong in all areas.\n\n\"They work the ball very well, they're good at taking their scores, their fitness is really good -- they're a team that has set the standard so it's up to us and everyone else to get up to that.\n\n\"Whenever you win an All-Ireland, everyone is out to get you and to take your title from you.\n\n\"They've had a really good Championship so far and they've beaten everyone by quite a substantial amount.\n\n\"It's going to be extremely tough but we'll give it our all and hopefully things will go our way.\"", "source": {"uri": "thesun.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Irish Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "paul_dollery@thesun.ie", "name": "Paul Dollery", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(Gaelic_games)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Captain (Gaelic games)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-Ireland_Senior_Hurling_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cork_(city)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cork (city)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cork (city)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galway", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Galway"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Galway"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O'Duffy_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "O'Duffy Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hogan_Stand", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hogan Stand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oranmore", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Oranmore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oranmore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counties_of_Ireland", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Counties of Ireland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camogie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Camogie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croke_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Croke Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Captain (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UPMC_Nowlan_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UPMC Nowlan Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GAA_GPA_All_Stars_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "GAA GPA All Stars Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterford", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Waterford"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Waterford"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-Ireland_Under-20_Hurling_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "All-Ireland Under-20 Hurling Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SuperValu_(Ireland)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "SuperValu (Ireland)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P\u00e1irc_U\u00ed_Chaoimh", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "P\u00e1irc U\u00ed Chaoimh"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Part-Time_Employment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Part-Time Employment", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://www.thesun.ie/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/08/crop-13574116.jpg?strip=all&quality=100&w=1920&h=1080&crop=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9796883", "eventUri": "eng-9796883", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.388235294117647, "wgt": 156, "relevance": 1}

Going back doing any sport after having a baby is no easy feat and to be going out on Croke Park on the biggest camogie day in the year is just unbelievable.\n\n\"There's girls there going for a couple of medals, there's girls just going for their first and I would be absolutely thrilled to see the girls come away with the cup on Sunday.\"\n\nOne young fan and player is more excited than most ahead of the game. Ten-year-old Zara Calvey is going to be one of the flag bearers at Croke Park.\n\n\"I'll have to walk out with the team, with the players on the pitch and carry out the flag.\n\n\"I'll be so proud and so excited. I still can't believe that I got it.\"\n\nAssistant Secretary of Galway Camogie Ann Kearney believes \"it means everything to be in the final\".\n\nShe has seen the team work very hard all year, especially after losing up to ten players since 2022 meaning a lot of team building had to be done, particularly during the league and championships.\n\n\"When you're up there in Croke Park, and when you win, it is everything.\"\n\nShe has seen great support from businesses in the clubs this year, sponsoring their own club's stars to help fundraise, and she's urging them to keep supporting the ladies.\n\n\"We need that money to bring the O'Duffy across the Shannon and we want that support up in Croke Park this year.\n\n\"We're in our 120th anniversary and wouldn't it be lovely if we had so many people up there to support the great team that we have today.\"\n\nThis is Galway's third All Ireland final this year, but the county has yet to bring home a cup.\n\nGalway Camogie Chairperson Brian Griffin does not think this last chance at an All Ireland victory is putting any additional pressure on the team.\n\n\"They're up against it, let's be honest about it. It's a serious Cork team so to be there, we'll go up, we'll give it our best shot but no, we wouldn't say there's pressure.\n\n\"Obviously it would have been nice if the lads and the ladies that went before us had won but no there's no pressure.

Twelve months later, and for the third time in six years, the All-Ireland senior final was decided by a single point.\n\nKilkenny edged Cork before, twelve months later, the current Rebel generation finally got their hands on the O'Duffy Cup.\n\nWaterford were blown away by a terrific all-round team performance highlighted by Amy O'Connor's mesmeric haul of 3-7.\n\nRedemption never tasted sweeter as the confetti fell on top of Cork's players and mentors on Croke Park's rain-sodden surface that July afternoon.\n\n2023's All-Ireland success also marked Matthew Twomey's final game in charge. So whoever took over had big shoes to fill.\n\nIt is one thing stepping into the increasingly demanding world of senior inter-county Camogie management.\n\nIt is even harder when the panel you've assumed command of has just won an All-Ireland.\n\nThat was the task bestowed upon Ger Manley, someone who'd been involved in Twomey's backroom team and knew exactly what he was getting into.\n\nSimilar to Cork senior hurling manager Pat Ryan and football equivalent John Cleary, Manley is a straight talker.\n\nCork's new senior manager laid out his intentions right from the off. Winning another All-Ireland was Cork's target and he believed he had the players to achieve that goal.\n\nLeaving no one, inside or outside the Cork dressing room, in any doubt as to why he accepted the role, Manley's confident declaration set the correct tone right from the off. His players responded.\n\nAlways approachable when it comes to incessant media demands, Cork's new senior manager has overseen a hugely impressive championship run.\n\nAlthough disappointed not to qualify for this year's National League final, Manley kept his players' eyes firmly on their main target.\n\nWexford, Down, Clare, Dublin and Galway were defeated in the group stages and, at times, in swashbuckling style. Heading to Nowlan Park for a semi-final meeting with Dublin, Cork racked up 4-17 and set their GPS' for Jones' Road, Dublin 9.\n\n\"We did a lot of work over the last three weeks and have worked extremely hard,\" Ger Manley shortly after Cork's semi-final victory.\n\n\"Liam Cronin has done a fine job with them. It will be a different battle now against a seasoned opponent in Galway.\n\n\"The final is there to be won. That was our goal at the start of the year, to get back to another final. First job done.\n\n\"Next job is to win it.\"\n\nCathal Murray will be standing on the same Croke Park side-line next Sunday.\n\nThe Galway manager is no stranger to success having overseen the Connacht county's 2021 All-Ireland final win over Cork.\n\nThe manner in which Galway saw off Tipperary in the penultimate round of this year's championship was the best possible reminder of the task facing Ger Manley and his backroom team.\n\nAilish O'Reilly, Aoife Donohue, Niamh Hanniffy, Niamh Kilkenny, Dervla Higgins and Sarah Healy were part of Galway's success three years ago. Those battle-hardened warriors know exactly what is needed to beat the Rebels.\n\nYet, Ger Manley can point to his own side's capabilities.\n\nThe half-back line of Hannah Looney, Laura Treacy and Laura Hayes has been amongst best in the country this year.\n\nAdd in Saoirse McCarthy, Aoife Healy and the ever-reliable Ashling Thompson's consistent performances and the Rebels have every reason to be confident.\n\nLast line of defence, Amy Lee, Meabh Murphy, Izzy O'Regan and Pamela Mackey have conceded a meagre four goals in six All-Ireland championship outings.\n\nAmy O'Connor remains as dependable as ever but Katrina Mackey's work rate on and off the ball has increased Cork's forward line's scoring opportunities this year. O'Connor and Orlaith Cahalane continue to benefit from Mackey's presence.\n\nThus far, Manley's biggest achievement has been increasing the depth and quality of his squad.\n\n1-4 off the bench against Dublin was no surprise when you consider Sorcha McCartan, Clare O'Sullivan, Clodagh Finn and Orlaith Mullins' combined talents.\n\nGer Manley has Cork primed for another tilt at the O'Duffy Cup despite defenders M\u00e9abh Cahalane (passed fit to play) and Libby Coppinger's long-term injury absences.\n\nIt will be far from straightforward against Galway but we anticipate red and white confetti floating down from the top of the Hogan Stand on Sunday.", "source": {"uri": "echolive.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "Echo Live"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ger_Manley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ger Manley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(Gaelic_games)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manager (Gaelic games)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galway_GAA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Galway GAA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-Ireland_Senior_Hurling_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cork_(city)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cork (city)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cork (city)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camogie", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Camogie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croke_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Croke Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilkenny_GAA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kilkenny GAA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterford_GAA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Waterford GAA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dublin", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dublin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dublin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UPMC_Nowlan_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UPMC Nowlan Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1994\u201395_National_Hurling_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "1994\u201395 National Hurling League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cleary_(Gaelic_footballer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John Cleary (Gaelic footballer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niamh_Kilkenny", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Niamh Kilkenny"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Ryan_(Cork_hurler)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pat Ryan (Cork hurler)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O'Duffy_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "O'Duffy Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hurling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clare_GAA", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Clare GAA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wexford_GAA", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wexford GAA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashling_Thompson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ashling Thompson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hogan_Stand", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hogan Stand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tipperary_GAA", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tipperary GAA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connacht", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Connacht"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Connacht"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Part-Time_Employment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Part-Time Employment", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Gaelic", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Gaelic", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.echolive.ie/cms_media/module_img/8459/4229638_5_seoimageog_Cork_20Camogie_20at_20Castle_20Road_2c_20Blackrock-5.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9796883", "eventUri": "eng-9796883", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 150, "relevance": 1}

Meanwhile, Shannon Corcoran has returned to training after successfully recovering from a shoulder problem.\n\nR\u00f3is\u00edn Black and her teammates have gotten stronger as this year's championship has progressed, and after hard fought wins over Waterford and Tipperary in their last two matches, they are 60 minutes away from a first All-Ireland title since 2021.\n\nHowever, the Tribeswomen face a huge challenge in taking on the title holders in what will be the third meeting between the teams in 2024. The sides' first meeting was in a league encounter in late March in Ballinasloe which Galwaywon on a 0-14 to 0-9 scoreline.\n\nThe second meeting was a fifth round group encounter in June at P\u00e1irc U\u00ed Chaoimh,when the Leesiders ran out comprehensive winners on a 2-16 to 1-7 scoreline. Cork subsequently recorded a 20-point win over Dublin the All-Ireland semi-final to qualify for the championship decider and give themselves the opportunity of retaining the title.\n\nThe Rebels are a very formidable team, with abundant strength throughout the pitch, and the confidence that goes with being All-Ireland champions.

This year Kilkenny have continued to show their strength.\n\nThey are unbeaten in the All-Ireland series with five wins from six, where a draw with Dublin was the only time they failed to record a victory.\n\nThey left everything on the pitch as they battled with Kerry for over 80 minutes to secure their place in the final.\n\nIt was nip and tuck all thoughtout and again in extra time as both sides went for it and it was Caroline Kennedy's goal in the second half of extra time that proved decisive in securing a win for Seamus Kelly's side and a place in the final.\n\nThe experienced Danielle Morrissey is a huge player for them, and she has been notching up the scores from play and placed balls on a consistent level all through the campaign.\n\nShe is a strong midfielder, who likes to attack and Cork will need to do a marking job on her.\n\nIn their semi-final outing versus Offaly, it was the Cork defence that stood strong in the closing stages as the pressure came on.\n\nAoife Barrett and Emma Flanagan in particular were superb, but as a unit, the Cork rear-guard was strong.\n\nNiamh O'Leary was absent due to a hamstring injury and if she is fit to start it will mean a reshuffle of the defence, where one option could be to have Barrett or Flanagan move out to pick up Morrissey, who will most likely line out at eight.\n\nUp front, Donie Daly will need more from his forwards.\n\nIn the semi-final win just two of the starting six forwards got on the scoresheet.\n\nLauren Homan and Cliona Dooley contributing 2-9 between them.\n\nDefenders Laura Doyle and Olivia McAllen mirroring the Downey brothers from the Cork senior hurling side, came from defence to fire over a point each with substitute Eimear Duignan adding two points after her introduction to the game.\n\nThese sides are evenly matched, both have had impressive campaigns in the run up to the final.\n\nKilkenny as a county have been starved of success at all levels recently.\n\nCork are aiming to get the day off to a good start and hopefully make it a Rebel double.\n\nThey have the ability they now need to go out and get the job done.", "source": {"uri": "echolive.ie", "dataType":

Galway a point or two adrift, a ship needing steadying and Carrie Dolan standing over the ball in that trademark stance of her; the lift, the strike, the white flag.\n\nIn the topsy-turvy semi-final against Tipperary on a warm day in Nowlan Park last month, she was called into action again for two key scores. First the one that brought Galway back to within a point; the other for the winner on a day when the margins were so tight.\n\nWithout doubt, there will be situations on Sunday at Croke Park that will require the coolness to be unpacked again and used effectively. Carrie is no stranger to the big occasions. Indeed, in her last winning final, she contributed handsomely with six scores from frees.\n\nIn that win against Cork in 2021, Galway were at odds for some of it; were it not for Dolan's donation to the cause, the team could have been staring at back to back final defeats, following the winter capitulation in an almost empty Croke Park win December 2020.\n\nThe contrast between the 2020 final on a foggy damp night in the capital and the colourful summery scenes of 2019 and 2021 could not be greater. She played well in that winter final. One move in particular which spanned the length of the pitch led to a classic score, her fourth of that night.\n\nMemories of that December reverse were exorcised with Dolan's performance against Cork the next summer.\n\nDolan is the niece of Galway great and 2013 All-Ireland winner, Therese Maher But while Therese had to endure years of heartache before finally lifting the O'Duffy Cup, Dolan has already enjoyed All-Ireland success twice at just 24 years of age. And she has played a vital role in both triumphs.\n\nShe was Galway's top-scorer in the 2021 final while in the 2019 decider against Kilkenny, the Clarinbridge star chalked up another six-point tally. Five of her scores came from frees on that occasion, while the other point was a '45.\n\nDolan has been a prominent feature in Galway camogie throughout the underage ranks, playing in four All-Ireland finals across U16 and minor level.\n\nShe was first called into the Galway senior panel in 2016, but would have to wait until 2018 before earning a chance to make an impression. She immediately went about proving her worth as she was entrusted with the free-taking responsibilities for the Tribeswomen.\n\nAnd as we saw in Kilkenny two weeks ago, she still performs that job with distinction for her county.\n\nAfter watching the last two finals from home, she told me that it was some relief to get back to the decider once again.\n\n\"The last time were there was in 2021, losing two semifinal was disappointing, so it was great to get over Tipp the last day.\"\n\nHas she nerves of steel for such pressure frees?\n\n\"You set yourself down and go through the same routine. You can't think about it very much, but I was absolutely delighted when it went over.\n\nShe acknowledged that her opponents on Sunday will be favoured for the title.\n\n\"Cork will be raging hot favourites and we will be the underdogs, but we will go into that game with the same attitude we apply to every game,\" she said.\n\nCarrie welcomed the interest in the team shown by the large attendance at the open training session at Athenry last week.\n\n\"It is wonderful to see this. In 2013, we were inspired by that team.

When the two sides met in SuperValu P\u00e1irc U\u00ed Chaoimh in June, a place in the All-Ireland semi-final was at stake. Cork produced one of their performances of the year that day, eventually winning out by 12 points, 2-16 to 1-7. Cork manager Ger Manley was interviewed afterward and he knew that day wouldn't be the end of Galway's season.\n\n'We'll probably meet them later on down the line', Manley said. So it transpired with Galway defeating Waterford in the quarter-final 1-12 to 1-9, and Tipperary 1-12 to 1-11 in the semi-final.\n\nLooking ahead to the final, Galway manager Cathal Murray noted that if his team performs, he feels they're good enough to beat any side.\n\n'Finals are for winning. We're used to them now and we feel like we perform well in them. There won't be much in it we hope. It's about our performance and getting our game right and we've concentrated on that since our day down in P\u00e1irc U\u00ed Chaoimh. We're hoping for a performance and any time we perform we feel like we're good enough for any team,' Murray said.\n\nCork boss Ger Manley has been involved with the Rebels for the past three seasons, and has felt the anguish of defeat to the Marooners on plenty of occasions but he feels that the win in the All-Ireland semi-final last year was a turning point for his team.\n\n'I thought we got the monkey off our back last year in the semi-final. It took quite a good performance in Nolan Park to beat them. Even since I was involved, we lost to them in two league finals, we lost in the 2021 final and they beat us in the championship twice as well. Look, they're so formidable, and they've so many good players. But I think we've improved this year. Our standards have gone up, and I think if we perform, we have a great chance,' the Cork manager admitted.\n\nThe main reason behind Cork's success this season has been down to their scoring power. Having already totalled 132 points in the championship before the semi-final, that ability was reinforced in their 4-17 to 0-9 win over Dublin in the semi-final. All year it's been Amy O'Connor and Katrina Mackey carrying the scoring load for the Rebels but against Dublin, it was Orlaith Cahalane and Saoirse McCarthy who took up the mantle notching 2-2 and 1-2 respectively. Cork also had 11 different scorers against the Dubs and that spread of scoring power will definitely be one of the Leesiders' main arsenals come Sunday evening.", "source": {"uri": "southernstar.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Southern Star"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ger_Manley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ger Manley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galway_GAA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Galway GAA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-Ireland_Senior_Hurling_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cork_(city)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cork (city)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cork (city)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(Gaelic_games)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Manager (Gaelic games)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P\u00e1irc_U\u00ed_Chaoimh", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "P\u00e1irc U\u00ed Chaoimh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SuperValu_(Ireland)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SuperValu (Ireland)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camogie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Camogie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croke_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Croke Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tipperary_GAA", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tipperary GAA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterford_GAA", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Waterford GAA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UPMC_Nowlan_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UPMC Nowlan Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dublin", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dublin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dublin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Part-Time_Employment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Part-Time Employment", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://img.resized.co/southernstar/eyJkYXRhIjoie1widXJsXCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL2ltYWdlcy5zb3V0aGVybnN0YXIuaWVcXFwvdXBsb2Fkc1xcXC8yMDI0XFxcLzA4XFxcLzA4MTA1MTA3XFxcLzEwLVNQTy1Db3JrLXYtR2Fsd2F5LmpwZ1wiLFwid2lkdGhcIjoxMjAwLFwiaGVpZ2h0XCI6NjMwLFwiZGVmYXVsdFwiOlwiaHR0cHM6XFxcL1xcXC93d3cuc291dGhlcm5zdGFyLmllXFxcL2ltYWdlc1xcXC9wbGFjZWhvbGRlci5wbmdcIixcIm9wdGlvbnNcIjpbXX0iLCJoYXNoIjoiMDNiM2U4MDg2NjFlNWIyZGQwNTljZDVmNTI5ZDBmYjA0ZmIyM2FlNSJ9/cork-scoring-power-key-to-keeping-hold-of-o-duffy-cup.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9796883", "eventUri": "eng-9796883", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-02-16", "dateEnd": "-01-07", "textStart": 512, "textEnd": 523}, {"amb": false, "date": "-01-12", "dateEnd": "-01-09", "textStart": 771, "textEnd": 782}, {"amb": false, "date": "-01-12", "dateEnd": "-01-11", "textStart": 798, "textEnd": 810}, {"amb": false, "date": "-02-02", "dateEnd": "-01-02", "textStart": 2518, "textEnd": 2529}], "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 148, "relevance": 1}

For the last two years, he has had no choice, having seen his side lose close semi-finals and then watch as the victors went on to take the title each year.\n\nFor Murray, since his elevation to the post in 2018, his side have been associated with glory. Two wins and one loss in finals, that loss coming in the doom and gloom of that winter All-Ireland in a city in the grip of a pandemic. The wins came in the glorious sunshine; the loss in the dark and the fog of an empty stadium.\n\n\"It was tough not to be in the last two finals, especially when we were beaten by the two winners,\" he tells me after his side hosted an open training session in Athenry last week.\n\n\"Our whole season revolves around getting to the All Ireland Final.

However, you can tell those stats don't bother the Galway coach and that he will let his charges do the talking come Sunday.\n\n\"We don't need to build Cork up for any advantage. They've built themselves up over the last number of weeks and months. They beat us by twelve points down in Pairc Ui Chaoimh and we had no excuses. They were by far the better team, and for them to go on and score 4-17 in an All-Ireland semifinal is remarkable,\" he said.\n\n\"I am delighted with our performance against Tipperary, especially the second half and it is all about building on that.\"\n\n\"We know it is a massive challenge.

The Ladies Gaelic football Association are celebrating their 50th anniversary, while camogie, who stage their three All-Ireland finals next Sunday in Croke Park, are 120 years old.\n\nThe Camogie Association, or Cumann Cam\u00f3ga\u00edochta na nGael was set up in 1904. The inaugural match under the new Association took place at a Gaelic League Fair in Meath, between Craobh an Cheithnigh and C\u00fachulainn. But the first final was not played until 1932 when Dublin beat Galway in the final and 92 years on Galway are also in the final on Sunday when they face Cork, who have won the O'Duffy Cup a record 29 times.\n\nCork, who had a facile win over Dublin in the semi-final, will probably start as favourites. Meanwhile Galway, who had a hard-fought one-point win over Tipperary in their semi-final, will want to avoid being the third county team to lose a final on three consecutive Sundays.\n\nWhile Cork has great history going right back to the start of the women's game, all four of Galway's wins have all come in recent years; their first was in 1996 when they beat Cork, then came wins in 2013 and 2019, and in 2021 when they beat Cork again. The Cork squad has changed a lot in recent years with most of their dual stars now retired, but the excellent Ashling Thompson is still doing the business at midfield.\n\nThe game is very strong in the Rebel County and Cork will also contest the Intermediate final where they play Kilkenny, with winners receiving the Nancy Murray Cup. In the opening game on Sunday Laois and Tipperary will meet in the Junior final, where the winners are presented with the Kathleen Mills Cup. Mills was a Camogie legend, winning 15 All-Ireland titles with her native Dublin.\n\nWe had an unforgettable All-Ireland senior hurling final between Clare and Cork. However, the rules are stricter in Camogie where no unintentional physical contact is allowed, in other words, there is no shoulder-to-shoulder tackle as there is in hurling. But the skill levels are high and hopefully we will see another great \"hurling/camogie\" game to remember.\n\nEPL club Everton completed the signing of Republic defender Jake O'Brien from Lyon on a four-year deal for reported fee of around \u00a317 million. The 23-year-old Cork-born centre back, made 27 appearances for the Ligue 1 side last season. He made his international debut when coming on as a half-time sub against Hungary in June and won his second cap in the 3-0 defeat to Portugal a few days later.\n\nThe Youghal, East Cork, native O'Brien is Everton's fifth summer signing in the pre-season., he was also a useful hurler and boxer in his younger days. He joined Crystal Palace from Cork City in Feb. 2021. Palace loaned him to Swindon Town and later to Belgian club RWD Molenbeek for the 2022-23 season. In August 2023 he signed for French club Lille making his debut in October 2023 to become the first Irish player since Tony Cascarino in 2000 to play in Ligue 1.\n\nO'Brien said. ''I have been dreaming of this kind of move to the EPL. It's a very exciting move for me. When the transfer window opened there were other clubs in for me but there was only one club I wanted to go to and that was Everton They have shown the faith in me so now it's my turn to show why on the pitch.''\n\nIrish soccer international Denise O'Sullivan has agreed a new two-year deal with North Carolina Courage, ending speculation that she'd join Manchester United. The 30-year-old, who has won 109 Irish caps, had been linked with a move to the Women's Super League as her most recent contract with the Courage wound down. O'Sullivan moved to the Courage from Houston Dash in 2017 and has been a hugely influential figure ever since. O'Sullivan, who was given the captain's armband last year, has led the club to seven NWSL trophies during her eight seasons in North Carolina. She was key to the team win the NWSL Championships in 2018 and 2019 with three straight NWSL Shields from 2017 through 2019 and a pair of NWSL Challenge Cup titles in 2022 and 2023, while also helping the Courage claim the inaugural ICC Championship in 2018. O'Sullivan said: ''I am delighted and honoured to extend my time with the North Carolina Courage. When I joined seven years ago, I had no idea how big an impact this club would have on me as a player and a person.''\n\nTurnover at Croke Park stadium declined nearly 20 per cent to \u20ac42m during 2023 due to a lack of concerts and events being held at the facility, newly filed accounts show. During its latest financial year, ending September 30, 2023, the directors of Croke Park reported a surplus of \u20ac3.2m, which is up from \u20ac285,000 in 2022. However, this is largely as a result of a lower distribution to the GAA's Ard Chomhairle. In 2022, this distribution amounted to \u20ac17m, which dropped to \u20ac15m last year.\n\nMickey Harte, who abruptly quit as Derry's senior football manager last month, has been mentioned as a possible replacement for Glen Ryan in Kildare, but it looks very much like the next Lilywhite manager will be Brian Flanagan. The Johnstownbridge clubman was Kildare's manager when they won the All-Ireland under 20 final last year. He was also involved with Meath club Summerhill as they won the Meath senior championship in 2023. Whoever gets the Kildare job will have to plan without Eoin Doyle who has brought the curtain down on his 13-year inter-county career with the Lilywhites. The Naas clubman captained Kildare for four years between 2016 and 2019 and also represented Ireland in the International Rules series in 2015.\n\nUlster GAA has welcomed recent positive noises emanating from Britain's new Labour Government on prioritising the redevelopment of Casement Park. In the latest twist, Prime Minister Keir Starmer has reportedly told UEFA that he will push for what the Times of London labelled a \"controversial \u00a3310 million bailout of Casement Park\" to allow Northern Ireland to host games at the Euro 2028. The actual funding shortfall for Casement Park is likely to be considerably less, when you factor in previous commitments from the Stormont Executive (\u00a362.5m), Irish Government (\u00a343m) and the GAA (\u00a315m) amounting to over \u00a3120m, or approximately \u20ac142 million.\n\nThis has been a great year for the GAA in Ulster, culminating in Armagh beating Galway to win the Sam Maguire Cup for only the second time in their history. In addition to the All-Ireland senior football title, Ulster counties and clubs won practically everything in Gaelic football in 2024. The list of winners reads as follows: National Football League Division 1: Derry; National Football League Division 2: Donegal; Tailteann Cup: Down; All-Ireland Junior Club: Arva (Cavan); All-Ireland Intermediate club: Cullyhanna (Armagh); All-Ireland Senior Club: Glen (Derry); All-Ireland Under 20: Tyrone; All-Ireland Minor: Derry; Sigerson Cup: Ulster University; Colleges Hogan Cup: Omagh CBS.\n\nTOM O'BRIEN, 95\n\nTom O'Brien, one of the last surviving members of the 1954 Meath All-Ireland winning team, has died at the age of 95. He was the first captain of a Skryne team to lift the Keegan Cup, when the Tara club won the silverware a year after the trophy was introduced. Tom won an All-Ireland Junior in 1952 and two years later starred a midfield in the win over Kerry.", "source": {"uri": "irishecho.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Irish Echo"}, "authors": [],

The Irish competitors expected, and were expected, to medal and they did just that.\n\nThis is the fourth Olympics in the last five where Ireland has won medals in boxing while it is the third straight occasion where there have been Irish rowers on the podium. That has never happened before, in any discipline.\n\nIf, beforehand, one had had to pick two sports where Ireland would win medals, it's likely that they would have been the two chosen by the majority. Why? Because most are aware of the groundwork put in and the incremental progress made.\n\nThese were not overnight successes. Similarly, the swimming achievements by Mona MacSharry and Daniel Wiffen mark the culmination of excellent work by Swim Ireland.\n\nWe have become used to rowing excellence but, even so, Paul O'Donovan and Fintan McCarthy winning back-to-back golds was also a first for Ireland.\n\nPhilip Doyle and Daire Lynch may not have got the same praise but it's worth noting their bronze was Ireland's first heavyweight rowing medal at the Olympics.\n\nAnd yet, as nice as the accolades are, Kellie Harrington gave us a nice insight into her mindset after her semi-final win when saying that she was just making sure to live in the moment, win or lose.\n\nRhys McClenaghan was surely doing the same as he banished the demons of Tokyo with a nerveless display.\n\nThose superb competitors bringing medals home will be rightly lauded and it's likely that more opportunities will open up for them. They all deserve that.\n\nBut, one would hope that somebody in a position of influence is noticing what can come from concerted efforts and is making sure that other sports are given the chance to produce champions, too.\n\nAfter all, it is at the grassroots that the funding is best spent and not, as Conor Niland says, when they have made it to the top.\n\nIf any Cork fans were seeking positive omens ahead of Sunday's Liberty Insurance All-Ireland Senior Camogie Championship final, the roll of honour provides some comfort.\n\nThe Leesiders, who beat Waterford in last year's decider, face Galway at Croke Park (throw-in 5.15pm).\n\nSince the beginning of the 2005 season, Cork have won the O'Duffy Cup nine times - leaving aside the win over Waterford, the other eight came in four pairs of consecutive wins and so Ger Manley's side will look to continue that trend.\n\nWaterford's appearance in the 2023 final was the county's first time to reach such a stage since 1945.\n\nThis time around, their campaign ended at the quarter-final stage and, while the semis did have a fresh look in the presence of Tipperary and Dublin, they were beaten by Galway and Cork respectively, the former narrower than the latter.\n\nIt means that, since 2013, last year is the only one not to feature two of Cork, Kilkenny or Galway, with the Leesiders and the Tribeswomen clashing in two of those. Honours are even - Cork won in 2015 but Galway came out on top in 2021.\n\nHaving ended a five-year gap with last year's victory, Cork have benefited from the easing of the pressure that comes with a drought (by their standards) hanging over their heads and they have played like champions this year.\n\nThat included a group-stage win over Galway but the closer games in the knockout stages might stand to them.\n\nAs with ladies' football, the senior final is preceded by the junior and intermediate editions - Laois face Tipperary at 1.05pm in the junior Cork's second team take on their Kilkenny counterparts in the intermediate at 3pm.\n\nWinning a national title is obviously special no matter where you achieve it but to do so at Croke Park adds an extra dimension to it.\n\nWith the Camogie Association celebrating its 120th anniversary this year, hopefully the occasion proves to be a memorable, and well-attended one.", "source": {"uri": "farmersjournal.ie", "dataType": "news",

I think this is our fourth one in a row, but we never take it for granted,\" said Saoirse.\n\n\"We strive to get there every year and then we can enjoy the couple of weeks beforehand, the build-up and get ready for the match.\"\n\nCork won last year but suffered defeats the previous two seasons, so will be looking to make it two in a row on Sunday as well as two in four years.\n\nSaoirse said that it's a combination of the two that drives them on and that you remember the pain of defeat as well as the win.\n\n\"I'd say it's definitely a bit of both, the hurt from a couple of years ago isn't completely vanished yet, and we want to retain our title that we earned last year.\n\n\"I suppose every year we look at it differently, as every year is different. A new group of people can be there. So in a one way, you start from scratch but you're also carrying what you've learned in the past.\n\n\"I think this group now won't be the same next year. So every year you want to go, you want to win it and this year is no different.\n\nPeople talk about back-to-backs or, you know losing and winning but we're not thinking about that.\n\n\"We're literally taking it game by game and the next game is Galway and that's all that matters.\"\n\nLast season the competition for places in the squad was intense but this year it has gone up again.\n\nA few players have joined the squad this season and all are helping to drive up the intensity and Saoirse said it's driving then on in training to either make the team or a place on the bench.\n\n\"100% you're fighting every night in training for your place. When you're training, it's like championship, genuinely we play A v B sometimes at training and you couldn't tell which one was which.\n\n\"Tonight was one of those nights, players were on fire, everyone is fighting for a position the whole time.\n\n\"No one is safe and I think that adds to us as a squad. We're all so close and we know that while we're competitive with each other, we also mind each other and it's a good environment to be in.\"\n\nSHOWDOWN\n\nLooking at Galway Saoirse knows and expects another close battle with one of their arch-rivals over the last number of seasons.\n\nLast year Cork defeated the Tribeswomen in the semi-final before going on to beat Waterford in the final. It had been a number of years since Cork defeated Galway and it gave then a huge confidence boost.\n\nBut now it's the other way around and she is well aware Galway will be coming into this game hell-bent on revenge for that defeat.\n\n\"We'll do our tactics on Galway and we'll look at them the same way as we do every time we play.\n\n\"Obviously there's a lot of history there. They're one of the top dogs the last couple of years and they're a brilliant team and I have no doubt that the game down the Pairc (which Cork won well in group stages) is going to mean absolutely nothing on Sunday.\n\n\"They're going to be a different team altogether and we'll just have to rise to the occasion. They know how to win matches and we know, so it should be a good game.\"", "source": {"uri": "echolive.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "Echo Live"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camogie", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Camogie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galway_GAA", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Galway GAA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courcey_Rovers_GAA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Courcey Rovers GAA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-Ireland_Minor_Hurling_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "All-Ireland Minor Hurling Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-Ireland_Senior_Hurling_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croke_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Croke Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cork_(city)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cork (city)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cork (city)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dublin", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dublin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dublin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterford_GAA", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Waterford GAA"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Part-Time_Employment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Part-Time Employment", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://www.echolive.ie/cms_media/module_img/8482/4241149_1_seoimageog_Cork_20Camogie_20at_20Castle_20Road_2c_20Blackrock-5.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9796883", "eventUri": "eng-9796883", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 143, "relevance": 1}

Our standards have gone up | The Southern Star", "body": "CORK boss Ger Manley knows a big performance is needed to overcome a 'determined' Galway in the All-Ireland senior camogie final this Sunday in Croke Park.\n\nThe Rebels' quest for back-to-back O'Duffy Cups will see them meet their old foes from the west for the third time this year and Manley insists his side will need to be on top of their game to come away with silverware.\n\n'There's nothing between us,' he said.\n\n'I thought we got the monkey off our back last year in the semi-final. It took quite a good performance in Nolan Park to beat them. Even since I was involved we lost to them in two league finals, we lost in the 2021 final and they beat us in the championship twice as well.\n\n'Look, they're so formidable, and they've so many good players, a bit like ourselves. But I think we've improved this year. Our standards have gone up, and I think if we perform, we'll have a great chance.'\n\nGalway overcame Tipperary in their All-Ireland semi-final 1-12 to 1-11 and the performance left a strong impression on Manley.\n\n'They were so determined,' he remarked. 'Their passing is very impressive. Tipp got a run on them in the second half, but myself and Liam (Cronin) were just talking, and we always felt there was a kick in Galway, and there was.\n\n'They've so many household names. I think their experience shone through in the end. They're a bit like us in that way. They've been at the business end of the championship for so many years. Probably at this stage, it's second nature to them. Look, it's going to be tough going again.'\n\nThis will be Cork's fourth All-Ireland final in a row and Manley believes that Cork's experience from last year's decider against Waterford will be advantageous, helping his team handle the pressures of Croke Park.\n\n'It's our fourth final in a row, my third since I've been involved, and it's different every time you play in Croke Park, because it's intimidating,' he explained.\n\n'I think the fact that we won last year will help a good bit because we lost three finals before that. I think last year flipped it for us. Because we're heading in as champions now, we've something to defend.'\n\nManley notes the increased confidence and improved standards within the team, with players pushing each other on in training. The Rebels are ready and focused as the Cork boss highlights.\n\n'I think this year the players are a bit more confident.

They seem to have gone up another couple of levels and we look forward to the challenge of it.\n\n\"We have been building game on game and obviously we had a huge battle against Waterford in the quarterfinal. The Tipperary game could have gone either way, but I think we finished really strongly in the last ten minutes of that match.\n\n\"Hopefully, there is another performance coming this weekend,\" she added.\n\n\"It's brilliant for the county. When we were growing up, we loved looking up to players. It is great to see so many people here. Am sure they will go on and play for Galway in ten years time.\n\n\"It is great to have these days so that the kids can see the pathway for themselves and what can be achieved.

I was in my Leaving Certificate year and my first few years in college and then I took a break from it.\n\n\"After my first stint with the team I went away on a J1 and wanted to come back playing after that but Covid arrived so that was kind of it so when Seamus (Kelly) asked me in last year I was delighted.\n\n\"I played a lot of camogie down in UCC when in college and Seamus was my minor manager so that probably helped in me making my return.\n\n\"Everyone is asking me about the game but it's nice friendly banter in Cork at the moment.\n\n\"It's a big commitment coming up from Cork but I've got used to it over the last two years and you have to be super organised to get meals right but I'm a dietitian by trade so that helps.\"\n\nThe Leinster Intermediate winner has also noted a few changes since returning to the squad after a few years.\n\n\"I've been back the last two years and I've definitley noticed the sacrifcies and commitment that you have to make as it takes a lot to be here every night for training.\n\n\"You have to do all the right things and have yourself in order with training during the winter months but I've still really enjoyed the year and I knew what I was signing up for with the same management still involved as you know what way they all work.\"\n\nThe 25 year-old also admits that she has a number of friends coming up from Cork for the game even if they mightn't necessarily be supporting the Cats:\n\n\"Everyone has GAA on their minds down in Cork after they reached the All-Ireland Hurling Final and a lot of my friends are heading up to the game from there aswell and the train was already booked out before we even thought about it much but it'll be great to see all the colour around Croke Park so it'll be fantastic\", she added.\n\nKennedy has made a home in the Kilkenny defence this term and she's excited about appearing in Croke Park for the first time.\n\n\"It's very exciting and it's just a privilege to be involved at this time of the year and I'll try to enjoy the build-up as I've never been in an All-Ireland Final before and it's a great group to be involved with.\n\n\"Everyone is buzzing in training at the moment and all anyone is thinking about is the game and while the build-up is great, it's easy to get distracted with different things going on that we wouldn't be used to and it's really important to realise that we still have a job to do.\n\n\"I've never played in Croke Park so it will be a career highlight and I can't wait for it now\".\n\nAll county focus is now on the Intermediates and while Kennedy and co would love to have the seniors involved alongside them on Sunday, they know they have a job to do.\n\nThe Kerry win after extra-time was a big confidence boost for the group as it at that same stage where the 2023 campaign ended and getting that monkey off the back is a big thing for the team.\n\n\"It's mad being the only Kilkenny team left playing as we've normally went kind of hand in hand with the seniors and it was the same last year but it's still great for the Intermediates to get the recognition as all of the girls are great rolemodels for any youngster watching on. 1.\n\n\"We wouldn't say it's been a perfect championship campaign but it's definitley gone well and that's because we've trained so hard and there is still a bit of hurt over the way we lost out in last year's semi-final.\n\n\"That defeat has kind of being in our minds all year so it was really good to remember that and push on again.\n\n\"We would have learned a lot from the semi-final win and we know there are aspects we can improve on but digging out the win will also give us a lot of belief that we can beat these teams and even when we are up against it, we know we have the players to do damage so hopefully we can get one more big display.\"", "source": {"uri": "kilkennypeople.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "Kilkenny People"}, "authors": [{"uri": "robert_cribbin@kilkennypeople.ie",

"body": "It's an approach that counties often take on the back of a successful manager moving on, as Andy Moran ultimately was in Leitrim's case, with continuity offering the best chance at maintaining progress.\n\nWith news that Mickey Graham is to become the next Leitrim manager emerging this week, he will join the likes of John Cleary (Cork), Vinny Corey (Monaghan) and Dessie Dolan (Westmeath) in stepping up from within a management team to take the main role.\n\nIt's an approach that counties often take on the back of a successful manager moving on, as Andy Moran ultimately was in Leitrim's case, with continuity offering the best chance at maintaining progress.\n\nIt doesn't always work out like that, of course, but there have been some notable successes - and failures.\n\nREAD MORE: Offaly starlet's emotional family link as Screeneys bookend county's clean sweep\n\nREAD MORE: Armagh story can inspire counties like Leitrim says incoming boss Mickey Graham\n\nKieran McGeeney (Armagh)\n\nIn only one of the last 17 seasons has McGeeney not been manager of a senior inter-county team.\n\nThat was in 2014 when, fresh from being jettisoned by Kildare in a county board vote, then Armagh boss Paul Grimley immediately snapped him as a coach.\n\nArmagh reached that year's All-Ireland quarter-final, losing by a point to Donegal, after which Grimley stepped down, with McGeeney the natural successor.\n\nHe's had his low moments, including having to take Armagh out of Division Three twice as well as a relegation from Division One last year and penalty shootout defeats in a pair of Ulster finals and two All-Ireland quarter-finals, but, generally, Armagh's graph was trending upwards under his stewardship.\n\nStill, he had to survive another county board vote last year to remain in situ and he went on to guide Armagh to an against-the-head All-Ireland title this year, his first major trophy as a manager.\n\nMichael Ryan (Tipperary)\n\nTipperary took a most unusual approach in late 2014 when announcing that Ryan, then Eamon O'Shea's assistant manager, would take over after the 2015 season.\n\nTipperary had just lost an All-Ireland hurling final to Kilkenny after a replay and would go on to suffer a narrow semi-final defeat to Galway the following year, which concluded O'Shea's three years at the helm as Ryan stepped up.\n\nHe made a glorious start as Tipp swept to Munster and All-Ireland titles in 2016, romping home in the final against Kilkenny to deny their neighbours and fierce rivals a three-in-a-row.\n\nIt was all downhill for Ryan from there, however, as Tipp never fully recovered from a League final trimming from Galway in 2017 and when they failed to win a game in the new-look Munster round robin the following year, he departed.\n\nGer Loughnane (Clare)\n\nTipperary's Len Gaynor enjoyed a fine stint as Clare senior hurling manager, leading them to landmark victories over Cork and Tipperary as they reached successive Munster finals in 1993 and '94.\n\nFormer wing-back Ger Loughnane was added to his management team for his last season in 1994, but on the proviso that he would then succeed Gaynor, who stepped down after a heavy defeat to Limerick in that year's Munster final.\n\nLoughnane turned Clare from nearly men into serial achievers as they stormed to a first Munster title since 1932 and then bridged an 81-year gap to their last All-Ireland in his first season in 1995.\n\nThey matched those feats in 1997 - beating a Gaynor-managed Tipperary in both the Munster and All-Ireland finals in dramatic fashion.\n\nLoughnane inspired Clare to another Munster title in 1998 but they started to wane from there and he quit after a heavy defeat to Tipp saw them eliminated from the 2000 Championship at the Munster semi-final stage.\n\nClare had succession stakes in place once again as Cyril Lyons was added to Loughnane's management team and went on to succeed him.\n\nIt didn't work quite as well this time, however, though Lyons did lead Clare to the 2002 All-Ireland final, which was the highlight of his three-year term despite losing to Kilkenny.\n\nPat O'Neill (Dublin)\n\nHero of the '70s Paddy Cullen was tasked with bridging the gap to Dublin's previous All-Ireland in 1983 when appointed after the 1990 Championship campaign, which concluded with a Leinster final defeat to Meath, with former Pat O'Neill and Jim Brogan his selectors.\n\nRemarkably, Cullen's first Championship campaign encompassed four games, none of which were won, as Meath edged them out after a famous four-game saga in the first round of the Leinster Championship.\n\nHe steered them all the way to an All-Ireland final the following year but quit following a surprise four-point loss to Donegal, with O'Neill stepping into the breach.\n\nUnder O'Neill, Dublin dominated Leinster but couldn't crack Ulster opposition, losing to eventual winners Derry in the 1993 All-Ireland semi-final and to Down in the decider the following year.\n\nThey finally went one better in 1995, edging out Tyrone in a forgettable final, with O'Neill stepping down the following month after the opening League game against Leitrim at Croke Park.\n\nIt would be a further 16 years before Dublin won an All-Ireland.\n\nPaul Caffrey (Dublin)\n\nIt was going to take something spectacular to revitalise Tommy Lyons's reign as Dublin manager after Westmeath knocked them out of Leinster in 2004 and, though they reached the All-Ireland quarter-final via the qualifiers, the game was up after a heavy defeat to Kerry.\n\nLegendary figure Brian Mullins, who guided Derry to an Ulster title in 1998, was courted but ultimately couldn't find common ground with the county board, who then shone a light on Lyons's outgoing management team.\n\nSelector Paul Caffrey had enjoyed success with Na Fianna, leading them to the 2000 All-Ireland club final, and was eventually handed the reins.\n\nUnder 'Pillar', Dublin took control of the Leinster Championship and haven't relinquished it since but they couldn't crack the All-Ireland semi-final stage, losing narrowly to Mayo and Kerry respectively in 2006 and '07, with quarter-final defeats to Tyrone either side of those defeats.\n\nCaffrey resigned in the immediate aftermath of the 14-point loss to Mickey Harte's side in 2008, with Pat Gilroy taking over and ending the All-Ireland drought three years later.\n\nJohn Allen (Cork)\n\nA former Cork dual player, Allen first joined the senior hurling backroom team as a masseur under Jimmy Barry-Murphy ahead of the 1999 All-Ireland win and was brought on board as a selector by Donal O'Grady in late 2002 as he took over from Bertie Og Murphy.\n\nO'Grady led Cork to the 2003 All-Ireland final, losing to Kilkenny, and opted to step down after reversing that result in the decider the following year.\n\nWith continuity sought in the wake of his surprise departure and Seanie O'Leary, another selector, distancing himself from the role, Allen became the obvious choice.\n\nThe transition was seamless as Cork regained the Munster title in 2005 and retained the All-Ireland, who remains the last manager to lead the county to the Liam MacCarthy Cup.\n\nHe quit after Kilkeny dashed their three-in-a-row dreams in the 2006 final and though he was linked with a return on occasions, he never reprised the role.\n\nHe did lead Limerick to a Munster title in 2013 at Cork's expense, however.\n\nCork had previously tried promotion from within after Barry-Murphy's departure in 2000 as his selector Tom Cashman took charge, only to quit on the back of a first round defeat to Limerick in 2001.\n\nBrian Cuthbert (Cork)\n\nCuthbert had a hard act to follow as Cork senior football manager after Conor Counihan's departure in 2013.\n\nThe Aghada man had turned Cork into one of the most formidable sides in the game on the back of an acrimonious players' strike in 2008, winning three League and Munster titles as well as the 2010 All-Ireland.\n\nCuthbert wasn't involved in the 2010 breakthrough - he was managing the county minors at the time - but he was subsequently recruited by Counihan and succeeded him in October 2013 on a two-year term.\n\nHe couldn't arrest the deterioration that had set in towards the end of Counihan's term, however, and endured a difficult two years as Kerry held them at arm's reach in Munster and their progress was minimal in the All-Ireland series.\n\nGet the latest sports headlines straight to your inbox by signing up for free email

Trading from the back of a horsebox the coffee takeaway is known as Full of Beans, an expression that many apply to Laura as well.\n\nShe is delighted how the business is going and will have just two weeks of trading under her belt before the final, but she did admit she might be taking a few days off after Sunday.\n\n\"It's something that has been in the pipeline for a while and I was trying to pick the right week to start,\" said Laura, \"and I think if I didn't start last week, it probably would be a few weeks before I did because I'll definitely be taking a week off after Sunday regardless of the result.\n\n\"It was something to for me to do, a distraction and I'm absolutely delighted to get it up and running. It's been kind of hard and it was a good distraction for the last few weeks.\n\n\"It's called Full of Beans, it's a bit of a pun as something I kind of think I am myself as well. To be fair it's been absolutely brilliant, the whole village in Conna, has come to call and long may it last.\n\n\"It was an old horsebox and we renovated it and the village doesn't have any kind of cafe or anything. So it's just something I was thinking of for a while and I've been always really interested in coffee and I just finished my grad programme, so I was kind of thinking what I do next.\n\n\"So I'm going to try this for a while anyway. To be fair to the people in the community hall they have been putting out a load of chairs and everything, so they're very much on board the idea. People can sit outside or take it away.\n\n\"So if anyone is passing through Conna over the next few weeks, except for next week, then call in and we'll be delighted to sort you out for coffee.\"\n\nBut for now Laura's concentration is on Sunday and their day of destiny with Galway as they bid to win the title and their opponents aim for revenge for their loss to Cork in the semi-final last season.\n\n\"We're absolutely delighted to be back in Croke Park on Sunday and I suppose a lot of people would say that Galway has been our greatest rival over the last few years,\" said Laura, \"but we don't really mind who we're against once we are there, but I think it's going to be really good match knowing how Galway play anyway.\n\n\"I wouldn't say that it will be anything like the league game (which Galway won) and or the one down the Pairc (which Cork won in group stages) and we're certainly expecting it to be a really tough battle.\n\n\"I suppose you could say it's 1-1 this season so the final will be the decider and we're really looking forward to it. We know they were missing a lot of players for the game down the Pairc so it will be a huge battle on Sunday,\" concluded Laura.", "source": {"uri": "echolive.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "Echo Live"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camogie", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Camogie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coffee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bean", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conna", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Conna"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Conna"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter-county", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inter-county"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Catherine's_GAA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "St Catherine's GAA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GAA_GPA_All_Stars_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "GAA GPA All Stars Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-Ireland_Senior_Hurling_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croke_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Croke Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galway", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Galway"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Galway"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pun", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_transport", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pipeline transport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cork_(city)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cork (city)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cork (city)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://www.echolive.ie/cms_media/module_img/8481/4240975_1_seoimageog_LauraHayes.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9796883", "eventUri": "eng-9796883", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 117, "relevance": 1}

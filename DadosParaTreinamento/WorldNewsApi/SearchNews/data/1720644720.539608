Oliva Dunne, 22, shared a funny behind-the-scenes video of her and Travis Kelce from an energy drink commercial the two were filing together that included a reference to the Chiefs star\u2019s girlfriend Taylor Swift. The video opens with Kelce mouthing a voiceover of Dunne saying: \u201cI feel like you\u2019re just here for the zipline \u2013 which references a scene that went viral from the comedy show \u201cI Think You Should Leave.\u201d Instead this time the caption is: I feel like you\u2019re just here for the concert tickets.\u201d The video then flashes to Dunne taking a sip of an Accelerator energy drink while looking around and miming a \u201cWhat?\u201d in reply with a different voice dubbed over her. The caption to the post read, \u201cWho me?! Never #swiftie #taylorswift #traviskelce.\u201d Both Dunne and Kelce know what it is like to be the significant other of a fellow star. Last year, Swift and Kelce took the NFL and pop culture by storm as the Grammy-winner singer supported the tight end at games throughout Kansas City\u2019s season \u2013 all the way to their Super Bowl win over the 49ers. Kelce also traveled the globe with Swift during his off time to attend her highly successful Eras Tour. Dunne, 21, helped the LSU gymnastics team win their first national championship this past season and regularly supported her boyfriend \u2013 Pirates pitching phenom Paul Skenes \u2013 during his rise to the major league. She was on hand for the star as he faced the Dodgers on Wednesday. He allowed three runs over five innings \u2013 and stuck out Shohei Ohtani and Mookie Betts \u2013 to move to 3-0 as Pittsburgh won 10-6.", "summary": "Oliva Dunne shared a funny behind-the-scenes video of her and Travis Kelce from an energy drink commercial the two were filing together that included a reference to the Chiefs star\u2019s girlfriend Taylor Swift.", "url": "https://nypost.com/2024/06/08/sports/livvy-dunne-travis-kelce-team-up-for-suprise-tiktok-crossover/", "image": "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/newspress-collage-7z0rf1giy-1717851477156.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1717837157&w=1200", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 13:53:31", "author": "Joseph Staszewski", "authors": ["Joseph Staszewski"], "language": "en", "catgory": "entertainment", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.307}

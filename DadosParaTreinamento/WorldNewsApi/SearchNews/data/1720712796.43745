But one popular holiday destination that\u2019s home to some of the best eateries across the globe may just surprise you: Bangkok, Thailand. Although the country is better known for its full moon parties than its fine dining, six of the World\u2019s Best 100 Restaurants are located in Thailand\u2019s capital \u2014 one more than haute cuisine hotspot Paris. In at number nine, Gaggan was Bangkok\u2019s highest entry on 2024\u2019s list. Infusing Indian, French, Thai and Japanese influences, it aims to take diners on \u2018a culinary adventure of the senses and a roller coaster ride of emotions\u2019 with its theatrical 22-course menu of \u2018progressive\u2019 dishes. Next up was S\u00fchring (which holds two Michelin stars) at 23, a German-inspired \u2018breath of fresh air\u2019 in the energetic Thai city. The menu features takes on popular European dishes like Leipziger Allerlei (with Brittany lobster, white asparagus, peas and morels) and a currywurst street food tribute served in a box complete with wooden fork. https://www.instagram.com/p/C6oCDwAP1mD The third Bangkok entry was Le Du, which has a Michelin star and placed at a respectable 40th in the annual rankings. Here, you\u2019ll find Thai cuisine given a contemporary twist, from khao chae with jasmine-scented ice cream, pork pate, shrimp and pickled radish to grouper paired with prized ant eggs. While there\u2019s definitely merit in cheap eats from street food vendors, head chef Thitid \u2018Ton\u2019 Tassanakajohn wants people to see a different side of Bangkok\u2019s food scene, commenting: \u2018For a very long time, Thai ingredients have been underappreciated. At Le Du, we believe Thailand is one among the best places on earth for the finest ingredients.\u2019 https://www.instagram.com/p/CbJdBf0vRdD If stereotypes about rowdy backpackers and red light districts have put you off a trip to Bangkok, it\u2019s worth reconsidering. Not only is it officially a haven for foodies, it was described as a \u2018feast for the senses\u2019 by Lonely Planet and an \u2018unforgettable\u2019 destination by visitor Janettebystrom1 on Tripadvisor. Another reviewer, JamesDhaka, wrote: \u2018I have travelled to many big cities but Bangkok is my favourite: good value for money, people are friendly, great food, shopping, night life and safety, and the service you you get is world standard. Whether with family or alone, Bangkok is \u201cTHE\u201d place.\u2019 Must-try food and drink in Bangkok If you\u2019re a foodie visiting Bangkok, you\u2019ll be spoilt for choice. Its reputation for incredible, authentic street food makes it a perfect spot for trialling all sorts of dishes on a budget. Try the Bib Gourmand-recognised Sae Phun for moreish chicken stew and rice priced at just 65 baht (\u00a31.39), or stuff yourself with award-winning wok-fried noodles and meats at Guay Tiew Khua Gai Suanmali for as little as 100 baht (\u00a32.14). The street food scene here is famed worldwide (Picture: Getty Images) Jay Fai, which operates from a bare-bones shop on Maha Chai Road, is another Bangkok institution that many say is worth the long queues, and it\u2019s even earned a Michelin star for its crab omelettes. Wherever you go, just make sure to try local staples like pad thai (done properly), som tam papaya salad, pad krapao, mango sticky rice, and sweet noodle dish bokkia. Alternatively, if you\u2019re after a more refined experience, Bangkok has a range of acclaimed fine dining restaurants to choose from. Check out those on the World\u2019s Best list above, or have a nose on the Michelin website for guides.

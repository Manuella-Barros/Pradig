However, Caitlin Clark\u2019s stellar performance was certainly a silver lining for the nearly sold out arena that showed up for the Fever\u2019s third home game of the season. \"Honestly, I think I just played with an aggressive mindset. I think that was the biggest thing,\" Clark, who scored a career-high of 30 points, said after the game.

She is the only rookie to record those stats in a single game in WNBA history, according to ESPN. She also recorded the third-most points for a rookie in franchise history, with Tamika Catchings recording 32 points in her rookie season on two occasions.

It's just hard to win when they shoot 60% from 3, and we shoot 38% from the field. It\u2019s just hard to win basketball games like that.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The Fever are now 1-7 and just one game better than the Washington Mystics, who have the league-worst record of 0-6. Indiana\u2019s slide comes amid a grueling schedule, which Clark lamented has made it impossible for the team to practice. However, their next two games will keep them in Indiana until they travel to New York to face the Liberty on Sunday.

Enough to be influential, but not so much that I can't be overturned,\" he wrote on X in January. \"Unless that is the case, I would prefer to build products outside of Tesla.\"Tesla's board has been attempting to persuade investors to support the controversial package since it was struck down by a Delaware judge in January over concerns about its size and the board's independence.In the ruling, Court of Chancery Judge Kathleen St. J. McCormick said, \"The process leading to the approval of Musk's compensation plan was deeply flawed,\" adding that \"Musk had extensive ties with the persons tasked with negotiating on Tesla's behalf.\"The SpaceX CEO was quick to express his view on the ruling on X, writing, \"Never incorporate your company in the state of Delaware.\"In 2018, 73% of investors approved Musk's pay proposal, per the FT.If Tesla's board can now prove investors still back the deal, it may help an appeal case against the decision to void it.Losing the vote would be a major blow to the board and could call Musk's leadership into question.Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider, which was made outside regular working hours.", "summary": "Proxy advisory firm Glass Lewis said in a report that the compensation package was of \"excessive size\" and \"dilutive.\"", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-investors-advised-vote-against-elon-musk-pay-package-2024-5", "image": "https://i.insider.com/6652fa79239fda2da6cbd30d?width=1136&format=jpeg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 12:22:04", "author": "Nathan Rennolds", "authors": ["Nathan Rennolds"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.128}

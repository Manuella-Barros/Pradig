{"id": 231947874, "title": "James Tavernier 'wanted' by former Rangers boss Gio van Bronckhorst as Steven Gerrard Saudi transfer raid jeopardised", "text": "James Tavernier is wanted by a SECOND former Rangers gaffer with Giovanni van Bronckhorst wanting a reunion at Besiktas, according to a report. The Ibrox skipper is said to be still be wanted by Steven Gerrard in the Saudi Pro League alongside Connor Goldson but the Liverpool hero could now face competition to land the full-back. Record Sport exclusively revealed that the right-back and his centre-back colleague are on Al-Ettifaq's shopping list this summer. But now the efforts to land Tav could be jeopardised with Turkish publication Sozcu stating Gio's first demands in his new role. After his announcement as the new Besiktas manager, all eyes turned to the transfer front with the publication stating right-sided players are high on the agenda. They say that the Dutch coach has 'requested' the management go out and get Steven Berghuis from Ajax alongside Tavernier in a double swoop. Tavernier, 32, still has two years to run on his current terms in Glasgow and he showed his importance to the Light Blues once again last season with 24 goals and 12 assists across 58 appearances in all competitions. He boasts a staggering 125 goals and 129 assists from right-back in his Rangers career to date. Philippe Clement has already kicked off his summer business with the arrivals of full-back Jefte and winger Oscar Cortes. The latter had his loan spell last season disrupted by injury but a fresh one-year agreement with an obligation has been struck with Lens. A host of other names have been linked with moves to Govan as the Belgian looks to put his stamp on proceedings. Kemar Roofe, John Lundstram, Borna Barisic, Ryan Jack and Jon McLaughlin have all headed in the other direction after the expiry of their contracts.

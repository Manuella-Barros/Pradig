The historic pocket watch had been missing for 37 years due to theft. It was taken during the object's transition from the Sagamore Hill National Historic Site to the Theodore Roosevelt Inaugural Historic Site in Buffalo, New York. The invaluable silver pocket watch was gifted to then-future President Theodore Roosevelt by his sister Corinne and brother-in-law Douglas Robinson in 1898, according to the NPS in a media release. MEET THE AMERICAN WHO FOUNDED THE AMERICAN LEGION, THEODORE ROOSEVELT JR., PRIVILEGED TO FIGHT AND TO SERVE The 126-year-old keepsake is inscribed \"THEODORE ROOSEVELT FROM D.R. AND C.R.R.\" Roosevelt was given the watch while impatiently waiting in Washington, D.C. to join the Spanish American War, according to NPS. A week later, he left for San Antonio, Texas to lead the 1st U.S. Volunteer Cavalry. He served as 26th president from 1901 to 1909. The relic is a Waltham 17 jewel watch in a silver-coined case, with \"Riverside\" grade and model \"1888\" with a hunter-style case. The return of the presidential piece of history was announced by NPS Director Chuck Sams alongside Roosevelt family members, who thanked federal agents during a special event to celebrate the return this week.

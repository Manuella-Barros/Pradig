With global demand for aquatic foods expected to keep growing, an increase in sustainable production is vital to ensure healthy diets, the United Nations\u2019s Food and Agriculture Organization said. In 2022, aquaculture yielded 94.4 million tones of aquatic animal production \u2014 51 percent of the total, and 57 percent of the production destined for human consumption, it said. \u201cAquatic systems are increasingly recognized as vital for food and nutrition security,\u201d according to the report, released as experts gathered in Costa Rica for talks on ocean conservation. \u201cBecause of their great diversity and capacity to supply ecosystem services and sustain healthy diets, aquatic food systems represent a viable and effective solution that offers greater opportunities to improve global food security and nutrition,\u201d it added. While wild fisheries production has stayed largely unchanged for decades, aquaculture has increased by 6.6 percent since 2020, the report noted. The sustainability of wild fishery resources remained a cause for concern, it added. The proportion of marine stocks fished within biologically sustainable levels decreased to 62.3 percent in 2021, 2.3 percent lower than in 2019, the report said. \u201cUrgent action is needed to accelerate fishery stock conservation and rebuilding.\u201d Call for investment With the world\u2019s population projected to reach 8.5 billion by 2030, \u201cproviding sufficient food, nutrition and livelihoods for this growing population demands significant investments,\u201d it added. \u201cAquaculture has a major role to play, particularly in Africa where its great potential is not yet realized,\u201d the report said, noting that more than 40 percent of the world\u2019s population cannot afford a healthy diet. Aquatic products remain one of the most traded food commodities, generating a record $195 billion in 2022 \u2014 a 19 percent increase from pre-pandemic levels, it said. \u201cDespite these significant achievements, the sector still faces major challenges from climate change and disasters, water scarcity, pollution, biodiversity loss\u201d and other man-made impacts, it added. The report was released to coincide with a meeting in San Jose of country representatives, scientists and international experts to prepare for the third UN Ocean Conference, to be held in France in 2025. United Nations Under-Secretary-General for Social Affairs Li Junhua said at the start of the talks that protecting the ocean was \u201cnot an option but an imperative.\u201d Costa Rica\u2019s President Rodrigo Chaves, host of the two-day meeting, said that if the world does not act, \u201cwe as a generation would be taking away the future of humanity.\u201d Participants will debate issues including the capacity of the ocean to absorb carbon dioxide, the need for sustainable fishing and tackling marine pollution.", "summary": "<p>Aquaculture is playing an increasingly important role in meeting the world&#8217;s food needs, surpassing wild fisheries in aquatic animal production for the first time, according to a report published Friday.

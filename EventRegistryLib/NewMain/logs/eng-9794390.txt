Wade and cleared the way for states to implement bans, a report released Wednesday found.\n\nA major reason for the increase is that some Democratic-controlled states enacted laws to protect doctors who use telemedicine to see patients in places that have abortion bans, according to the quarterly #WeCount report for the Society of Family Planning, which supports abortion access.\n\nThe data comes ahead of November elections in which abortion-rights supporters hope the issue will drive voters to the polls. In some places, voters will have a chance to enshrine or reject state-level abortion protections.\n\nFallout from the Supreme Court's June 2022 ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization has remade the way abortion works across the country. The #WeCount data, which has been collected in a monthly survey since April 2022, shows how those providing and seeking abortion have adapted to changing laws.\n\nThe survey found that the number of abortions fell to nearly zero in states that ban abortion in all stages of pregnancy and declined by about half in places that ban it after six weeks of pregnancy, before many women know they are pregnant. Fourteen states are enforcing bans on abortion at all stages of pregnancy, with some exceptions, and four others bar it after about six weeks of pregnancy.\n\nNumbers went up in places where abortion remains legal until further into pregnancy - and especially in states such as Illinois, Kansas and New Mexico, which border states with bans.\n\nAbortion pills and telemedicine play a key role. In March, doctors in states with laws to protect medical providers used telemedicine to prescribe abortion pills to nearly 10,000 patients in states with bans or restrictions on abortion by telehealth - accounting for about 1 in 10 abortions in the U.S.\n\nLaws to protect medical providers who use telemedicine to prescribe abortion pills started taking effect in some Democratic-led states last year.\n\n\"It eases the burden on clinics,\" said Ushma Upadhyay, a University of California, San Francisco School of Medicine professor who co-leads #WeCount. \"So it creates more space for the people who are coming to clinics.\"\n\nAbortion opponents say the fight over the abortion drug mifepristone isn't over after a narrow Supreme Court ruling that preserved access to it for now. But so far there have not been legal challenges to shield laws.\n\nThe latest edition of the survey covers the first three months of this year. January was the first time since the survey began that it's counted more than 100,000 abortions across the country in a single month.\n\nBefore the shield laws began kicking in and #WeCount started tallying them, people were still getting some pills in places with bans.\n\nUpadhyay said that even before the fall of Roe, abortion demand was greater than access. She also said that even with the changing patterns, some women are continuing pregnancies they would have ended if they could have.\n\nOne of the states where abortions increased was Florida. That changed in April, when a ban after six weeks' gestation took effect. The data doesn't yet reflect that change.\n\nThe policy could change again through a November ballot measure that would make abortion legal until viability, generally considered to be around 23 or 24 weeks into pregnancy. It would take at least 60% approval to add that to the state constitution.\n\nOne vote against it will come from Mia Adkins, a 20-year-old senior at Florida International University. She said the overturning of Roe and changes in Florida's law have brought more attention to abortion and have strengthened her belief that there should be limits.\n\n\"Instead of pushing for more abortion legal later in pregnancy, we should be pushing for laws that protect these pregnant parents and students and provide them with the support that they need,\" said Akins, a senior at Florida International University.\n\nFlorida is one of six states where abortion-related measures are already on the ballot. Determinations from elections officials about adding similar questions are pending in four more states. In one, Nebraska, there are dueling amendments: One to allow access until viability and one to keep the current policy, which bans most abortions after 12 weeks of pregnancy.\n\nAbortion-rights supporters have prevailed in all seven abortion ballot questions in the U.S. since 2022. That tracks with public opinion polling that has shown growing support for abortion rights, including a recent Associated Press-NORC poll that found 6 in 10 Americans think their state should allow someone to obtain a legal abortion if they don't want to be pregnant for any reason.\n\nAn amendment to protect access could be on the ballot in Arizona, a political battleground state where court cases have swung abortion policy - and access - since the Dobbs ruling.\n\nThe state Supreme Court ruled in April that Arizona should enforce an 1864 ban on abortions at all stages of pregnancy, only for lawmakers to repeal that law. The state's ban on abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy remains. The ballot measure would expand it to 24 weeks.\n\nNatalie Harper, a 23-year-old independent who usually doesn't vote, said the potential of bringing back the Civil War-era ban \"absolutely\" impacts her decision to head to the polls and support the ballot measure this November. \"Seeing that as a possibility really made me realize that everyone's pro-choice voices need to be heard in hopes it never goes in that direction again,\" she said.\n\nIn Missouri, which has outlawed almost all abortions and where nearly none were reported in the new data, election officials could soon certify whether a proposed constitutional amendment guaranteeing abortion rights received enough petition signatures to qualify for the ballot in the reliably Republican state.\n\nUniversity of Missouri political scientist Peverill Squire said that if the measure is put before voters, it could draw out enough Democratic voters to help swing a few competitive legislative races.\n\n\"They can seize on the personal freedom arguments the Republicans have generally owned over the recent elections,\" he said.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Sejal Govindarao in Phoenix and David A.

She also said that even with the changing patterns, some women are continuing pregnancies they would have ended if they could have.\n\nOne of the states where abortions increased was Florida. That changed in April, when a ban after six weeks' gestation took effect. The data doesn't yet reflect that change.\n\nThe policy could change again through a November ballot measure that would make abortion legal until viability, generally considered to be around 23 or 24 weeks into pregnancy. It would take at least 60% approval to add that to the state constitution.\n\nOne vote against it will come from Mia Adkins, a 20-year-old senior at Florida International University. She said the overturning of Roe and changes in Florida's law have brought more attention to abortion and have strengthened her belief that there should be limits.\n\n\"Instead of pushing for more abortion legal later in pregnancy, we should be pushing for laws that protect these pregnant parents and students and provide them with the support that they need,\" said Akins, a senior at Florida International University.\n\nFlorida is one of six states where abortion-related measures are already on the ballot. Determinations from elections officials about adding similar questions are pending in four more states. In one, Nebraska, there are dueling amendments: One to allow access until viability and one to keep the current policy, which bans most abortions after 12 weeks of pregnancy.\n\nAbortion-rights supporters have prevailed in all seven abortion ballot questions in the U.S. since 2022. That tracks with public opinion polling that has shown growing support for abortion rights, including a recent Associated Press-NORC poll that found 6 in 10 Americans think their state should allow someone to obtain a legal abortion if they don't want to be pregnant for any reason.\n\nAn amendment to protect access could be on the ballot in Arizona, a political battleground state where court cases have swung abortion policy -- and access -- since the Dobbs ruling.\n\nThe state Supreme Court ruled in April that Arizona should enforce an 1864 ban on abortions at all stages of pregnancy, only for lawmakers to repeal that law. The state's ban on abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy remains. The ballot measure would expand it to 24 weeks.\n\nNatalie Harper, a 23-year-old independent who usually doesn't vote, said the potential of bringing back the Civil War-era ban \"absolutely\" impacts her decision to head to the polls and support the ballot measure this November. \"Seeing that as a possibility really made me realize that everyone's pro-choice voices need to be heard in hopes it never goes in that direction again,\" she said.\n\nIn Missouri, which has outlawed almost all abortions and where nearly none were reported in the new data, election officials could soon certify whether a proposed constitutional amendment guaranteeing abortion rights received enough petition signatures to qualify for the ballot in the reliably Republican state.\n\nUniversity of Missouri political scientist Peverill Squire said that if the measure is put before voters, it could draw out enough Democratic voters to help swing a few competitive legislative races.\n\n\"They can seize on the personal freedom arguments the Republicans have generally owned over the recent elections,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "courant.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hartfort Courant"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@courant.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Medical abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telehealth", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Telehealth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion-rights_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abortion-rights movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pregnancy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Roe v.

Wade Didn't Go Far Enough For Abortion Rights, Hundreds Of Health Care Providers Tell Biden And Harris", "body": "More than 400 health care providers called on the Biden administration to \"actively and unequivocally\" support an abortion rights policy that goes further than Roe v. Wade and restores access to abortion later in pregnancy.\n\nAdvocacy group Physicians for Reproductive Health, along with 430 physicians providing sexual and reproductive health care, on Monday sent a letter to President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, urging them to do better on abortion care and gender-affirming care.\n\nSince the Supreme Court repealed federal abortion protections in 2022, Biden has continually supported restoring Roe, which protected abortion access until around 24 weeks on the federal level. But many abortion rights advocates say that Roe was inherently flawed, allowing targeted restrictions on abortion providers that chipped away at access even where it was legal and left out people who needed abortion care past fetal viability.\n\n\"While Roe provided a constitutional right to abortion, it never ensured access to that right for all those who needed it,\" reads the letter, which was shared exclusively with HuffPost. \"The promise of Roe, the legal right to abortion care, was never fulfilled.\"\n\nWhen Roe was still intact, pregnant people routinely had to travel across state lines to get care later in pregnancy, and hundreds were criminalized for their pregnancy outcomes. More than 1,300 abortion restrictions, or TRAP laws, were enacted in the years after Roe was decided in 1973. These laws forced many abortion clinics to shut down, creating a dynamic where abortion care was legal on a federal level but not actually accessible in many parts of the country.\n\n\"We urge the Administration and law makers across the country to broaden their efforts, moving beyond Roe's framework, and talk about the future our patients deserve boldly and bravely,\" the letter says. \"We ask you to champion policy solutions that are not premised on returning us to the narrow protections Roe created. We deserve so much more. Our patients deserve so much more.\"\n\nPro-choice advocates have repeatedlycriticized the president -- who was running for a second term on a \"Restore Roe\" platform before stepping down from the campaign -- for not being more aggressive on abortion rights. Nearly half the country has effectively criminalized abortion care since the Supreme Court repealed federal protections, and the president still struggles to say the word \"abortion.\" Some advocates were optimistic when Harris became the Democratic presidential nominee, pointing out that she's been much more vocal about her support for abortion rights, but recent reports indicate that she is also seeking to restore Roe if elected.\n\nThe group of health care providers also encouraged Biden and Harris to support access to gender-affirming care for young people and adults. The providers criticized the president's recent statement in which he opposed care for minors, writing that comments like his are \"dangerous\" and \"firm up opposition to this essential care.\"\n\nSimilarly, the letter's signatories implored Biden to stop using language that stigmatizes later abortion care because it causes \"tremendous harm.\" Around 1% of abortions occur at 21 weeks or later -- a small percentage that Democrats often point to -- but 1% is still around 9,000 people who get later abortions every year. People get abortions later in pregnancy for a variety of reasons, including people with wanted pregnancies who get a fatal fetal diagnosis or young people who don't realize they're pregnant or don't have a safe way to get an abortion right away. Since Roe fell, more and more women are being pushed further into pregnancy because they experience barriers to care early on.\n\n\"Full-spectrum reproductive and gender-affirming health care are not only essential, life-saving services, but fundamental human rights,\" Dr. Jamila Perritt, the president and CEO of Physicians for Reproductive Health who also works as an OB/GYN in Washington, D.C., told HuffPost in a statement.\n\n\"Today, we are calling for bold and brave solutions that support individuals in seeking the care they need free of stigma, delays, and barriers,\" Perritt added. \"As providers, it is our responsibility to offer compassionate health care and evidence-based advocacy, to support our patients to the best of our abilities, and ultimately, to build a future where everyone is positioned to thrive. It is my hope that this letter will inspire change within our current legislative landscape, centering the humanity and dignity of those at the margins of oppression.\"", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion-rights_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abortion-rights movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Roe v.

Wade and cleared the way for states to implement bans, a report released Wednesday found.\n\nA major reason for the increase is that some Democratic-controlled states enacted laws to protect doctors who use telemedicine to see patients in places that have abortion bans, according to the quarterly #WeCount report for the Society of Family Planning, which supports abortion access.\n\nThe data comes ahead of November elections in which abortion-rights supporters hope the issue will drive voters to the polls. In some places, voters will have a chance to enshrine or reject state-level abortion protections.\n\nFallout from the Supreme Court's June 2022 ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization has remade the way abortion works across the country. The #WeCount data, which has been collected in a monthly survey since April 2022, shows how those providing and seeking abortion have adapted to changing laws.\n\nThe survey found that the number of abortions fell to nearly zero in states that ban abortion in all stages of pregnancy and declined by about half in places that ban it after six weeks of pregnancy, before many women know they are pregnant. Fourteen states are enforcing bans on abortion at all stages of pregnancy, with some exceptions, and four others bar it after about six weeks of pregnancy.\n\nNumbers went up in places where abortion remains legal until further into pregnancy -- and especially in states such as Illinois, Kansas and New Mexico, which border states with bans.\n\nAbortion pills and telemedicine play a key role. In March, doctors in states with laws to protect medical providers used telemedicine to prescribe abortion pills to nearly 10,000 patients in states with bans or restrictions on abortion by telehealth -- accounting for about 1 in 10 abortions in the U.S.\n\nLaws to protect medical providers who use telemedicine to prescribe abortion pills started taking effect in some Democratic-led states last year.\n\n\"It eases the burden on clinics,\" said Ushma Upadhyay, a University of California, San Francisco School of Medicine professor who co-leads #WeCount. \"So it creates more space for the people who are coming to clinics.\"\n\nAbortion opponents say the fight over the abortion drug mifepristone isn't over after a narrow Supreme Court ruling that preserved access to it for now. But so far there have not been legal challenges to shield laws.\n\nThe latest edition of the survey covers the first three months of this year. January was the first time since the survey began that it's counted more than 100,000 abortions across the country in a single month.\n\nBefore the shield laws began kicking in and #WeCount started tallying them, people were still getting some pills in places with bans.\n\nUpadhyay said that even before the fall of Roe, abortion demand was greater than access.

Fourteen states are enforcing bans on abortion at all stages of pregnancy, with some exceptions, and four others bar it after about six weeks of pregnancy.\n\nNumbers went up in places where abortion remains legal until further into pregnancy -- and especially in states such as Illinois, Kansas and New Mexico, which border states with bans.\n\nAbortion pills and telemedicine play a key role.

Wade and cleared the way for states to implement bans, a report released Wednesday found.\n\nA major reason for the increase is that some Democratic-controlled states enacted laws to protect doctors who use telemedicine to see patients in places that have abortion bans, according to the quarterly #WeCount report for the Society of Family Planning, which supports abortion access.\n\nThe data comes ahead of November elections in which abortion-rights supporters hope the issue will drive voters to the polls. In some places, voters will have a chance to enshrine or reject state-level abortion protections.\n\nFallout from the Supreme Court's June 2022 ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization has remade the way abortion works across the country. The #WeCount data, which has been collected in a monthly survey since April 2022, shows how those providing and seeking abortion have adapted to changing laws.\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nInterim superintendent of St. Louis Public Schools left previous job under fire Letter: If Biden's age was so concerning, why isn't Trump's age?

Fourteen states are enforcing bans on abortion at all stages of pregnancy, with some exceptions, and four others bar it after about six weeks of pregnancy.\n\nNumbers went up in places where abortion remains legal until further into pregnancy -- and especially in states such as Illinois, Kansas and New Mexico, which border states with bans.\n\nAbortion pills and telemedicine play a key role. In March, doctors in states with laws to protect medical providers used telemedicine to prescribe abortion pills to nearly 10,000 patients in states with bans or restrictions on abortion by telehealth -- accounting for about 1 in 10 abortions in the U.S.\n\nLaws to protect medical providers who use telemedicine to prescribe abortion pills started taking effect in some Democratic-led states last year.\n\n\"It eases the burden on clinics,\" said Ushma Upadhyay, a University of California, San Francisco School of Medicine professor who co-leads #WeCount. \"So it creates more space for the people who are coming to clinics.\"\n\nAbortion opponents say the fight over the abortion drug mifepristone isn't over after a narrow Supreme Court ruling that preserved access to it for now. But so far there have not been legal challenges to shield laws.\n\nThe latest edition of the survey covers the first three months of this year. January was the first time since the survey began that it's counted more than 100,000 abortions across the country in a single month.\n\nBefore the shield laws began kicking in and #WeCount started tallying them, people were still getting some pills in places with bans.\n\nUpadhyay said that even before the fall of Roe, abortion demand was greater than access. She also said that even with the changing patterns, some women are continuing pregnancies they would have ended if they could have.\n\nOne of the states where abortions increased was Florida. That changed in April, when a ban after six weeks' gestation took effect. The data doesn't yet reflect that change.\n\nThe policy could change again through a November ballot measure that would make abortion legal until viability, generally considered to be around 23 or 24 weeks into pregnancy. It would take at least 60% approval to add that to the state constitution.\n\nOne vote against it will come from Mia Adkins, a 20-year-old senior at Florida International University. She said the overturning of Roe and changes in Florida's law have brought more attention to abortion and have strengthened her belief that there should be limits.\n\n\"Instead of pushing for more abortion legal later in pregnancy, we should be pushing for laws that protect these pregnant parents and students and provide them with the support that they need,\" said Akins, a senior at Florida International University.\n\nFlorida is one of six states where abortion-related measures are already on the ballot. Determinations from elections officials about adding similar questions are pending in four more states. In one, Nebraska, there are dueling amendments: One to allow access until viability and one to keep the current policy, which bans most abortions after 12 weeks of pregnancy.\n\nAbortion-rights supporters have prevailed in all seven abortion ballot questions in the U.S. since 2022. That tracks with public opinion polling that has shown growing support for abortion rights, including a recent Associated Press-NORC poll that found 6 in 10 Americans think their state should allow someone to obtain a legal abortion if they don't want to be pregnant for any reason.\n\nAn amendment to protect access could be on the ballot in Arizona, a political battleground state where court cases have swung abortion policy -- and access -- since the Dobbs ruling.\n\nThe state Supreme Court ruled in April that Arizona should enforce an 1864 ban on abortions at all stages of pregnancy, only for lawmakers to repeal that law. The state's ban on abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy remains. The ballot measure would expand it to 24 weeks.\n\nNatalie Harper, a 23-year-old independent who usually doesn't vote, said the potential of bringing back the Civil War-era ban \"absolutely\" impacts her decision to head to the polls and support the ballot measure this November. \"Seeing that as a possibility really made me realize that everyone's pro-choice voices need to be heard in hopes it never goes in that direction again,\" she said.\n\nIn Missouri, which has outlawed almost all abortions and where nearly none were reported in the new data, election officials could soon certify whether a proposed constitutional amendment guaranteeing abortion rights received enough petition signatures to qualify for the ballot in the reliably Republican state.\n\nUniversity of Missouri political scientist Peverill Squire said that if the measure is put before voters, it could draw out enough Democratic voters to help swing a few competitive legislative races.\n\n\"They can seize on the personal freedom arguments the Republicans have generally owned over the recent elections,\" he said.\n\nAssociated Press writers Sejal Govindarao in Phoenix and David A.

Wade. But on June 24, 2022, the Dobbs decision changed that and allowed states to make their own laws about who can have access to abortion care, and under what circumstances.\n\nSince then, 14 states have banned abortion, and six states have introduced a gestational limit between six to 12 weeks, according to KFF. As Salon has reported, the consequences are harrowing. Medical school graduates are avoiding states with abortion bans exacerbating the maternal healthcare crisis. Pregnant women are being forced to cross state lines to terminate nonviable pregnancies. This week, Amnesty International USA released a report detailing how the aftermath of Dobbs is a \"human rights crisis.\"\n\n\"These types of bans and policies can impact a variety of human rights,\" Jasmeet Sidhu, a senior researcher with Amnesty International USA, told Salon in a phone interview. \"Including the right to life, the right to access healthcare, the right to privacy in some situations where abortion is being criminalized, and the right to be free from torture and other degrading treatment,\"\n\nThe report centered on the stories of patients and medical providers. From interviewing people in states with the strictest laws to researching court cases and media reports, Amnesty researchers found that abortion restrictions have led to a terrifying landscape for pregnant people in America.\n\n\"It was incredibly horrifying as a woman and a mother as well of two girls to learn about some of the circumstances in which people have been placed because of these restrictions,\" Sidhu told Salon, adding that it was hard to hear from doctors about how they're being forced to turn away patients and provide evidence-based care. \"As we detailed in the report, there are less and less doctors that want to go to states where they're going to be criminalized for providing abortion care.\"\n\nIn the report, Amnesty says that by failing to ensure that abortion care is accessible and affordable, the United States is \"failing to comply with international human rights laws and standards to ensure pregnant individuals have equal access to abortion information services.\"\n\nSpecifically, forcing a pregnant person to carry an unwanted pregnancy is a human rights violation.\n\nIn one story in the report, a Black 12-year-old named Kim (whose name had been changed for privacy purposes), was raped in Mississippi. Once her mother found out she was pregnant, she filed a complaint with the police department. While there is technically an exception to Mississippi's abortion ban -- which restricts all abortions, except in cases of rape or incest or the save the life of the pregnant person -- Kim became a mother.\n\n\"Abortion remains difficult to access in these circumstances because even if someone files a police report, there are no clear guidelines on how to qualify for legal abortion in cases of sexual violence,\" the report explained. \"Kim's mother did not even know that an exception for rape existed under the criminal abortion law.\"\n\nExceptions typically have a \"multitude of very specific requirements,\" Sidhu told Salon.\n\n\"These laws are pretty hard to navigate, even for someone like myself, who's a lawyer, to be able to understand what the guidelines are,\" Sidhu said. \"In that particular circumstance, the mother did not realize that there was an exception for rape, but even if she had, to be able to kind of navigate that, and take a child to law enforcement and get a physical exam, it is very complicated.\"\n\nSheila, another woman whose name was changed for privacy, became pregnant in Mississippi when her hormonal birth control implant expired and she couldn't afford a new one. Since the Jackson Women's Health Organization in Mississippi the month after the Dobbs decision, she couldn't afford to travel out of state to obtain care, either. She was forced to have the child without being able to work and pay for childcare.\n\n\"The idea behind human rights are that they should be available, equally and universally, to everyone,\" Sidhu said. \"If I live in rural Oklahoma and I can't access an abortion unless I travel hundreds of miles, then I'm facing an undue burden compared to somebody who maybe, for example, lives in Washington, D.C.\"\n\nThe report emphasized that there is a disparate impact of abortion restrictions, highlighting how systemic and structural racism prohibit people from equal access to health insurance. That results in a lack of access to contraception, prenatal care and abortion care.\n\n\"For Black women, these bans represent a denial of abortion care to a constituency who, due to longstanding discrimination and ongoing challenges accessing comprehensive reproductive healthcare, seek abortions at a higher rate than any other group, and are already suffering far higher rates of maternal mortality,\" the report states. \"For Indigenous women, Dobbs adds even more restrictions to what many had long experienced as effective bans on abortion due to pre-existing federal government restrictions on the Indian Health Service, on which many of them depend for their health care.\"\n\nThe report urged the U.S. to create a federal protection for abortion, among other suggestions.\n\n\"I think that's pretty clear, that's the number one thing that needs to happen,\" Sidhu said. \"So that everyone, everywhere, has the same right to be able to access abortion care.\"", "source": {"uri": "truthout.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Truthout"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nicole_karlis@truthout.org", "name": "Nicole Karlis", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salon.com", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Salon.com"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Human rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amnesty_International_USA", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Amnesty International USA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobbs_v._Jackson_Women's_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dobbs v.

Wade and cleared the way for states to implement bans, a report released on Wednesday found.\n\nA major reason for the increase is that some Democratic-controlled states enacted laws to protect doctors who use telemedicine to see patients in places that have abortion bans, according to the quarterly #WeCount report for the Society of Family Planning, which supports abortion access.\n\nAlso Read | AAP MP Raghav Chadha Demands Corridor to Sri Nankana Sahib, Birthplace of Guru Nanak Dev, in Pakistan's Punjab Province (Watch Video).\n\nThe data comes ahead of November elections in which abortion-rights supporters hope the issue will drive voters to the polls. In some places, voters will have a chance to enshrine or reject state-level abortion protections.\n\nFallout from the Supreme Court's June 2022 ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organisation has remade the way abortion works across the country. The #WeCount data, which has been collected in a monthly survey since April 2022, shows how those providing and seeking abortion have adapted to changing laws.\n\nAlso Read | Shubhanshu Shukla, IAF Pilot Selected for ISRO's Gaganyaan Mission, Arrives at Houston To Train for Indo-US Axiom-4 Mission to International Space Station, Know Key Details.\n\nThe survey found that the number of abortions fell to nearly zero in states that ban abortion in all stages of pregnancy and declined by about half in places that ban it after six weeks of pregnancy, before many women know they are pregnant. Fourteen states are enforcing bans on abortion at all stages of pregnancy, with some exceptions, and four others bar it after about six weeks of pregnancy.\n\nNumbers went up in places where abortion remains legal until further into pregnancy -- and especially in states such as Illinois, Kansas and New Mexico, which border states with bans.\n\nAbortion pills and telemedicine play a key role. In March, doctors in states with laws to protect medical providers used telemedicine to prescribe abortion pills to nearly 10,000 patients in states with bans or restrictions on abortion by telehealth -- accounting for about 1 in 10 abortions in the U.S.\n\nLaws to protect medical providers who use telemedicine to prescribe abortion pills started taking effect in some Democratic-led states last year.\n\n\"It eases the burden on clinics,\" said Ushma Upadhyay, a University of California, San Francisco School of Medicine professor who co-leads #WeCount. \"So it creates more space for the people who are coming to clinics.\"\n\nAbortion opponents say the fight over the abortion drug mifepristone isn't over after a narrow Supreme Court ruling that preserved access to it for now. But so far there have not been legal challenges to shield laws.\n\nThe latest edition of the survey covers the first three months of this year. January was the first time since the survey began that it's counted more than 100,000 abortions across the country in a single month.\n\nBefore the shield laws began kicking in and #WeCount started tallying them, people were still getting some pills in places with bans.\n\nUpadhyay said that even before the fall of Roe, abortion demand was greater than access. She also said that even with the changing patterns, some women are continuing pregnancies they would have ended if they could have.\n\nOne of the states where abortions increased was Florida. That changed in April, when a ban after six weeks' gestation took effect. The data doesn't yet reflect that change.\n\nThe policy could change again through a November ballot measure that would make abortion legal until viability, generally considered to be around 23 or 24 weeks into pregnancy. It would take at least 60% approval to add that to the state constitution.\n\nOne vote against it will come from Mia Adkins, a 20-year-old senior at Florida International University. She said the overturning of Roe and changes in Florida's law have brought more attention to abortion and have strengthened her belief that there should be limits.\n\n\"Instead of pushing for more abortion legal later in pregnancy, we should be pushing for laws that protect these pregnant parents and students and provide them with the support that they need,\" said Akins, a senior at Florida International University.\n\nFlorida is one of six states where abortion-related measures are already on the ballot. Determinations from elections officials about adding similar questions are pending in four more states. In one, Nebraska, there are duelling amendments: One to allow access until viability and one to keep the current policy, which bans most abortions after 12 weeks of pregnancy.\n\nAbortion-rights supporters have prevailed in all seven abortion ballot questions in the US since 2022. That tracks with public opinion polling that has shown growing support for abortion rights, including a recent Associated Press-NORC poll that found 6 in 10 Americans think their state should allow someone to obtain a legal abortion if they don't want to be pregnant for any reason.\n\nAn amendment to protect access could be on the ballot in Arizona, a political battleground state where court cases have swung abortion policy -- and access -- since the Dobbs ruling.\n\nThe state Supreme Court ruled in April that Arizona should enforce an 1864 ban on abortions at all stages of pregnancy, only for lawmakers to repeal that law. The state's ban on abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy remains. The ballot measure would expand it to 24 weeks.\n\nNatalie Harper, a 23-year-old independent who usually doesn't vote, said the potential of bringing back the Civil War-era ban \"absolutely\" impacts her decision to head to the polls and support the ballot measure this November. \"Seeing that as a possibility really made me realize that everyone's pro-choice voices need to be heard in hopes it never goes in that direction again,\" she said.\n\nIn Missouri, which has outlawed almost all abortions and where nearly none were reported in the new data, election officials could soon certify whether a proposed constitutional amendment guaranteeing abortion rights received enough petition signatures to qualify for the ballot in the reliably Republican state.\n\nUniversity of Missouri political scientist Peverill Squire said that if the measure is put before voters, it could draw out enough Democratic voters to help swing a few competitive legislative races.\n\n\"They can seize on the personal freedom arguments the Republicans have generally owned over the recent elections,\" he said.

That tracks with public opinion polling that has shown growing support for abortion rights, including a recent Associated Press-NORC poll that found six in 10 Americans think their state should allow someone to obtain a legal abortion if they don't want to be pregnant for any reason.\n\nAn amendment to protect access could be on the ballot in Arizona, a political battleground state where court cases have swung abortion policy -- and access -- since the Dobbs ruling.\n\nThe state Supreme Court ruled in April that Arizona should enforce an 1864 ban on abortions at all stages of pregnancy, only for lawmakers to repeal that law. The state's ban on abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy remains. The ballot measure would expand it to 24 weeks.\n\nNatalie Harper, a 23-year-old independent who usually doesn't vote, said the potential of bringing back the Civil War-era ban \"absolutely\" impacts her decision to head to the polls and support the ballot measure this November. \"Seeing that as a possibility really made me realize that everyone's pro-choice voices need to be heard in hopes it never goes in that direction again,\" she said.\n\nIn Missouri, which has outlawed almost all abortions and where nearly none were reported in the new data, election officials could soon certify whether a proposed constitutional amendment guaranteeing abortion rights received enough petition signatures to qualify for the ballot in the reliably Republican state.\n\nUniversity of Missouri political scientist Peverill Squire said that if the measure is put before voters, it could draw out enough Democratic voters to help swing a few competitive legislative races.\n\n\"They can seize on the personal freedom arguments the Republicans have generally owned over the recent elections,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "ctvnews.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "CTV News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Medical abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telehealth", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Telehealth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion-rights_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abortion-rights movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abortion law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pregnancy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobbs_v._Jackson_Women's_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dobbs v.

Wade, Republicans are leaving abortion laws to the states' discretion.\n\nDelegates showed united support with Trump's abortion platform at this year's Republican National Convention. The platform committee agreed to Trump's new document, passing with an 84 to 18 vote.\n\nThis is a dramatic shift from the party's stance over the last 40 years. In 1984, the party platform included an \"amendment to the Constitution and legislation to make clear that the Fourteenth Amendment's protections apply to children before birth.\"\n\nThe platform, in 2016, included support for a national ban of abortions performed 20 weeks after pregnancy.\n\nIn March, the Republican Study Committee, which represents all House Republican leaders, released a budget that endorses a national abortion ban with zero exceptions.\n\nSince the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, 14 states have passed near-total abortion bans. In the 18 months following the decision, the number of abortions in the U.S. steadily rose, according to the Society of Family Planning's report in May.\n\nAbortion is legal and protected in Washington state.\n\nAfter the Dobbs decision, total abortion patients were up 18% in 11 Planned Parenthood clinics in Central and Eastern Washington, according to information from Sen. Maria Cantwell's office. The data compares numbers from January-May 2022 and 2023. Idaho's abortion ban went into effect in August 2022.\n\nThe Yakima clinic reported a 5% increase in abortion patients during that time frame, but more significant increases happened in Kennewick, Pullman and Walla Walla with additional patients from Idaho, according to Cantwell's office.\n\nLindsay Johnson, chief external affairs officer for Planned Parenthood Advocates of Greater Washington and North Idaho, said \"abortion is really top of people's minds in this election. Our reproductive rights and our access to basic health care are on the line right now.\"\n\nA June poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found that a majority of Americans support abortion access. Eight in 10 Americans oppose Congress passing a federal abortion ban, the study found.\n\nIn an April video posted on TruthSocial, Trump said he believes abortion limits should be left to the states, and declined to endorse a national ban.\n\nVice President and expected Democratic Presidential nominee Kamala Harris supports a national right to abortion. In the Biden administration, Harris vocally objected to abortion bans. She visited an abortion clinic in March, which White House officials believed had never been done before by a president or vice president. While in the Senate, she co-sponsored a bill that would have banned state-level abortion restrictions.\n\nJohnson critiques incumbent Republican Congressman Dan Newhouse's voting record, specifically his support of the Defund Planned Parenthood Act of 2023. \"For any elected official who's making decisions and voting on policy, we hope that they trust pregnant people and trust providers,\" Johnson said.\n\nNewhouse is facing challenges from seven candidates in the upcoming Washington primary election.\n\nIn general, Republicans Jerrod Sessler and Tiffany Smiley are running to the right of Newhouse's more moderate policies. Democrats Mary Baechler, \"Birdie\" Jane Muchlinski, and Barry Knowles are running to his left. Independent Benny Garcia and \"MAGA Democrat\" John Malan are running outside the two-party system, and support Trump.\n\nProtests outside the Planned Parenthood office in Yakima have increased since Dobbs, Johnson said.\n\nRon Thomassom, a retired Gateway Church pastor, protests outside the office on Tuesdays. He experiences a mix of support and disapproval from passersby but hopes to change incoming patients' minds.\n\n\"I'm praying and seeing that there's a big change coming,\" said Thomassom.\n\nThere are two branches of Planned Parenthood. One provides services to patients and educates community members. The other participates in election efforts. The 501(c)(4) Planned Parenthood Advocates of Greater Washington and North Idaho partners with the groups like the Yakima County Democrats to canvass voters.\n\nThe Yakima County Democrats chair Lindsey Keesling thinks the abortion issue should not be framed in black and white terms. She had a miscarriage and received medical care as a result.\n\n\"That medical care, depending on your insurance, is coded as an abortion, even if you had absolutely no choice,\" said Keesling. She knows Republican women who are similarly worried about the lack of nuanced rhetoric concerning abortion access.\n\nThe Yakima County Republicans' platform states that all health care decisions are personal rights that must rest with each individual. \"Parents and legal guardians have the ultimate decision-making authority over, and responsibility for, their children.\" It also states: \"We support the protection of innocent human life, pre-born or born, through all stages of life up to natural death.\"\n\nEach candidate for the 4th Congressional District spoke to the Yakima Herald-Republic about their abortion platforms, among other issues. Below are their responses, in alphabetical order by last name:\n\nMary Baechler\n\nDemocrat, Yakima\n\nReproductive justice is a top priority for Baechler. She worked as a midwife and founded a baby stroller company. Baechler believes that people should be free to make their health care decisions alone and highlights that the more countries restrict abortion access, the more their abortion rates increase.\n\n\"If you look at the best practices in the world, it's countries like the Netherlands. Their (abortion) rate is so much lower than ours,\" said Baechler. She attributes this to more access to contraceptives and health care education.\n\nBenny \"BG3\" Garcia\n\nIndependent, Grandview\n\nGarcia identifies as pro-life but in cases where a mother is at risk, he is more lenient. \"All I can say is I hope for the best and pray for the best for the child and for the mother to be healthy,\" said Garcia.\n\nHe supports the use of in vitro fertilization (IVF) for couples struggling with pregnancy and would not support a national ban on abortion.\n\nBarry Knowles\n\nDemocrat, Covington and Yakima\n\nKnowles, who doesn't fit squarely in the Democrat mold, said he was happy when the Supreme Court made abortion a state-level issue. He said he doesn't feel strongly over whether Americans should have a right to reproductive care, but believes the federal government cannot make the decision.\n\n\"Me personally, I don't care. I think that people should vote in each state and decide what they want,\" said Knowles.\n\nJohn Malan\n\nMAGA Democrat, Grant County\n\nThough pro-life, Malan thinks reproductive rights should be determined by each state. \"If they wanted it, they can have it. I don't like it. I don't believe in it. I don't want it. But if the people want it, let them go kill themselves. I don't care,\" said Malan. He is glad Roe v. Wade was overturned and would not support a national ban on abortion.\n\n\"Birdie\" Jane Muchlinski\n\nDemocrat, Richland\n\n\"Health care is a freedom and we need to be protecting freedoms across the board,\" said Muchlinski. She supports creating a federal right to contraception and IVF.\n\nShe is against a national ban on abortion, saying that building a family is a private decision for individuals to make for themselves.\n\nDan Newhouse\n\nRepublican, Sunnyside\n\nThe Dobbs decision will not change abortion access in Washington, Newhouse said. Pro-life himself, Newhouse wants to create ways to steer women in the direction of giving birth rather than seeking an abortion. He supports a federal right to IVF.\n\n\"We should do everything we can to preserve life and help the individuals that find themselves in these very difficult positions to help them make the decision to preserve life,\" said Newhouse.\n\nJerrod Sessler\n\nRepublican, Prosser\n\nSessler, a conservative Christian, thinks abortion should be decided on the state level. While he is pro-life, Sessler believes there are situations where a doctor and patient need to decide what is best for them. \"And I would say generally those situations are going to be unbelievably rare,\" said Sessler.\n\nOn his website, Sessler says that people are pushing for legislation \"that will allow doctors to kill babies weeks after they come out of the womb.\" However, it is illegal to kill a newborn in all states and no state is trying to pass a law to change that. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that doctors perform only 1% of abortions after 21 weeks' gestation.\n\nTiffany Smiley\n\nLike the other conservative candidates, Smiley labels herself as pro-life. She approves the issue of abortion being decided by individual states. Smiley worked as a triage nurse for an OB/GYN clinic in Spokane.\n\nShe supports IVF, saying, \"We should make it easy for families to grow and bring life into this world, and we need to make contraception easy, accessible, and affordable to women.\"\n\nJordan Allyn is a news reporter for the Yakima Herald-Republic.

Wade and restores access to abortion later in pregnancy.\n\nAdvocacy group Physicians for Reproductive Health, along with 430 physicians providing sexual and reproductive health care, on Tuesday sent a letter to President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, urging them to do better on abortion care and gender-affirming care.\n\nSince the Supreme Court repealed federal abortion protections in 2022, Biden has continually supported restoring Roe, which protected abortion access until around 24 weeks on the federal level. But many abortion rights advocates say that Roe was inherently flawed, allowing targeted restrictions on abortion providers that chipped away at access even where it was legal and left out people who needed abortion care past fetal viability.\n\n\"While Roe provided a constitutional right to abortion, it never ensured access to that right for all those who needed it,\" reads the letter, which was shared exclusively with HuffPost. \"The promise of Roe, the legal right to abortion care, was never fulfilled.\"\n\nWhen Roe was still intact, pregnant people routinely had to travel across state lines to get care later in pregnancy, and hundreds were criminalized for their pregnancy outcomes. More than 1,300 abortion restrictions, or TRAP laws, were enacted in the years after Roe was decided in 1973. These laws forced many abortion clinics to shut down, creating a dynamic where abortion care was legal on a federal level but not actually accessible in many parts of the country.\n\n\"We urge the Administration and law makers across the country to broaden their efforts, moving beyond Roe's framework, and talk about the future our patients deserve boldly and bravely,\" the letter says. \"We ask you to champion policy solutions that are not premised on returning us to the narrow protections Roe created. We deserve so much more. Our patients deserve so much more.\"\n\nPro-choice advocates have repeatedly criticized the president -- who was running for a second term on a \"Restore Roe\" platform before stepping down from the campaign -- for not being more aggressive on abortion rights. Nearly half the country has effectively criminalized abortion care since the Supreme Court repealed federal protections, and the president still struggles to say the word \"abortion.\" Some advocates were optimistic when Harris became the Democratic presidential nominee, pointing out that she's been much more vocal about her support for abortion rights, but recent reports indicate that she is also seeking to restore Roe if elected.\n\nThe group of health care providers also encouraged Biden and Harris to support access to gender-affirming care for young people and adults. The providers criticized the president's recent statement in which he opposed care for minors, writing that comments like his are \"dangerous\" and \"firm up opposition to this essential care.\"\n\nSimilarly, the letter's signatories implored Biden to stop using language that stigmatizes later abortion care because it causes \"tremendous harm.\" Around 1% of abortions occur at 21 weeks or later -- a small percentage that Democrats often point to -- but 1% is still around 9,000 people who get later abortions every year. People get abortions later in pregnancy for a variety of reasons, including people with wanted pregnancies who get a fatal fetal diagnosis or young people who don't realize they're pregnant or don't have a safe way to get an abortion right away. Since Roe fell, more and more women are being pushed further into pregnancy because they experience barriers to care early on.\n\n\"Full-spectrum reproductive and gender-affirming health care are not only essential, life-saving services, but fundamental human rights,\" Dr. Jamila Perritt, the president and CEO of Physicians for Reproductive Health who also works as an OB/GYN in Washington, D.C., told HuffPost in a statement.\n\n\"Today, we are calling for bold and brave solutions that support individuals in seeking the care they need free of stigma, delays, and barriers,\" Perritt added. \"As providers, it is our responsibility to offer compassionate health care and evidence-based advocacy, to support our patients to the best of our abilities, and ultimately, to build a future where everyone is positioned to thrive. It is my hope that this letter will inspire change within our current legislative landscape, centering the humanity and dignity of those at the margins of oppression.\"", "source": {"uri": "huffpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "HuffPost"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion-rights_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abortion-rights movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Roe v.

(Michael Nigro/Pacific Press/LightRocket via Getty Images)\n\nFor nearly 50 years in the United States, the U.S. Supreme Court asserted that the U.S. Constitution protected the right to access abortion under Roe v. Wade. But on June 24, 2022, the Dobbs decision changed that and allowed states to make their own laws about who can have access to abortion care, and under what circumstances.\n\nSince then, 14 states have banned abortion, and six states have introduced a gestational limit between six to 12 weeks, according to KFF. As Salon has reported, the consequences are harrowing. Medical school graduates are avoiding states with abortion bans exacerbating the maternal healthcare crisis. Pregnant women are being forced to cross state lines to terminate nonviable pregnancies. This week, Amnesty International USA released a report detailing how the aftermath of Dobbs is a \"human rights crisis.\"\n\n\"These types of bans and policies can impact a variety of human rights,\" Jasmeet Sidhu, a senior researcher with Amnesty International USA, told Salon in a phone interview. \"Including the right to life, the right to access healthcare, the right to privacy in some situations where abortion is being criminalized, and the right to be free from torture and other degrading treatment,\"\n\nThe report centered on the stories of patients and medical providers. From interviewing people in states with the strictest laws to researching court cases and media reports, Amnesty researchers found that abortion restrictions have led to a terrifying landscape for pregnant people in America.\n\n\"It was incredibly horrifying as a woman and a mother as well of two girls to learn about some of the circumstances in which people have been placed because of these restrictions,\" Sidhu told Salon, adding that it was hard to hear from doctors about how they're being forced to turn away patients and provide evidence-based care. \"As we detailed in the report, there are less and less doctors that want to go to states where they're going to be criminalized for providing abortion care.\"\n\nIn the report, Amnesty says that by failing to ensure that abortion care is accessible and affordable, the United States is \"failing to comply with international human rights laws and standards to ensure pregnant individuals have equal access to abortion information services.\"\n\nWant more health and science stories in your inbox? Subscribe to Salon's weekly newsletter Lab Notes.\n\nSpecifically, forcing a pregnant person to carry an unwanted pregnancy is a human rights violation.\n\nIn one story in the report, a Black 12-year-old named Kim (whose name had been changed for privacy purposes), was raped in Mississippi. Once her mother found out she was pregnant, she filed a complaint with the police department. While there is technically an exception to Mississippi's abortion ban -- which restricts all abortions, except in cases of rape or incest or the save the life of the pregnant person -- Kim became a mother.\n\n\"Abortion remains difficult to access in these circumstances because even if someone files a police report, there are no clear guidelines on how to qualify for legal abortion in cases of sexual violence,\" the report explained. \"Kim's mother did not even know that an exception for rape existed under the criminal abortion law.\"\n\nExceptions typically have a \"multitude of very specific requirements,\" Sidhu told Salon.\n\n\"These laws are pretty hard to navigate, even for someone like myself, who's a lawyer, to be able to understand what the guidelines are,\" Sidhu said. \"In that particular circumstance, the mother did not realize that there was an exception for rape, but even if she had, to be able to kind of navigate that, and take a child to law enforcement and get a physical exam, it is very complicated.\"\n\nSheila, another woman whose name was changed for privacy, became pregnant in Mississippi when her hormonal birth control implant expired and she couldn't afford a new one. Since the Jackson Women's Health Organization in Mississippi the month after the Dobbs decision, she couldn't afford to travel out of state to obtain care, either. She was forced to have the child without being able to work and pay for childcare.\n\n\"The idea behind human rights are that they should be available, equally and universally, to everyone,\" Sidhu said. \"If I live in rural Oklahoma and I can't access an abortion unless I travel hundreds of miles, then I'm facing an undue burden compared to somebody who maybe, for example, lives in Washington, D.C.\"\n\nThe report emphasized that there is a disparate impact of abortion restrictions, highlighting how systemic and structural racism prohibit people from equal access to health insurance.

But anti-abortion politicians have had control of at least one body of Congress ever since Roe was overturned, preventing meaningful congressional action on abortion. Enacting federal legislation to protect the right to abortion throughout the country is a crucial and desperately needed step to rectify the harms of overturning Roe.\n\nTo be clear, abortion care was not accessible for far too many even before the end of Roe. If elected, Harris must carry out her promise to restore reproductive freedom by taking bold action to ensure that everyone can get an abortion if they need one, no matter who they are, where they live, or how much money they have. She must not only demand legislation that codifies abortion rights and invalidates state bans and restrictions, but that also ends discriminatory barriers to abortion care, such as insurance coverage bans like the Hyde Amendment.\n\nWhy It Matters: Right now, millions of people of reproductive age live hundreds of miles from the closest abortion provider. In 2023 alone, more than 171,000 people were forced to travel outside of their home state to secure abortion access. As a result of abortion bans and other restrictions, countless people are being forced to continue their pregnancies against their will. Some states have gone so far as to criminalize the provision of abortion care in medical emergencies where the inability to get an abortion puts the pregnant person's health, life, and future fertility in danger.\n\nIn the two years since Roe was overturned, however, there has been a groundswell of public support for abortion rights and rising opposition against bans and restrictions on abortion care. People in states across the country -- including Kansas, Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Wisconsin -- have repeatedly demonstrated their support for reproductive health care access since Roe was overturned.", "source": {"uri": "aclu.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "American Civil Liberties Union"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion-rights_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abortion-rights movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Roe v.

When adjusted to account for this underreporting, the percentage of American women who underwent a self-managed abortion in 2023 was 7.1%.\n\nThe researchers, some of whom have ties to Planned Parenthood and the ACLU, attributed the rise to the increase in the number of states with pro-life laws and of people who \"fear criminalization for seeking pregnancy-related care.\"\n\nThe upsurge also appears to be spurred on by an increase in women taking chemical abortion pills, which can now be legally obtained without a doctor's visit.\n\nA chemical abortion is a two-pill regimen in which the first -- a drug called mifepristone -- is ingested to cut off nutrient flow to the unborn baby, essentially starving the child to death.\n\nIn 2021, chemical abortions accounted for 18% of all unsupervised abortions. As of 2023, chemical abortions now account for 24.1%, a 6.1% increase. This comes after another study by the pro-abortion Guttmacher Institute found that chemical abortions account for 63% of all U.S. abortions.\n\nThe Biden administration significantly loosened restrictions on chemical abortion pills following the overturn of Roe v. Wade in 2022. Revisions to FDA regulations made in 2021 and 2023 made it so that abortion pills can now be obtained at retail pharmacies such as CVS and Walgreens as well as through the mail without an in-person doctor's visit.\n\nDespite abortion pills being heavily restricted in 14 states, those laws have not impeded pills from being mailed in from other states where they are legal.\n\nThe study reported that women used a wide range of other methods to attempt a self-managed abortion including taking emergency contraception (29.7%) and herbs (25.9%). Meanwhile, 21.6% of women participating in the study tried to abort their baby by hitting themselves in the stomach, while 18.6% reported using alcohol or other controlled substances.\n\nConsistent with overall abortion statistics, the largest proportion of women attempting self-managed abortions were African Americans at 5.1% versus all other ethnic groups at 3.1%.\n\nThe study noted that several of the methods employed by women in the study have the \"potential for harm\" and that many \"offer low to no effectiveness in ending a pregnancy.\"\n\nBecause of this, researchers said that \"interaction with the health care system following SMA is not uncommon, whether to seek emergency care related to adverse effects or complications or to seek subsequent prenatal or abortion care.\"\n\nDr. Ingrid Skop, an OB-GYN based in Texas, responded to the study by saying: \"We must skeptically evaluate this blatant propaganda by abortion advocates promoted by increasingly biased medical journals.\"\n\n\"For years, abortion advocates have been seeking to de-medicalize induced abortion. Whereas, once they insisted abortion should be 'between a woman and her doctor,' increasingly there is no doctor involved in abortion provision, and women are left to suffer alone ... Thus, 'self-managed' abortion is being promoted to women, regardless of the increased risks, in pursuit of ideological goals,\" Skop told CNA. \"Now, abortion advocates attempt to have it both ways, by implying the methods they have encouraged will cause harm to women in states protecting unborn life.\"\n\nSusan B. Anthony Pro-Life America President Marjorie Dannenfelser commented to CNA that \"pro-abortion fearmongering has hit new lows as the Democrats go all in on abortion to save them in the coming elections\" and that \"rebranding DIY mail-order abortions as 'self-managed abortion' exposes the lie of the Democrats' old 'safe, legal, and rare' stance.\"", "source": {"uri": "ncregister.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "National Catholic Register"}, "authors": [{"uri": "peter_pinedo@ncregister.com", "name": "Peter Pinedo", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Medical abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Socialism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JAMA", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "JAMA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Medical_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American Medical Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_Liberties_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American Civil Liberties Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-abortion_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anti-abortion movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planned_Parenthood", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Planned Parenthood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mifepristone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mifepristone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guttmacher_Institute", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Guttmacher Institute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_contraception", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Emergency contraception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion-rights_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Abortion-rights movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walgreens", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Walgreens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Roe v.

Voters approved on Nov. 7, 2023 an amendment to the Ohio Constitution to protect access to abortion.\n\nAbortion was slightly more common across the U.S. in the first three months of this year than it was before the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and cleared the way for states to implement bans, a report released Wednesday found.\n\nA major reason for the increase is that some Democratic-controlled states enacted laws to protect doctors who use telemedicine to see patients in places that have abortion bans, according to the quarterly #WeCount report for the Society of Family Planning, which supports abortion access.\n\nThe data comes ahead of November elections in which abortion-rights supporters hope the issue will drive voters to the polls. In some places, voters will have a chance to enshrine or reject state-level abortion protections.\n\nFallout from the Supreme Court's June 2022 ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization has remade the way abortion works across the country. The #WeCount data, which has been collected in a monthly survey since April 2022, shows how those providing and seeking abortion have adapted to changing laws.\n\nThe survey found that the number of abortions fell to nearly zero in states that ban abortion in all stages of pregnancy and declined by about half in places that ban it after six weeks of pregnancy, before many women know they are pregnant. Fourteen states are enforcing bans on abortion at all stages of pregnancy, with some exceptions, and four others bar it after about six weeks of pregnancy.\n\nNumbers went up in places where abortion remains legal until further into pregnancy -- and especially in states such as Illinois, Kansas and New Mexico, which border states with bans.\n\nAbortion pills and telemedicine play a key role. In March, doctors in states with laws to protect medical providers used telemedicine to prescribe abortion pills to nearly 10,000 patients in states with bans or restrictions on abortion by telehealth -- accounting for about 1 in 10 abortions in the U.S.\n\nLaws to protect medical providers who use telemedicine to prescribe abortion pills started taking effect in some Democratic-led states last year.\n\n\"It eases the burden on clinics,\" said Ushma Upadhyay, a University of California, San Francisco School of Medicine professor who co-leads #WeCount. \"So it creates more space for the people who are coming to clinics.\"\n\nAbortion opponents say the fight over the abortion drug mifepristone isn't over after a narrow Supreme Court ruling that preserved access to it for now. But so far there have not been legal challenges to shield laws.\n\nThe latest edition of the survey covers the first three months of this year. January was the first time since the survey began that it's counted more than 100,000 abortions across the country in a single month.\n\nBefore the shield laws began kicking in and #WeCount started tallying them, people were still getting some pills in places with bans.\n\nUpadhyay said that even before the fall of Roe, abortion demand was greater than access. She also said that even with the changing patterns, some women are continuing pregnancies they would have ended if they could have.\n\nOne of the states where abortions increased was Florida. That changed in April, when a ban after six weeks' gestation took effect. The data doesn't yet reflect that change.\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\nThe policy could change again through a November ballot measure that would make abortion legal until viability, generally considered to be around 23 or 24 weeks into pregnancy. It would take at least 60% approval to add that to the state constitution.\n\nOne vote against it will come from Mia Adkins, a 20-year-old senior at Florida International University. She said the overturning of Roe and changes in Florida's law have brought more attention to abortion and have strengthened her belief that there should be limits.\n\n\"Instead of pushing for more abortion legal later in pregnancy, we should be pushing for laws that protect these pregnant parents and students and provide them with the support that they need,\" said Akins, a senior at Florida International University.\n\nFlorida is one of six states where abortion-related measures are already on the ballot. Determinations from elections officials about adding similar questions are pending in four more states. In one, Nebraska, there are dueling amendments: One to allow access until viability and one to keep the current policy, which bans most abortions after 12 weeks of pregnancy.\n\nAbortion-rights supporters have prevailed in all seven abortion ballot questions in the U.S. since 2022. That tracks with public opinion polling that has shown growing support for abortion rights, including a recent Associated Press-NORC poll that found 6 in 10 Americans think their state should allow someone to obtain a legal abortion if they don't want to be pregnant for any reason.\n\nAn amendment to protect access could be on the ballot in Arizona, a political battleground state where court cases have swung abortion policy -- and access -- since the Dobbs ruling.\n\nThe state Supreme Court ruled in April that Arizona should enforce an 1864 ban on abortions at all stages of pregnancy, only for lawmakers to repeal that law. The state's ban on abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy remains. The ballot measure would expand it to 24 weeks.\n\nNatalie Harper, a 23-year-old independent who usually doesn't vote, said the potential of bringing back the Civil War-era ban \"absolutely\" impacts her decision to head to the polls and support the ballot measure this November. \"Seeing that as a possibility really made me realize that everyone's pro-choice voices need to be heard in hopes it never goes in that direction again,\" she said.\n\nIn Missouri, which has outlawed almost all abortions and where nearly none were reported in the new data, election officials could soon certify whether a proposed constitutional amendment guaranteeing abortion rights received enough petition signatures to qualify for the ballot in the reliably Republican state.\n\nUniversity of Missouri political scientist Peverill Squire said that if the measure is put before voters, it could draw out enough Democratic voters to help swing a few competitive legislative races.\n\n\"They can seize on the personal freedom arguments the Republicans have generally owned over the recent elections,\" he said.\n\nAssociated Press writers Sejal Govindarao in Phoenix and David A.

Tim Walz, calling it the most pro-reproductive freedom ticket in history, while two other groups called on Democratic leaders to act boldly to establish new federal abortion protections.\n\nBoth Planned Parenthood Action Fund (PPAF) and Reproductive Freedom for All (RFA) applauded Walz's pro-choice record and called him a \"champion\" of reproductive rights.\n\nThe ACLU and Physicians for Reproductive Health (PRH) called for bolder action to secure abortion rights, with the ACLU pushing for a number of federal reforms, and PRH urging more fundamental protections for abortion and gender-affirming care that go beyond the standards once set by Roe v. Wade.\n\n\"Unfortunately, Roe v. Wade was never enough to ensure our communities obtained the care they needed,\" Dr. Jamila Perritt, PRH's president, said in a statement. \"It was, in fact, barely a starting point.\"\n\nWalz, who served in U.S. Congress for 12 years before becoming governor of Minnesota at the start of 2019, has a sterling pro-choice record on abortion. He earned a consistent 100% on RFA's congressional report card during his time as a congressman, and signed a pair of key state bills into law as governor.\n\nThe first, signed in January 2023, strengthened and codified abortion protections, even as neighboring states restricted abortion rights, turning Minnesota into \"the Midwest's abortion access center.\" The second, passed three months later, sought to shield people who seek or provide abortions or gender-affirming care from legal action by conservative states.\n\nBoth bills narrowly passed the Minnesota state Legislature, where Democrats have had a slight majority since the 2022 election and used it to push through a wide array of progressive laws. These included expanded funding for birth control access, family planning services, and Medicaid reimbursements.\n\nWalz was by Harris' side when she became the first vice president to visit an abortion provider in March, at a Planned Parenthood in St. Paul. Reproductive rights advocates generally regard Harris as stronger on the issue than President Joe Biden, who is Catholic and has struggled to say the word \"abortion\" publicly, though his administration has pushed pro-choice policy.\n\n\"The Biden-Harris administration did more for reproductive freedom than any other, and a Harris-Walz administration is poised to build on that legacy,\" RFA president Mini Timmaraju said in a statement.\n\nBiden and Harris have emphasized the need to restore Roe, the landmark U.S. Supreme Court ruling from 1973 that established a federal right to abortion up to roughly 24 weeks for the next five decades, before it was reversed by the 2022 Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization ruling.\n\nHowever, PRH on Tuesday sent Biden and Harris an open letter, signed by 430 healthcare providers, that called for them to be bolder, citing the limitations of the Roe framework:\n\nWhile Roe provided a constitutional right to abortion, it never ensured access to that right for all those who needed it. The promise of Roe, the legal right to abortion care, was never fulfilled. This is especially true for communities facing the most barriers to care. When abortion care is treated as anything other than basic, essential healthcare and is so willingly stigmatized by supporters and nonsupporters alike, ensuring true access to our communities is not possible. We urge the administration and lawmakers across the country to broaden their efforts, moving beyond Roe's framework, and talk about the future our patients deserve boldly and bravely. We ask you to champion policy solutions that are not premised on returning us to the narrow protections Roe created.\n\nThe ACLU warned of the erosion of reproductive rights following Dobbs, which left states to determine abortion policy; 14 Republican-controlled states have since banned abortion altogether, while eight others have passed bans on abortions at 18 weeks of gestation or less. In a statement, the nonprofit human rights group praised Harris for her pledge to restore reproductive freedom and vowed to hold her accountable.\n\nThe ACLU's \"roadmap\" for Harris includes overturning the Hyde amendment, which restricts Medicaid coverage for abortion and \"has forced 1 in 4 low-income women seeking an abortions to carry an unwanted pregnancy to term,\" the ACLU said. The group also calls for increased federal funding for Title X, which helps low-income people secure healthcare services, a federal push to ensure that all hospitals that receive Medicare funding provide emergency stabilizing treatment, including abortion.\n\nAmnesty International on Monday issued a detailed report on the negative impact of the abortion bans and restrictions in Republican-led states, saying they \"cause extensive harm\" and \"violate human rights.\"\n\nReproductive rights advocates warn that much worse is to come if Republican nominee and former President Donald Trump wins back the White House in November. Project 2025, a right-wing blueprint written by people affiliated with Trump, proposes \"mobilizing an array of government agencies to curb access to abortion,\" The Guardianreported Monday.\n\nPPAF implicitly nodded to the threat Republicans pose in making the case for the Democratic ticket in its statement on Tuesday.\n\n\"The stakes of this election could not be higher, the contrast between the two tickets could not be clearer, and the state of sexual and reproductive healthcare in this country could not be more dire,\" said Alexis McGill Johnson, PPAF's president. \"Kamala Harris and Tim Walz are the only people we can trust to ensure that everyone has the freedom to make decisions about their own bodies.\"", "source": {"uri": "commondreams.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Common Dreams"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproductive_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Reproductive rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion-rights_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abortion-rights movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_Liberties_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "American Civil Liberties Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Roe v.

Tim Walz (D) as her running mate -- a choice one of America's leading pro-life organizations says represents the \"most pro-abortion Democratic ticket yet.\"\n\n\"Kamala Harris and Tim Walz make up the most pro-abortion presidential ticket America has ever seen. There is no daylight between them on this issue,\" SBA Pro-Life America President Marjorie Dannenfelser said in a statement. \"Walz is no moderate when it comes to abortion.\"\n\nWATCH -- CNBC's Ross Sorkin: Business Sees Walz Pick as Sign Harris May Govern More from a \"Progressive Left Standpoint\":\n\nDannenfelser pointed to legislation Walz signed in January of 2023, which was \"at the time the country's most extreme law enshrining abortion on demand throughout pregnancy as a 'fundamental right' without limits of any kind.\"\n\nAs Breitbart News reported at the time, Walz made Minnesota the first in the nation to codify abortion via legislative action after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and sent the issue of abortion back to individual states and their elected representatives. The bill, called H.F. 1 or the Protect Reproductive Options (PRO) Act, was created to cement in state law the \"right\" to access reproductive health care options including abortion, birth control, family planning help, and sterilization.\n\nAbortion was already legal in Minnesota through the second trimester. The bill's author, Sen. Jennifer McEwen (D) said the bill enshrines abortion access, no matter what future courts decide. Senate Minority Leader Mark Johnson lamented its passage at the time, calling it \"the most extreme bill in the country regarding youth sterilization, late term abortions and public viability for a vast array of new reproductive rights.\"\n\nAt the time, Minnesota Citizens Concerned for Life (MCCL) blasted law as \"extreme, inhumane, and harmful to women and children who deserve so much better.\"\n\n\"The PRO Act means a right to abort any baby for any reason at any time up to birth. It means that the elective killing of a human being in utero is perfectly legal even in the third trimester of pregnancy, when the child can feel excruciating pain and could live outside the womb. It means that parents have no right to know when their teenage daughter has been taken to undergo an abortion,\" said MCCL Co-Executive Director Cathy Blaeser.\n\n\"Gov. Walz's absolutist abortion policy puts Minnesota in the company of just a small handful of countries around the world, including North Korea and China. It is extreme, inhumane, and harmful to women and children who deserve so much better,\" Blaeser continued.\n\nThe pro-life group also noted that lawmakers \"rejected dozens of amendments that would have made the bill less extreme,\" including one protecting unborn babies in the third trimester (with exceptions), one barring partial-birth abortions, and one providing the option of anesthesia when unborn children can feel pain. Another proposed amendment would have required third-trimester abortions to take place in a hospital and would have required abortion facilities to be licensed by the state.\n\n\"This law doesn't just allow late abortion for medical emergencies or hard cases,\" Blaeser said. \"It allows late abortion for any reason whatsoever, and it's an open invitation to notorious late abortion practitioners to come to Minnesota to set up shop. Here in Minnesota, you don't even need to be a doctor or have a licensed facility in order to perform abortions. The lack of guardrails to protect women and children is appalling.\"\n\nDannenfelser noted that Walz subsequently signed more legislation that \"grossly expanding taxpayer-funded abortion, stripping away the state's informed consent protections, and significantly weakening protections for babies born alive.\"\n\n\"With Harris and Walz as standard-bearers, the Democratic Party has become the 'Shout Your Abortion' party, with no limits for any reason even in the seventh, eighth or ninth month,\" she said. \"In contrast to President Trump, JD Vance and the GOP, who support the right of the people to set limits on abortion and provide real options for mothers in need, Democrats have made it clear nothing - not the checks and balances built into our government, not the humanity of unborn children and not the true needs of women - will stop them from imposing all-trimester abortion nationwide.\"\n\nStudents for Life President Kristan Hawkins also slammed Harris's vice presidential pick in posts to X on Tuesday.\n\n\"Kamala Harris is promising NO LIMITS on abortion if elected, which is exactly what her pick for VEEP, MN Gov. Tim Walz, delivered to babies in the womb in his state,\" Hawkins said.\n\n\"Not to mention, in 2020 Walz let Minneapolis burn, so of course he'll let preborn babies be dismembered, burned, and delivered dead,\" she added.", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors": [{"uri": "katherine_hamilton@breitbart.com", "name": "Katherine Hamilton", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marjorie_Dannenfelser", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marjorie Dannenfelser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion-rights_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abortion-rights movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-abortion_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anti-abortion movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pregnancy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sterilization_(medicine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sterilization (medicine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobbs_v._Jackson_Women's_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dobbs v.

One of those is abortion, about which she has spoken frequently since Joe Biden declared her his preferred successor.\n\nJust over two years ago, the US Supreme Court overruled the 49-year-old precedent of Roe v Wade and withdrew constitutional protection for the choice to terminate a pregnancy. In the June 2022 majority judgment in the case of Dobbs v Women's Health Organization - the case that overturned Roe v Wade - Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito wrote that Roe v Wade had been \"egregiously wrong from the start\". He concluded that: \"Its reasoning was exceptionally weak, and the decision has had damaging consequences.\"\n\nUnder the guise of undoing this wrong, the Supreme Court returned the issue of abortion law to state jurisdiction. Americans have been watching the consequences unfold ever since, as various states have passed laws restricting or banning women from being able to terminate pregnancies.\n\nHarris led the Biden administration's response to this decision, visiting an abortion clinic and speaking out about reproductive freedom. Even before she took on the presidential candidacy, campaign rallies and adverts from the Democratic campaign were focused on the decision restrict women's reproductive freedom.\n\nThe results of the 2022 midterm elections suggest this could be a useful strategy. The Democrats did significantly better than expected - and abortion was considered a major factor. Certainly successful ballot initiatives in California, Michigan and Ohio (which added constitutional protections) and defeats for abortion restriction measures in Kansas, Kentucky and Montana suggested an increased turnout of Democrat voters.\n\nThis November, a possible 11 states could have abortion-related initiatives on the ballot, including Arizona, a key swing state in this election. In such a tight race, parties are looking for any possible advantage.\n\nPossibly mindful of this - and of the fact that most Americans continue to support some access to abortion - the Republican party recently softened its official stance, removing language calling for a federal abortion ban which appeared in both 2016 and 2020. Some Republican state legislators have urged caution about strict abortion bans that may alienate potential voters.\n\nSpeaking regularly about reproductive rights also helps keep in voters' minds the widespread consequences of the Dobbs decision on abortion and how it affects pregnant women and medical professionals across much of the country.\n\nOnly half of states protect abortion, at least until the point of foetal viability. These states - particularly those which border two or more states with abortion bans such as Illinois and Ohio - have become centres for those seeking abortion care and who are able to travel.\n\nFourteen states have outright bans on abortion access. Some have exceptions for cases of rape, incest, or to save the life of the pregnant women, but many do not. Another 11 states have gestational limits that are earlier than the previous 24-week limit. Some are so early that most pregnant women don't even yet know they are pregnant.\n\nMore than half of states have other restrictions: waiting time requirements, mandated counselling, required ultrasounds, multiple visits to the doctor, spousal or parental consent laws and others.\n\nThe most recent estimates suggest 48% of women now live in states with some form of abortion restrictions. That figure rises to 57% for black women and higher for Native American women. The Guttmacher Institute, a pro-choice research organisation, estimates that almost one in five pregnant women now have to travel out of state for abortion access.\n\nBy speaking out on abortion, the Harris campaign is also seeking to galvanise pro-choice voters by reminding them that the threats come in many forms.\n\nIn June, an attempt to undermine access to the abortion pill, mifepristone, was rejected by the Supreme Court. The case was, in effect, a back door attempt to further restrict abortion access.\n\nAnd, although interstate travel is constitutionally protected in the US, some localities in Texas have been trying to prevent use of their roads by those seeking to leave the state to access abortion care.\n\nTwo University of Texas at Austin professors sought the legal right to academically fail students who take time off for abortion care, while Idaho academics were warned they could no longer advise students about anything relating to abortion.\n\nAnd, as the New Republic reported, anti-abortion laws are increasingly being used by domestic abusers to threaten and harass partners.\n\nAs anti-abortion advocates continue to press for greater restrictions across the US, data from the Guttmacher Institute show that they continue to fail to achieve their aim of reducing abortion rates. In 2023, abortion rates were higher across the country than in previous years.\n\nBut, as many doctors are pointing out, the restrictions are regularly putting the lives of pregnant women at risk. Mimi Zieman, an obstetrician from Georgia wrote: \"If I were finishing my training today and choosing somewhere to practice, I would not come to this state or anywhere with these restrictions on practice.\"\n\nMany agree with her. Recent studies suggest as many as 70% of gynaecology students in the US are less likely to consider residency in a state with abortion restrictions.\n\nThis risks leaving pregnant women without both abortion access and good, reliable, accessible reproductive healthcare. In a country that already has the highest maternal mortality rate among developed nations, this suggests further declines.\n\nTestimony from practitioners overwhelmingly indicates that threats to medical licences and risk of prison terms are deterring doctors from undertaking vital healthcare provision.\n\nAnd pregnant women are suffering as a result. Stories now abound of women like Kate Cox, who was forced to travel outside of Texas for an abortion when the state refused to determine that her case was sufficiently life threatening to qualify under their exemption. Or that of Nicole Miller, airlifted to a nearby state because the abortion she required to medically stabilise her was unavailable in her home state of Idaho.\n\nHarris and the Democrats want voters to remember these stories as they go to the polls in November. And they want voters to remember that it was Trump, and his Supreme Court appointees, who made it possible.\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

Wade and cleared the way for states to implement bans, a report released Wednesday found.\n\nAbortion was slightly more common across the U.S. in the first three months of this year than it was before the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and cleared the way for states to implement bans, a report released Wednesday found.\n\nA major reason for the increase is that some Democratic-controlled states enacted laws to protect doctors who use telemedicine to see patients in places that have abortion bans, according to the quarterly #WeCount report for the Society of Family Planning, which supports abortion access.\n\nThe data comes ahead of November elections in which abortion-rights supporters hope the issue will drive voters to the polls. In some places, voters will have a chance to enshrine or reject state-level abortion protections.\n\nFallout from the Supreme Court's June 2022 ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization has remade the way abortion works across the country. The #WeCount data, which has been collected in a monthly survey since April 2022, shows how those providing and seeking abortion have adapted to changing laws.\n\nThe survey found that the number of abortions fell to nearly zero in states that ban abortion in all stages of pregnancy and declined by about half in places that ban it after six weeks of pregnancy, before many women know they are pregnant. Fourteen states are enforcing bans on abortion at all stages of pregnancy, with some exceptions, and four others bar it after about six weeks of pregnancy.\n\nNumbers went up in places where abortion remains legal until further into pregnancy -- and especially in states such as Illinois, Kansas and New Mexico, which border states with bans.\n\nAbortion pills and telemedicine play a key role. In March, doctors in states with laws to protect medical providers used telemedicine to prescribe abortion pills to nearly 10,000 patients in states with bans or restrictions on abortion by telehealth -- accounting for about 1 in 10 abortions in the U.S.\n\nLaws to protect medical providers who use telemedicine to prescribe abortion pills started taking effect in some Democratic-led states last year.\n\n\"It eases the burden on clinics,\" said Ushma Upadhyay, a University of California, San Francisco School of Medicine professor who co-leads #WeCount. \"So it creates more space for the people who are coming to clinics.\"\n\nAbortion opponents say the fight over the abortion drug mifepristone isn't over after a narrow Supreme Court ruling that preserved access to it for now. But so far there have not been legal challenges to shield laws.\n\nThe latest edition of the survey covers the first three months of this year. January was the first time since the survey began that it's counted more than 100,000 abortions across the country in a single month.\n\nBefore the shield laws began kicking in and #WeCount started tallying them, people were still getting some pills in places with bans.\n\nUpadhyay said that even before the fall of Roe, abortion demand was greater than access. She also said that even with the changing patterns, some women are continuing pregnancies they would have ended if they could have.\n\nOne of the states where abortions increased was Florida. That changed in April, when a ban after six weeks' gestation took effect. The data doesn't yet reflect that change.\n\nThe policy could change again through a November ballot measure that would make abortion legal until viability, generally considered to be around 23 or 24 weeks into pregnancy. It would take at least 60% approval to add that to the state constitution.\n\nOne vote against it will come from Mia Adkins, a 20-year-old senior at Florida International University. She said the overturning of Roe and changes in Florida's law have brought more attention to abortion and have strengthened her belief that there should be limits.\n\n\"Instead of pushing for more abortion legal later in pregnancy, we should be pushing for laws that protect these pregnant parents and students and provide them with the support that they need,\" said Akins, a senior at Florida International University.\n\nFlorida is one of six states where abortion-related measures are already on the ballot. Determinations from elections officials about adding similar questions are pending in four more states. In one, Nebraska, there are dueling amendments: One to allow access until viability and one to keep the current policy, which bans most abortions after 12 weeks of pregnancy.\n\nAbortion-rights supporters have prevailed in all seven abortion ballot questions in the U.S. since 2022. That tracks with public opinion polling that has shown growing support for abortion rights, including a recent Associated Press-NORC poll that found 6 in 10 Americans think their state should allow someone to obtain a legal abortion if they don't want to be pregnant for any reason.\n\nAn amendment to protect access could be on the ballot in Arizona, a political battleground state where court cases have swung abortion policy -- and access -- since the Dobbs ruling.\n\nThe state Supreme Court ruled in April that Arizona should enforce an 1864 ban on abortions at all stages of pregnancy, only for lawmakers to repeal that law. The state's ban on abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy remains. The ballot measure would expand it to 24 weeks.\n\nNatalie Harper, a 23-year-old independent who usually doesn't vote, said the potential of bringing back the Civil War-era ban \"absolutely\" impacts her decision to head to the polls and support the ballot measure this November. \"Seeing that as a possibility really made me realize that everyone's pro-choice voices need to be heard in hopes it never goes in that direction again,\" she said.\n\nIn Missouri, which has outlawed almost all abortions and where nearly none were reported in the new data, election officials could soon certify whether a proposed constitutional amendment guaranteeing abortion rights received enough petition signatures to qualify for the ballot in the reliably Republican state.\n\nUniversity of Missouri political scientist Peverill Squire said that if the measure is put before voters, it could draw out enough Democratic voters to help swing a few competitive legislative races.\n\n\"They can seize on the personal freedom arguments the Republicans have generally owned over the recent elections,\" he said.\n\nAssociated Press writers Sejal Govindarao in Phoenix and David A.

As the State of Iowa joined the growing ranks of Republican-led states banning abortion at six weeks, Iowans woke up to new realities of state-forced birth, where the government controls private medical decisions for over half the state's population.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris also woke up to a new reality. After President Joe Biden withdrew and endorsed Harris as the 2024 Democratic nominee, Harris and associated PACs raised an historic $250 million in campaign donations in under three days, much of it from first-time donors, and young voter registration surged by 700%.\n\nAnyone missing the connection between former president Donald Trump's abortion bans and the drumbeat for Harris isn't paying attention.\n\nAlthough abortion was carefully scripted out of the headlines and speeches at the Republican National Convention, Harris will remind Americans how Trump bragged about overturning Roe v. Wade, and appointed three radical justices who were willing to lie to Congress under oath -- and trash the credibility of the Supreme Court in the process -- to overturn abortion rights.\n\nHarris will remind voters how Trump publicly congratulated himself on his social media platform Truth Social, bragging in writing that:\n\n\"After 50 years of failure, with nobody coming even close, I was able to kill Roe v. Wade, much to the 'shock' of everyone... Without me, there would be no 6 weeks, 10 weeks, 15 weeks, or whatever is finally agreed to. Without me the pro-Life movement would have just kept losing. Thank you President TRUMP!!!\"\n\nIndeed, thank you Donald Trump, for confirming in writing that you're responsible for life-threatening, six-week abortion bans, you're responsible for forcing women and girls to flee their home states to stay alive, you're responsible for Republicans gunning for armed menstruation police, and you're responsible for pushing frightened women to the brink of death before doctors can intervene to save them.\n\nVery well done, Sir. Bragging about the Dobbs decision was probably the most consequential self-own you will ever make.\n\nFaced with opinion polls showing that a strong majority of Americans think Trump overturning Roe v. Wade was a \"bad thing,\" Trump is now marketing a softer position on abortion, saying that rather than a national ban, it should be left up to individual states to decide. Republican VP candidate and antiabortion extremist JD Vance -- who would criminalize abortion even in cases of rape and incest because \"two wrongs don't make a right\" and who thinks \"childless cat ladies\" should not equally participate in democracy -- now parrots Trump's \"softening,\"\n\nLetting states decide via popular vote whether women -- or the government -- should make private health care decisions is more gaslighting than softening. Under the 14th Amendment, all persons born or naturalized in the United States have been entitled to the same Equal Protection under the law since 1866, regardless of popular whim. The whole point of the 14th Amendment was to remove fundamental human rights from the vicissitudes of popular opinion, which, as MAGA illustrates, is easily manipulated.\n\nThe 14th Amendment prohibits all states from making or enforcing any law that denies the equal protection of the laws to all citizens, or that deprives any person of liberty without due process of law; it does not subject these rights to periodic revision as popular opinion fluctuates. When writing Dobbs, lifelong misogynist Justice Samuel Alito wrote deceptively that the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause could not protect women's medical privacy, or abortion access, because \"that theory is squarely foreclosed by the Court's precedents, which establish that a State's regulation of abortion is not a sex-based classification.\"\n\nIn case you missed it, that was Alito selectively choosing to prioritize the Court's \"classification precedent\" over 50 years of substantive due process precedent to reach his desired outcome, despite Roe's determination that a woman's decision to terminate her pregnancy is a \"liberty\" protected against state interference by the Due Process and Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment.\n\nHelping themselves to Alito's smug and dishonest dismissal of equal protection for women, Trump/Vance's \"let-each-state-decide\" abortion stance subjects women's bodies and lives to the whims of popular vote. After owning Miss USA and similar beauty pageants for decades, it's not surprising that Trump continues to see women's bodies on a catwalk, subject to popular opinion and scorecards. Harris will serve it back in ways Biden never could, due to Biden's Catholic reluctance to say the word \"abortion\" in public.\n\nHarris isn't reluctant. She has read, and understands, the assignment. She can communicate how abortion bans have increased maternal and infant mortality, and decreased women's equal opportunity to earn a living. She can explain how Republicans have unconstitutionally stripped half the U.S. population of Equal Protection under the 14th Amendment because Trump justices said they could.\n\nBelieved to be the first vice president ever to visit an abortion clinic, Harris talks about abortion rights clearly, forcefully and unapologetically, and will help shape abortion into the pivotal issue in November.\n\nIn stepping away from power despite his strong conviction that he could and should serve a second term, President Biden displayed as selfless an act of sacrifice and patriotism as any president since George Washington. As heart-wrenching as it was to watch his Oval Office address explaining his decision, women who have had it up to here with Republicans' cruel machinations under Dobbs are grateful finally to have a fierce messenger.", "source": {"uri": "chicagotribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Chicago Tribune"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Roe v.

Tim Walz toured a Planned Parenthood clinic in his state alongside Harris -- the first time a sitting president or vice president had visited an abortion provider.\n\nThat visit in March put Minnesota's efforts to safeguard reproductive rights in the spotlight.\n\nNow, Harris and Walz represent a Democratic ticket that vocally supports access to abortion and fertility treatment, during an election in which those issues are expected to be important to voters and a focus of many Democratic campaigns.\n\nMinnesota was the first state to pass a law protecting abortion rights after the Supreme Court's Dobbs decision in 2022. The law, which Walz signed in January 2023, stipulates that local governments -- cities, counties, towns, etc. -- cannot regulate a person's choice to obtain an abortion or other reproductive services.\n\nA few months later, Walz signed a second abortion-rights law -- that statute prohibits the arrest of abortion providers in Minnesota and protects people who travel there to avoid another state's abortion ban. According to the law, Minnesota officials do not have to turn over a patient's health records in response to another state's subpoena or court order.\n\nThe share of people who traveled from other states to Minnesota for abortions tripled between 2020 and 2023, according to data from the Guttmacher Institute, a research organization that supports abortion access.\n\nAbortion-rights advocates pointed to these actions when expressing support for Walz on Tuesday.\n\n\"By choosing Gov. Walz as her running mate, Vice President Harris has put forward the most pro-reproductive freedom ticket in history,\" Alexis McGill Johnson, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Action Fund, said in a statement. \"Gov. Walz is a longtime champion of sexual and reproductive health care and has been a fierce abortion rights champion as governor.\"\n\nMinnesota, which traditionally votes for Democratic presidential candidates, has some of the most progressive abortion policies in the country. Abortion has been legal there since the Roe decision in 1974. In 1995, the Minnesota Supreme Court ruled that abortion rights were protected by the state's constitution.\n\nSince Roe was overturned, the state has adopted additional measures to make abortions easier to obtain. In July 2022, a district court judge struck down several requirements that hindered access, including a rule that only physicians could perform abortions and a mandatory 24-hour waiting period. Abortions are also covered by state Medicaid funds.\n\nAs governor, Walz also slashed funding for a grant program under the Minnesota Department of Health that supported so-called crisis pregnancy centers, which offer pregnant people counseling and supplies while often trying to persuade them not to get abortions. Some of these centers have been known to provide inaccurate or misleading information.\n\nNational Right to Life, the largest anti-abortion organization in the U.S., said Tuesday that Walz's move to defund crisis pregnancy centers in his state was a \"huge blow\" to families.\n\n\"If elected, a Harris-Walz Administration would push for the most extreme abortion agenda policies of any administration,\" Carol Tobias, president of National Right to Life, said in a statement.\n\nIn addition to his support for abortion access, Walz has championed in vitro fertilization. Many abortion rights supporters worry that access to the fertility treatment is under threat post-Dobbs, since IVF often involves discarding embryos due to genetic abnormalities or because they are no longer needed. Some who believe in the notion of fetal personhood have opposed that practice. National Right to Life, for instance, says frozen embryos should be given to other couples rather than destroyed.\n\nWalz told the Minneapolis Star Tribune in March that his two children were born with the help of fertility treatments, which his wife had been receiving for seven years before getting pregnant with their daughter.\n\nIn February, Walz criticized an Alabama Supreme Court ruling that said embryos created through IVF were considered children, meaning people could theoretically be sued for destroying them. The ruling prompted several IVF providers in Alabama to pause their services; they resumed once the state passed legal protections for fertility doctors and clinics.\n\n\"This issue is deeply personal to our family and so many others,\" Walz wrote on Facebook at the time. \"Don't let these guys get away with this by telling you they support IVF when their handpicked judges oppose it. Actions speak louder than words, and their actions are clear.\"\n\nWalz has also expressed support for a bill introduced last year in the Minnesota House of Representatives that would require Minnesota health plans that offer maternity coverage to also cover fertility treatment. He has also called for language to be added to the Minnesota abortion-rights law signed in January 2023 that would further guarantee access to IVF and other fertility treatments.\n\nWalz's office did not respond to a request for comment.

Tim Walz (D-MN) as her running mate solidifies the Democratic ticket as squarely opposed to abortion restrictions.\n\n\"Tim Walz has made his support of unlimited abortion a foundation of his administration,\" Carol Tobias, president of National Right to Life, said in a press statement. \"Both Kamala Harris and Tim Walz have yet to hear of an abortion they would oppose.\"\n\nAfter winning reelection for governor in 2022, Walz and the newly-elected Democratic legislature in January 2023 rushed through the Protect Reproductive Options Act, which codified the \"fundamental right to reproductive freedom\" and essentially prohibited any restrictions on abortion, including gestational age limits.\n\nMinnesota was the first state to enact abortion-rights legislation following the 2022 midterm elections, the first general election following the Supreme Court's overturning of Roe v. Wade and federal abortion protections.\n\nAlso early into his second term, Walz ushered in the repeal of existing law that would have required abortion patients to wait 24 hours and go through an informed consent process.\n\nUnder the new regulations, abortion providers also do not have to provide much data to the state Department of Health about each procedure and are only required to report how the abortion was performed, the age of the woman, and the approximate gestational age of the fetus. They do not need to report if the mother's life or health was at stake, nor do they need to report if the pregnancy was a result of rape or incest.\n\nWalz also signed the repeal of the Positive Alternatives Act, which funded pregnancy resource centers, also known as crisis pregnancy centers. CPCs, which provide assistance and counseling to pregnant women, are favored by anti-abortion groups but increasingly criticized by Democrats, who say the centers mislead women who might be seeking abortions.\n\nAnti-abortion advocates and religious conservatives have become increasingly restive because the Republican Party has softened its stance on abortion ahead of the presidential election, as former President Donald Trump and vice presidential candidate J.D. Vance have advocated a state-based abortion policy. But they have also ramped up their opposition to Democrats as the party has moved to the left on abortion policy.\n\nSBA Pro-Life America President Marjorie Dannenfelser said in a press statement that Harris's selection of Walz makes \"the Democratic Party has become the 'Shout Your Abortion' party, with no limits for any reason even in the seventh, eighth or ninth month.\"\n\n\"In contrast to President Trump, JD Vance and the GOP, who support the right of the people to set limits on abortion and provide real options for mothers in need, Democrats have made it clear nothing -- not the checks and balances built into our government, not the humanity of unborn children and not the true needs of women -- will stop them from imposing all-trimester abortion nationwide,\" Dannenfelser said.\n\nOther candidates on Harris's short list for the \"veepstakes\" did not have the record of aggressively promoting abortion rights that Walz has.\n\nGov. Josh Shapiro (D-PA) made it to the final three for Harris's list. Abortion in Pennsylvania is legal until the 24th week of pregnancy, and Shapiro has not made any moves to change Pennsylvania's legal framework.\n\nGovs. Roy Cooper (D-NC) and Andy Beshear (D-KY) both have track records of supporting abortion rights in red states, but neither had the support to liberalize policy as Walz was able to in Minnesota.\n\nPlanned Parenthood Action Fund, the lobbying arm of the abortion provider, called the announcement of Walz as Harris's running mate \"huge.\"\n\n\"We could not think of a better duo headed to the White House,\" Planned Parenthood Action Fund posted on X.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nThe abortion-rights group Reproductive Freedom for All, formerly NARAL, also celebrated the announcement.\n\n\"Gov.

Through its updated abortion care guideline released in 2022, the WHO expects all Member States to implement this policy.\n\nThis article is not about whether the WHO's policy is right or wrong, but the process used to reach its conclusions, and what this tells us about it as a legitimate global health advisory body.\n\nIt is important to say awkward things sometimes, when these things are true. When we become polarized, we can start to believe that stating something consistent with 'the other party' can be worse than telling lies to support our preferred stance. This demeans us and does not help anyone. There are few issues that polarize (Western) society more than abortion.\n\nI am tied to neither side of the abortion debate. As a medical practitioner, I have taken part in surgical abortions, helping women to stop a pregnancy that they decided they did not want to continue. I have also assisted some hundreds of women to deliver babies.\n\nI have been with tiny premature babies of just 20 weeks gestation when they died. I have gently cradled a very premature child of my own, fully human in my hands. He saw light and felt hunger, pain and fear, his outstretched hand the size of my thumbnail. He could have been killed in many places if he had not happened to be born early.\n\nMany thousands of girls and women also die excruciating deaths each year from septic, unsafe abortions performed because safe abortion is outlawed or inaccessible. The introduction to the WHO guideline notes that 3 of 10 pregnancies end in abortion and nearly half of these are unsafe for the mother, nearly all these being in low-income countries. I have lived in a Southeast Asian country where several thousand women are thought to die from this each year. These young and agonizing deaths mostly cease when abortion is legalized.\n\nPhilosophically, I believe in the equality of all human beings and in the concept of bodily autonomy - no one has the right to interfere and control another's body. We own and must control our bodies, not because someone grants us this right, but because we are humans. This applies to medical procedures as it does to torture. As it applies to our own body, it applies to all others.\n\nHowever, because there is good and bad in the world -nurture and harm - the interpretation of this fundamental truth is not simple. At times we may need to kill another's body. We do this in war, for example, to stop a country being invaded and its people tortured, raped and killed. But we also uphold the right of conscientious objectors who decline to kill because of their religious or moral beliefs.\n\nSo there is no simple right and wrong when it comes to the act of abortion, only a right or wrong in the intent. As humans we need to face such truths fearlessly because truth is intrinsically better than lies, and simplifications of complex issues are frequently lies. In interpreting the same truths, we may reach different actions. We need to recognize that life is full of hard choices, always harder for some than others, and we all have different experiences to inform them.\n\nA wise friend was once discussing the issue of abortion with people who, with good intentions, held vigils outside abortion clinics to dissuade women from entering. He recounted the words of a woman who had an abortion at such a clinic: \"What she needed was someone to be with her and support her after she had left by the back door, not someone accosting her on the way in\".\n\nLike much that life throws at us, dealing with abortion primarily requires truth, understanding and compassion, not dogma.\n\nThe WHO released its Abortion care guideline in early 2022, updating previous publications on the social, ethical and medical aspects of abortion into one volume. As a 'guideline' rather than a recommendation, the WHO expects the document to be followed by the 194 Member States that make up the World Health Assembly. The WHO, of course, does not have power to enforce guidelines, but 'guideline' in the WHO lexicon is an instruction with which countries should abide.\n\nTo ensure an evidence-base, guideline development is supposed to involve a wide range of experts and stakeholders who gather to weigh evidence, using this to carefully formulate 'best practice.' The process should be transparent, and the data traceable. A department within the WHO oversees this process, ensuring that the guideline reflects the Organization's principles and way of working.\n\nThe WHO's guideline recommends unequivocally that abortion be performed on request of a pregnant woman, at any time during pregnancy up until delivery, without any delay that may potentially cause the pregnant woman distress.\n\nRecommend against laws and other regulations that restrict abortion by grounds abortion is available when carrying a pregnancy to term would cause the woman, girl or other pregnant person substantial pain or suffering ...\n\nRemarks:\n\niv. health grounds reflect WHO's definitions of health and mental health (see Glossary);\n\n[A state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity]\n\n[Mental health: A state of well-being in which every individual realizes their own potential, can cope with the normal stresses of life, can work productively and fruitfully, and is able to make a contribution to their community]\n\nGestational age limits delayed access to abortion, especially among women seeking abortions at later gestational ages... Gestational age limits have been found to be associated with...increased rates of maternal mortality and poor health outcomes.\n\nThe evidence also showed that grounds-based approaches that require fetal impairments to be fatal for abortion to be lawful frustrate providers who wish to support patients and leave women no choice but to continue with pregnancy. Being required to continue with a pregnancy that causes significant distress violates numerous human rights. States are obligated [emphasis added] to revise these laws to make them compatible with international human rights law.\n\nPut another way (but exactly the same meaning), the WHO's official position is that a woman may kill an unborn embryo or baby soon after conception, or when it is entering the birth canal during labor, and it is the health profession's role to do this without delay upon request.\n\nThe WHO's logic in arriving at its conclusion is deeply flawed, and can only be reached by adopting a specific view of humanity that is inconsistent with that of most Member States. It is therefore an illegitimate position, if the WHO works for all of its Member States and not for narrow, unrepresentative interests.\n\nIn its lack of inclusivity, the guideline demonstrates a growing culture within international health that is deeply troubling and dangerous. This culture relies on a denial of reality to achieve a pre-ordained result. It deliberately misuses human rights norms to force a particular worldview on others - a form of cultural colonialism and quite the opposite of the community-driven and anti-colonialist ideals around which the WHO was formed.\n\nThe WHO justifies its position on abortion by citing what it considers relevant human rights norms and law. It holds that there is no choice but to allow abortion, as refusing or delaying abortion, such as through a requirement for counselling, could potentially distress the pregnant woman.\n\nWhen offering and providing counselling, it is essential to apply the following guiding principles:\n\n* ensure that the individual is requesting the counselling and make it clear that counselling is not required;\n\nIn causing distress, her human right to be free from ill-health (in this case psychological pain) has been infringed, based on the definition of health - physical, mental and social well-being - in the WHO's Constitution. This weak argument requires disagreement with another person's views to constitute a violation of that person's rights. Society could not function on this basis.\n\nIn establishing the required evidence-base for maintaining its incongruous position, the WHO has to consider only risk and no benefit.\n\nThe studies also showed that where women requested an abortion and were denied care due to gestational age this could result in the unwanted continuation of pregnancy ... those who presented at 20 weeks' gestation or later. This outcome can be viewed as incompatible with the requirement in international human rights law to make abortion available when carrying a pregnancy to term would cause the woman substantial pain or suffering, regardless of pregnancy viability.\n\nThe studies used by the WHO do not however only record negative outcomes of delays through required counselling, but note that women also considered that legally-required delays and counselling could be positive, with some opting not to have an abortion as a result.\n\nIf the WHO recognized any requirement for counselling, it would have to recognize that practitioners withholding counselling would be putting informed consent in jeopardy, and in some cases babies (\"pregnancy tissue\") would be lost when an informed woman, on reflection, may have preferred to keep it. Informed consent is at the basis of modern medical ethics and an internationally-accepted human right.\n\nThe WHO recognizes in the document that \"States must ensure that informed consent is provided freely, safeguarded effectively, and based on complete provision of high-quality, accurate and accessible information.\" Incongruously, it then considers that the rights of that woman are violated if the abortion is delayed in order to ensure that information, and time for reflection, are provided.\n\nAt no place in the document is the definition of 'human' discussed. The WHO's argument for abortion requires absolute acceptance that human rights do not apply in any form prior to birth. The only human rights acknowledged in the document are those of the pregnant woman, with disputable subsidiary rights of providers. Discussion of fetal (unborn baby) rights is absent. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights does not specify a time that dividing cells become human, creating uncertainty for the Guideline's argument.\n\nDefining 'human' is difficult. It may be argued that the lack of independence, or ability to express thoughts to others, prevents the application of human rights to a fetus. This claim would require dependent adults or children who cannot articulate their thoughts to be considered sub-human, such as people severely mentally or even physically disabled, and those who are comatose. This is a position previously adopted by fascist and eugenic regimes that believed in a hierarchy of human worth. It would be unfitting for the WHO.\n\nThe only intrinsic difference between the baby within and without the womb apart from geography is the umbilical cord. Suggesting the functioning of this fetal organ, comprised solely of fetal tissue, somehow prevents the rest of the fetus from being a sentient being would require redefinition of 'sentient.' For the last few months within the uterus, when it could readily survive outside, it has its own unique and complete human DNA, a beating heart and independent movement. Some mothers will say it responds to familiar sounds. If removed from the uterus, it displays sensations of pain and distress, hunger, an ability to cry, respond to stimuli, recognize light, shapes and sounds, and drink milk. If this sentient being is not human, what is it?\n\nAny recognition of humanness of the WHO's 'pregnancy tissue' requires an acceptance of two persons in the woman - fetal relationship (i.e. two potential victims). The human rights basis of the WHO's guidelines would then require one to be considered subservient to the other. This would require a rewriting of the human rights agreements on which the panel based its determination (a hierarchy of human worth).\n\nAlternatively, it can be decided that the rights to life of one can be infringed to benefit the other. We do this in war, we may do it in triage at the scene of an accident. We also do this sometimes in pregnancy. It involves recognizing hard and unpleasant choices, as it involves putting value on potential harm to the woman versus harm to the second person in the equation. This approach would fit with human rights conventions, but would disallow an approach that relies solely on a dogma that claims the pregnant woman's welfare is the only relevant concern. The failure of the WHO to recognize the potential of two humans with attendant rights in a pregnancy smells like cowardice. Their argument is flawed.\n\nThe Guideline manages the definition of the unborn by avoiding the use of the term 'baby' anywhere in its 120 pages - itself quite a feat of drafting for an abortion guideline. The term 'pregnancy tissue' is used most frequently, to describe the growing mass within the uterus:\n\nPregnancy tissue should be treated in the same way as other biological material unless the individual expresses a desire for it to be managed otherwise.\n\nHowever, if the fetus happens to be born at 28 weeks, the WHO considers it a fully-fledged human. It is recorded in human death statistics, and the WHO provides guidance on how to support its health and welfare elsewhere. The WHO's 2022 Recommendations for care of the preterm or low-birth-weight infant state: \"The care of preterm and LBW infants is a global priority.\" To kill it once out of the birth canal is murder in most countries - an ultimate violation of human rights.\n\nFor the WHO's entire human rights argument to be valid, the definition of a human must therefore rely entirely on geography - inside or outside the uterus. The WHO must hold that at some moment during the final stage of labor, the 'pregnancy tissue' is suddenly transformed into an entirely different entity - from irrelevant tissue to a full person with the rights and immeasurable worth that this implies.\n\nIf this guideline is followed, my 28-week baby became human not through any intrinsic value or worth, but because the drugs suppressing labor became ineffective. If these drugs had worked, the WHO holds that my child could have been subsequently killed as one might excise an annoying tumor. From pregnancy tissue to \"global priority\" depends, in the WHO's eyes, on a matter of seconds and centimeters. Whether a live abortion 'product' is a global priority or pregnancy tissue is not discussed - the assumption is that the intent to abort changes the status of the erstwhile human to irrelevance.\n\nThe guideline considers removing the right to conscientious objection of the provider (this \"may\" be necessary), where this will delay an abortion. This is a fascinating contrast to the emphasis on avoiding any risk of emotional harm or stress to the pregnant woman. Rights apply here to the pregnant woman, but not to other involved humans.\n\nRecommend that access to and continuity of comprehensive abortion care be protected against barriers created by conscientious objection.\n\nRights of the provider to follow their own cultural or religious belief may be overridden \"if no alternative provider is available.\"\n\nIf it proves impossible to regulate conscientious objection in a way that respects, protects and fulfils abortion seekers' rights, conscientious objection in abortion provision may become indefensible.\n\nProviders are not classed as equal humans; their rights are subservient. If we are to believe that 'stress' is a legitimate harm from which the pregnant woman must be protected as a human right, then this must also apply to stress caused to a provider who is forced to act against their conscience. We are faced with at least two beings whose rights must be weighed together. The WHO's simplistic human interpretation again seems to fall apart.\n\nThe guideline committee did appear aware of this dilemma, and resorted to EU human rights law to support their case (though legal arguments may question its fit with the Universal Declaration on Human Rights). The right to conscientious objection in other instances is strongly protected in international law. Whilst the guideline quotes sections of this EU law, it fails to elucidate contrary arguments. French human rights law takes a contrary view and upholds the rights of such a medical or nursing practitioner to object; recognizing the issue of forcing a practitioner to act in a way they consider wrong, It explicitly notes the inherent moral difficulty of setting rules in this area.\n\nThe rights of parents or guardians are recognized in regard to decisions on medical procedures for minors in most WHO Member States, whilst being more widely questioned in some Western cultures. The Guideline considers only one view throughout, that young age is no limit to consent. Practitioners therefore have a duty to maintain confidentiality for a pregnant girl who requests an abortion and prefers her parents to be unaware.\n\n\"Recommend that abortion be available on the request of the woman, girl or other pregnant person without the authorization of any other individual, body or institution.\"\n\nThis is a complicated area, and there are strong arguments for protecting confidentiality, as there are for parental involvement in consenting to medical procedures for children under their protection. The WHO considers only one specific Western view to be legitimate and therefore superior, and supposedly holding that contrary views (e.g. in Islamic, South Asian, East Asian or most Christian communities) to be illegitimate and inappropriate.\n\nIn formulating a guideline on an issue critical to human rights and values, the world might expect the WHO to consider the rich diversity of its cultural, religious and societal life. This is not evidenced within the document's 150 pages. The drafting committee generically noted such opinions and cultures are important in the introduction:\n\nThe needs of all individuals with respect to abortion are recognized and acknowledged in this guidance,\n\nand further;\n\nWHO guidelines systematically incorporate consideration of the values and preferences of end-users of the recommended or suggested interventions into the process of developing the guidance.\n\nThose formulating the guidelines were seemingly unaware that such values and preferences may lead to differing opinions regarding the killing of an unborn baby.\n\nThe WHO states that a global survey was conducted, followed by a meeting with participants from 15 (of 194) Member States. Either no one in this 'inclusivity'-driven process raised any objection, or those in charge of the process considered such opinions so inferior to their own as to be unworthy of record. If cultural colonialism needs definition, this act of imposing one's values on others through an apparent belief in the superiority of one's own views seems an excellent example.\n\nThe WHO, heavily sponsored by private vested interests, is not the population-oriented organization it was 75 years ago. Along with the Covid-19 response, this guideline demonstrates the extent to which the WHO has regressed to a narrow Western-derived worldview that many in the West would find appalling. It seeks to impose this on others, considering alternate approaches unworthy of serious discussion.\n\nWhatever one's views on abortion, the flaws in the WHO's human rights arguments, and its clear avoidance of diversity of opinion, suggest an organization focused on dogma rather than evidence.\n\nAbortion is a morally complicated area. Policy must be based on compassion and respect for all of humanity. To impose one's views on others irrespective of evidence and without respect for alternate opinion is a form of fascism. The WHO may have a place in advising on safety of a medical procedure, but not in pontificating over moral rights and wrongs. It is not there to tell people how to live their lives, but to support them with the tools to do so.\n\nCountries currently considering whether to grant greater powers to the WHO would do well to question whether the organization is compatible with their culture, ethics and beliefs. The abortion guideline is a reflection of the WHO's growing unfitness to lead global health.", "source": {"uri": "brownstone.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brownstone Institute"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestational_age", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gestational age"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-being", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Well-being"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Who", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Who"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preterm_birth", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Preterm birth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vagina", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vagina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychotherapy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Psychotherapy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torture", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Torture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "World Health Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tissue (biology)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_state_of_the_European_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Member state of the European Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pregnancy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fetus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Human rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_human_rights_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "International human rights law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informed_consent", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Informed consent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscientious_objector", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Conscientious objector"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gestation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterus", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Uterus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mental health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodily_integrity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bodily integrity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeast_Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Southeast Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developing_country", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Developing country"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "East Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Abortion", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Abortion", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Support_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Society/Support Groups", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Alternative_Lifestyles", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Alternative Lifestyles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Morality", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Morality", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://brownstone.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Shutterstock_1691653948.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9794390", "eventUri": "eng-9794390", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

Voters approved on Nov. 7, 2023 an amendment to the Ohio Constitution to protect access to abortion.\n\nBy GEOFF MULVIHILL and KIMBERLEE KRUESI - Associated Press\n\nAbortion was slightly more common across the U.S. in the first three months of this year than it was before the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and cleared the way for states to implement bans, a report released Wednesday found.\n\nA major reason for the increase is that some Democratic-controlled states enacted laws to protect doctors who use telemedicine to see patients in places that have abortion bans, according to the quarterly #WeCount report for the Society of Family Planning, which supports abortion access.\n\nThe data comes ahead of November elections in which abortion-rights supporters hope the issue will drive voters to the polls. In some places, voters will have a chance to enshrine or reject state-level abortion protections.\n\nFallout from the Supreme Court's June 2022 ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization has remade the way abortion works across the country. The #WeCount data, which has been collected in a monthly survey since April 2022, shows how those providing and seeking abortion have adapted to changing laws.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Fourteen states are enforcing bans on abortion at all stages of pregnancy, with some exceptions, and four others bar it after about six weeks of pregnancy.\n\nNumbers went up in places where abortion remains legal until further into pregnancy -- and especially in states such as Illinois, Kansas and New Mexico, which border states with bans.\n\nAbortion pills and telemedicine play a key role. In March, doctors in states with laws to protect medical providers used telemedicine to prescribe abortion pills to nearly 10,000 patients in states with bans or restrictions on abortion by telehealth -- accounting for about 1 in 10 abortions in the U.S.\n\nLaws to protect medical providers who use telemedicine to prescribe abortion pills started taking effect in some Democratic-led states last year.\n\n\"It eases the burden on clinics,\" said Ushma Upadhyay, a University of California, San Francisco School of Medicine professor who co-leads #WeCount. \"So it creates more space for the people who are coming to clinics.\"\n\nAbortion opponents say the fight over the abortion drug mifepristone isn't over after a narrow Supreme Court ruling that preserved access to it for now. But so far there have not been legal challenges to shield laws.\n\nThe latest edition of the survey covers the first three months of this year. January was the first time since the survey began that it's counted more than 100,000 abortions across the country in a single month.\n\nBefore the shield laws began kicking in and #WeCount started tallying them, people were still getting some pills in places with bans.\n\nUpadhyay said that even before the fall of Roe, abortion demand was greater than access. She also said that even with the changing patterns, some women are continuing pregnancies they would have ended if they could have.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nOne of the states where abortions increased was Florida. That changed in April, when a ban after six weeks' gestation took effect. The data doesn't yet reflect that change.\n\nThe policy could change again through a November ballot measure that would make abortion legal until viability, generally considered to be around 23 or 24 weeks into pregnancy. It would take at least 60% approval to add that to the state constitution.\n\nOne vote against it will come from Mia Adkins, a 20-year-old senior at Florida International University. She said the overturning of Roe and changes in Florida's law have brought more attention to abortion and have strengthened her belief that there should be limits.\n\n\"Instead of pushing for more abortion legal later in pregnancy, we should be pushing for laws that protect these pregnant parents and students and provide them with the support that they need,\" said Akins, a senior at Florida International University.\n\nFlorida is one of six states where abortion-related measures are already on the ballot. Determinations from elections officials about adding similar questions are pending in four more states. In one, Nebraska, there are dueling amendments: One to allow access until viability and one to keep the current policy, which bans most abortions after 12 weeks of pregnancy.\n\nAbortion-rights supporters have prevailed in all seven abortion ballot questions in the U.S. since 2022. That tracks with public opinion polling that has shown growing support for abortion rights, including a recent Associated Press-NORC poll that found 6 in 10 Americans think their state should allow someone to obtain a legal abortion if they don't want to be pregnant for any reason.\n\nAn amendment to protect access could be on the ballot in Arizona, a political battleground state where court cases have swung abortion policy -- and access -- since the Dobbs ruling.\n\nThe state Supreme Court ruled in April that Arizona should enforce an 1864 ban on abortions at all stages of pregnancy, only for lawmakers to repeal that law. The state's ban on abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy remains. The ballot measure would expand it to 24 weeks.\n\nNatalie Harper, a 23-year-old independent who usually doesn't vote, said the potential of bringing back the Civil War-era ban \"absolutely\" impacts her decision to head to the polls and support the ballot measure this November. \"Seeing that as a possibility really made me realize that everyone's pro-choice voices need to be heard in hopes it never goes in that direction again,\" she said.\n\nIn Missouri, which has outlawed almost all abortions and where nearly none were reported in the new data, election officials could soon certify whether a proposed constitutional amendment guaranteeing abortion rights received enough petition signatures to qualify for the ballot in the reliably Republican state.\n\nUniversity of Missouri political scientist Peverill Squire said that if the measure is put before voters, it could draw out enough Democratic voters to help swing a few competitive legislative races.\n\n\"They can seize on the personal freedom arguments the Republicans have generally owned over the recent elections,\" he said.\n\nAssociated Press writers Sejal Govindarao in Phoenix and David A.

From his support for a national abortion ban to his refusal to protect access to IVF, it's clear that Vance believes that he should have a say in personal medical decisions that should be between a patient and their doctor.\"\n\nLawson said the super PAC branch of Planned Parenthood \"is working to ensure Kamala Harris and Tim Walz make it to the White House, where they can build on the work Harris has done as vice president to protect our lives, bodies, and futures.\"\n\nMini Timmaraju, the CEO and president of nonprofit Reproductive Freedom for All, said on MSNBC that Minnesota \"was the first state to codify federal protections for abortion rights and immediately sprung into action right after the Dobbs decision... that tells you so much about Tim Walz and Gwen [Walz], quite frankly.\"\n\nMinnesota \"also instituted protections for patients and providers not to be extradited to states with bans,\" Timmaraju said. \"They were very clear about where they were in terms of protecting a nationwide population that was going to have to come to Minnesota.\"\n\nThe Harris-Walz and Trump campaigns have been contacted for comment via email.\n\nAnti-abortion activists on the other hand have criticized Walz's record.\n\n\"Harris-Walz is the most pro-abortion, baby killing, ticket we've ever seen in America,\" Kristan Hawkins, the president of nonprofit Students for Life of America, wrote on X on Tuesday.\n\nBilly Valentine, of SBA Pro-Life America, wrote that Walz \"is no moderate on abortion. Because of the laws he championed & signed, there is NO abortion limit in Minnesota & young girls can get secret abortions without their parents ever knowing.\"\n\nHarris is making abortion a major issue of her presidential campaign. And it's a winning one for Democrats -- voters have sided with abortion-rights supporters every time the issue has been directly on the ballot since Roe's fall.\n\nShe and Walz will likely repeatedly hammer former President Trump and Vance on abortion ahead of November's election. Trump has repeatedly taken credit for the overturning of Roe but has publicly declined to support a national abortion ban.\n\nVance has said he adheres to Trump's views but said in 2022 that he would like abortions to be \"illegal nationally.\"", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "khaleda_rahman@newsweek.com", "name": "Khaleda Rahman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion-rights_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abortion-rights movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproductive_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Reproductive rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobbs_v._Jackson_Women's_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dobbs v.

One of those is abortion, about which she has spoken frequently since Joe Biden declared her his preferred successor.\n\nJust over two years ago, the US Supreme Court overruled the 49-year-old precedent of Roe v Wade and withdrew constitutional protection for the choice to terminate a pregnancy. In the June 2022 majority judgment in the case of Dobbs v Women's Health Organization - the case that overturned Roe v Wade - Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito wrote that Roe v Wade had been \"egregiously wrong from the start\". He concluded that: \"Its reasoning was exceptionally weak, and the decision has had damaging consequences.\"\n\nUnder the guise of undoing this wrong, the Supreme Court returned the issue of abortion law to state jurisdiction. Americans have been watching the consequences unfold ever since, as various states have passed laws restricting or banning women from being able to terminate pregnancies.\n\nHarris led the Biden administration's response to this decision, visiting an abortion clinic and speaking out about reproductive freedom. Even before she took on the presidential candidacy, campaign rallies and adverts from the Democratic campaign were focused on the decision restrict women's reproductive freedom.\n\nThe results of the 2022 midterm elections suggest this could be a useful strategy. The Democrats did significantly better than expected - and abortion was considered a major factor. Certainly successful ballot initiatives in California, Michigan and Ohio (which added constitutional protections) and defeats for abortion restriction measures in Kansas, Kentucky and Montana suggested an increased turnout of Democrat voters.\n\nThis November, a possible 11 states could have abortion-related initiatives on the ballot, including Arizona, a key swing state in this election. In such a tight race, parties are looking for any possible advantage.\n\nPossibly mindful of this - and of the fact that most Americans continue to support some access to abortion - the Republican party recently softened its official stance, removing language calling for a federal abortion ban which appeared in both 2016 and 2020. Some Republican state legislators have urged caution about strict abortion bans that may alienate potential voters.\n\nWidespread impact\n\nSpeaking regularly about reproductive rights also helps keep in voters' minds the widespread consequences of the Dobbs decision on abortion and how it affects pregnant women and medical professionals across much of the country.\n\nOnly half of states protect abortion, at least until the point of foetal viability. These states - particularly those which border two or more states with abortion bans such as Illinois and Ohio - have become centres for those seeking abortion care and who are able to travel.\n\nFourteen states have outright bans on abortion access. Some have exceptions for cases of rape, incest, or to save the life of the pregnant women, but many do not. Another 11 states have gestational limits that are earlier than the previous 24-week limit. Some are so early that most pregnant women don't even yet know they are pregnant.\n\nMore than half of states have other restrictions: waiting time requirements, mandated counselling, required ultrasounds, multiple visits to the doctor, spousal or parental consent laws and others.\n\nThe most recent estimates suggest 48% of women now live in states with some form of abortion restrictions. That figure rises to 57% for black women and higher for Native American women. The Guttmacher Institute, a pro-choice research organisation, estimates that almost one in five pregnant women now have to travel out of state for abortion access.\n\nIndirect attacks on access\n\nBy speaking out on abortion, the Harris campaign is also seeking to galvanise pro-choice voters by reminding them that the threats come in many forms.\n\nIn June, an attempt to undermine access to the abortion pill, mifepristone, was rejected by the Supreme Court. The case was, in effect, a back door attempt to further restrict abortion access.\n\nAnd, although interstate travel is constitutionally protected in the US, some localities in Texas have been trying to prevent use of their roads by those seeking to leave the state to access abortion care.\n\nTwo University of Texas at Austin professors sought the legal right to academically fail students who take time off for abortion care, while Idaho academics were warned they could no longer advise students about anything relating to abortion.\n\nAnd, as the New Republic reported, anti-abortion laws are increasingly being used by domestic abusers to threaten and harass partners.\n\nHealthcare consequences\n\nAs anti-abortion advocates continue to press for greater restrictions across the US, data from the Guttmacher Institute show that they continue to fail to achieve their aim of reducing abortion rates. In 2023, abortion rates were higher across the country than in previous years.\n\nBut, as many doctors are pointing out, the restrictions are regularly putting the lives of pregnant women at risk. Mimi Zieman, an obstetrician from Georgia wrote: \"If I were finishing my training today and choosing somewhere to practice, I would not come to this state or anywhere with these restrictions on practice.\"\n\nMany agree with her. Recent studies suggest as many as 70% of gynaecology students in the US are less likely to consider residency in a state with abortion restrictions.\n\nThis risks leaving pregnant women without both abortion access and good, reliable, accessible reproductive healthcare. In a country that already has the highest maternal mortality rate among developed nations, this suggests further declines.\n\nTestimony from practitioners overwhelmingly indicates that threats to medical licences and risk of prison terms are deterring doctors from undertaking vital healthcare provision.\n\nAnd pregnant women are suffering as a result. Stories now abound of women like Kate Cox, who was forced to travel outside of Texas for an abortion when the state refused to determine that her case was sufficiently life threatening to qualify under their exemption. Or that of Nicole Miller, airlifted to a nearby state because the abortion she required to medically stabilise her was unavailable in her home state of Idaho.\n\nHarris and the Democrats want voters to remember these stories as they go to the polls in November. And they want voters to remember that it was Trump, and his Supreme Court appointees, who made it possible.", "source": {"uri": "theconversation.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Conversation"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproductive_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Reproductive rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Roe v.

Tim Walz toured a Planned Parenthood clinic in his state alongside Harris -- the first time a sitting president or vice president had visited an abortion provider.\n\nThat visit in March put Minnesota's efforts to safeguard reproductive rights in the spotlight.\n\nNow, Harris and Walz represent a Democratic ticket that vocally supports access to abortion and fertility treatment, during an election in which those issues are expected to be important to voters and a focus of many Democratic campaigns.\n\nMinnesota was the first state to pass a law protecting abortion rights after the Supreme Court's Dobbs decision in 2022. The, which Walz signed in January 2023, stipulates that local governments -- cities, counties, towns, etc. -- cannot regulate a person's choice to obtain an abortion or other reproductive services.\n\nA few months later, Walz signed a second abortion-rights law -- that statute prohibits the arrest of abortion providers in Minnesota and protects people who travel there to avoid another state's abortion ban. According to the law, Minnesota officials do not have to turn over a patient's health records in response to another state's subpoena or court order.\n\nThe share of people who traveled from other states to Minnesota for abortions tripled between 2020 and 2023, according to data from the Guttmacher Institute, a research organization that supports abortion access.\n\nAbortion-rights advocates pointed to these actions when expressing support for Walz on Tuesday.\n\n\"By choosing Gov. Walz as her running mate, Vice President Harris has put forward the most pro-reproductive freedom ticket in history,\" Alexis McGill Johnson, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Action Fund, said in a statement. \"Gov. Walz is a longtime champion of sexual and reproductive health care and has been a fierce abortion rights champion as governor.\"\n\nMinnesota, which traditionally votes for Democratic presidential candidates, has some of the most progressive abortion policies in the country. Abortion has been legal there since the Roe decision in 1974. In 1995, the Minnesota Supreme Court ruled that abortion rights were protected by the state's constitution.\n\nSince Roe was overturned, the state has adopted additional measures to make abortions easier to obtain. In July 2022, a district court judge struck down several requirements that hindered access, including a rule that only physicians could perform abortions and a mandatory 24-hour waiting period. Abortions are also covered by state Medicaid funds.\n\nAs governor, Walz also slashed funding for a grant program under the Minnesota Department of Health that supported so-called crisis pregnancy centers, which offer pregnant people counseling and supplies while often trying to persuade them not to get abortions. Some of these centers have been known to provide inaccurate or misleading information.\n\nNational Right to Life, the largest anti-abortion organization in the U.S., said Tuesday that Walz's move to defund crisis pregnancy centers in his state was a \"huge blow\" to families.\n\n\"If elected, a Harris-Walz Administration would push for the most extreme abortion agenda policies of any administration,\" Carol Tobias, president of National Right to Life, said in a statement.\n\nIn addition to his support for abortion access, Walz has championed in vitro fertilization. Many abortion rights supporters worry that access to the fertility treatment is under threat post-Dobbs, since IVF often involves discarding embryos due to genetic abnormalities or because they are no longer needed. Some who believe in the notion of fetal personhood have opposed that practice. National Right to Life, for instance, says frozen embryos should be given to other couples rather than destroyed.\n\nWalz told the Minneapolis Star Tribune in March that his two children were born with the help of fertility treatments, which his wife had been receiving for seven years before getting pregnant with their daughter.\n\nIn February, Walz criticized an Alabama Supreme Court ruling that said embryos created through IVF were considered children, meaning people could theoretically be sued for destroying them. The ruling prompted several IVF providers in Alabama to pause their services; they resumed once the state passed legal protections for fertility doctors and clinics.\n\n\"This issue is deeply personal to our family and so many others,\" Walz wrote on Facebook at the time. \"Don't let these guys get away with this by telling you they support IVF when their handpicked judges oppose it.

Voters approved on Nov. 7, 2023 an amendment to the Ohio Constitution to protect access to abortion.\n\nBy GEOFF MULVIHILL and KIMBERLEE KRUESI - Associated Press\n\nAbortion was slightly more common across the U.S. in the first three months of this year than it was before the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and cleared the way for states to implement bans, a report released Wednesday found.\n\nA major reason for the increase is that some Democratic-controlled states enacted laws to protect doctors who use telemedicine to see patients in places that have abortion bans, according to the quarterly #WeCount report for the Society of Family Planning, which supports abortion access.\n\nThe data comes ahead of November elections in which abortion-rights supporters hope the issue will drive voters to the polls. In some places, voters will have a chance to enshrine or reject state-level abortion protections.\n\nFallout from the Supreme Court's June 2022 ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization has remade the way abortion works across the country. The #WeCount data, which has been collected in a monthly survey since April 2022, shows how those providing and seeking abortion have adapted to changing laws.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Fourteen states are enforcing bans on abortion at all stages of pregnancy, with some exceptions, and four others bar it after about six weeks of pregnancy.\n\nNumbers went up in places where abortion remains legal until further into pregnancy -- and especially in states such as Illinois, Kansas and New Mexico, which border states with bans.\n\nAbortion pills and telemedicine play a key role. In March, doctors in states with laws to protect medical providers used telemedicine to prescribe abortion pills to nearly 10,000 patients in states with bans or restrictions on abortion by telehealth -- accounting for about 1 in 10 abortions in the U.S.\n\nLaws to protect medical providers who use telemedicine to prescribe abortion pills started taking effect in some Democratic-led states last year.\n\n\"It eases the burden on clinics,\" said Ushma Upadhyay, a University of California, San Francisco School of Medicine professor who co-leads #WeCount. \"So it creates more space for the people who are coming to clinics.\"\n\nAbortion opponents say the fight over the abortion drug mifepristone isn't over after a narrow Supreme Court ruling that preserved access to it for now. But so far there have not been legal challenges to shield laws.\n\nThe latest edition of the survey covers the first three months of this year. January was the first time since the survey began that it's counted more than 100,000 abortions across the country in a single month.\n\nBefore the shield laws began kicking in and #WeCount started tallying them, people were still getting some pills in places with bans.\n\nUpadhyay said that even before the fall of Roe, abortion demand was greater than access. She also said that even with the changing patterns, some women are continuing pregnancies they would have ended if they could have.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nOne of the states where abortions increased was Florida. That changed in April, when a ban after six weeks' gestation took effect. The data doesn't yet reflect that change.\n\nThe policy could change again through a November ballot measure that would make abortion legal until viability, generally considered to be around 23 or 24 weeks into pregnancy. It would take at least 60% approval to add that to the state constitution.\n\nOne vote against it will come from Mia Adkins, a 20-year-old senior at Florida International University. She said the overturning of Roe and changes in Florida's law have brought more attention to abortion and have strengthened her belief that there should be limits.\n\n\"Instead of pushing for more abortion legal later in pregnancy, we should be pushing for laws that protect these pregnant parents and students and provide them with the support that they need,\" said Akins, a senior at Florida International University.\n\nFlorida is one of six states where abortion-related measures are already on the ballot. Determinations from elections officials about adding similar questions are pending in four more states. In one, Nebraska, there are dueling amendments: One to allow access until viability and one to keep the current policy, which bans most abortions after 12 weeks of pregnancy.\n\nAbortion-rights supporters have prevailed in all seven abortion ballot questions in the U.S. since 2022. That tracks with public opinion polling that has shown growing support for abortion rights, including a recent Associated Press-NORC poll that found 6 in 10 Americans think their state should allow someone to obtain a legal abortion if they don't want to be pregnant for any reason.\n\nAn amendment to protect access could be on the ballot in Arizona, a political battleground state where court cases have swung abortion policy -- and access -- since the Dobbs ruling.\n\nThe state Supreme Court ruled in April that Arizona should enforce an 1864 ban on abortions at all stages of pregnancy, only for lawmakers to repeal that law. The state's ban on abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy remains. The ballot measure would expand it to 24 weeks.\n\nNatalie Harper, a 23-year-old independent who usually doesn't vote, said the potential of bringing back the Civil War-era ban \"absolutely\" impacts her decision to head to the polls and support the ballot measure this November. \"Seeing that as a possibility really made me realize that everyone's pro-choice voices need to be heard in hopes it never goes in that direction again,\" she said.\n\nIn Missouri, which has outlawed almost all abortions and where nearly none were reported in the new data, election officials could soon certify whether a proposed constitutional amendment guaranteeing abortion rights received enough petition signatures to qualify for the ballot in the reliably Republican state.\n\nUniversity of Missouri political scientist Peverill Squire said that if the measure is put before voters, it could draw out enough Democratic voters to help swing a few competitive legislative races.\n\n\"They can seize on the personal freedom arguments the Republicans have generally owned over the recent elections,\" he said.\n\nAssociated Press writers Sejal Govindarao in Phoenix and David A.

The law, known as the Protect Reproductive Options (PRO) Act, established abortion as a \"fundamental right\" throughout pregnancy without any restrictions.\n\nThe legislation positioned Minnesota as the first state to codify abortion rights after the Supreme Court's overturning of Roe v. Wade, which relegated the decision-making power on abortion to individual states.\n\nThe PRO Act not only enshrines the right to abortion but also includes provisions for birth control, family planning, and sterilization. Prior to this act, abortion was legal in Minnesota up through the second trimester. The bill's author, Democrat state Sen. Jennifer McEwen, stated that the act ensures abortion access irrespective of future court decisions.\n\nThe bill's passage drew criticism from various quarters. State Senate Minority Leader, Republican Mark Johnson, condemned it as \"the most extreme\" in the nation concerning youth sterilization, late-term abortions, and new reproductive rights.\n\nMinnesota Citizens Concerned for Life (MCCL) labeled the law as \"extreme, inhumane, and harmful to women and children,\" asserting that it permits abortion up to birth without parental consent for minors undergoing the procedure.\n\nMCCL Co-Executive Director Cathy Blaeser said, \"The PRO Act means a right to abort any baby for any reason at any time up to birth. It legalizes the elective killing of a human being in utero even in the third trimester, when the child can feel pain and could survive outside the womb.\"\n\nBlaeser further criticized the lack of safeguards in the law, such as requiring third-trimester abortions to occur in hospitals or mandating state-licensed facilities for performing abortions. She expressed concern that the legislation opens the door for notorious late-term abortion providers to operate in Minnesota without sufficient regulation.\n\nDannenfelser also pointed out that Walz signed additional legislation expanding taxpayer-funded abortions, weakening informed consent protections, and diminishing safeguards for babies born alive after failed abortion attempts.\n\nShe argued that \"with Harris and Walz as standard-bearers, the Democratic Party has become the 'Shout Your Abortion' party, with no limits for any reason even in the seventh, eighth or ninth month,\" she said. \"In contrast to [former] President [Donald] Trump, (vice president nominee] J.D.

Fourteen states are enforcing bans on abortion at all stages of pregnancy, with some exceptions, and four others bar it after about six weeks of pregnancy.\n\nNumbers went up in places where abortion remains legal until further into pregnancy -- and especially in states such as Illinois, Kansas and New Mexico, which border states with bans.\n\nAbortion pills and telemedicine play a key role. In March, doctors in states with laws to protect medical providers used telemedicine to prescribe abortion pills to nearly 10,000 patients in states with bans or restrictions on abortion by telehealth -- accounting for about 1 in 10 abortions in the U.S.\n\nLaws to protect medical providers who use telemedicine to prescribe abortion pills started taking effect in some Democratic-led states last year.\n\n\"It eases the burden on clinics,\" said Ushma Upadhyay, a University of California, San Francisco School of Medicine professor who co-leads #WeCount. \"So it creates more space for the people who are coming to clinics.\"\n\nAbortion opponents say the fight over the abortion drug mifepristone isn't over after a narrow Supreme Court ruling that preserved access to it for now. But so far there have not been legal challenges to shield laws.\n\nThe latest edition of the survey covers the first three months of this year. January was the first time since the survey began that it's counted more than 100,000 abortions across the country in a single month.\n\nBefore the shield laws began kicking in and #WeCount started tallying them, people were still getting some pills in places with bans.\n\nUpadhyay said that even before the fall of Roe, abortion demand was greater than access. She also said that even with the changing patterns, some women are continuing pregnancies they would have ended if they could have.\n\nOne of the states where abortions increased was Florida. That changed in April, when a ban after six weeks' gestation took effect. The data doesn't yet reflect that change.\n\nThe policy could change again through a November ballot measure that would make abortion legal until viability, generally considered to be around 23 or 24 weeks into pregnancy. It would take at least 60% approval to add that to the state constitution.\n\nOne vote against it will come from Mia Adkins, a 20-year-old senior at Florida International University. She said the overturning of Roe and changes in Florida's law have brought more attention to abortion and have strengthened her belief that there should be limits.\n\n\"Instead of pushing for more abortion legal later in pregnancy, we should be pushing for laws that protect these pregnant parents and students and provide them with the support that they need,\" said Akins, a senior at Florida International University.\n\nFlorida is one of six states where abortion-related measures are already on the ballot. Determinations from elections officials about adding similar questions are pending in four more states. In one, Nebraska, there are dueling amendments: One to allow access until viability and one to keep the current policy, which bans most abortions after 12 weeks of pregnancy.\n\nAbortion-rights supporters have prevailed in all seven abortion ballot questions in the U.S. since 2022. That tracks with public opinion polling that has shown growing support for abortion rights, including a recent Associated Press-NORC poll that found 6 in 10 Americans think their state should allow someone to obtain a legal abortion if they don't want to be pregnant for any reason.\n\nAn amendment to protect access could be on the ballot in Arizona, a political battleground state where court cases have swung abortion policy -- and access -- since the Dobbs ruling.\n\nThe state Supreme Court ruled in April that Arizona should enforce an 1864 ban on abortions at all stages of pregnancy, only for lawmakers to repeal that law. The state's ban on abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy remains. The ballot measure would expand it to 24 weeks.\n\nNatalie Harper, a 23-year-old independent who usually doesn't vote, said the potential of bringing back the Civil War-era ban \"absolutely\" impacts her decision to head to the polls and support the ballot measure this November. \"Seeing that as a possibility really made me realize that everyone's pro-choice voices need to be heard in hopes it never goes in that direction again,\" she said.\n\nIn Missouri, which has outlawed almost all abortions and where nearly none were reported in the new data, election officials could soon certify whether a proposed constitutional amendment guaranteeing abortion rights received enough petition signatures to qualify for the ballot in the reliably Republican state.\n\nUniversity of Missouri political scientist Peverill Squire said that if the measure is put before voters, it could draw out enough Democratic voters to help swing a few competitive legislative races.\n\n\"They can seize on the personal freedom arguments the Republicans have generally owned over the recent elections,\" he said.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Sejal Govindarao in Phoenix and David A.

In the first three months of 2024, there was an average of 98,990 abortions a month.\n\nRelated: Project 2025: what does the rightwing blueprint say about abortion?\n\n\"Increased access has addressed a lot of the pre-existing unmet need for abortion that was already there,\" said Ushma Upadhyay, professor at University of California, San Francisco, and co-chair of #WeCount, a research project collecting monthly abortion volume data by state.\n\nReports like these were \"critical, because if we don't know how many abortions are occurring, then we are subject to misinformation\", said Amanda Jean Stevenson, assistant professor of sociology at University of Colorado Boulder, who is not affiliated with the study.\n\nAfter the Dobbs decision, states radically reshaped reproductive healthcare access, with 14 states instituting total bans and many others setting extreme limitations. Only nine states and the District of Columbia have no gestational bans on abortion.\n\nProviders and policymakers in states where the procedure is legal responded to the crackdown on access by expanding telehealth, where patients can be seen remotely by physicians who can prescribe abortion medications.\n\nBefore the decision in Dobbs v Jackson Women's Health Organization, about 5% of abortions happened through telehealth. Now, it accounts for 20% of all abortions in the US.\n\nDobbs pushed abortion providers to be creative in offering care, Upadhyay said, and telehealth is also cheaper, especially given the costs associated with traveling for in-person abortion care - transportation, lodgings, childcare, time off work, and more.\n\nProviders also feel a \"moral imperative\" to reach those people living under abortion bans who have no other choice, Upadhyay said.\n\nSome states and districts have also passed laws to protect the rights of patients and providers - including shield laws, which protect clinicians offering telehealth care to people in other states.\n\nMore than 65,000 people living in states with abortion bans were able to access medication through telehealth visits between July 2023 and March 2024 because of shield laws.\n\nFlorida, which is geographically close to several states with restrictions, was one of five states with the most abortions each month from January to March this year. But the state enacted its own six-week ban on 1 May.\n\nResearchers expect to see a decline in in-person abortions in Florida, but there will probably be an increase in telehealth abortions because of the new restrictions.\n\nNotably, not all patients are comfortable with or able to use telehealth, and abortion restrictions are still impeding patients' ability to access reproductive healthcare, Upadhyay said.\n\n\"We believe there's still many people living in these states with abortion bans who are not getting the abortions that they desire because of all of the barriers,\" she said.\n\nStevenson also pointed out: \"Just because abortion is increasing doesn't mean there aren't still people who can't get abortions who want them.\"", "source": {"uri": "aol.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telehealth", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Telehealth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Roe v.

That's about 14% higher than the average from the same period last year, or about 12,000 more abortions each month.\n\nThere are seasonal patterns and some month-to-month fluctuation in abortion rates, but in January, monthly abortions topped 100,000 for the first time since #WeCount started tracking about two years ago.\n\n\"I am expecting the number to plateau at some point. But with each report, we see the numbers increase, so we're not at that plateau just yet,\" said Dr. Ushma Upadhyay, co-chair of #WeCount and a professor at the University of California, San Francisco's Advancing New Standards in Reproductive Health. \"There continues to be a lot of unmet need that is being met in various ways.\"\n\nMuch of the increase has been driven by a surge in medication abortions, especially those provided through telehealth. When #WeCount started collecting data from abortion providers in April 2022, about 4% of all abortions were medication abortions provided through telehealth. The latest report shows that 20% of all abortions in March 2024 were telehealth abortions.\n\nMedication abortion is a method by which someone ends their pregnancy by taking two drugs -- mifepristone and misoprostol -- rather than having a surgical procedure. The US Food and Drug Administration approved the drugs for abortion use more than two decades ago, and the regimen is approved for use up to 10 weeks gestation. Research has long found that medication abortion is safe and effective, and recent studies have shown that to be true even when the patient gets the medicine through a telehealth appointment.\n\nIt's not entirely clear whether medication abortion provided through telehealth are increasing because access has improved or because there's growing awareness of and preference for this option, Upadhyay said. But it is clear that telehealth abortions have become an important option amid a changing and increasingly restrictive abortion landscape.\n\nA rise in telehealth abortions can help keep schedules more open for people who need in-person care, Upadhyay said. The new report shows that the number of in-person abortions in the first three months of 2024 was about the same as it was in the first three months of 2023, while telehealth abortions rose 28%.\n\nTelehealth abortion rates vary by state but tend to be less common in states that had the least restrictions. In the first quarter of 2024, about 10% of abortions in New Mexico and Illinois and only 7% in New York were telehealth abortions, according to the new report. Meanwhile, more than half of all abortions in Wyoming were telehealth abortions; judges have recently blocked legislative attempts to ban abortion - and medication abortion, specifically - in the state.\n\n\"Telehealth providers are really going through tremendous efforts to offer this care at very low or no cost to patients,\" Upadhyay said. \"As long as we keep seeing more states increasing restrictions, I think we will continue to see the abortion volume grow as people learn about telehealth.\"\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter\n\nSign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nIn states where abortion is restricted, abortions provided under shield laws have also become more common. Shield laws offer some legal protections for providers who practice in some states where abortion remains legal to prescribe medication abortion drugs via telehealth to people living in states with bans or restrictions.\n\nNearly a third of all telehealth abortions in the first three months of 2024 were provided under shield laws; an average of 6,700 each month were for people living in states with total abortion bans or six-week bans, and nearly 2,500 were for people living in states with restrictions on telehealth abortion.\n\n\"While the volume of abortions has increased, we know that this isn't the full story,\" Dr. Alison Norris, co-chair of #WeCount and professor at The Ohio State University's College of Public Health, said in a statement. \"Even as we see the increase in abortion volume nationally, the burden on an individual living in a state with an abortion ban is enormous, especially if they need in-person abortion care.\"\n\nAbortions have all but ceased in the 14 states that have enacted bans since the Dobbs decision, which overturned Roe. v.

You can see the full list of writers and signatories at the bottom of the piece.\n\nTwo years after the Supreme Court's Dobbs decision, the crisis of abortion access in America has reached a breaking point.\n\nAt the same time, Democrats are making abortion a central issue in their election-year campaigns, and their allies at well-funded national reproductive rights and health non-profit organizations invest millions in vague, multi-year electoral strategies.\n\nAs representatives of local abortion funds across the country, we of course support any political efforts to expand abortion access in the future. But we also want to pose this question to the elite sectors of our movement: where is your strategy to increase abortion care right now, when it has never been needed more?\n\nLocal abortion funds from across the country are eager to share their perspectives and expertise on the challenges of funding abortion in their area, and the frustrations that are brought on by the failure of national reproductive health, rights, and access organizations to attend to the needs of so many pregnant people on the ground.\n\nThere is an alarming disconnect between abortion funds, grassroots organizations that are actually providing access to abortion, and large national organizations that are advocating for access.\n\nLocal abortion funds were founded as a direct result of the shortcomings of Roe v Wade, which, though it ensured a basic right to some abortion care, enshrined a limited framework that proved vulnerable to conservative assaults long before Dobbs. Abortion funds created a bridge between the theoretical right to an abortion and the real-world ability to access that right for the most marginalized. Local funds know their unique community needs best and work tirelessly to meet them through case management, emotional support, arranging travel and logistical support, and directly covering the costs of abortion care. Unlike national funds, most local funds have no client requirements or restrictions-such as around gestational age or income-and trust the people who seek their help as the experts in their own lives.\n\nSince the Dobbs decision, and subsequent enforcement of extremely restrictive state laws, local funds have used their decades-long expertise, deep relationships, and infrastructure to collectively meet this moment of crisis and support the growing number of people struggling to access abortion. This is despite skyrocketing travel and appointment costs. For the Kentucky Health Justice Network, travel costs have grown by over 500% since Dobbs. While the expenses, misinformation, and fear tactics continue to rise, local abortion funds have doubled down on their commitment to supporting their callers, no matter what.\n\nBy contrast, some national funds with resources that our organizations could only dream of are making it harder, not easier, to get abortion care. In June, for instance, the National Abortion Federation (NAF) announced that it would be cutting back on the amount it gives people who qualify for its financial assistance program. Where the NAF previously paid for 50 percent of the cost of care, it will now pay for just 30 percent, with no exceptions for exceptionally high abortion prices later in pregnancy. For example, an abortion seeker in Nevada who qualifies for NAF assistance will now be responsible for $1,330 of their $1,900 procedure. This is a significant change from the $800 they would be responsible for under the previous NAF funding parameter. Planned Parenthood also announced similar cuts to its Justice Fund program.\n\nThese groups blamed their decision on budget constraints, but their resources dwarf anything local funds can provide. For instance, Planned Parenthood received $275 million in 2022 from just one donor. Every budget is a reflection of priorities. The choice of these well-funded, national organizations to drastically deprioritize their assistance will be felt by abortion seekers and their local abortion funds who will be called upon to bridge a much larger funding gap on tightening budgets. Local and regional abortion funds are often underfunded, understaffed, or volunteer-led. This decision will spread them even thinner, and make accessing abortion care even more difficult.\n\nThen, on Tuesday, June 25th, the newly-formed Abortion Access Now coalition held a celebration to announce its not-so-new plan to advocate for abortion access in the next decade (not \"now\" as the name suggests). During this launch, which we watched live, one of the speakers went so far as to say that national groups were the ones holding together the gaps in access since the Dobbs decision. This statement is not only incorrect, but an erasure of the work of local abortion funds that have been coordinating access for individuals across the country despite increasingly hostile conditions.\n\nBut while the statement was offensive, it was also a telling encapsulation of the warped perspectives and priorities of the most powerful groups in our movement. The national organizations that comprise the Abortion Access Now coalition fundraise endlessly, siphon support from institutional funders and grassroots donors, capitalize on the Dobbs rage donations, and funnel that money into campaign bank accounts. These groups already largely operate hundreds of million-dollar budgets. This is all being done with the promise that this time they'll be successful in getting their ducks in a row in Congress and repealing the Hyde Amendment. It's a great idea (and one that abortion funds also dream of), but this campaign is a gross abuse of funding and publicity that deprioritizes actual access to abortion care right now.", "source": {"uri": "thenation.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Nation"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion_fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abortion fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abortion in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobbs_v._Jackson_Women's_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dobbs v.

Dr. Alison Norris, co-chair of the group, said the data captures about 80% of abortion clinics nationwide. Using that data, the group makes estimates to account for clinics that do not provide reports.\n\nFrom January to March 2024, there were about 19,700 telehealth abortions per month, according to the report. The states with the biggest jumps in the average number of abortions per month compared with the first three months of 2023 include New York, California, Virginia, Kansas and Pennsylvania. Kansas saw 59% more telehealth abortions and 29% more in-person abortions each month.\n\nNorris said the use of telehealth has continued to grow, particularly now that five states -- New York, Massachusetts, Washington, Vermont and Colorado -- specifically shield those who provide telehealth abortions from legal ramifications if they work with patients from states with abortion restrictions. Maine will become the sixth state when its shield law takes effect on Friday. Fourteen states in the U.S. have a near-total ban on abortion.\n\n\"There was already a move toward telehealth (during the COVID pandemic), but I think it was accelerated by the need,\" Norris said.\n\nTelehealth abortions provided by clinicians in states with shield laws averaged 9,200 per month from January to March 2024, according to the report. That's an increase of about 1,200 per month from the last report that showed data from October to December 2023.\n\nIn the nine months from July 2023 to March 2024, over 65,000 people in states with near-total or six-week bans and states with telehealth restrictions have accessed medication abortion provided under shield laws.\n\nBut the vast majority of abortions still take place in person, Norris said, in part because medication abortion can only be prescribed via telehealth through 10 weeks' gestation, and because some people just prefer to be seen in person.\n\nThe overall number of abortions per month has grown as well, with a high of 102,350 in January. The average over the first three months of 2024 was 98,990 -- the highest monthly number during the last quarter of 2023 was 91,470.\n\nNorris said the data shows the number of abortions began to rise nationally in 2017, and while it's hard to pinpoint the cause, there are new factors that could be contributing. Some people who needed an abortion before the Dobbs decision in 2022 could get them once states passed legislation to remove barriers. And for those who faced financial issues obtaining an abortion, she said, there is more awareness of abortion funds and other sources of support.\n\n\"There's a lot more information in the ecosystem, there's better resources on the internet, and there's potentially been a destigmatization of abortion, given how much it's in the media and being talked about by politicians,\" Norris said.\n\nAlthough she views it as a positive that many people who live in states with near-total bans or six-week bans are able to access abortion via telehealth, she said it's still an unfair situation.\n\n\"Those bans and those restrictions are not evidence-based in terms of public health science, and the fact that thousands and thousands of people don't have access to ordinary and safe health care that's time-sensitive just because of the state where they live, it is an injustice that I hope people keep their eyes on,\" Norris said. \"It's important that people maintain the will to keep advocating for access for all people in the U.S., no matter where they live.\"", "source": {"uri": "ncnewsline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NC Newsline"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kelcie_moseley_morris@ncnewsline.com", "name": "Kelcie Moseley-Morris", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telehealth", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Telehealth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kansas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kansas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion_clinic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abortion clinic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_control", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Birth control"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Medical abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vermont", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vermont"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Vermont"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maine", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Maine"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Maine"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobbs_v._Jackson_Women's_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dobbs v.

The same district judge deciding this case will also decide on Gov. Gordon's first-in-the-country measure to ban abortion pills.\n\nWyoming United for Freedom was formed at the end of last year, Kindred noted, when other abortion advocacy groups were overwhelmed with work following the overturning of Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, in which the U.S. Supreme Court ruled the Constitution of the United States does not confer a right to abortion.\n\nAbortion access will not be on the Wyoming ballot this November but Kindred pointed out the group is preparing for action in several scenarios, including if the judge decides the constitution protects the right to abortion.\n\n\"We will still need to organize to defend against attacks on reproductive freedom from our legislature,\" Kindred stressed. \"And make sure that we are electing people that will protect those rights.\"\n\nIn Wyoming, citizens can initiate amendments to state statutes but only the legislature has the power to introduce measures to change the state's constitution.

In front of a crowd of hundreds, Harris stressed abortion rights are at risk if Republicans win in November. She said Biden has vowed to veto any attempts to ban abortion nationwide.\n\n\"We believe in freedom. Freedom from the government telling us what to do about matters of heart and home,\" Harris explained. \"We believe in the right of people to make basic decisions, like when and if they will start a family and how.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Trump's pick for vice president, Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, has supported national abortion bans and opposed exceptions for rape and incest. Democrats are hoping the distinction will lead them to a victory this year in the key battleground state of Michigan. It was a critical issue for voters in 2022, when Gov. Gretchen Whitmer won her reelection race easily and both chambers of the state legislature flipped to Democrats for the first time in decades.\n\nIn her speech, Harris condemned political violence following the recent attempted shooting of Donald Trump at a Pennsylvania political rally. She also praised the gun safety measures Michigan lawmakers passed in recent years, including universal background checks and safe storage requirements. She added politicians in Washington, D.C., should favor similar laws.\n\n\"The solutions don't really require that much creativity,\" Harris asserted. \"What they do require is people in the United States Congress to have courage to act and do what we know is the right thing to do and not cower, based on special interests and powerful lobbyists.\"\n\nOne Michigan Democrat in Congress, Rep. Hillary Scholten, D-Grand Rapids, has called on Biden to drop out of the presidential race over concerns about his age and cognitive ability. Harris would likely be a top replacement choice in the race against Trump.\n\nget more stories like this via email\n\nAbortion bans and restrictions limit women's participation in the workforce, according to a new analysis that quantifies the negative impacts on state economies.\n\nSouth Dakota saw an average loss in GDP of nearly 1% per year between 2021 and 2023, due to a drop in labor force participation by people who became pregnant and didn't have access to abortion care, according to data from the Institute for Women's Policy Research. That adds up to nearly $641 million in economic losses to the state.\n\nJamila Taylor, president and CEO of the Institute for Women's Policy Research, said the 16 states with abortion bans or extreme restrictions, including South Dakota, are costing the national economy $68 billion annually.\n\n\"Not only do these restrictions and bans have a clear impact on the health and well being of people with the ability to get pregnant, they also have an impact on their productivity and their economic position in life,\" Taylor said.\n\nTaylor added abortion access not only helps family finances, but also allows women ages 15 to 44 to engage more broadly in society -- in local communities or politics, for example.\n\nDespite restrictions, abortion numbers are rising. The first full calendar year after the Dobbs decision overturned Roe v. Wade saw an 11% increase in abortions since 2020 - or over one million abortions in the formal health care system in 2023, according to The Guttmacher Institute.\n\nIf voters pass South Dakota's constitutional Amendment G in November, it will enshrine protections to abortion.\n\nHannah Haksgaard, University of South Dakota law professor, said even if it passes, people seeking an in-state abortion would likely see a lag time before services become available.\n\n\"There would still likely be state legislation that would try to restrict abortion in certain ways, and then the question would become whether those restrictions violated the new constitutional amendment,\" she said.\n\nHaksgaard added that could make providers move slowly on offering abortion services in the state, until the legal issues are settled.\n\nget more stories like this via email\n\nA ruling from the U.S. Supreme Court Thursday will allow for abortions in emergency situations in Idaho - for now.\n\nThe justices said they were dismissing an appeal, reestablishing a lower court decision allowing hospitals to perform abortions in emergency cases, despite the state's restrictive abortion laws.\n\nMolly Meegan, chief legal officer for the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, said the organization is glad to see temporary relief in this case but added it is far from a complete solution.\n\n\"The way these laws are set up in Idaho and elsewhere are that there are limits on what care can be provided,\" Meegan explained. \"Those limits are not clearly defined, and they're not committed to the discretion, the judgment, the expertise and the training of the physician that's facing a particular patient.\"\n\nThe protection for emergency abortions stems from a federal law known as the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act. The law requires Medicare-funded hospitals to perform abortions in emergency situations. The three dissenting justices in Thursday's case called the Act's ability to preempt Idaho's restrictive abortion laws \"plainly unsound.\"\n\nDr. Stella Dentas, president of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, said there is still a lack of clarity around the law in Idaho and OB/GYNs are leaving the state as a result. She noted when doctors face the prospect of jail over restrictive laws like Idaho's, it makes their job more difficult in emergency situations.\n\n\"It's already hard enough to make these critical decisions in the moment,\" Dentas emphasized. \"If you're stuck on, 'OK, I can go down path A, but I'm not allowed to go down path B,' that is very confusing for both clinicians and the patients and the shared decision-making that we do.\"\n\nMeegan added legislators should not be determining what care is available to patients.\n\n\"These questions need to be decided by science, by evidence, by the individual case in front of you,\" Meegan contended. \"The idea that you can have black and white worlds being created by people without the expertise, training or experiencing the emergencies is really fundamentally dangerous.\"\n\nget more stories like this via email", "source": {"uri": "publicnewsservice.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Public News Service"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion-rights_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abortion-rights movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abortion law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyoming", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wyoming"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wyoming"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobbs_v._Jackson_Women's_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dobbs v.

In it, though, was a secret that is certain to catapult to national prominence now that Walz has been selected to be Democrat Kamala Harris's running mate.\n\nIn Walz's state and on his watch, five infants were \"born alive\" in 2021 during failed abortions, and none was provided life-saving care though two got \"comfort care,\" the Minnesota Department of Health reported on July 1, 2022.\n\nThree other infants were \"born alive\" during abortions in 2019, Walz's first year as governor, and they too perished without life-saving care, according to a July 1, 2020 report from the same state agency.\n\nMinnesota was the rare state to require such born-alive abortions to be publicly reported, creating a powerful statistic for pro-life and anti-abortion forces to draw upon.\n\nBut in 2023, Walz worked with his new Democrat-controlled Legislature to eliminate both the reporting requirement and the state's legal obligation for doctors, nurses and medical professionals to administer life-saving care to infants born alive during an abortion procedure. The governor-turned-vice presidential nominee signed an omnibus bill known as SF2995 that closed one of the few statistical windows on late-term abortions and the possibility that babies born alive were left to die.\n\nOf all the veep nominees on Vice President Harris's short list from which she could have chosen, the affable former Army reserve sergeant major and school teacher from Minnesota provided the best opportunity for Donald Trump and his Republican posse to fuel a debate on extremism, experts told Just the News.\n\nJust a few days ago, Walz attended a \"White Dudes for Harris\" event and made a proclamation likely to offend millions of American immigrants who fled the repression of Marxism, communism and socialism in their homelands.\n\n\"One person's socialism is another person's neighborliness,\" Walz said casually in a video clip certain to remain viral through Election Day.\n\nWalz also has pushed to eliminate fossil fuels and gas-powered cars from Minnesota, with a goal of being carbon-neutral by 2050, with EVs mostly required by 2035 under a California-style tailpipe emission rule and electricity to be carbon-free by 2040.\n\nHe also endured significant criticism for his slow response to the George Floyd riots that devastated Minneapolis in 2020. And he signed a law allowing illegal aliens to get state drivers' licenses in the midst of one of America's steepest border crises.\n\nBut Walz's role in making Minnesota one of the most permissive abortion states in the world - abortions can be sought for any reason and at any time - is certain to become a lightning rod in the last 90 days of the campaign, allowing Republicans to flip a script and suggest the Democratic ticket in 2024 is the more extremist when it comes to abortion.\n\nThat assault began in earnest on Tuesday just hours after Harris named Walz her running mate.\n\n\"Governor Tim Walz of Minnesota signed a law allowing the killing of preborn babies at any stage, even up to birth. Along with Kamala Harris, who made her career out of persecuting pro-life activists, this is the most pro-abortion presidential ticket in American history,\" prominent anti-abortion activist Lila Rose wrote on X.\n\nAnd Minnesota's rare abortion reporting requirements - now disbanded - will allow conservatives to put front and center an uncomfortable truth for pro-choice advocates: later-term abortions sometimes result in infants being born alive and left to die with just comfort care or no care at all.\n\nThe language of Minnesota's born-alive abortion reports from 2019 through 2023 are as plain and clear as they are likely to be shocking to many Americans unaware that the new Democratic vice presidential nominee presided over a state that allowed eight infants to die without life-saving care on his watch.\n\nThe July 2022 report described the five deaths in 2021 this way:\n\nFor the calendar year of January 1, 2021 through December 31, 2021, 5 abortion procedures resulting in a born-alive infant were reported.\n\n* In one instance, fetal anomalies were reported resulting in death shortly after delivery. No measures taken to preserve life were reported and the infant did not survive.\n\n* In two instances, comfort care measures were provided as planned and the infant did not survive.\n\n* In two instances, the infant was previable. No measures taken to preserve life were reported and the infant did not survive.\n\nThe July 2020 report described the three deaths in 2019 this way:\n\nFor the calendar year of January 1, 2019 through December 31, 2019, three (3) abortion procedures resulting in a born-alive infant were reported.\n\n* In one instance, fetal anomalies were reported but residual cardiac activity was present at 2 minutes. Care of fetus was transferred to the second medical doctor. No measures taken to preserve life were reported and the infant did not survive.\n\n* In one instance, comfort care measures were provided as planned and the infant did not survive.\n\n* In one instance, the infant was previable. No measures taken to preserve life were reported and the infant did not survive.\n\nMinnesota's permissive abortion laws run contrary to public opinion, especially in second and third trimesters when infants can be born alive in a failed abortion.\n\nGallup reported in 2023, the same year Walz signed the new abortion law in his state, that majorities of Americans oppose legal abortion in the second (55%) and third (70%) trimesters.\n\nRepublican pollster Scott Rasmussen created a messaging platform last year to help Republicans, often portrayed as the extremists when it comes to abortion, to flip the script by focusing on supporting women considering an abortion decision and denouncing abortion up to the moment of birth.\n\n\"We've done some research and when you say that most Democrats have supported abortion up to the moment of birth, hardly anybody believes you,\" Rasmussen told Just the News earlier this year.\n\n\"Only 5% of voters believe that a woman should be able to have an abortion at any time up to the moment of birth with no exceptions and no restrictions. And by the way, on the other side, only 5% are saying that there should be no abortions allowed, you know, regardless of any other restrictions.\"\n\nLongtime evangelical activist Ralph Reed, who helped fashion the GOP's pro-life platform for Trump in 2024, said Trump has an unprecedented opportunity to flip the script.\n\n\"The real extremists on abortion are the Democrats whose platform calls for abortion on demand at any stage of pregnancy, including up to the moment of birth and calls for the creation of a new abortion entitlement under Medicaid that would allow for taxpayer-funded abortion under Medicaid for the first time since Roe v. Wade, and would lead to hundreds of thousands of additional abortions every year,\" Reed told Just the News last month. \"And when you poll that, about 12% of the electorate supports it. So they're the extremists. They're the radicals. They're out of the mainstream.\"\n\n- - -", "source": {"uri": "theminnesotasun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Minnesota Sun"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-abortion_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anti-abortion movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Socialism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_Minnesota", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor of Minnesota"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergeant_major", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sergeant major"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omnibus_bill", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Omnibus bill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_termination_of_pregnancy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Late termination of pregnancy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion-rights_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abortion-rights movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Government agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extremism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Extremism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Floyd_protests", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "George Floyd protests"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_neutrality", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carbon neutrality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_California", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Governor of California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marxism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_fuel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fossil fuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minneapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minneapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minneapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Abortion", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Abortion", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence_and_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence and Abuse", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 98}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9794390", "eventUri": "eng-9794390", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2019-01-01", "dateEnd": "2019-12-31", "textStart": 4700, "textEnd": 4741}, {"amb": false, "date": "2020-07-01", "textStart": 719, "textEnd": 731}, {"amb": false, "date": "2020-07-", "textStart": 4612, "textEnd": 4621}], "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1}

He signed the repeal of Minnesota's Positive Alternatives Act which had provided support for pregnant mothers and funding for pregnancy help centers.\n\nSUPPORT LIFENEWS! To help us fight Kamala Harris' abortion agenda, please help LifeNews.com with a donation!\n\nShe said Walz supports a policy allowing unlimited abortion for any reason throughout pregnancy. He signed legislation to enshrine a \"fundamental right\" to abortion for any reason until birth in Minnesota law and invalidate existing protections like the state's parental involvement law.\n\nBefore becoming governor, Walz represented Minnesota's 1st congressional district in the U.S. House of Representatives from 2007-2019. During his time in Congress, Walz earned a 0% pro-life rating from National Right to Life.\n\n\"Kamala Harris' selection of Tim Walz is in keeping with her entrenched support of unlimited abortion,\" said Tobias. \"Walz, like Harris, is fully entrenched in his support of abortion anytime, anywhere, and under any circumstances.\"\n\nWhen running for governor, Walz was endorsed by pro-abortion groups supporting unlimited abortion, including Planned Parenthood Action Fund and NARAL Pro-Choice America (now called \"Reproductive Freedom for All\").\n\nAnother pro-life group also condemned Walz's radical abortion record.\n\n\"Kamala Harris and Tim Walz make up the most pro-abortion presidential ticket America has ever seen. There is no daylight between them on this issue,\" said SBA Pro-Life America President Marjorie Dannenfelser. \"Walz is no moderate when it comes to abortion. Last year Walz signed the 'PRO Act,' which was at the time the country's most extreme law enshrining abortion on demand throughout pregnancy as a 'fundamental right' without limits of any kind. He then signed further legislation grossly expanding taxpayer-funded abortion, stripping away the state's informed consent protections, and significantly weakening protections for babies born alive.\n\n\"With Harris and Walz as standard-bearers, the Democratic Party has become the 'Shout Your Abortion' party, with no limits for any reason even in the seventh, eighth or ninth month. In contrast to President Trump, JD Vance and the GOP, who support the right of the people to set limits on abortion and provide real options for mothers in need, Democrats have made it clear nothing - not the checks and balances built into our government, not the humanity of unborn children and not the true needs of women - will stop them from imposing all-trimester abortion nationwide.\n\n\"The pro-life movement must fully engage to defeat the Harris-Walz extreme abortion agenda in November. Our team is working tirelessly to reach 10 million voters, with four million visits to the homes of voters in key battleground states.\"", "source": {"uri": "lifenews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Life News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "steven_ertelt@lifenews.com", "name": "Steven Ertelt", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion-rights_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abortion-rights movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-abortion_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anti-abortion movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Right_to_Life_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Right to Life Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota's_1st_congressional_district", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota's 1st congressional district"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planned_Parenthood", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Planned Parenthood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marjorie_Dannenfelser", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marjorie Dannenfelser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NARAL_Pro-Choice_America", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NARAL Pro-Choice America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Doctor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Juris Doctor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_powers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Separation of powers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Swing state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Abortion", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Abortion", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://www.lifenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/harriswalz.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9794390", "eventUri": "eng-9794390", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1}

Tim Walz state of the state address (Screenshot Office of the Governor of Minnesota/YouTube)\n\nMinnesota Democrat Gov. Tim Walz pushed to turn Minnesota into an abortion \"safe haven\" just one day after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris, who has been at the forefront of the Biden administration's pro-abortion policies, selected Walz on Tuesday to be her running mate for the 2024 presidential election. The Minnesota governor issued an executive order on June 25, 2022, that said individuals entering Minnesota from states that restrict abortion would not be extradited for receiving the procedure.\n\n\"Reproductive freedom is a right under Minnesota law...that right no longer exists in many states, including many of our neighboring states,\" Walz wrote in the order, bemoaning the restrictions states would soon apply. \"The impending loss of freedom to people around the nation poses an imminent threat to the health and safety of people in Minnesota to the extent that other states may seek to infringe on essential liberties protected by the Minnesota Constitution.\"\n\nThe June 2022 emergency order banned state agencies from assisting \"any investigation or proceeding that seeks to impose civil or criminal liability or professional sanctions upon a person or entity\" for receiving an abortion in the state.\n\n\"I will exercise my discretion to decline requests for the arrest or surrender of any person charged with a criminal violation of a law of another state where the violation alleged involves the provision of, assistance with, securing of, or receipt of reproductive health care services, unless the acts forming the basis of the prosecution of the crime charged would also constitute a criminal offense under Minnesota law,\" the order reads.\n\nIn 2022, there were 12,175 total abortions in Minnesota, with 226 occurring after 21 weeks of pregnancy.\n\nAbortions performed in Minnesota in 2022 increased by 20% from 2021, with 17% coming from out-of-state women, a seven point increase compared to the previous year, according to the state's health department. The number of North Dakota residents receiving abortions in Minnesota went up from 84 to 383, Iowa residents from 56 to 174, and Texas residents from 18 to 150, all states that severely restricted the procedure that year.\n\nIn 2023, Walz signed a law enshrining a right to abortion into Minnesota's constitution with no restrictions, making it nearly irreversible. That same year he signed a bill reversing a requirement that physicians provide care for infants that are born alive after a failed abortion attempt.\n\nAs vice president, Harris has been open about her pro-abortion agenda, earning endorsements from several pro-abortion groups and even campaigning at a Minnesota abortion clinic in early 2024. Harris previously voted against bills that would have protected babies that can feel pain and born-alive babies.\n\n\"Kamala Harris' selection of Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate, reaffirms Harris' extreme views on the issue of life,\" Jeanne Mancini, president of March for Life Action, said in a statement. \"Harris and Walz share a longstanding history of hostility towards pregnant women in need and their unborn children.\"\n\nWalz's office and the Harris campaign did not immediately respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation's request for comment.", "source": {"uri": "dailycallernewsfoundation.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "dailycallernewsfoundation.org"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2024 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobbs_v._Jackson_Women's_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dobbs v.

To help us fight Kamala Harris' abortion agenda, please help LifeNews.com with a donation!\n\n\"The PRO Act means a right to abort any baby for any reason at any time up to birth. It means that the elective killing of a human being in utero is perfectly legal even in the third trimester of pregnancy, when the child can feel excruciating pain and could live outside the womb. It means that parents have no right to know when their teenage daughter has been taken to undergo an abortion,\" said MCCL Co-Executive Director Cathy Blaeser. \"Gov. Walz's absolutist abortion policy puts Minnesota in the company of just a small handful of countries around the world, including North Korea and China. It is extreme, inhumane, and harmful to women and children who deserve so much better.\"\n\nWalz signed the bill despite polls showing Minnesota did not want unlimited abortions.\n\nPolls showed that most Minnesotans and most Americans disagree with the no-limits policy enshrined by the PRO Act. A 2022 KSTP/SurveyUSA poll found that only 30 percent of Minnesotans think abortion should always be legal.\n\nBut that coincides with Kamala Harris' views of abortions up to birth.", "source": {"uri": "lifenews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Life News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "steven_ertelt@lifenews.com", "name": "Steven Ertelt", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infanticide", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Infanticide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fundamental rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statute", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Statute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pregnancy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlie_Kotyza-Witthuhn", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carlie Kotyza-Witthuhn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legislature", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Legislature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protecting_the_Right_to_Organize_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Protecting the Right to Organize Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_monarchy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Absolute monarchy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "North Korea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "North Korea"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Abortion", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Abortion", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Support_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Society/Support Groups", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Disabilities", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Disabilities", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 64}], "image": "https://www.lifenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/harriswalz3.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9794390", "eventUri": "eng-9794390", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1}

Carlie Kotyza-Witthuhn, D-Eden Prairie, the bill would allow abortion on demand even late in pregnancy when unborn babies are viable and can feel excruciating pain. The law Walz signed also would also deny parents the right to know if their minor daughter is seeking an abortion.\n\nSUPPORT LIFENEWS! To help us fight Kamala Harris' abortion agenda, please help LifeNews.com with a donation!\n\n\"The PRO Act means a right to abort any baby for any reason at any time up to birth. It means that the elective killing of a human being in utero is perfectly legal even in the third trimester of pregnancy, when the child can feel excruciating pain and could live outside the womb. It means that parents have no right to know when their teenage daughter has been taken to undergo an abortion,\" said MCCL Co-Executive Director Cathy Blaeser. \"Gov. Walz's absolutist abortion policy puts Minnesota in the company of just a small handful of countries around the world, including North Korea and China. It is extreme, inhumane, and harmful to women and children who deserve so much better.\"\n\nWalz signed the bill despite polls showing Minnesota did not want unlimited abortions.\n\nPolls showed that most Minnesotans and most Americans disagree with the no-limits policy enshrined by the PRO Act. A 2022 KSTP/SurveyUSA poll found that only 30 percent of Minnesotans think abortion should always be legal.\n\nBut that coincides with Kamala Harris' views of abortions up to birth.\n\nHarris refuses to name any limits on abortion that she supports.\n\nHarris continues to gaslight the American people by saying all she wants to do is \"bring Roe v. Wade back\" but, when asked repeatedly what that means to her and what, if any, protections should be there for babies in the womb ... she can't list a single one. Listen to her dodge this question for four minutes on CBS, when the reporter hounds her to pick a single week where babies are allowed the right to live. Even when a reporter asked if she'd support a 20 to 24-week limit. Kamala shook her head and said, \"No, no, no.\" She wouldn't even commit to a seven- or either-month limit.\n\nHarris co-sponsored legislation that federally forces all-trimester abortions on all 50 states.\n\nThe so-called Women's Health Protection Act is so radical, even members of the Democrat party said it would go much further than Roe. And then they opposed it. This is the legislation that Democrats continue to try and shove through Congress to make the law of the land. And Mrs. Harris was an early sponsor and originator of it. It would not only bypass the will of the voters in each state and strip all pro-life states of their protections for babies in the womb but it would mandate all-trimester abortion laws in each state. It would take away informed consent laws for people seeking abortions and would get rid of parental consent for parents of minors seeking abortions. These are just a few of the shocking laws Mrs. Harris' WHPA would federally force all states to do. And speaking of laws...\n\nWhile in Congress, she repeatedly voted against protecting babies when they can feel pain AND babies born alive after failed abortions.\n\nMrs. Harris' congressional record showed that she voted twice against a limit on abortions at 20 weeks, well after science shows unborn babies can feel pain. She didn't stop there, she made sure to say that granting babies the right to live at five months, is \"immoral.\" As if that wasn't bad enough, she also voted twice against providing any kind of medical care for babies who survive an abortion. If it were up to Mrs. Harris, nationwide survivors like those from the Abortion Survivors Network, would not be granted a second chance at life.", "source": {"uri": "lifenews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Life News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "steven_ertelt@lifenews.com", "name": "Steven Ertelt", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterus", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Uterus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pregnancy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protecting_the_Right_to_Organize_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Protecting the Right to Organize Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlie_Kotyza-Witthuhn", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carlie Kotyza-Witthuhn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_Minnesota", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor of Minnesota"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fundamental rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statute", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Statute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legislature", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Legislature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_monarchy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Absolute monarchy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Roe v.

Tim Walz unveiled the part of his budget that focuses on education and kid-focused spending in January 2023.\n\nWhere the Biden administration has struggled, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz has succeeded.\n\nThe former schoolteacher turned politician whom Vice President Kamala Harris picked as her running mate in the 2024 presidential race has been able to enact many of the progressive policies President Joe Biden and Harris pitched but failed to get through Congress.\n\nAided by a Democratic sweep of the state legislature, Walz last year signed a landmark budget that established a generous child tax credit, created a paid family and medical leave program and made college tuition free for certain students, among other measures.\n\n\"We're pretty sure it's going to mean a fairer, more inclusive, better and more prosperous Minnesota,\" he said upon signing the budget.\n\nThe One Minnesota Budget built upon the left-leaning policies that Walz established in the state, including protecting abortion rights and gender-affirming care, investing in affordable housing and instituting clean energy measures.\n\nRepublicans, however, have critiqued Walz's efforts, which entail an increase in state spending, as unsustainable and as increasing the burden on families and businesses.\n\nAlso, Minnesota was one of the few states to raise taxes in recent years, even though it had large surpluses, the Tax Foundation said. The increases mainly affected businesses and high-earning residents.\n\nHere are some of the progressive measures Walz has enacted as governor:\n\nChild tax credit\n\nMany lower-income Minnesota families can access a state child tax credit, which Walz signed into law last year. The credit, which provides up to $1,750 per kid with no limit on the number of children claimed, is the most generous in the US and is projected to lower child poverty by a third. It is also refundable so families can receive a refund even if they don't owe any tax, though they do need to file a tax return to claim the credit.\n\nThe full credit is available to single parents earning $29,500 and couples earning $35,000, and slowly phases out depending on income, filing status and number of children.\n\nMore than 215,000 families, with more than 437,000 children, have claimed the credit so far for 2023, Walz said in a statement last week. The average credit was $1,244 per child - totaling more than $545 million.\n\nFree college tuition\n\nLast year, Walz signed a bill into law that made college tuition free for students from Minnesota families who earn less than $80,000 a year.\n\nBetween 15,000 and 20,000 students are expected to benefit during the upcoming school year, the first year the program is in effect.\n\nKnown as the North Star Promise Scholarship, the program covers the balance of tuition and fees remaining for students after applying other scholarships, grants and stipends that don't have to be paid back. The idea is that students won't have to borrow student loans to pay for tuition and mandatory fees to attend college.\n\nStudents who are eligible for a Pell grant, a federal financial aid award for low-income students, may receive additional funds from the state program.\n\nStudents must be enrolled at a public two- or four-year college in Minnesota to be eligible for the North Star Promise Scholarship. They are required to be Minnesota residents, but undocumented students who meet certain conditions are also eligible, like they are for other state financial aid awards.\n\nMinnesota is now one of more than 30 states that offer some kind of free tuition program.\n\nAbortion access\n\nWalz has been an advocate for abortion access. In January 2023, he signed into law the Protect Reproductive Options Act, which established the right for people in the state to obtain an abortion after the US Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade the previous year.\n\nIn April 2023, he signed a law protecting people who travel to Minnesota for abortions, and clinicians providing abortion care, from criminal penalties from other states.\n\nMinnesota's policies around abortion make it among the most protective states for abortion access, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research and policy organization that supports abortion rights, with more people expected to travel to the state for care after Iowa implemented a six-week ban in July.\n\nWhen Harris became the first vice president believed to have visited an abortion clinic while in office, she chose a Planned Parenthood location in Minnesota.\n\nUniversal school meals\n\nStudents can receive free breakfast and lunch in participating schools after Walz signed a universal school meals bill into law last year, making it the fourth state to enact such a measure.\n\nNearly 4.3 million more breakfasts and 4.5 million more lunches were served to students last fall compared with the same period in 2022, Walz said in March.\n\n\"The data is clear: more students are eating breakfast and lunch at school, ensuring they have the food they need to succeed and helping families save money on their grocery bills,\" Walz said in a statement. \"This investment is a win for our kids, our families, and the long-term success of our state.\"\n\nThe measure is expected to cost the state about $400 million over two years.\n\nGender-affirming care\n\nIn March 2023, Walz signed an executive order that directed Minnesota agencies to do whatever they could to protect and support Minnesotans seeking gender-affirming health care services.\n\nGender-affirming care is evidence-based care for people who identify as transgender or nonbinary. It's been deemed medically necessary and has the backing of nearly every major medical association and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. More than half of states now have laws that restrict such care.\n\nWalz's executive order directed state agencies to study the effectiveness of the care and investigate any health organization that denied it. The order also prohibited Minnesota from cooperating in any investigation by a state that aimed to penalize such care, calling such actions \"a grave threat\" to the health of members of the LGBTQ+ community.\n\n\"We want every Minnesotan to grow up feeling safe, valued, protected, celebrated and free to exist as their authentic versions of themselves,\" Walz said after signing the order.\n\nThe next month, he signed \"trans refuge\" legislation that safeguarded access to such care and another law that banned conversion therapy, a discredited practice that aims to change someone's understanding of their gender identity or sexual orientation.\n\nPaid family and medical leave\n\nSaying paid family and medical leave is important for the health of the state's workforce and future of its economy, Walz signed a bill establishing the program last year. It launches in 2026.\n\n\"Paid family and medical leave is about investing in the people that made our state and economy strong in the first place,\" Walz said in a statement. \"By signing paid family and medical leave into law, we're ensuring Minnesotans no longer have to make the choice between a paycheck and taking time off to care for a new baby or a sick family member.\"\n\nIndividuals will be able to take up to 12 weeks each of medical and family leave, for a combined maximum of 20 weeks in a 12-month period. How much workers will receive during their leave will depend on their pay.\n\nBenefits are paid by the state but are funded through payroll deductions on wages.\n\nMinnesota will be the 13th state to enact such a program.\n\nAffordable housing investments\n\nWalz was praised by housing and homeless advocates for signing a bill last year that provides the largest state investment in housing to date.\n\nMore than half of the $1 billion spending package is being used to expand the supply of affordable housing, according to the National Low Income Housing Coalition. The state funds will also provide $150 million in downpayment assistance for first-time homebuyers, which will enable approximately 5,000 Minnesotans to purchase homes, as well as $45 million for a homeless prevention program.\n\n\"Whether it's building new housing infrastructure, providing rental assistance, or ensuring homeownership is an option for all Minnesotans, this bill will have a historic impact on the quality of life in Minnesota and move us towards becoming the best state to raise a family,\" Walz said in a statement released in 2023 after signing the bill.\n\nThe bill also raised the sales tax in the seven-county Twin Cities metropolitan area by 0.25% to create a permanent funding stream for Minnesota housing programs.\n\nClean energy policy\n\nWalz oversaw a cutting-edge clean energy policy as governor of Minnesota. As part of a Democratic trifecta in the state House, Senate and governor's office, Walz signed a law last year that aims to make 100% of Minnesota's electricity clean by 2040.\n\nThe law compels utilities that provide electricity in Minnesota to switch from polluting sources of electricity like coal and natural gas to clean sources, including wind, solar, battery storage, hydropower and clean hydrogen.\n\nUnder the law, utilities need to switch to generating 100% carbon-free electricity by 2040 and get 80% of the way there by 2030.

Josh Shapiro (D) told a rally in his hometown of Philadelphia on Tuesday that President Trump had taken away women's freedom to choose an abortion. It was a claim made during a starkly partisan speech, in which Shapiro called Sen. JD Vance (R-OH), Trump's running mate, a \"weirdo.\" Shapiro was warming up the crowd ahead of the introduction of Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz (D) as Vice President Kamala Harris's running mate.\n\nPerhaps Shapiro was particularly emotional, given that he himself had been the favorite to join the ticket, until left-wing, anti-Israel -- and possibly antisemitic -- voices within the party objected to his selection.\n\nRegardless, he was wrong.\n\nTrump did not directly change anything on abortion. He appointed conservative justices to the Supreme Court who he thought were likely to overturn Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision that made up the right to abortion from whole cloth.\n\nIn 2022, the Court threw out Roe v. Wade in the Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization. But it specifically did not say that women did not have the freedom to choose abortion. It simply left the issue to the states to decide.\n\nShapiro knows that. Or he should, because Walz -- the man he was introducing -- signed a law in 2023 removing all restrictions on abortion in Minnesota (and defunding pregnancy counseling centers). It was the first such law passed in the wake of Dobbs, and there is nothing at all to stop Minnesota from having abortions until the moment of birth.\n\nIt is true that Trump has taken credit for overturning Roe v. Wade. He is proud to have allowed pro-life laws to be passed in states that support them. But he has specifically refused to endorse the idea of national abortion legislation.\n\nTrump did not take away anyone's freedom.

Tim Walz pushed to turn Minnesota into an abortion \"safe haven\" just one day after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris, who has been at the forefront of the Biden administration's pro-abortion policies, selected Walz on Tuesday to be her running mate for the 2024 presidential election. The Minnesota governor issued an executive order on June 25, 2022, that said individuals entering Minnesota from states that restrict abortion would not be extradited for receiving the procedure.\n\n\"Reproductive freedom is a right under Minnesota law...that right no longer exists in many states, including many of our neighboring states,\" Walz wrote in the order, bemoaning the restrictions states would soon apply. \"The impending loss of freedom to people around the nation poses an imminent threat to the health and safety of people in Minnesota to the extent that other states may seek to infringe on essential liberties protected by the Minnesota Constitution.\"\n\nThe June 2022 emergency order banned state agencies from assisting \"any investigation or proceeding that seeks to impose civil or criminal liability or professional sanctions upon a person or entity\" for receiving an abortion in the state. (RELATED: Minnesota's Impending Hellscape Is A 'Blueprint' For The Left's National Dreams)\n\n\"I will exercise my discretion to decline requests for the arrest or surrender of any person charged with a criminal violation of a law of another state where the violation alleged involves the provision of, assistance with, securing of, or receipt of reproductive health care services, unless the acts forming the basis of the prosecution of the crime charged would also constitute a criminal offense under Minnesota law,\" the order reads.\n\nIn 2022, there were 12,175 total abortions in Minnesota, with 226 occurring after 21 weeks of pregnancy.\n\nAbortions performed in Minnesota in 2022 increased by 20% from 2021, with 17% coming from out-of-state women, a seven point increase compared to the previous year, according to state's health department. The number of North Dakota residents receiving abortions in Minnesota went up from 84 to 383, Iowa residents from 56 to 174, and Texas residents from 18 to 150, all states that severely restricted the procedure that year.\n\nIn 2023, Walz signed a law enshrining a right to abortion into Minnesota's constitution with no restrictions, making it nearly irreversible. That same year he signed a bill reversing a requirement that physicians provide care for infants that are born alive after a failed abortion attempt.\n\nAs vice president, Harris has been open about her pro-abortion agenda, earning endorsements from several pro-abortion groups and even campaigning at a Minnesota abortion clinic in early 2024. Harris previously voted against bills that would have protected babies that can feel pain and born-alive babies.\n\n\"Kamala Harris' selection of Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate, reaffirms Harris' extreme views on the issue of life,\" Jeanne Mancini, president of March for Life Action, said in a statement. \"Harris and Walz share a longstanding history of hostility towards pregnant women in need and their unborn children.\"\n\nWalz's office and the Harris campaign did not immediately respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation's request for comment.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Wade in 2022, and nothing in this year's election will change it.\n\nWomen can still end their pregnancies in the state up to 24 weeks gestation, just as they could before 2022. And abortions can be performed after that cutoff if a woman's life or health is in danger.\n\nWith Gov. Josh Shapiro (D-PA) in power, who supports access to abortions, the procedure's legality will remain for at least the next three years. That is not a guess. It is what Shapiro has said and posted on social media repeatedly.\n\n\"Abortion is legal for Pennsylvanians and all women who travel here ... as your Governor, I'll always fight like hell to keep it that way,\" Shapiro posted on X last week.\n\nThe only way abortion could be made illegal in Pennsylvania is if two legislative votes are taken in succession to reverse that \"right\" and the governor signed the change into law. But with a Democratic governor and the state House majority held by Democrats as well, and with the state House gerrymandered just last cycle to make sure it stays majority-Democrat for the foreseeable future, the change just isn't going to happen.\n\nSo why have Democrats such as Shapiro campaigned as though the right to have an abortion is at risk in Pennsylvania?\n\nSen. Bob Casey (D-PA) headlined a reproductive rights panel at Crossing Vineyards and Winery here in Wrightstown, Pennsylvania, last week, warning that \"women's reproductive freedom is on the ballot in November.\"\n\nAt a fundraiser in April, Shapiro said, \"Donald Trump is coming to our Commonwealth to continue pushing his extreme agenda to control women's bodies and take away Pennsylvanians' freedoms.\"\n\nThat would make for spectacular politics if it were true. But it's not. Shapiro knows former President Donald Trump is not taking away the right to an abortion in Pennsylvania. Indeed, not only can he not do so in Pennsylvania, or Ohio and Michigan for that matter, but the former president has said firmly he has no intention of doing so.\n\nTrump said in April he would not support a national ban on abortion. He also said state abortion laws are up to individual states, offering up two very clear stances that differ wildly from the message pushed by just about every Democrat running in Pennsylvania that the \"right-wing MAGA extremists are going to take your abortion rights away.\"\n\nThe truth is actually the opposite: The only abortion-access changes seeing any daylight in the state are ones that would expand access, not restrict it. When Shapiro entered office, he extended an executive order signed by former Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf that offered access to services for out-of-state women whose own states have abortion restrictions.\n\nDespite all this, Vice President Kamala Harris spoke in Montgomery County's Elkins Park, Pennsylvania, in May to persuade white suburban women to believe their reproductive rights were at risk.\n\n\"Another Trump presidency could lead to more restrictions or even a nationwide ban,\" Harris said.\n\nHarris has made reproductive rights a focus of her campaign, and the vice president said at the time she was \"optimistic about young voters and believe they will vote for more reproductive healthcare access.\"\n\nChris Borick, a political science professor at Muhlenberg College, said the reason Democrats continue to run on a matter that isn't a concern at all is simple.\n\n\"Democrats want voters to see a direct and imminent threat of Republicans winning and changing policy to make it more restrictive,\" he said.\n\nBorick said Democrats hope voters concentrate on that, but he said that does not translate into real immediate threats in terms of policy.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\n\"The truth is, simply, insert any Republican candidate here, cannot take away abortion rights in Pennsylvania,\" he said.\n\n\"As it stands in Pennsylvania, the status quo is right now that those protections exist, and to undo it would take significant action on the part of the state,\" Borick added.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Examiner"}, "authors": [{"uri": "salena_zito@washingtonexaminer.com", "name": "Salena Zito", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Shapiro", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Josh Shapiro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproductive_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Reproductive rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobbs_v._Jackson_Women's_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dobbs v.

{"uri": "8263597429", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2024-08-07", "time": "13:10:38", "dateTime": "2024-08-07T13:10:38Z", "dateTimePub": "2024-08-07T13:09:53Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.545098066329956, "url": "https://www.kgou.org/health/2024-08-07/inside-a-medical-practice-sending-abortion-pills-to-states-where-theyre-banned", "title": "Inside a medical practice sending abortion pills to states where they're banned", "body": "The packages, no bigger than a hardcover book, line the walls of the nondescript office near Boston. It's not an Etsy retailer or a Poshmark seller or, as the nearby post office workers believe, a thriving jewelry business.\n\nThese boxes contain abortion pills.\n\n\"Welcome to modern abortion care,\" says Angel Foster, as she holds up a box for mailing. Foster, who has an M.D. degree, leads operations at what's known as the MAP, a Massachusetts telehealth provider sending pills to people who live in states that ban or restrict abortion.\n\nThe MAP is one of just four organizations in the U.S. operating under recently enacted state shield laws, which circumvent traditional telemedicine laws requiring out-of-state health providers to be licensed in the states where patients are located. Eight states have enacted these shield laws.\n\nPregnant patients can fill out an online form, connect with a doctor via email or text and, if approved, receive the pills within a week, no matter which state they live in.\n\nShield law practices account for about 10% of abortions nationwide. There were 9,200 abortions a month provided under shield laws from January to March of this year, according to fresh data from the Society of Family Planning's WeCount project. And some researchers estimate that this number has risen since then and could be as high as 12,000 per month.\n\nThe rise of telehealth is part of why the number of abortions in the U.S. has continued to go up since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022 -- even though 14 states have near-total abortion bans. In those states, shield law providers represent the only legal way people can access abortions within the established health care system.\n\nBack in Massachusetts, Foster glances down at the list of today's patients. The practice's four OB-GYNs have signed off on prescriptions for nearly two dozen women -- in Texas, Florida, Tennessee, Georgia, Alabama, Oklahoma and South Carolina. Most of today's patients are around six weeks along in their pregnancy. Many already have children.\n\n\"I really need an abortion pill. My state has banned it. My funds are really low,\" one patient wrote on the online form she filled out for the doctor.\n\n\"I'm a single mom with a kid under two,\" another wrote. \"I can't afford a baby. I can't even afford this abortion.\"\n\nFoster and her team serve patients who are up to 10 weeks pregnant and who are 16 or older. It costs $250 to get the two-drug regimen -- mifepristone and misoprostol -- in the mail, but there's a sliding scale and patients can pay as little as $5. The MAP is funded through abortion funds, individual donations and philanthropic gifts, and Foster has plans to apply for grants and state funding to help make the organization more sustainable. The MAP currently sends out about 500 prescriptions a month.\n\nIn the eight states with shield laws, abortion providers can treat out-of-state patients just as if they were in-state patients. The laws give abortion providers some protection from criminal prosecution, civil claims and extradition, among other threats. The laws have yet to be tested in court, but they certainly haven't gone unnoticed by lawmakers and groups looking to limit abortion.\n\n\"These websites are breaking the law ... aiding and abetting crimes in Texas,\" says John Seago, the president of Texas Right to Life. \"We want to use all the instruments that we have, all the tools available, to really fight against this new trend of abortion pills by mail.\"\n\nSeago says providers should still be held responsible for committing a crime that is executed across state lines. \"Mailing the abortion pill is a state jail felony according to our pro-life laws,\" he says, \"but enforcement of those policies has been a real, real challenge.\"\n\nHis organization has been looking for the right individual or circumstance to challenge shield laws directly in court. Three Republican-led states recently tried to sue the Food and Drug Administration over regulations allowing doctors to send pills through the mail, but the Supreme Court threw out the case in June over issues of standing. Those plaintiffs say they'll fight on. And a Republican attorney general in Arkansas sent a cease-and-desist letter to a shield law provider.\n\nSeago thinks many conservative prosecutors have been hesitant to take legal action, especially in an election year. But he says it's important to act quickly, before abortion by mail becomes pervasive.\n\nThe people who are sending these pills know that there's risk in what they're doing. Some providers say they won't travel to or through states with bans so that they can't be subpoenaed, be served legal papers or even be arrested if there's a warrant. That may mean avoiding layovers at Dallas Love Field airport or a detour around those places on a cross-country road trip. For Foster, it means she can't visit her mom and stepdad, who retired to South Carolina.\n\n\"The thing about shield laws is that they're new, so we don't have a precedent to go off of,\" says Lauren Jacobson, a nurse practitioner who prescribes abortion medication through Aid Access, the largest of the four shield law providers. She says she avoids large swaths of the United States. \"We don't really know what will or won't happen. But I'm not going to Texas. I've been before though, so that's OK for me.\"\n\nShield laws don't offer blanket protection. The doctors and nurse practitioners who prescribe the pills have malpractice insurance in their states, but it's unclear whether those policies would cover suits from states with abortion restrictions. Patients use third-party payment services like Cash App or PayPal, which are also untested in how they would work under a shield law. Would they give up information on a provider or patient if requested to do so by law enforcement?\n\nLauren, who is 33 and lives in Utah, got pregnant while on birth control and decided that she couldn't afford another child. (NPR is not using her last name because she's worried about professional repercussions.)\n\nAbortion is legal in Utah until 18 weeks, but there are only a handful of clinics in the state. The closest one to Lauren was several hours away by car. Several years prior, she had an abortion at a clinic in Salt Lake City, and it hadn't been a pleasant experience -- she had to walk through protesters. The guilt from her conservative Christian upbringing was overwhelming.\n\n\"I got in my car and I cried,\" she recalls. \"I just never wanted to go through it again.\"\n\nThis time, Lauren got pills from Aid Access, a shield law provider similar to the MAP. \"I was a little bit sketched out, I won't lie,\" she says. \"Because like, well, where is this coming from? Who is this under? How are they prescribing this?\"\n\nShe and her partner did research to try to figure out whether what they were doing was legal. She says ultimately she couldn't find anything that clearly stated that what she wanted to do -- have pills sent from an out-of-state doctor -- was illegal.\n\nShe filled out a form online with questions about how far along she was and her medical history and then connected with a doctor via email and text messages. She googled the doctor, who she found was legit and practicing out of New York.\n\nA few days later, she received abortion medication in the mail and had her abortion at home.\n\n\"To do it in the privacy of your own home, where I felt more support as opposed to going through protesters,\" Lauren says. \"Especially with a provider within the state of Utah. I feel like there's always a judgmental indication or undertone.\"\n\nThe online doctor also followed up to make sure everything had gone OK, which Lauren appreciated. \"I felt it was a little bit more thorough,\" she says. \"They're checking in on you, like, 'How did you respond? What symptoms? What's going on?'\"\n\nIn Massachusetts, the folks who run the MAP hear much the same from their patients. Many emails and messages are logistical, like this email: \"I took the first pill on Friday and all the other pills on Saturday. For how long should I be bleeding as I'm still bleeding this morning?\"\n\nMany others offer disbelief, relief and gratitude. \"I just wanted to say thank you so much,\" wrote one woman. \"I was terrified of this process. It goes against everything I believe in. I'm just not in a place where I can have a child. Thank you for making the pills easily accessible to me.\"\n\nWhen Foster, who runs operations for the MAP, does a final tally of the patients who are ready to have their pills sent out, she notices a new note from a woman who just paid, bringing the day's total number of patients from 20 to 21.\n\n\"I am a single mother on a fixed income, and I can not afford a kid right now.\"\n\nIt's from a woman in Alabama who is six weeks pregnant and filled out her form around lunchtime. Within an hour, a MAP doctor had reviewed her case and prescribed her the medication. She paid the fee as soon as she was approved. All in all, the whole process took about three hours. Foster is able to pack up those pills and add them to the batch headed to the post office.\n\nBy 3 p.m., the Alabama woman's package is scanned by the Postal Service worker.", "source": {"uri": "kgou.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "KGOU 106.3"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shield_laws_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shield laws in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Medical abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telehealth", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Telehealth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobbs_v._Jackson_Women's_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dobbs v.

Elissa Nadworny/NPR hide caption\n\nThe packages, no bigger than a hardcover book, line the walls of the nondescript office near Boston. It's not an Etsy retailer or a Poshmark seller or, as the nearby post office workers believe, a thriving jewelry business.\n\nThese boxes contain abortion pills.\n\n\"Welcome to modern abortion care,\" says Angel Foster, as she holds up a box for mailing. Foster, who has an M.D. degree, leads operations at what's known as the MAP, a Massachusetts telehealth provider sending pills to people who live in states that ban or restrict abortion.\n\nThe MAP is one of just four organizations in the U.S. operating under recently enacted state shield laws, which circumvent traditional telemedicine laws requiring out-of-state health providers to be licensed in the states where patients are located. Eight states have enacted these shield laws.\n\nPregnant patients can fill out an online form, connect with a doctor via email or text and, if approved, receive the pills within a week, no matter which state they live in.\n\nShield law practices account for about 10% of abortions nationwide. There were 9,200 abortions a month provided under shield laws from January to March of this year, according to fresh data from the Society of Family Planning's WeCount project. And some researchers estimate that this number has risen since then and could be as high as 12,000 per month.\n\nThe rise of telehealth is part of why the number of abortions in the U.S. has continued to go up since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022 -- even though 14 states have near-total abortion bans. In those states, shield law providers represent the only legal way people can access abortions within the established health care system.\n\nBack in Massachusetts, Foster glances down at the list of today's patients. The practice's four OB-GYNs have signed off on prescriptions for nearly two dozen women -- in Texas, Florida, Tennessee, Georgia, Alabama, Oklahoma and South Carolina. Most of today's patients are around six weeks along in their pregnancy. Many already have children.\n\n\"I really need an abortion pill. My state has banned it. My funds are really low,\" one patient wrote on the online form she filled out for the doctor.\n\n\"I'm a single mom with a kid under two,\" another wrote. \"I can't afford a baby. I can't even afford this abortion.\"\n\nFoster and her team serve patients who are up to 10 weeks pregnant and who are 16 or older. It costs $250 to get the two-drug regimen -- mifepristone and misoprostol -- in the mail, but there's a sliding scale and patients can pay as little as $5. The MAP is funded through abortion funds, individual donations and philanthropic gifts, and Foster has plans to apply for grants and state funding to help make the organization more sustainable. The MAP currently sends out about 500 prescriptions a month.\n\nIn the eight states with shield laws, abortion providers can treat out-of-state patients just as if they were in-state patients. The laws give abortion providers some protection from criminal prosecution, civil claims and extradition, among other threats. The laws have yet to be tested in court, but they certainly haven't gone unnoticed by lawmakers and groups looking to limit abortion.\n\n\"These websites are breaking the law ... aiding and abetting crimes in Texas,\" says John Seago, the president of Texas Right to Life. \"We want to use all the instruments that we have, all the tools available, to really fight against this new trend of abortion pills by mail.\"\n\nSeago says providers should still be held responsible for committing a crime that is executed across state lines. \"Mailing the abortion pill is a state jail felony according to our pro-life laws,\" he says, \"but enforcement of those policies has been a real, real challenge.\"\n\nHis organization has been looking for the right individual or circumstance to challenge shield laws directly in court. Three Republican-led states recently tried to sue the Food and Drug Administration over regulations allowing doctors to send pills through the mail, but the Supreme Court threw out the case in June over issues of standing. Those plaintiffs say they'll fight on. And a Republican attorney general in Arkansas sent a cease-and-desist letter to a shield law provider.\n\nSeago thinks many conservative prosecutors have been hesitant to take legal action, especially in an election year. But he says it's important to act quickly, before abortion by mail becomes pervasive.\n\nThe people who are sending these pills know that there's risk in what they're doing. Some providers say they won't travel to or through states with bans so that they can't be subpoenaed, be served legal papers or even be arrested if there's a warrant. That may mean avoiding layovers at Dallas Love Field airport or a detour around those places on a cross-country road trip. For Foster, it means she can't visit her mom and stepdad, who retired to South Carolina.\n\n\"The thing about shield laws is that they're new, so we don't have a precedent to go off of,\" says Lauren Jacobson, a nurse practitioner who prescribes abortion medication through Aid Access, the largest of the four shield law providers. She says she avoids large swaths of the United States. \"We don't really know what will or won't happen. But I'm not going to Texas. I've been before though, so that's OK for me.\"\n\nShield laws don't offer blanket protection. The doctors and nurse practitioners who prescribe the pills have malpractice insurance in their states, but it's unclear whether those policies would cover suits from states with abortion restrictions. Patients use third-party payment services like Cash App or PayPal, which are also untested in how they would work under a shield law. Would they give up information on a provider or patient if requested to do so by law enforcement?\n\nLauren, who is 33 and lives in Utah, got pregnant while on birth control and decided that she couldn't afford another child. (NPR is not using her last name because she's worried about professional repercussions.)\n\nAbortion is legal in Utah until 18 weeks, but there are only a handful of clinics in the state. The closest one to Lauren was several hours away by car. Several years prior, she had an abortion at a clinic in Salt Lake City, and it hadn't been a pleasant experience -- she had to walk through protesters. The guilt from her conservative Christian upbringing was overwhelming.\n\n\"I got in my car and I cried,\" she recalls. \"I just never wanted to go through it again.\"\n\nThis time, Lauren got pills from Aid Access, a shield law provider similar to the MAP. \"I was a little bit sketched out, I won't lie,\" she says. \"Because like, well, where is this coming from? Who is this under? How are they prescribing this?\"\n\nShe and her partner did research to try to figure out whether what they were doing was legal. She says ultimately she couldn't find anything that clearly stated that what she wanted to do -- have pills sent from an out-of-state doctor -- was illegal.\n\nShe filled out a form online with questions about how far along she was and her medical history and then connected with a doctor via email and text messages. She googled the doctor, who she found was legit and practicing out of New York.\n\nA few days later, she received abortion medication in the mail and had her abortion at home.\n\n\"To do it in the privacy of your own home, where I felt more support as opposed to going through protesters,\" Lauren says. \"Especially with a provider within the state of Utah. I feel like there's always a judgmental indication or undertone.\"\n\nThe online doctor also followed up to make sure everything had gone OK, which Lauren appreciated. \"I felt it was a little bit more thorough,\" she says. \"They're checking in on you, like, 'How did you respond? What symptoms? What's going on?'\"\n\nIn Massachusetts, the folks who run the MAP hear much the same from their patients. Many emails and messages are logistical, like this email: \"I took the first pill on Friday and all the other pills on Saturday. For how long should I be bleeding as I'm still bleeding this morning?\"\n\nMany others offer disbelief, relief and gratitude. \"I just wanted to say thank you so much,\" wrote one woman. \"I was terrified of this process. It goes against everything I believe in. I'm just not in a place where I can have a child. Thank you for making the pills easily accessible to me.\"\n\nWhen Foster, who runs operations for the MAP, does a final tally of the patients who are ready to have their pills sent out, she notices a new note from a woman who just paid, bringing the day's total number of patients from 20 to 21.\n\n\"I am a single mother on a fixed income, and I can not afford a kid right now.\"\n\nIt's from a woman in Alabama who is six weeks pregnant and filled out her form around lunchtime. Within an hour, a MAP doctor had reviewed her case and prescribed her the medication. She paid the fee as soon as she was approved. All in all, the whole process took about three hours. Foster is able to pack up those pills and add them to the batch headed to the post office.\n\nBy 3 p.m., the Alabama woman's package is scanned by the Postal Service worker.", "source": {"uri": "npr.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "NPR"}, "authors": [{"uri": "elissa_nadworny@npr.org", "name": "Elissa Nadworny", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shield_laws_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shield laws in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Medical abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telehealth", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Telehealth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobbs_v._Jackson_Women's_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dobbs v.

A mother of one child, she found out she was pregnant in July 2022. She was overjoyed to grow her family, until things took a turn for the worse.\n\nJust days later, Callahan felt a sensation like her water breaking. She felt sick and spoke with health care providers at her next appointment, and while they believed she was miscarrying, tests showed she was still pregnant. Unsure of what to do, doctors sent her home to recuperate.\n\nThe next month was excruciating, Callahan said. She vomited so often that she depleted the electrolytes in her body, causing heart palpitations.\n\n\"I feared I would die, and my family feared the same,\" Callahan said.\n\nAfter multiple visits to doctors' offices and hospitals, Callahan finally discovered that she was pregnant with twins. While one fetus was viable, the other was not. Doctors offered her a shot containing medication to help end the nonviable pregnancy.\n\n\"I had a child back home I wanted to live for. I had to survive for her,\" said Callahan.\n\nCallahan, who helped found Middle Georgia 4 Choice, shared her story alongside other Middle Georgia abortion rights advocates on a panel Friday. She credits the shot with saving her life, but because the shot could've endangered her viable pregnancy, she fears that the overturning of Roe v. Wade in 2022 may mean women in the same situation won't have access to the same care she did.\n\nThe panelists are not alone. Abortion has become a key issue for Georgians ahead of the 2024 presidential election, and has been a major point of contention for years.\n\nGeorgia had already seen conflict around abortion prior to the Supreme Court's 2022 decision to end federal abortion rights protections.\n\nIn 2019, Georgia enacted a law that banned most abortions at six weeks, which is when fetal cardiac activity can be detected. The law was overturned by a federal judge, citing Roe v. Wade, the decision that protected abortion rights.\n\nIn 2023, about a year after the ruling was overturned, the Georgia Supreme Court reinstated the legislation banning most abortions at six weeks.\n\nFollowing the Supreme Court's 2022 decision, Callahan partnered with other Middle Georgia residents, including Mia Robbins-Aguilar, to organize a protest against the decision. The women eventually founded a permanent group, Middle Georgia 4 Choice, to advance abortion rights at the local, state and federal levels.\n\nFriday's panelists represented a diverse slate of women, each with their own reasons for being there. Robbins-Aguilar said her reasons for speaking on the panel were the same as when she founded the group: she wants young women and girls to have the same rights she had as a young person.\n\n\"I am afraid for my nieces and every young girl that I come into contact with,\" Robbins-Aguilar said. \"They should all have the same rights that I had. They should all have access to care and medical treatment.\"\n\nOthers expressed concern for their community. Tina Taft Hobson, who grew up in a rural community in southwest Georgia, said she watched many of her peers become pregnant as teenagers due to a lack of comprehensive sex education and abortion access. Previous reporting by The Telegraph documented similar issues in Middle Georgia.\n\n\"If you don't know what you're doing, you're going to end up getting pregnant,\" Taft Hobson said. \"I think that's a one-to-one connection.\"\n\nWomen who have children as teenagers are significantly less likely to finish high school and attend college, according to the National Library of Medicine. They also on average earn lower incomes than their peers who do not become pregnant as teenagers.\n\nSupporters of Georgia's abortion law say that it would not endanger women's lives because it has exceptions for medical emergencies that present serious threats to a woman's life or health.\n\nWhile many panelists and attendees wore clothes and carried signs displaying abortion rights slogans, others also bought T-shirts and signs supporting Vice President Kamala Harris' presidential bid.\n\nSince the overturning of Roe, abortion has become a major electoral issue, motivating some female voters across America to head to the ballot box for abortion rights candidates and to stop amendments to state constitutions limiting abortion rights. Harris has promised to protect abortion rights if elected.\n\nThe panel was organized by Ride to Decide, an abortion rights advocacy group visiting a range of locations to host events with local activists. After Macon, they made a stop in Atlanta. Georgia is especially key to abortion rights advocates because it stands to be a major player in this year's presidential election, and abortion has already been a key issue in other races in the state.\n\nDrawing on her own experiences, Callahan emphasized her belief that electoral power is key to protecting abortion rights. She said she hopes to restore abortion rights in Georgia through the ballot box.\n\n\"Women in the same position are being denied life-saving care and being threatened with prosecutions,\" Callahan said.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion-rights_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abortion-rights movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pregnancy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fetus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miscarriage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miscarriage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2024 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobbs_v._Jackson_Women's_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dobbs v.

Tim Walz has succeeded.\n\nThe former schoolteacher turned politician whom Vice President Kamala Harris picked as her running mate in the 2024 presidential race has been able to enact many of the progressive policies President Joe Biden and Harris pitched but failed to get through Congress.\n\nAided by a Democratic sweep of the state legislature, Walz last year signed a landmark budget that established a generous child tax credit, created a paid family and medical leave program and made college tuition free for certain students, among other measures.\n\n\"We're pretty sure it's going to mean a fairer, more inclusive, better and more prosperous Minnesota,\" he said upon signing the budget.\n\nThe One Minnesota Budget built upon the left-leaning policies that Walz established in the state, including protecting abortion rights and gender-affirming care, investing in affordable housing and instituting clean energy measures.\n\nRepublicans, however, have critiqued Walz's efforts, which entail an increase in state spending, as unsustainable and as increasing the burden on families and businesses.\n\nAlso, Minnesota was one of the few states to raise taxes in recent years, even though it had large surpluses, the Tax Foundation said. The increases mainly affected businesses and high-earning residents.\n\nHere are some of the progressive measures Walz has enacted as governor:\n\nMany lower-income Minnesota families can access a state child tax credit, which Walz signed into law last year. The credit, which provides up to $1,750 per kid with no limit on the number of children claimed, is the most generous in the US and is projected to lower child poverty by a third. It is also refundable so families can receive a refund even if they don't owe any tax, though they do need to file a tax return to claim the credit.\n\nThe full credit is available to single parents earning $29,500 and couples earning $35,000, and slowly phases out depending on income, filing status and number of children.\n\nMore than 215,000 families, with more than 437,000 children, have claimed the credit so far for 2023, Walz said in a statement last week. The average credit was $1,244 per child - totaling more than $545 million.\n\nLast year, Walz signed a bill into law that made college tuition free for students from Minnesota families who earn less than $80,000 a year.\n\nBetween 15,000 and 20,000 students are expected to benefit during the upcoming school year, the first year the program is in effect.\n\nKnown as the North Star Promise Scholarship, the program covers the balance of tuition and fees remaining for students after applying other scholarships, grants and stipends that don't have to be paid back. The idea is that students won't have to borrow student loans to pay for tuition and mandatory fees to attend college.\n\nStudents who are eligible for a Pell grant, a federal financial aid award for low-income students, may receive additional funds from the state program.\n\nStudents must be enrolled at a public two- or four-year college in Minnesota to be eligible for the North Star Promise Scholarship. They are required to be Minnesota residents, but undocumented students who meet certain conditions are also eligible, like they are for other state financial aid awards.\n\nMinnesota is now one of more than 30 states that offer some kind of free tuition program.\n\nWalz has been an advocate for abortion access. In January 2023, he signed into law the Protect Reproductive Options Act, which established the right for people in the state to obtain an abortion after the US Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade the previous year.\n\nIn April 2023, he signed a law protecting people who travel to Minnesota for abortions, and clinicians providing abortion care, from criminal penalties from other states.\n\nMinnesota's policies around abortion make it among the most protective states for abortion access, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research and policy organization that supports abortion rights, with more people expected to travel to the state for care after Iowa implemented a six-week ban in July.\n\nWhen Harris became the first vice president believed to have visited an abortion clinic while in office, she chose a Planned Parenthood location in Minnesota.\n\nStudents can receive free breakfast and lunch in participating schools after Walz signed a universal school meals bill into law last year, making it the fourth state to enact such a measure.\n\nNearly 4.3 million more breakfasts and 4.5 million more lunches were served to students last fall compared with the same period in 2022, Walz said in March.\n\n\"The data is clear: more students are eating breakfast and lunch at school, ensuring they have the food they need to succeed and helping families save money on their grocery bills,\" Walz said in a statement. \"This investment is a win for our kids, our families, and the long-term success of our state.\"\n\nThe measure is expected to cost the state about $400 million over two years.\n\nIn March 2023, Walz signed an executive order that directed Minnesota agencies to do whatever they could to protect and support Minnesotans seeking gender-affirming health care services.\n\nGender-affirming care is evidence-based care for people who identify as transgender or nonbinary. It's been deemed medically necessary and has the backing of nearly every major medical association and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. More than half of states now have laws that restrict such care.\n\nWalz's executive order directed state agencies to study the effectiveness of the care and investigate any health organization that denied it. The order also prohibited Minnesota from cooperating in any investigation by a state that aimed to penalize such care, calling such actions \"a grave threat\" to the health of members of the LGBTQ+ community.\n\n\"We want every Minnesotan to grow up feeling safe, valued, protected, celebrated and free to exist as their authentic versions of themselves,\" Walz said after signing the order.\n\nSaying paid family and medical leave is important for the health of the state's workforce and future of its economy, Walz signed a bill establishing the program last year. It launches in 2026.\n\n\"Paid family and medical leave is about investing in the people that made our state and economy strong in the first place,\" Walz said in a statement. \"By signing paid family and medical leave into law, we're ensuring Minnesotans no longer have to make the choice between a paycheck and taking time off to care for a new baby or a sick family member.\"\n\nIndividuals will be able to take up to 12 weeks each of medical and family leave, for a combined maximum of 20 weeks in a 12-month period. How much workers will receive during their leave will depend on their pay.\n\nBenefits are paid by the state but are funded through payroll deductions on wages.\n\nWalz was praised by housing and homeless advocates for signing a bill last year that provides the largest state investment in housing to date.\n\nMore than half of the $1 billion spending package is being used to expand the supply of affordable housing, according to the National Low Income Housing Coalition. The state funds will also provide $150 million in downpayment assistance for first-time homebuyers, which will enable approximately 5,000 Minnesotans to purchase homes, as well as $45 million for a homeless prevention program.\n\n\"Whether it's building new housing infrastructure, providing rental assistance, or ensuring homeownership is an option for all Minnesotans, this bill will have a historic impact on the quality of life in Minnesota and move us towards becoming the best state to raise a family,\" Walz said in a statement released in 2023 after signing the bill.\n\nThe bill also raised the sales tax in the seven-county Twin Cities metropolitan area by 0.25% to create a permanent funding stream for Minnesota housing programs.\n\nWalz oversaw a cutting-edge clean energy policy as governor of Minnesota. As part of a Democratic trifecta in the state House, Senate and governor's office, Walz signed a law last year that aims to make 100% of Minnesota's electricity clean by 2040.\n\nThe law compels utilities that provide electricity in Minnesota to switch from polluting sources of electricity like coal and natural gas to clean sources, including wind, solar, battery storage, hydropower and clean hydrogen.\n\nUnder the law, utilities need to switch to generating 100% carbon-free electricity by 2040 and get 80% of the way there by 2030. Minnesota's largest utilities have voiced support for having to move quickly to zero-carbon energy but have also acknowledged the switch will be challenging.\n\nAnd earlier this summer, Walz signed a separate bill to speed up energy permitting projects in Minnesota and get more clean energy onto the grid. Passing a similar bill at the federal level has been elusive in Congress.\n\nLast year, Walz signed a bill into law that restored voting rights to more than 55,000 formerly incarcerated people in Minnesota.\n\nMinnesota is now one of 23 states that automatically restores voting rights following incarceration of those who have been convicted of a felony, according to the Voting Rights Lab.\n\nThe passage of the bill followed several years of legal challenges to the constitutionality of the state's former law, which prohibited people who were on felony supervision or probation from voting even if their prison term has been completed or they have never spent a day in prison.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Tim Walz, Babies Born Alive in Botched Abortions Were Left to Die. Then He Removed Reporting Requirements", "body": "As Democrats and media outlets accuse former President Donald Trump of dramatizing the Democratic abortion agenda, data from the Minnesota Department of Health shows that at least eight babies who survived abortions in the state were left to die.\n\nUnder a 2015 Minnesota law, the state formerly was required to report whether abortions resulted in the live birth of a baby, what actions were taken to preserve the life of that baby, and whether the baby survived.\n\nThose reporting requirements exposed that between Jan. 1, 2021 and Dec. 31, 2021, physicians performed five abortions that resulted in a baby being born alive and then allowed to die.\n\nNo measures were taken to help the first baby, who reportedly had \"fetal anomalies\" that resulted \"in death shortly after delivery.\" Two of the babies were given \"comfort care measures\" as they died. No measures were taken to \"preserve life\" of the last two babies, who were previable.\n\nPrevious data from the Minnesota Department of Health reveals that doctors have been leaving babies to die after failed abortions for years. In 2020, no babies were reported born alive through botched abortions, according to the Minnesota Department of Health.\n\nBut between Jan. 1, 2019 and Dec. 31, 2019, three abortions resulted in born-alive babies who were then allowed to die. The first baby reportedly had \"fetal anomalies\" but also had \"residual cardiac activity\" for two minutes, yet no efforts were taken to preserve that baby's life, and \"the infant did not survive.\"\n\nThe second baby died while \"comfort care measures\" were provided. The third baby was previable and did not receive any attempts to preserve his or her life.\n\nIt does not appear that any of the babies born alive in botched abortions survived.\n\nDue to efforts by the state's Democratic governor, who served from 2019 until the present, Minnesota will no longer even keep track of born-alive babies.\n\nTim Walz, the new Democratic vice presidential nominee, repealed the bipartisan measure in May 2023, stripping the state's requirement that measure be taken to preserve the baby's \"life and health\" and merely replacing it with a nebulous requirement for \"care.\"\n\nDemocratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris has refused to specify any limitations on abortion or protections for unborn babies that she would support, indicating that her campaign does not, in fact, support any restrictions on abortion.\n\nWhen Trump has pointed out that some states leave babies to die after birth, stating, \"Hard to believe, they have some states passing legislation where you can execute the baby after birth,\" outlets like CNN rate such claims as \"false,\" writing: \"No state has passed or is passing a law that allows the execution of a baby after it is born.\"\n\nThe Harris campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n\"Post-birth abortion is real and Harris-Walz support it,\" tweeted The Heritage Foundation's Roger Severino. \"At least 5 babies were born alive after botched abortions and left to die under Walz's watch. Two of these struggling babies were given 'comfort care' instead of medical care allegedly in violation of state law.\"\n\n\"How did Walz respond?\" he continued. \"By repealing the very law exposing and outlawing this horror and replacing it with abortion-on-demand on the front end, and infanticide on the back end.\"\n\nIn January 2023, Walz signed a broad abortion law that included no limitations on how late during pregnancy a mother may end the life of her unborn baby.\n\n\"To Minnesotans, know that your access to reproductive health, and your right to make your own health care decisions, are preserved and protected,\" Walz said then of the Protect Reproductive Options Act. \"And because of this law, that won't change with the political winds and the makeup of the Supreme Court.\"\n\nThe legislation reads: \"Every individual has a fundamental right to make autonomous decisions about the individual's own reproductive health, including the fundamental right to use or refuse reproductive health care.\"", "source": {"uri": "dailysignal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Signal"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mary_margaret_olohan@dailysignal.com", "name": "Mary Margaret Olohan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Department_of_Health", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Department of Health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fetus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Physician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipartisanship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bipartisanship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infanticide", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Infanticide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Heritage_Foundation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Heritage Foundation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fundamental rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-abortion_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anti-abortion movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Abortion law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pregnancy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Abortion", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Abortion", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Divorce", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Divorce", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 59}], "image": "https://first-heritage-foundation.s3.amazonaws.com/live_files/2024/08/GettyImages-2165044765-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9794390", "eventUri": "eng-9794390", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2019-01-01", "dateEnd": "2019-12-31", "textStart": 1211, "textEnd": 1241}], "sentiment": -0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 133, "relevance": 1}

Wade - Pehal News", "body": "Termination was slightly more prevalent across the United States in the initial three months of this year than it was prior to the Supreme Court invalidated Roe v. Wade and authorized states to enforce prohibitions, a report issued on Wednesday revealed.\n\nA significant cause for the escalation is that certain Democratic-governed states instituted regulations to safeguard physicians who use telehealth to consult with patients in regions with abortion restrictions, according to the quarterly #WeCount report for the Society of Family Planning, which advocates for abortion access.\n\nThe information emerges before the November elections where proponents of abortion rights anticipate that the matter will motivate voters to participate. In various regions, voters will have an opportunity to endorse or reject abortion protections at the state level.\n\nConsequences from the Supreme Court's June 2022 ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization have reshaped the landscape of abortion practices throughout the nation. The #WeCount data, gathered monthly since April 2022, illustrates how providers and seekers of abortion have adjusted to evolving regulations.\n\nThe study discovered that the number of terminations dropped to nearly zero in states that prohibit abortion in every phase of pregnancy and decreased by approximately half in regions that ban it post-six weeks of pregnancy, prior to many women realizing their pregnancy. Fourteen states are enforcing prohibitions on abortion at all stages of pregnancy, with certain exceptions, and four others forbid it post approximately six weeks of pregnancy.\n\nFigures rose in regions where abortion remains legal until later stages of pregnancy -- notably in states like Illinois, Kansas, and New Mexico, which neighbor states with prohibitions.\n\nAbortion medications and telehealth are crucial. In March, healthcare professionals in states with statutes guarding medical practitioners employed telehealth to prescribe abortion medications to nearly 10,000 patients in states with prohibitions or constraints on abortion via telehealth -- representing about 1 in 10 terminations in the U.S.\n\nStatutes protecting medical practitioners who employ telehealth to prescribe abortion medications began to take effect in certain Democratic-governed states last year.\n\n\"It alleviates the burden on clinics,\" stated Ushma Upadhyay, a professor at the University of California, San Francisco School of Medicine who co-leads #WeCount. \"Thus, it generates more room for individuals visiting clinics.\"\n\nOpponents of abortion assert that the battle over the termination medication mifepristone is ongoing following a narrow Supreme Court decision that presently maintains access to it. However, there have not been legal disputes yet to protect statutes.\n\nThe most recent version of the survey encompasses the first three months of this year. January marked the first instance since the survey's inception that it recorded more than 100,000 terminations nationwide in a single month.\n\nBefore the protective statutes began to be enforced and #WeCount commenced counting them, individuals were still acquiring some medications in regions with prohibitions.\n\nUpadhyay mentioned that even before the collapse of Roe, the demand for termination exceeded availability. She also noted that despite the shifting trends, some women are opting to continue pregnancies they would have terminated if they had the opportunity.\n\nOne of the states where terminations rose was Florida. That altered in April, when a prohibition post-six weeks' gestation was enforced. The data has not yet reflected that modification.\n\nThe policy could undergo further changes via a November ballot initiative that would legalize termination until viability, typically estimated to be around 23 or 24 weeks into pregnancy. It would necessitate at least 60% approval to incorporate it into the state constitution.\n\nOne vote against it will come from Mia Adkins, a 20-year-old senior at Florida International University. She said the overturning of Roe and changes in Florida's law have brought more attention to termination and have reinforced her belief that there should be restrictions.\n\n\"Instead of advocating for more termination legal at later stages of pregnancy, we should be advocating for statutes that safeguard these expectant parents and students and provide them with the assistance they require,\" said Akins, a senior at Florida International University.\n\nFlorida is one of six states where measures related to termination are already on the ballot. Verdicts from election officials regarding incorporating similar inquiries are pending in four additional states. In Nebraska, there are conflicting amendments: One to permit access until viability and one to maintain the current policy, which prohibits most terminations post-12 weeks of pregnancy.\n\nAdvocates for abortion rights have emerged victorious in all seven termination referendum questions in the U.S. since 2022. This aligns with public opinion polls indicating growing support for termination rights, including a recent Associated Press-NORC survey that discovered 6 in 10 Americans believe their state should allow individuals to undergo a legal termination if they do not wish to be pregnant for any reason.\n\nAn amendment to safeguard access could appear on the ballot in Arizona, a battleground state where legal cases have influenced termination policies -- and access -- since the Dobbs ruling.\n\nThe state Supreme Court ruled in April that Arizona should uphold an 1864 prohibition on terminations at all stages of pregnancy, only for legislators to revoke that law. The state's prohibition on termination post-15 weeks of pregnancy stands. The ballot initiative would extend it to 24 weeks.\n\nNatalie Harper, a 23-year-old independent who typically refrains from voting, stated that the potential restoration of the Civil War-era prohibition \"absolutely\" influences her decision to participate in the elections and endorse the ballot measure this November. \"Seeing that as a possibility really made me realize that everyone's pro-choice voices need to be heard in hopes it never goes in that direction again,\" she said.\n\nIn Missouri, which has prohibited nearly all terminations and where almost none were reported in the latest data, election officials could soon confirm if a proposed constitutional amendment guaranteeing termination rights garnered enough signatures to qualify for the ballot in the reliably Republican state.\n\nPeverill Squire, a political scientist at the University of Missouri, stated that if the measure is presented to voters, it could attract sufficient Democratic voters to influence a few competitive legislative races.\n\n\"They can capitalize on the personal freedom arguments that Republicans have generally dominated in recent elections,\" he stated.", "source": {"uri": "pehalnews.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "Pehal News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telehealth", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Telehealth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion-rights_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abortion-rights movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statute", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Statute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Physician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pregnancy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Roe v.

But he also put his signature on allowing infanticide, letting babies die who survive abortions.\n\nBabies survive abortions every year, including five in 2021 just in Minnesota. But the state no longer protects their lives.\n\nMinnesota Democrats took control of the state legislature in 2023 and quickly passed a series of radical pro-abortion bills. One repealed a state law that required medical providers to provide medical care for newborns who survive abortions and report the situation to authorities.\n\nIn 2021 alone, five babies were reported born alive, according to data from the Minnesota Department of Health.\n\nThe report provides more details than most about what happened to the babies:\n\nThe report mentions \"previable\" with two of the babies, raising questions about whether the other three babies were viable. It does not mention their gestational ages.\n\nBut the bill Walz signed leaves them totally unprotected.\n\nPlease follow LifeNews.com on Gab for the latest pro-life news and info, free from social media censorship.\n\nThe Omnibus bill, SF 2995, was largely crafted behind closed doors without input from Republicans on the conference committee. The bill stripped out Minnesota's existing requirement that reasonable measures be taken to \"preserve the life and health\" of born-alive infants, replacing it with a requirement for \"care,\" which the bill's House author, Rep. Tina Liebling (DFL-Rochester), has described as mere \"comfort\" care. Under the new language, an infant could be denied lifesaving care and allowed to die.\\\n\nIn support of repealing the protection for newborns, some lawmakers falsely claimed that the repealed language required inappropriate or futile attempts to save the infants' lives. Instead, the repealed law simply required \"reasonable measures consistent with good medical practice.\" Disabled babies, whose lives are often devalued, could be especially at risk from the denial of this basic protection.\n\nReacting to the action, Renee Carlson, general counsel with the Minnesota Family Council, said their state now has one of the most \"extreme abortion regimes\" in the U.S.\n\n\"Based on elusive claims about access to abortion and with insufficient public notice or debate, the Minnesota legislature and Walz administration created one of the most extreme abortion regimes in the country,\" Carlson said this spring. \"Minnesota's newly elected Democratic trifecta created a fundamental right to abortion by repealing, and thus removing, nearly all health and safety protections in civil and criminal law regulating abortion, impacting women and young girls.\"\n\nOther bills that Walz signed included taxpayer funding for abortions, and the repeal of a program that provided resources to assist \"pregnant and parenting women in developing and maintaining family stability and self-sufficiency.\" Pro-life pregnancy resource centers were involved in providing these services, making the program a target of pro-abortion activists.", "source": {"uri": "lifenews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Life News"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Eight states have enacted these shield laws.\n\nPregnant patients can fill out an online form, connect with a doctor via email or text and, if approved, receive the pills within a week, no matter which state they live in.\n\nShield law practices account for about 10% of abortions nationwide. There were 9,200 abortions a month provided under shield laws from January to March of this year, according to fresh data from the Society of Family Planning's WeCount project. And some researchers estimate that this number has risen since then and could be as high as 12,000 per month.\n\nThe rise of telehealth is part of why the number of abortions in the U.S. has continued to go up since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022 -- even though 14 states have near-total abortion bans. In those states, shield law providers represent the only legal way people can access abortions within the established health care system.\n\n[...]", "source": {"uri": "democraticunderground.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Democratic Underground"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shield_laws_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Shield laws in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telehealth", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Telehealth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Medical abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPR", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NPR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobbs_v._Jackson_Women's_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dobbs v.

Wade was overturned in June 2022, there has been considerable media attention and legal scrutiny of the health and life exceptions to state abortion bans. This may emerge as an election issue as Former President Trump has stated that he supports rape exceptions to abortion bans, but the 2024 Republican party platform says states should decide their own abortion laws - with no mention of exceptions. The vast majority of Americans - about 8 in 10 - support legal access to abortion for pregnancies resulting from rape or incest. While rape and incest exceptions have been part of the political debate, the feasibility of accessing abortion care under these exceptions has garnered much less attention.\n\nDespite broad support for legal access to abortion in cases of rape or incest, 10 of the 21 states with abortion bans or gestational limits do not have an exception for pregnancies resulting from sexual assault. In the 11 states with rape and incest exceptions, lack of provider availability, law enforcement reporting requirements, and early pregnancy gestational limits can make access to abortion care unattainable for pregnant survivors of sexual assault (Figure 1).\n\nRape and incest exceptions to state abortion bans or gestational limits are often restricted to abortion early in pregnancy. Among the 21 states with abortion bans or early gestational limits, 11 make exceptions for pregnancies resulting from rape or incest and 10 do not. Of the 14 states with total abortion bans, nine (Alabama, Arkansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Missouri, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Tennessee, and Texas) lack a rape or incest exception. The remaining 5 (Idaho, Indiana, Mississippi, North Dakota, and West Virginia) have exceptions for cases of rape or incest but limit these exceptions to the earlier stages of pregnancy. Most pregnant people discover they are pregnant at 5.5 weeks LMP, though people living on lower incomes, younger people, Black and Hispanic people, and those experiencing unintended pregnancies often discover their pregnancies later. Of the 7 states with overall gestational limits between 6 and 15 weeks LMP, six (Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Nebraska, North Carolina, and South Carolina) have rape or incest exceptions. Arizona does not have a rape or incest exception in its law.\n\nMost rape or incest exceptions require involvement of law enforcement, which can restrict abortion access for those who have become pregnant as a result sexual assault. In 5 of the states with rape or incest exceptions - Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Mississippi, and West Virginia - pregnant people must report the sexual assault to law enforcement before they can receive abortion care. Many of these states additionally require that the pregnant person provide the physician a copy of the report ahead of receiving care. In Iowa, sexual assault survivors must report the incident \"to law enforcement or a public or private health agency which may include a family physician\"- within 45 days of the incident (140 days for cases of incest). In South Carolina, survivors are not required to report their assault to law enforcement before receiving abortion care, but physicians who perform abortions under the rape/incest exception must report the allegation of sexual assault to the sheriff in the county in which the abortion was provided.\n\nIt is estimated that only 21% of sexual assaults are reported. Survivors are often afraid to report sexual violence to the police due to fear of retaliation and the belief that law enforcement would not do anything to help.\n\nThese requirements can also delay care. There are no clear guidelines specifying how quickly law enforcement must issue a copy of the report in these states. Advocates argue it is difficult to get a copy of a police report while the sexual assault is still being investigated. Among the states that require law enforcement reporting, only Idaho specifies that survivors of sexual assault are entitled to receiving a copy of the report within 72 hours of making the request.\n\nPregnant people may face difficulty finding an abortion provider or securing an appointment. In states with total abortion bans, few abortion providers remain. Providers in states with early gestational limits (and the few remaining providers in states with total bans) may be unwilling to provide abortion care in instances of rape or incest - even when there is an exception - out of fear of prosecution. The sexual assault exceptions often do not specifically outline how physicians can ensure that they will not be prosecuted for providing an abortion that falls under the exceptions. In Idaho, Mississippi, and North Dakota clinics and abortion funds have counseled patients to leave the state to obtain abortion care because they have found that it is easier for people to obtain abortion care out of state than to attempt to receive care in-state under the exception.\n\nIt is instructive to consider a hypothetical scenario in West Virginia, an abortion ban state with a rape/incest exception. The state's total abortion ban has an exception for pregnancies resulting from rape or incest, but only up to 8 weeks LMP (Last Menstrual Period) for adults, typically about 4 weeks after a missed period. Because most people discover they are pregnant at 5.5 weeks LMP, a person who is pregnant as a result of rape or incest in West Virginia typically would have only 2.5 weeks to:\n\nWest Virginia's ban is layered on top of the abortion restrictions implemented before the Dobbs decision: a 24-hour waiting period, mandatory counseling, an ultrasound offer, and for minors, parental or legal guardian notification or a judge's approval. The flow chart below shows how tight this timing is. (Figure 2)\n\nMedicaid coverage for abortion care may be inaccessible, even for enrollees who qualify for a rape or incest exception. Although the federal Hyde Amendment requires state Medicaid programs to cover abortions in cases where the pregnancy resulted from rape or incest, many state Medicaid programs impose pre-authorization requirements and medically unnecessary restrictions. As a result, few, if any, pregnant people obtain Medicaid coverage for their abortion care. For low-income survivors of sexual assault, cost can be an insurmountable barrier to accessing abortion care. In 2021, the median cost of abortion services exceeded $500. However, 43% of women ages 18-49 cannot cover an emergency expense of at least $500 using their current savings, with even larger shares of Black and Hispanic women (57% and 58%, respectively) being unable to cover such an emergency medical expense.\n\nFew people have accessed abortion care under the rape or incest exceptions to state abortion bans. While data from states with abortion bans and exceptions for rape or incest is scant, estimates show that very few abortions are provided in states with total abortion bans, even in those with sexual assault exceptions. For example, Mississippi and Idaho each had 5 documented abortions in 2023, though neither specify the exception under which the abortions were provided. In West Virginia, 23 abortions were provided from January 2023 through June 2024, but none are reported to have been provided under the state's rape/incest exception. Since Indiana's total ban went into effect in late August 2023, providers have reported that 5 abortions were provided due to rape or incest. The true number of pregnancies that result from rape is unknown. Given the extremely low number of abortions states have reported as qualifying for rape exceptions to abortion bans and what is known about the high rates of sexual violence that women experience, it would appear that these exceptions have not provided the level of access to abortion for pregnant rape survivors that the laws presumably are designed to protect.", "source": {"uri": "kff.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "KFF"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy_from_rape", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pregnancy from rape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abortion law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incest", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Incest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_assault", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sexual assault"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Physician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pregnancy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idaho", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Idaho"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Idaho"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Virginia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "West Virginia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "West Virginia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mississippi", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mississippi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mississippi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobbs_v._Jackson_Women's_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dobbs v.

A May 2024 poll by the Pew Research Center found that health care is a major concern for voters going into this election, with questions about what Harris and Walz would potentially change across a range of health care issues in the country. Harris' campaign is still in the early stages, and she hasn't spoken out about her all her views on the topic just yet. But her history with several areas of health care suggests her stance on a range of topics.\n\nHealth policy experts stress that a lot of what Harris and Walz could do in office largely depends on what happens in Congress. \"This is still a divided country,\" says Leighton Ku, PhD, MPH., director of the Center for Health Policy Research at George Washington University's Milken Institute School of Public Health. \"I don't think Harris would be likely to have control of both houses of Congress, but all sorts of things can happen.\"\n\n\"No matter who the president is, reforming health care in the United States is a tall order given the power and lobbying abilities of the health insurance companies,\" says Perry N. Halkitis, Ph.D., dean of the Rutgers School of Public Health.\n\nHere's what health policy researchers and a doctor anticipate may change if Harris and Walz take the election in November.\n\nHarris has repeatedly been vocal about her support for reproductive-care access. In December, she launched a Reproductive Freedoms Tour for which she hosted events to highlight the fallout of abortion bans and shared the stories of people who were impacted by strict legislation around reproductive rights in their states.\n\n\"Extremists across our country continue to wage a full-on attack against hard-won, hard-fought freedoms as they push their radical policies -- from banning abortion in all 50 states and criminalizing doctors, to forcing women to travel out of state in order to get the care they need,\" she said in a statement at the time. \"I will continue to fight for our fundamental freedoms while bringing together those throughout America who agree that every woman should have the right to make decisions about her own body -- not the government.\"\n\nIn March, Harris also made what is believed to be the first official visit to an abortion clinic by a sitting president or vice president. During that visit, she called abortion access a \"very serious health crisis facing women,\" per NPR.\n\n\"Harris is a longtime supporter of abortion rights, while Trump touts his appointments to the Supreme Court that resulted in Roe v. Wade getting overturned,\" Larry Levitt, executive vice president for Health Policy at KFF, tells Fortune.\n\nWalz also has a history of supporting access to abortion care. In 2023, he signed several bills into law to protect people who sought or provided abortions in Minnesota. \"Today, we're protecting the rights of Minnesotans and making sure our state remains a place where people have the freedom to get the care they need to live their fullest lives,\" he said in a statement at the time. \"We're putting up a firewall to ensure Minnesotans have the freedom to make their own healthcare decisions.\"\n\nBut Levitt says that a Harris-Walz administration is likely to be limited in what it can achieve. \"How much either Harris or Trump could do to affect abortion access would depend a lot on who controls Congress, but there are executive actions they could take to shift policy to some extent,\" he says.\n\nKu agrees. \"She may have some room to do more in terms of executive actions or really trying to pursue legal actions to sue states that try to further restrict abortion access,\" he tells Fortune. Harris could continue to push a requirement on hospitals to provide abortions in emergencies where a woman's health is at stake, even in states where abortion is banned, Levitt says.\n\nUltimately, Ku says that Harris is likely to have the biggest impact on reproductive rights if she's able to put a new judge or two in the Supreme Court. \"If she is elected president, I would expect that she would have the opportunity to name one or two Supreme Court justices over her term,\" he says. \"That leads to the possibility of potentially changing the Court.\"\n\nStill, policies on this are vague at the moment. \"Harris supported Medicare for All in the past, offering a proposal in 2019 that would have extended Medicare to everyone gradually with an option to enroll in a private insurance plan,\" Levitt says. \"Harris' previous support for Medicare for all is indicative of her desire to achieve universal coverage, but I don't expect her to push it on the campaign trail or if she wins the presidency.\"\n\nWalz has also stressed the importance of healthcare access. \"What Minnesotans want from their health care is simple,\" Walz said during his 2019 inaugural speech. \"They don't want to get sick in the first place. But if they do, they want care at a price they can afford and at a location close to home.\"\n\nLevitt says he'd expect the administration to focus more on making the Affordable Care Act -- also called Obamacare -- coverage more affordable.\n\nKu agrees that it's unlikely that Harris would put Medicare for All on the front burner right now. \"She continues to be in favor of Medicaid expansions and to keep the Affordable Care Act marketplace strong,\" he says.\n\nLevitt points out that Harris has campaigned on the Biden-Harris administration's political victory over the pharmaceutical industry that gave the government authority to negotiate drug prices in Medicare for the first time, including capping insulin copays at $35 per month. \"She has indicated she wants to take these drug cost relief measures further,\" Levitt says.\n\n\"I assume that she will continue to pursue this,\" Ku says. However, he points out that \"some of this is tied up in courts.\"\n\nWalz also has a history of working to help constituents afford their medication. In 2020, he signed a bill into law that would help Minnesotans afford their insulin. \"Minnesotans should not die because they are forced to choose between putting food on the table and affording the drug they need to survive,\" he said in a statement at the time. \"Despite resistance from the pharmaceutical industry, the grit and determination of Minnesotans with diabetes, Minnesotans who have lost loved ones with diabetes, and their legislators moved this bill forward. It is downright inspiring. This hard-fought law will provide much-needed relief to Minnesotans struggling to afford their insulin. We must continue to put Minnesotans first and ensure people don't struggle to afford the care they need.\"\n\nMariana Socal, PhD, an associate professor in the Department of Health Policy and Management at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, expects that this will be a \"key issue\" for the Harris-Walz campaign. \"Having prescription drug affordability front and center and building on the accomplishments that Vice President Harris had during the Biden Administration will probably be highlighted even more,\" she tells Fortune. \"There would be a stronger ground for drug pricing affordability.\"\n\nHarris was previously California's attorney general, and she actively fought against health industry consolidation -- situations where hospitals and other similar health-related companies merge -- during her tenure, according to Politico. The driving reason was concern that prices would increase.\n\nA Harris-Walz administration could also try to fight private equity ownership in health care systems, Ku says. \"Private equity makes investments because there is money to be made there,\" he says. \"But the quality of care may deteriorate somewhat when private equity is involved.\"\n\nHarris hasn't said much publicly on the topic, but Ku anticipates that she will with time. \"That's the kind of thing I think a Harris administration might be interested in,\" he says.\n\nKu points out that the height of the pandemic revealed a lot of issues with nursing homes in the U.S. \"Nursing homes are still struggling,\" he says. \"They are having great difficulty getting quality staff.\" Under the Biden-Harris administration, the Department of Health and Human Services issued new staffing requirements in nursing homes, Ku notes.\n\nWalz, too, has a history of trying to support nursing care. In August 2023, he helped bring $173 million in funding to support nursing care for Minnesotans. \"This session, we worked across the aisle to prioritize the needs of middle class families and seniors. We're providing direct support to nursing homes across the state to ensure Minnesota's seniors have the quality care and safe environments they deserve,\" he said in a statement. \"By funding nursing homes and investing in workforce incentives, we're working to ensure our seniors have access to high-quality care while bringing new workers into this critical profession and building the workforce of the future.\"\n\nAlso in April, Harris announced rulings to improve access to long-term care, as well as the quality of caregiving jobs. \"A lot of people said, 'Great, but how are we going to pay for this?'\" Ku says, suggesting that a Harris-Walz administration might try to increase funding for nursing homes -- something that would be popular given that Baby Boomers are an aging population. \"I would expect that we will see this come up,\" he says.\n\nOverall, experts stress that there's a lot to still be revealed about what the Harris-Walz duo would do for healthcare if elected. \"The campaign is still so new,\" Ku says. \"But it's important to remember that what happens with Congress and the current Supreme Court are limiting factors in what change can take place.\"", "source":

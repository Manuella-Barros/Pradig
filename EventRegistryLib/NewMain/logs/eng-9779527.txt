This observance aims to increase awareness about lung cancer and promote healthier lifestyle choices to mitigate the risk. Every year since then, August 1 has been dedicated to this cause.\n\nThis year, World Lung Cancer Day focuses on the theme 'Close the Care Gap: Everyone Deserves Access to Cancer Care', emphasising the need for equitable healthcare access for all individuals affected by cancer.\n\nLung cancer is primarily classified into two categories: non-small cell lung cancer and small-cell lung cancer. On World Lung Cancer Day, discussions revolve around understanding the risks associated with lung cancer, offering prevention advice, suggesting lifestyle changes and exploring treatment options. The importance of early detection is highlighted to educate people about lung cancer risks. This day also provides a platform for communities to unite in finding ways to make cancer treatments more accessible and affordable worldwide.\n\nIn an insightful conversation with Firstpost, Dr. Aravind Badiger, Technical Director at BDR Pharmaceuticals, shares practical advice on identifying symptoms, treatment options, and preventive measures for lung cancer.\n\nWhat is lung cancer, and why is it important to be aware of its symptoms and prevention strategies?\n\nLung cancer is a type of cancer that originates in the lungs, primarily affecting the cells lining the air passages. It is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths globally. Awareness of its symptoms and prevention strategies is crucial because early detection and intervention can significantly improve the prognosis and survival rates. Recognising symptoms early allows for timely medical intervention potentially leading to better treatment outcomes and improved quality of life.\n\nWhat are the early symptoms of lung cancer that individuals should be aware of?\n\nEarly symptoms of lung cancer are often subtle and can be mistaken for other respiratory conditions. Key symptoms to watch for include:\n\nHow can one differentiate between common respiratory symptoms and potential signs of lung cancer?\n\nDifferentiating between common respiratory symptoms and potential signs of lung cancer involves paying attention to the persistence and combination of symptoms. For example, a chronic cough that lasts more than a few weeks, especially if accompanied by blood in the sputum, unexplained weight loss, or chest pain, should prompt a visit to a healthcare professional. Unlike typical respiratory infections that improve with standard treatments, lung cancer symptoms persist and may progressively worsen.\n\nHow do treatment plans vary based on the stage and type of lung cancer?\n\nTreatment plans for lung cancer depend on the type (non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) or small cell lung cancer (SCLC)) and the stage of the disease. Common treatment options include:\n\nWhat are the potential side effects and challenges associated with lung cancer treatments?\n\nLung cancer treatments can have various side effects and challenges, including:\n\nManaging these side effects often requires supportive care and close monitoring by healthcare professionals.\n\nWhat role do regular screenings and early detection play in lung cancer prevention?\n\nRegular screenings, especially for high-risk individuals (e.g., long-term smokers), play a crucial role in early detection of lung cancer. Low-dose CT scans can help detect lung cancer at an early, more treatable stage, significantly improving survival rates. Early detection allows for timely and potentially less aggressive treatment, which can lead to better outcomes and reduced mortality.\n\nWhat lifestyle changes and habits can contribute to lower lung cancer risk?\n\nSeveral lifestyle changes and habits can help lower the risk of lung cancer:\n\nHow does genetics play a role in lung cancer risk and treatment?\n\nGenetics can influence an individual's susceptibility to lung cancer and response to treatment. Certain genetic mutations such as those in the EGFR or ALK genes, can make individuals more prone to developing lung cancer. Genetic testing can also guide personalised treatment plans, improving efficacy and minimizing side effects. Understanding genetic predispositions helps tailor prevention strategies and treatment options to the individual.\n\nWhat are the emerging trends in lung cancer research and innovative treatment approaches?\n\nEmerging trends in lung cancer research include:\n\nWhat psychological and emotional support resources are available for lung cancer patients and their families?\n\nPsychological and emotional support is crucial for lung cancer patients and their families. Resources include:\n\nAccess to comprehensive support resources can alleviate the emotional burden and improve the overall well-being of patients and their families.\n\nHow does lung cancer impact different demographics, such as age, gender and ethnicity?\n\nLung cancer impacts various demographics differently. For example:\n\nUnderstanding these demographic variations helps in tailoring public health strategies and treatment approaches to specific populations.\n\nHow can technology and digital health tools assist in lung cancer management and patient support?\n\nTechnology and digital health tools can assist in lung cancer management by:\n\nThese tools enhance patient engagement, improve adherence to treatment plans, and allow for more personalised and proactive care.\n\nWhat are the economic implications of lung cancer for patients, healthcare systems, and society at large?\n\nLung cancer has significant economic implications, including:\n\nAddressing the economic burden requires comprehensive healthcare policies and support systems to assist patients and their families.\n\nWhat are the potential challenges and considerations in palliative care for lung cancer patients?\n\nPalliative care for lung cancer patients focuses on managing symptoms and improving quality of life. Challenges include:\n\nEffective palliative care involves a multidisciplinary approach to address the complex needs of lung cancer patients and their families.\n\nIn conclusion, lung cancer is a multifaceted disease that requires a comprehensive approach to management and prevention. By staying informed about symptoms, treatment options, and preventive measures, individuals can take proactive steps towards better lung health. The pharmaceutical industry continues to play a critical role in advancing research and developing innovative treatments to improve outcomes for lung cancer patients.", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Firstpost"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lung cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_effect", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Side effect"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small-cell_carcinoma", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Small-cell carcinoma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medication", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Medication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_professional", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Health professional"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Respiratory system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptomatic_treatment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Symptomatic treatment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sputum", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sputum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chest_pain", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chest pain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Respiratory disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prognosis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prognosis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Genetics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quality of life"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_loss", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Weight loss"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Smoking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_tract_infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Respiratory tract infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cough", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cough"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 32}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Cancer", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Cancer", "wgt": 56}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Support_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Health/Support Groups", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Support_Groups/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Support Groups/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 33}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Women's_Health/Smoking", "label": "dmoz/Health/Women's Health/Smoking", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://images.firstpost.com/uploads/2024/05/Cancer-word-rep-Pixabay-2024-05-c52db3d69d54a0e85f96cd8b52b51322.jpg?im=FitAndFill=(1200,675)", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9779527", "eventUri": "eng-9779527", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-01", "textStart": 316, "textEnd": 324, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.5607843137254902, "wgt": 227, "relevance": 1}

This alarming revelation was made by health experts on World Lung Cancer Day, an annual event observed on August 1st to raise awareness about lung cancer.\n\nLung cancer, a leading cause of mortality worldwide, has been identified as the most common cancer to spread to the brain, creating secondary cancer. This alarming revelation was made by health experts on World Lung Cancer Day, an annual event observed on August 1st to raise awareness about lung cancer. In India, lung cancer accounts for an annual incidence of 72,510 cases, making up 5.8 per cent of all cancer cases and ranking as the third most commonly diagnosed cancer.\n\nThe health experts noted that a significant challenge arises when lung cancer metastasizes to critical parts of the body, such as the brain. Brain metastases are a prevalent complication across various cancer types, particularly among lung cancer patients, said Dr. Praveen Gupta, Principal Director & Chief of Neurology, Fortis Hospital. He added that about 10 per cent of newly diagnosed patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) develop brain metastases, with lung cancer accounting for 40 to 50 per cent of primary tumours in these cases.\n\nAddressing brain metastases requires a multidisciplinary approach involving oncologists, neurologists, and palliative care specialists to meet the complex needs of patients. The primary goals are to alleviate symptoms, extend survival, and enhance the overall quality of life through personalized treatment plans and supportive care.\n\nTobacco smoking is the primary risk factor for lung cancer in India, contributing to a significant proportion of cases. Cigarette smoking is the leading cause of lung cancer, responsible for about 85 per cent of all cases. Quitting smoking is the most effective way to reduce the risk, said Pavan Yadav, Lead Consultant - Interventional Pulmonology & Lung Transplantation, Aster RV Hospital. However, exposure to environmental pollutants, occupational hazards, and genetic factors also play crucial roles in the development of this disease.\n\nEarly cancer detection and screening play a crucial role in improving lung cancer outcomes. When lung cancer is diagnosed at an early stage before it has spread to other parts of the body, there is a higher chance of successful treatment and potential cure. Screening programmes like Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) scans are recommended for high-risk individuals such as heavy smokers and those with a family history of the disease.\n\nThe lung microbiome, the community of microorganisms in the lungs, has emerged as a significant factor in the context of lung cancer. Research suggests that changes in the lung microbiome, or dysbiosis, can contribute to disease progression. For instance, an imbalance in the types of bacteria present may promote inflammation, which can create an environment conducive to cancer growth. Specific bacterial populations have been associated with lung cancer, such as an increase in pathogenic bacteria and a decrease in beneficial ones.\n\nIn terms of treatment, understanding the lung microbiome's role could lead to personalized approaches. For example, certain bacteria might affect how patients respond to immunotherapy or chemotherapy. Bacterial metabolites can influence the immune system's response to cancer, and targeting the microbiome could potentially enhance the effectiveness of cancer treatments or reduce side effects.\n\nThe fight against lung cancer is multifaceted, involving not only medical interventions but also lifestyle changes and public health initiatives. The role of the lung microbiome in lung cancer is an emerging area of research that could potentially lead to new treatment strategies. However, the most effective way to reduce the risk of lung cancer remains quitting smoking and avoiding exposure to environmental pollutants and occupational hazards. The focus on early detection and understanding the role of the lung microbiome in lung cancer progression underscores the importance of a comprehensive approach to managing this disease.", "source": {"uri": "ibtimes.co.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "International Business Times, India Edition"}, "authors": [{"uri": "qurat_ull_ann@ibtimes.co.in", "name": "Qurat Ull Ann", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lung cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Metastasis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mortality rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_metastasis", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Brain metastasis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Neurology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_smoking", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tobacco smoking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiota", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microbiota"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personalized_medicine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Personalized medicine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking_cessation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Smoking cessation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pulmonology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palliative_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palliative care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Risk factor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Neoplasm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Genetics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quality of life"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oncology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bacteria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CT_scan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CT scan"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Cardiovascular_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Cardiovascular Disorders", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Cancer", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Cancer", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Women's_Health/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Women's Health/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Men's_Health/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Men's Health/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://data1.ibtimes.co.in/en/full/801127/lung-cancer-most-common-cancer-spread-brain-experts.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9779527", "eventUri": "eng-9779527", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-01", "textStart": 256, "textEnd": 266, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.7176470588235294, "wgt": 226, "relevance": 1}

It has the greatest mortality rates among both men and women and is the primary cause of cancer-related fatalities globally. As we observe World Lung Cancer Day 2024, it is important to separate fact from fiction to better understand this condition and its impacts. Here we will debunk 5 common myths about lung cancer and focus on some other facts.\n\nWhile smoking is a significant risk factor for lung cancer, it is not the sole cause. According to the American Cancer Society, approximately 10-20% of lung cancer cases occur in non-smokers. Exposure to secondhand smoke, radon gas, asbestos, and other carcinogens can also lead to lung cancer. Genetic factors and air pollution play substantial roles. For instance, a study published in The Lancet found that air pollution contributes to around 14% of lung cancer cases worldwide.\n\n\"For lung cancer, while a healthy lifestyle, trying to avoid the use of smoking and tobacco are common measures, it is also imperative to consider getting regular screenings done. A first step would be to watch out for early symptoms like - persistent or worsening cough, chest pain triggered by breathing or laughing, difficulty in breathing, joint or bone pain, or unexplained weight loss,\" said Dr Amitesh Anand, Surgical Oncologist, Ranchi Cancer Hospital & Research Centre (RCHRC).\n\nAlthough lung cancer is more common in older adults, it can affect people of all ages. The American Lung Association highlights that while the average age of diagnosis is around 70, younger adults and even teenagers can develop lung cancer. Early onset of the disease can be linked to genetic mutations and environmental factors. A comprehensive study in Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention noted an increase in lung cancer incidence among individuals aged 20 to 49.\n\nDr Anand further explained, \"Lung cancer is one of the most commonly diagnosed cancers in India, accounting for 5.9% of all cancer cases and 8.1% of all cancer-related deaths. Alarmingly, the burden is steadily increasing among younger populations as well, with 10-20 percent of cases occurring in individuals under the age of 50.\"\n\nQuitting smoking at any age significantly reduces the risk of developing lung cancer and improves overall health. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) states that within 10 years of quitting, the risk of dying from lung cancer drops by half compared to someone who continues smoking. Research from the Journal of the National Cancer Institute reveals that former smokers experience a substantial decline in lung cancer risk over time, regardless of how long they smoked.\n\nEarly detection through screening can save lives, even if you don't exhibit symptoms. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends annual lung cancer screening for high-risk individuals, such as those aged 50-80 with a significant smoking history. The National Lung Screening Trial found that low-dose CT scans can reduce lung cancer mortality by 20% compared to chest X-rays. Screening helps detect cancer at an early, more treatable stage.\n\nWhile not all lung cancer cases are preventable, several measures can significantly reduce the risk. Avoiding smoking and exposure to secondhand smoke, testing homes for radon, and reducing exposure to carcinogens like asbestos are effective strategies. Maintaining a healthy diet rich in fruits and vegetables and regular exercise can also contribute to lung health. A study in The Journal of Nutrition emphasized the protective role of a diet high in antioxidants against lung cancer.\n\n\"While lung cancer is the leading cancer among men in India, it is increasingly impacting women as well due to rising tobacco use, passive smoking, and severe indoor and outdoor air pollution. Women's cancer cases are often only identified at advanced stages due to reluctance in undergoing routine screenings. Women in high-risk jobs, such as mining and construction, and those in rural communities, are particularly vulnerable.

Lung cancer was first discovered in the early 1900s in autopsies. Later advances in imaging technologies, bronchosopy, and molecular diagnostics helped diagnose it more frequently and reliably in the 20th century. As we confront this growing epidemic on August 1, observed as World Lung Cancer Day, understanding the multifaceted aspects of lung cancer -- from its risk factors to the critical importance of early detection -- becomes paramount.\n\nA silently growing concern\n\nLung cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer-related deaths globally. As per the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), the incidence of lung cancer is rising rapidly every year in India, and contributes to 10% of cancer deaths. India ranks fourth globally in terms of the absolute number of lung cancer cases, with 81,000 cases and 75,000 deaths reported in 2022. This is expected to double by 2025.\n\nCurrently, lung cancer is most often detected in Indians only at Stage 3 or 4, by which time it is no longer curable, leading to poor survival rates. Over half of the patients present with distant metastasis at diagnosis. This delay is often due to inadequate screening, resource constraints, lack of a structured referral system, and a high burden of tuberculosis (TB). Primary care physicians may not recognise lung cancer due to these factors. So, an augmented intelligence system to suggest diagnoses based on imaging or history may help.\n\nWhile India has developed frameworks for different cancer screening programmes, lung cancer is yet to be included. The recent ICMR call to researchers for a rigorous evaluation of population health to set the appropriate guidelines for screening is an encouraging sign.\n\nThe increasing prevalence of lung cancer is attributed not only to smoking but also to rising levels of air pollution. Alarmingly, the number of lung cancer deaths attributed to air pollution has surged by nearly 30% since 2007. When a large number of harmful substances accumulate in the air, such as particulate matter (PM10, PM2.5, toxic metals) and gases (sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide), they can cause detrimental effects on lung health, resulting in lung cancer.\n\nSmoking tobacco (including cigarettes, beedis, cigars, and pipes) is the primary risk factor for lung cancer. Factors affecting non-smokers include exposure to second-hand smoke, occupational hazards (such as asbestos, radon and certain chemicals), air pollution, hereditary cancer syndromes, and previous chronic lung diseases. Notably, about 40% of lung cancer patients in north India are non-smokers. This underlines the need for broader awareness and preventive measures. Often, a combination of factors contributes to lung cancer among non-smokers. One of the strongest predictors can be genetic mutation. Lung cancers associated with non-smokers often affect younger individuals and show distinct genetic changes compared to smoker-related cancers.\n\nImportance of early detection\n\nThe high rate of disability-adjusted life years due to lung cancer in India underscores the critical need for early detection, which is vital to improving lung cancer outcomes. Despite having a considerable burden of lung cancer, India does not have a systematic lung cancer screening programme because of cost and logistical constraints, and concerns regarding high false-positive rates owing to the TB burden. Although newer medications may extend life in advanced stage lung cancer, these are often expensive. It is better to prevent and detect it early.\n\nWhen detected early enough, lung cancer is curable. Lung cancer can be diagnosed by imaging methods such as Chest X-ray and CT scan. Chest X-rays typically only pick up nodules or masses which are either greater than 2 cm in size or closer to the chest wall (<2.5 cm), and so may not detect early-stage lung cancer effectively. There are no blood biomarkers for lung cancer yet, although active investigation into various techniques including exhaled breath analysis is ongoing.\n\nIn recent times, the Low-Dose Computed Tomography (LDCT) has emerged as a game-changer. This scan uses five times less radiation than a conventional CT scan and has become the first choice for early lung cancer screening. It is currently being recommended in the United States and Europe for routine lung cancer screening. Since LDCT uses a much lower dose of radiation, the test can be done periodically and sometimes even annually in certain groups.\n\nStudies have shown that LDCT can lower the mortality rate from lung cancer by 20% compared to detection with Chest X-rays and by 24% compared to no screening at all. Although LDCT uses lower radiation, the sensitivity allows detection of potentially cancerous nodules or lesions within the lungs years before the onset of symptoms, improving both the range of possible therapies and treatment.\n\nLung cancer is a serious problem that demands a concerted effort from individuals, healthcare providers, and policymakers to raise awareness, implement smoking cessation programmes as well as safety measures for occupational exposures. In addition, research into better diagnostic technologies and treatment modalities for the Indian population, alongside a national lung cancer screening programme, will be required to combat this silent epidemic and ensure better survival rates.\n\nDr. Madhu Sasidhar, Pulmonologist and Critical Care Specialist, and President and CEO, Hospitals Division, Apollo Hospitals; Dr. Sai Praveen Haranath, American Board Certified in Internal Medicine, Pulmonologist and Critical Care Specialist, Apollo Hospitals, Jubilee Hills\n\nRead Comments", "source": {"uri": "thehindu.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hindu"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lung cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Council_of_Medical_Research", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indian Council of Medical Research"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Risk factor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Diagnosis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_pollution", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Air pollution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particulates", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Particulates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Epidemic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Metastasis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tuberculosis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_care_physician", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Primary care physician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autopsy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Autopsy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CT_scan", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CT scan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_cancer_screening", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lung cancer screening"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chest_radiograph", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chest radiograph"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability-adjusted_life_year", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Disability-adjusted life year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_smoking", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Passive smoking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_screening", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cancer screening"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen_dioxide", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nitrogen dioxide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_Hospitals", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apollo Hospitals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Cardiovascular_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Cardiovascular Disorders", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Cancer", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Cancer", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Women's_Health/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Women's Health/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 61}], "image": "https://th-i.thgim.com/public/migration_catalog/article11961396.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/vbk-02-lung%20cancer.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9779527", "eventUri": "eng-9779527", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-01", "textStart": 367, "textEnd": 375}], "sentiment": -0.5372549019607843, "wgt": 208, "relevance": 1}

He's president and CEO of the American Lung Association (ALA), which conducted the 2024 Lung Health Barometer survey.\n\nGetting a tumor detected via an annual CT lung scan raises the odds of five-year survival from stage 1 to 4 lung cancer by 63%, according to the ALA.\n\nUnder current American Cancer Society guidelines, yearly lung cancer screening with a low-dose CT scan is currently recommended for all people aged 50 to 80 who smoke or used to smoke, and who have at least a 20 pack-year history of smoking (meaning a pack of cigarettes smoked per day for 20 years).\n\nThe new ALA survey canvassed 4,000 people across the United States about their knowledge of lung health and lung cancer.\n\nOnly 38% of respondents knew that CT scans were now an available screening option for folks at high risk for lung cancer.\n\nStill, even that number is an increase from prior years, Wimmer noted.\n\n\"Compared to our 2022 Lung Health Barometer, we saw a 27% increase in awareness of lung cancer screening,\" he said in an ALA news release.\n\nIn other findings:\n\nOnly about a quarter (28%) of respondents knew that lung cancer is still America's leading cancer killer. Only 10% thought it was a cancer likely to affect women (women are often affected).\n\nMost (73%) of respondents had never spoken to their doctor about their risk for lung cancer, and only 42% were concerned they might get the disease. According to the ACS, about 1 in every 5 lung cancers occur in people who have never smoked.\n\nSeven out of 10 of those surveyed were hopeful that lung cancer treatments and outcomes have improved over the past decade. However, only 15% were aware that survival has increased dramatically -- by over 50% in the past 10 years.\n\n\"The American Lung Association's new survey provides a critical look at public awareness and attitudes regarding lung cancer, which is the leading cause of cancer deaths in the U.S.,\" Wimmer said.\n\nMore information\n\nFind out more about lung cancer screening guidelines from another respected group, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force.\n\nSOURCE: American Lung Association, news release, Aug. 1, 2024\n\nWhat This Means For You\n\nToo many Americans who may be at risk for lung cancer remain unaware of CT screening, which can catch tumors early.", "source": {"uri": "norfolkdailynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Norfolk Daily News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CT_scan", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "CT scan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_cancer_screening", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lung cancer screening"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lung cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Smoking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Lung_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "American Lung Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five-year_survival_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Five-year survival rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Cancer_Society", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American Cancer Society"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cigarette", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cigarette"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Neoplasm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Preventive_Services_Task_Force", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Preventive Services Task Force"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Cancer", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Cancer", "wgt": 41}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Support_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Health/Support Groups", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Support_Groups/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Support Groups/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Women's_Health/Smoking", "label": "dmoz/Health/Women's Health/Smoking", "wgt": 33}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 72}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/norfolkdailynews.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/5/25/525a3dd0-b33b-51a0-a79a-044ea2574a46/66ab63b959750.image.jpg?crop=1200%2C630%2C0%2C106&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9779527", "eventUri": "eng-9779527", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.5529411764705883, "wgt": 206, "relevance": 1}

But there are times when they overgrow and multiply inappropriately, leading to tumours and other complications. This condition is known as cancer. In lung cancer, abnormal cell division occurs in the lungs resulting in tumours and lumps. Typically, this cancer manifests itself through persistent cough, blood in the cough and shortness of breath. Your risk of lung cancer increases if you smoke or are exposed to a gas called radon and toxic substances such as asbestos or diesel.\n\nThe global prevalence of lung cancer is quite alarming. In 2018 alone, around 2.1 million new cases of this cancer were diagnosed worldwide, which accounts for 11.6 per cent of the world's total cancer burden. Globally, the mortality rate is the highest in North America and Europe. In India, one in 68 males develops lung cancer. Lung cancer is one of the five most common cancer in India. More than 40% of patients are diagnosed with advanced lung cancer where cancer has been spread.\n\nTypes\n\nThere are two types of lung cancer: Small-cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) and Non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC).\n\nThe stage of cancer tells us about the spread of the condition. This is crucial for deciding the treatment modality. While NSLC has four main stages, SCLC has two stages.\n\nSymptoms\n\nWhatever the form be, the manifestations of lung cancer usually remain the same. In most cases, the symptoms start showing up at a much later stage. Here are the red flags to watch out for:\n\nAlmost anyone can get this condition. However, certain factors make you more vulnerable to lung cancer.\n\nPrevention\n\nNo form of cancer, including lung cancer, can be prevented. However, you can reduce your chance of falling prey to this condition.\n\nDiagnosis\n\nAfter reviewing your symptoms, if your doctor suspects lung cancer, he may recommend the following tests for a confirmatory diagnosis.\n\nTreatment\n\nThe treatment of this condition may vary on the basis of location, stage and overall health status of an individual. Here are the treatment modalities that your oncologist may resort to:\n\nThere's no diet or menu meant specifically for lung cancer. However, a balanced meal plan that nourishes your body well can help you combat the side effects of treatments. Also, in the course of your treatment, your nutritional needs and food tolerance may be altered. So, consult your physician and nutritionist for any change in diet that your body needs. Here are some dietary tips that will make you feel better if you follow them well:\n\nPrognosis And Complications\n\nPrognosis\n\nThe type and stage of lung cancer affect its prognosis. More than half of the patients are diagnosed in an advanced stage where cancer has spread. On an average, the 5-year survival rate for lung cancer is 15%.\n\nComplications\n\nTreatments for lung cancer can lead to several complications. Smoking before surgery, weakened immune system, age, and obesity can lead to complications during surgery. The incidence of death within 60 days after surgery is very high. Respiratory complications like pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome are responsible for deaths after surgery. Surgery can affect the patient's quality of life as they can become physically disabled. Radiotherapy can lead to pneumonia, fibrosis, and lung toxicity. Radiotherapy can also cause toxicity in the heart, digestive system, spinal cord and skin.\n\nAlternative Treatments\n\nComplementary and alternative medicines that are used for the treatment of lung cancer are:", "source": {"uri": "thehealthsite.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Thehealthsite.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lung cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Neoplasm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small-cell_carcinoma", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Small-cell carcinoma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cough", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cough"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-small-cell_lung_cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Non-small-cell lung cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortness_of_breath", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shortness of breath"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prevalence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poison", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Poison"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asbestos", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Asbestos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_division", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cell division"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Radon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mortality rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Diagnosis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Therapy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_digestive_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Human digestive system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_respiratory_distress_syndrome", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Acute respiratory distress syndrome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_effect", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Side effect"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrosis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fibrosis"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Cancer", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Cancer", "wgt": 55}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Support_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Health/Support Groups", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Support_Groups/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Support Groups/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Women's_Health/Smoking", "label": "dmoz/Health/Women's Health/Smoking", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.thehealthsite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Lung-Cancer.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9779527", "eventUri": "eng-9779527", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.584313725490196, "wgt": 206, "relevance": 1}

It is an apt time to know the early signs of a disease that kills half of the people who are diagnosed with it.\n\nMedical negligence solicitor Kim Jackson, from Patient Claim Line, said Brits can spot signs of lung cancer. Kim has also spoken about what to do if your doctor has missed your symptoms.\n\nWhat are the red flag symptoms of lung cancer?\n\nKim said: \"Red flag symptoms include a persistent cough that can deteriorate, coughing up blood and chest pain that is worse with deep breathing, coughing or laughing. A loss of appetite, weight loss that cannot be explained and fatigue are also key signs of lung cancer. Watch out for hoarseness, breathlessness, a new onset of wheezing and infections such as bronchitis and pneumonia that are persistent.\"\n\nWhat should a doctor or medical professional do upon recognising the symptoms of lung cancer?\n\nKim said: \"If you visit your GP with symptoms suggestive of lung cancer, a GP should examine you and ask you to breathe into a device called a spirometer, which measures how much air you breathe in and out. A blood test might be requested to rule out some of the possible causes of your symptoms. The main test to diagnose lung cancer is a chest X-ray. A CT scan will also be advised as well as a PET-CT scan.\"\n\nWhat happens if lung cancer isn't treated quickly?\n\nKim said: \"More than half of people diagnosed with lung cancer will die within one year of diagnosis, even with treatment. Obviously, the sooner lung cancer is detected, the greater chance you have of survival. However, it all depends on the staging of the lung cancer and the health of the person overall.\"\n\nWhat are my legal rights if I've experienced a delayed lung cancer diagnosis?\n\nKim said: \"A person has three years from their date of knowledge to bring a claim before the Court. In order to establish negligence, a person must prove that there has been a breach of duty of care and as a result, causation has arisen i.e. a person has suffered injury as a direct result of negligence. It can be difficult to be successful in a claim for negligence in cancer cases, particularly when proving causation.

As it accounts for one in four cancer-related fatalities, it is vital to encourage early identification by raising awareness of symptoms and developing screening programs for the disease.\n\nEarly discovery makes it possible to start treatment, reduces the likelihood that the disease will spread and starts to lower the number of lung cancer fatalities that occur globally.\n\nLung cancer ranks first among cancer-related fatalities globally for both men and women, according to the World Health Organisation. Globally, there were 1.80 million lung cancer deaths and 2.21 million new cases of the disease in 2020.\n\nAlthough there is common knowledge that smoking causes lung cancer, it is crucial to acknowledge that occupational hazards also contribute significantly to the development of lung cancer and that smoking may compound the effects of occupational exposure to cause lung cancer.\n\nThese are the 5 careers where lung cancer is more likely to occur later in life.\n\nAsbestos is the primary cause of lung cancer deaths among construction workers following possible asbestos exposure when renovating or demolishing buildings that contain asbestos-containing materials (ACMs). Roofing materials, floor tiles and insulation are a few examples of ACMs. The prevalent ingredient in building materials, silica, can potentially increase the risk of cancer and lung conditions.\n\nThe coal/coke and allied product industry was shown to have a considerable risk of lung cancer, according to a study published in Translational Lung Cancer Research. Coal gasification personnel may be exposed to a variety of substances in addition to PAHs, such as asbestos, silica, arsenic, cadmium, lead, nickel, hydrocarbons, sulphur dioxide, sulphuric acid, aldehydes, etc.\n\nAs per a study published in the National Library of Medicine, glass filaments, ceramic fibres and slag wool are examples of man-made mineral fibres that have been shown to have carcinogenic consequences. Studies on humans have demonstrated an increased risk of lung cancer in those who produce glass and slag wool.\n\nMiners may be exposed to asbestos at work, just like mechanics and construction workers, but they may also be exposed to other hazardous materials. Miners, for example, may have an increased cancer risk as a result of exposure to radon and uranium, with probable malignancies including gastric cancer, mesothelioma and brain cancer.\n\nWelders deal with metal parts, so part of their job involves everyday exposure to a lot of carcinogenic chemicals, such as benzene. These toxic fibres and gases, when breathed, can harm the lungs and frequently result in lung cancer and other deadly illnesses.\n\nPrimary prevention provides targeted protection against an illness by removing or reducing known risk factors in groups that are vulnerable to it. Numerous studies have shown that a high risk of lung cancer is associated with tobacco use. By lowering tobacco use, we can lower the incidence of lung cancer through behaviour adjustment.\n\nAs the number of nonsmokers developing lung cancer rises, it is imperative to investigate nontobacco risk factors. Workplace and environmental risk factors might be to blame for this. Since primary preventive care is a valuable and affordable strategy, it is necessary to investigate its effectiveness.\n\nAppropriate communication tactics are required to spread political and scientific messages across society. The scientific community is well aware -- but the general public is not -- that lung cancer is caused by exposure to certain chemicals and workplace hazards.\n\nTo address the environmental and occupational drivers of lung cancer, multi-sectoral approaches and collaborations are required for primary preventive efforts.\n\nCommunity organisations, private businesses and health and non-health sectors including the environment, commerce, housing, industry and occupation must conduct population or community-based interventions.\n\nTo identify the areas that require action to prevent lung cancer connected to the environment and work, research on the prevention of lung cancer is crucial.", "source": {"uri": "news18.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News18"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asbestos", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Asbestos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lung cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "World Health Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Smoking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_hazard", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Occupational hazard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineral_wool", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mineral wool"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_dioxide", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Silicon dioxide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coal_gasification", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coal gasification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aldehyde", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aldehyde"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polycyclic_aromatic_hydrocarbon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_National_Library_of_Medicine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States National Library of Medicine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_insulation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thermal insulation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadmium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cadmium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfur_dioxide", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sulfur dioxide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Building_material", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Building material"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Risk factor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carcinogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfuric_acid", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sulfuric acid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrocarbon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hydrocarbon"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances/Tobacco", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances/Tobacco", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Cancer", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Cancer", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Wounds_and_Injuries", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Wounds and Injuries", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Women's_Health/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Women's Health/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2024/07/lung-cancer-day-2024-workplace-safety-2024-07-b7e133540561da32e32094ae63bc0a69-16x9.jpg?impolicy=website&width=1200&height=675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9779527", "eventUri": "eng-9779527", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-01", "textStart": 176, "textEnd": 184}], "sentiment": -0.6549019607843137, "wgt": 203, "relevance": 1}

Quitting smoking is the most effective way to reduce the risk,\" Pavan Yadav, Lead Consultant - Interventional Pulmonology & Lung Transplantation, Aster RV Hospital, told VOICE.\n\n\"However, exposure to environmental pollutants, occupational hazards, and genetic factors also play crucial roles in the development of this disease,\" he added.\n\nEarly cancer detection and screening, however, play a crucial role in improving lung cancer outcomes.\n\nWhen lung cancer is diagnosed at an early stage before it has spread to other parts of the body, there is a higher chance of successful treatment and potential cure, Yadav said.\n\nHe also recommended screening programmes like Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) scans for high-risk individuals such as heavy smokers and those with a family history of the disease.\n\nThe experts also called to quit smoking and to recognise warning signs \"such as persistent cough, chest pain, shortness of breath, hoarseness, unexplained weight loss, and coughing up blood, can prompt individuals to seek medical evaluation if they experience these signs\".", "source": {"uri": "weeklyvoice.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Weekly Voice"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_metastasis", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brain metastasis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lung cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Metastasis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lancet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Lancet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Neurology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mortality rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_impairment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cognitive impairment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seizure", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Seizure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_pathway", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Neural pathway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_control", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Motor control"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edema", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Edema"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palliative_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palliative care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_smoking", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tobacco smoking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Neoplasm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quality of life"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headache", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Headache"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oncology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CT_scan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CT scan"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Cancer", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Cancer", "wgt": 53}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Support_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Health/Support Groups", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Support_Groups/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Support Groups/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Women's_Health/Smoking", "label": "dmoz/Health/Women's Health/Smoking", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://weeklyvoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/202408013196993.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9779527", "eventUri": "eng-9779527", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-01", "textStart": 11, "textEnd": 16, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.8117647058823529, "wgt": 199, "relevance": 1}

Expert explains", "body": "New Delhi: Cancer is the leading cause of death across the world, affecting millions of people worldwide. Among all the cancer cases, lung cancer is the leading condition of all time. According to the Indian Council of Medical Research National Cancer Registry Programme, the number of cases is anticipated to increase from 14.6 lakhs in 2022 to 15.7 lakhs in 2025. In India, lung cancer reports more deaths every year as compared to breast, prostate, and colorectal cancers combined. Some of the major factors behind the cause of lung cancer can be a combination of genetic factors and lifestyle choices.\n\nOn World Lung Cancer Day, Dr Tushar Patil, Senior Consultant - Medical Oncologist, Sahyadri Super Speciality Hospital, Deccan Gymkhana, Pune shared with News9, \"Long-term dynamic smoking and long exposure to natural carcinogens increase the hazard of developing lung cancer. Understanding how daily choices impact lung health is essential for both prevention and early detection.\"\n\n1. Tobacco Smoking - Primary Culprit: Cigarette Smoking - The most well-known risk factor for lung cancer is cigarette smoking. Tobacco smoke contains numerous carcinogens that damage lung cells. The risk increases with the number of cigarettes smoked and the duration of smoking. According to recent studies, smokers are 15 to 30 times more likely to develop lung cancer compared to non-smokers.\n\nPassive Smoking: Secondhand smoke, or passive smoking, also significantly increases lung cancer risk. Non-smokers exposed to secondhand smoke at home or work have a 20-30 per cent greater risk of developing lung cancer.\n\n2. Air Pollution: Outdoor Air Pollution - India, with its rapid urbanization and industrialization, faces severe air pollution issues. Pollutants such as particulate matter (PM2.5), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and sulfur dioxide (SO2) are linked to an increased risk of lung cancer. Long-term exposure to high levels of these pollutants can be as harmful as smoking a pack of cigarettes daily.\n\nIndoor air pollution from biomass fuel used for cooking and heating, particularly in rural areas, is another significant risk factor. Women exposed to biomass smoke over extended periods have a higher incidence of lung cancer, similar to heavy smokers.\n\n3. Occupational Hazards: Certain occupations expose individuals to carcinogens such as asbestos, radon, and diesel exhaust. Miners, construction workers, and factory workers are particularly at risk. Regulations and protective measures can mitigate these risks, but awareness and compliance remain challenges.\n\n4. Diet and Nutrition: Fruits and Vegetables - A diet rich in fruits and vegetables has been shown to reduce lung cancer risk. These foods contain antioxidants and phytochemicals that protect cells from damage.\n\nAlcohol Consumption - While moderate alcohol consumption has mixed effects on overall health, excessive drinking is linked to an increased risk of several cancers, including lung cancer. Limiting alcohol intake is advisable for cancer prevention.\n\n5. Physical Activity: Regular physical activity is associated with a lower risk of lung cancer. Exercise helps maintain a healthy weight, improves lung function, and boosts the immune system. Engaging in moderate to vigorous physical activity for at least 30 minutes a day is recommended.\n\n6. Genetic Factors: While lifestyle choices significantly impact lung cancer risk, genetic predisposition also plays a role. Individuals with a family history of lung cancer should be particularly vigilant and adopt healthier lifestyle choices to mitigate their risk.\n\n1. Quitting smoking at any age significantly reduces lung cancer risk. Smoking cessation programs, including counselling, medications, and support groups, are highly effective.\n\n2. For high-risk individuals, such as long-term smokers and those with occupational exposures, regular screenings with low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) can detect lung cancer early, improving treatment outcomes.\n\n3. Educating the public about the risks of smoking, air pollution, and occupational hazards is crucial. Campaigns should focus on prevention and early detection strategies.", "source": {"uri": "news9live.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News9live"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sneha_kumari@news9live.com", "name": "Sneha Kumari", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lung cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Smoking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_smoking", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Passive smoking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Carcinogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cigarette", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cigarette"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Council_of_Medical_Research", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indian Council of Medical Research"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen_dioxide", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nitrogen dioxide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfur_dioxide", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sulfur dioxide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorectal_cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colorectal cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Risk factor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prostate cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particulates", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Particulates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Genetics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tobacco"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oncology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pune", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pune"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pune"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_(drug)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alcohol (drug)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_smoke", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tobacco smoke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indoor_air_quality", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indoor air quality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollutant", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pollutant"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances/Tobacco", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances/Tobacco", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Cancer", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Cancer", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Nutrition/Disease_Prevention", "label": "dmoz/Health/Nutrition/Disease Prevention", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://images.news9live.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Untitled-design-2024-08-01T114908.839.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9779527", "eventUri": "eng-9779527", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.4274509803921569, "wgt": 198, "relevance": 1}

The statistics are expected to double by 2025.\n\nOn World Lung Cancer Day, Dr Bhavna Bansal Senior Consultant and HOD, Histopathology Oncquest Laboratories shared with News9, \"Lung cancer continues to be one of the world's leading causes of cancer mortality, claiming around 1.6 million lives every year. In India, lung cancer accounts for 5.9 per cent of cancer cases and 8.1 per cent of cancer-related deaths.

Our goal is to use state-of-the-art technology to enhance the accuracy of lung cancer diagnostics, which enables early detection and customised treatment. Our goal is to close the gaps and offer the best possible care to all patients, regardless of their financial situation. Striving towards a healthcare system where everyone has access to comprehensive cancer care will help mitigate the impact of lung cancer in the long run.\"\n\nStay away from tobacco: According to a report from the American Cancer Society, the best way to reduce the risk of lung cancer is to quit smoking and avoid passive smoking. When you stop smoking, your lung tissue gradually starts to repair itself.\n\nAvoid radon exposure: Radon is one of the major causes of cancer, you need to reduce the exposure to radon by having your home tested and treated.\n\nLimit exposure to cancer-causing substances: It is better to avoid or limit exposure to cancer-causing substances in workplaces or anywhere else.\n\nMaintain a healthy diet: Eating lots of fruits, vegetables and nutrients can help reduce the cancer risk and help you be healthy.\n\nExercise: Being physically fit is extremely important, it helps to lose weight and reduces mental stress.

Officials said the remaining patients are yet to come back with reports. Besides, among the 20,418 screened, as many as 2,805 have been found to have presumptive tuberculosis. August 1 is observed as World Lung Cancer Day.\n\nWith most lung cancer cases detected at the last stage in the absence of specific common testing techniques for the disease, early intervention has become a challenge. In this context, the State Health Department had tied up with AstraZeneca to deploy AI-based lung cancer screening technology in its hospitals.\n\nState Health Commissioner Randeep D. said the AI-based lung cancer screening technology would screen a patient for 29 lung diseases in one chest X-ray. Developed by Qure.ai, this AI-powered chest X-ray system will help the government detect lung nodules, overcoming a major early detection challenge, he said.\n\nIncidence of cancer\n\nIn Karnataka, the incidence of cancer is increasing by about 1% each year in both men and women. In 2023, a total of 88,873 cancer cases were recorded in the State of which 5,272 (5.9%) were lung cancers.\n\nAccording to data from the State-run Kidwai Memorial Institute of Oncology, the institute sees around 25,000 new cancer cases every year. \"In 2023, 11,712 patients tested positive for malignancy and of these 721 (6.2%) were diagnosed with lung cancers (508 male patients and 213 female patients) at Kidwai. Of these, only around 500 patients continue treatment,\" said L.K. Rajeev, associate professor in Medical Oncology at the institute.\n\nStating that the number of patients continuing treatment for lung cancer is increasing when compared with that in the last decade, Dr. Rajeev said late presentation remains a crucial issue. \"Most patients present with fourth-stage cancers. Of the 15% who report in early stages, only 5% are fit to undergo surgeries,\" the doctor said.\n\nMost prevalent cancer\n\nQuoting findings from the National Cancer Registry Programme, Prashant Mathur, director of the Indian Council of Medical Research - National Centre for Disease Informatics and Research (ICMR-NCDIR) in Bengaluru, said lung cancer is one of the most prevalent and fatal forms of cancer in the country, ranking as the first leading site among men and fifth leading site among women.\n\n\"The incidence of lung cancer has been steadily rising, with major risk factors including tobacco use and air pollution. A recent study done by the ICMR-NCDIR, looking at various published studies found a strong link between air pollution and cancer, specifically showing that fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) in the air are associated with higher rates of lung cancer and deaths resulting from it,\" Dr. Mathur said.\n\n\"The projected number of lung cancer cases in 2025 is estimated to be 81,219 among men and 30,109 among women. A recent analysis of 44,218 lung cancers confirmed that about half of the patients were in an advanced stage of disease at the time of diagnosis,\" he pointed out.\n\nRead Comments", "source": {"uri": "thehindu.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hindu"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lung cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_nodule", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lung nodule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CT_scan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CT scan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chest_radiograph", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chest radiograph"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tuberculosis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oncology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Respiratory disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AstraZeneca", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "AstraZeneca"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karnataka", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Karnataka"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Karnataka"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Council_of_Medical_Research", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indian Council of Medical Research"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen_dioxide", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nitrogen dioxide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Risk factor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Diagnosis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_smoking", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tobacco smoking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_pollution", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Air pollution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particulates", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Particulates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Cardiovascular_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Cardiovascular Disorders", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Cancer", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Cancer", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Women's_Health/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Women's Health/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Men's_Health/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Men's Health/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 77}], "image": "https://th-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/3xjqws/article68469921.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/IMG_iStock-1217561470_2_1_O9BMTLQK.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9779527", "eventUri": "eng-9779527", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-01", "textStart": 635, "textEnd": 643}], "sentiment": -0.4509803921568627, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

(Image: Shutterstock)\n\nLung Cancer is one of the most common cancers of India. According to GLOBOCAN 2022 data, Lung cancer is the 4th most common cancer while it is the second most common cancer among males. There are estimated 81000 new cases of lung cancer diagnosed every year. It is also a associated with a high incidence of mortality. Annually, approximately 75000 deaths can be attributed to lung cancer which indicates its fatal nature. One of the reasons for its high mortality is because it is often diagnosed in an advanced stage. According to one of the largest data published from AIIMS in 2017, approximately 2/3 rd of all lung cancer cases are diagnosed when the cancer has already metastasized to other organ (stage 4). Additional 20% of the cases are diagnosed in stage III where majority of the cases are not operable. Less than 10-15% of cases are diagnosed in stage I and 2 where a realistic chance of cure is possible.\n\nDr. Abhishek Raj, Senior Consultant & Head (Unit I) Medical Oncology, Haematology & BMT, Cancer Care, Genomic Oncology, Paediatric Oncology, Sarvodaya Hospital, Faridabad, says, \"This underscores the need for early diagnosis and screening to detect lung cancer early where it can be cured. Screening is a test which can detect the presence of disease before the symptoms appear. Screening is usually done in healthy and asymptomatic individuals. Various screening tests are well established in different cancers and they are known to detect cancer early and prevent mortality.\"\n\nExamples include Mammography (breast cancer), PAP smear and HPV DNA testing (Cervical cancer), colonoscopy (colon cancer), PSA levels (prostate cancer). Screening in lung cancer is tricky because of two reasons. First, the screening involves using computed tomography scan (CT scan) which in itself is associated with exposure to radiation beams and it is not a single time procedure. If the first scan comes is negative, it needs to be repeated at a regular interval (usually annually). \"To counter this, various trials have successfully used a low-dose CT (LDCT) scan for lung cancer screening which uses significantly less radiation exposure to conventional diagnostic CT scan of the chest. Various studies from the west have shown that annual LDCT scan chest in individuals with significant history of smoking (> 20-30 pack years of active smoking or quit recently not > 15 years ago) in age group 50-80 have shown to detect lung cancer early and also led to significant reduction in lung cancer mortality,\" adds Dr Raj.\n\nDr Raj explains the second problem with screening is overdiagnosis and over-investigation. Sometimes a small nodule detected on a screening LDCT scan will necessitate the individual to undergo a further array of other investigations like biopsy, bronchoscopy to prove the nature of abnormality detected on CT scan. In a country like India where lung infections like tuberculosis and more recently COVID are so common, often a benign lung nodule due to past infections can be interpreted as suspicious for cancer and can lead to over investigations leading to anxiety, mental stress and burden on healthcare system and family. So, every person who are more than 50 years of age with significant history of smoking should meet with experts to help them take an informed decision making on doing annual low dose CT scan of chest to screen for lung cancer.\n\nDiagnosis of lung cancer is made by various modalities like CT scan of chest, Bronchoscopy and guided needle aspirations and biopsies. PET-CT scan is another modality that is used to determine the extent and spread of lung cancer. PET-CT scan is often done after the diagnosis of lung cancer is established. The common signs and symptoms of lung cancer are a dry or productive cough that is not going away, chest pain, blood in sputum, shortness of breath at rest or at exertion, weight loss and a recent change in voice. \"Some of these symptoms are non-specific and can be seen in other lung and heart conditions as well. People with a history of smoking with these symptoms should not ignore it and meet their physicians at the earliest to arrive at the correct diagnosis,\" shares Dr Raj.\n\nTobacco smoking in its various forms like cigarette, bidi, hukkah etc. is one of the most common causes of lung cancer. 80-85% of all lung cancer could be attributed to smoking. Other less common risk factors are exposure to second hand smoke, asbestos dust and radon gas exposure, air pollution and rarely genetic predisposition. The risk of lung cancer increases with both the number of cigarettes smoked as well as the duration of exposure to smoking.\n\nWe are all aware that prevention is better than cure; sensitizing the masses to the ill effects of smoking and the impact it causes on their physical, mental and financial health. Besides various types of cancer, smoking also increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, migraine, mental health problems etc. It is important to target the youths and adolescents as this is the age where smoking habits usually develop.\n\nSeeking professional help with counselling and medications can be really helpful in smoking cessation. Nicotine which is common component of cigarette smoke which causes physical and mental dependence is not itself a carcinogen but your cigarette smoke contains 70 other different carcinogens. Nicotine causes craving for one to smoke and eventually exposing to other carcinogens contained in smoke. There are nicotine patches and gums available to reduce the craving for smoking.\n\nSensitizing the masses about the harmful effects of second-hand smoking is also important. When a person smokes, the fumes of the smokes inhaled by the persons around them are also at increased risk. It has been shown in various studies that second hand smoking is an established risk factor for lung cancer.", "source": {"uri": "news18.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News18"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lifestyle_desk@news18.com", "name": "Lifestyle Desk", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "swati_chaturvedi@news18.com", "name": "Swati Chaturvedi", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CT_scan", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "CT scan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lung cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_smoking", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tobacco smoking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mortality rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Oncology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nodule_(medicine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nodule (medicine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cancer staging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hematology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Metastasis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Diagnosis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pediatrics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_papillomavirus_infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Human papillomavirus infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_stress", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Psychological stress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overdiagnosis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Overdiagnosis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pap_test", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pap test"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronchoscopy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bronchoscopy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonoscopy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Colonoscopy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervical_cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cervical cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionizing_radiation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ionizing radiation"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances", "wgt": 38}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances/Tobacco", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances/Tobacco", "wgt": 37}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Cancer", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Cancer", "wgt": 48}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Support_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Health/Support Groups", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Women's_Health/Smoking", "label": "dmoz/Health/Women's Health/Smoking", "wgt": 41}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2024/07/lung-cancer-day-2024-workplace-safety-2024-07-b7e133540561da32e32094ae63bc0a69-16x9.jpg?impolicy=website&width=1200&height=675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9779527", "eventUri": "eng-9779527", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.5372549019607843, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

Lung cancer accounts for 40 to 50 per cent of primary tumours in these cases,\" he added.\n\nAddressing brain metastases requires a multidisciplinary approach involving oncologists, neurologists, and palliative care specialists to meet the complex needs of patients.\n\nThe primary goals are to alleviate symptoms, extend survival, and enhance the overall quality of life through personalised treatment plans and supportive care.\n\n\"Common symptoms of brain metastases include persistent headaches, seizures, cognitive impairments, personality changes, and difficulties with motor functions or speech. These symptoms result from cancerous cells disrupting normal brain function, causing swelling, pressure, and damage to neural pathways,\" Gupta said.\n\nLung cancer that has spread to the brain can be treated via therapies such as radiation, and systemic chemotherapy. These interventions aim to manage both the primary lung cancer and brain metastases.\n\nTobacco smoking is the primary risk factor for lung cancer in India, contributing to a significant proportion of cases.\n\n\"Cigarette smoking is the leading cause of lung cancer, responsible for about 85 per cent of all cases.

This important health awareness day serves as a reminder of the ongoing battle against one of the most prevalent and deadly forms of cancer. It's a time to educate, support, and inspire action in the fight against lung cancer, which continues to be a significant global health challenge.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization, lung cancer claims more lives annually than colon, breast, and liver cancers combined. This sobering statistic underscores the critical need for increased awareness, prevention efforts, and advancements in treatment.\n\nIn the early 19th century, lung cancer was rare, affecting less than 1% to 2% of the population. By the mid-20th century, it had become the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in men in many countries. Initial theories attributed the rise to air pollution and exposure to toxic gases from World War I, but it wasn't until the 1940s and 1950s that studies definitively linked smoking to lung cancer. This recognition marked a pivotal shift in public health, prompting widespread anti-smoking campaigns and a decline in smoking rates. As our understanding evolved, we also became aware of additional risk factors, such as radon gas, asbestos, and other carcinogens.\n\nDespite advances in prevention, screening, and treatment, lung cancer remains a significant health challenge, with approximately 1.80 million deaths and 2.21 million new cases reported globally in 2020. These figures highlight the ongoing need for awareness and action. However, there is reason for hope, as countries like the United States have seen steadily declining mortality rates due to advances in treatment, increased public awareness of the dangers of smoking, and the crucial role of early detection through screening programs in improving patient outcomes.\n\nIndividuals and communities can make a significant impact on World Lung Cancer Day through several meaningful actions. The most effective way to reduce lung cancer risk is to avoid smoking and exposure to secondhand smoke. If you smoke, consider quitting and encourage others to do the same. Additionally, improving air quality in your environment, such as using air purifiers or growing air-purifying plants, can further reduce risk.\n\nEncourage high-risk individuals, including current and former smokers, those over 55, and people with known carcinogen exposure, to get screened. Early detection is crucial for significantly improving treatment outcomes and increasing survival rates. Support lung cancer research by donating to relevant organizations, participating in fundraising events, or volunteering with local cancer support groups and advocacy organizations.\n\nAs we observe World Lung Cancer Day, it's important to recognize the progress made in targeted therapies, immunotherapy, and early detection while acknowledging the ongoing need for research, prevention, and awareness. By coming together on this day, we can amplify our collective voice, support those affected by the disease, and work towards a future where lung cancer no longer poses a significant threat to global health. Let's use this day to renew our commitment to lung health and take actionable steps toward a world where everyone can breathe easier.\n\nThe writer, retired from the Health Department, Govt of Sindh, is a contributing columnist.

World Lung Cancer Day was first observed in 2012. The Forum of International Respiratory Societies (FIRS) and the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC) established this day to raise awareness on lung cancer. There are seven types of lung cancer with some being more aggressive than others.\n\nThis year, the theme for World Lung Cancer Day 2024 is \"Close the Care Gap: Everyone Deserves Access to Cancer Care\". Here is a look at some well-known celebs who battled lung cancer, and some who died because of it.\n\nMuch loved actor Sanjay Dutt was diagnosed with lung cancer in 2020. Given the kind of tribulations he has faced in his life, Sanjay Dutt faced it like a champ. He sought treatment in India and abroad. In an interview with India Today, he revealed that he told himself it was impossible that he had cancer. He underwent chemotherapy for his lung cancer, which was quite aggressive. Dr Sewanti Limaye, who treated director Rakesh Roshan for his cancer, was also Sanjay Dutt's oncologist. Dr Limaye operated upon Dutt. As reported in The Economic Times Panache, the doctor revealed that Sanjay Dutt would head to his workouts after his chemotherapy sessions. He also performed action shoots for his films with her permission, she said. Sanjay Dutt has been a survivor and been a part of several successful films since, including K.G.F: Chapter 2. He will be seen in Double iSmart next. Sanjay Dutt Turns 65: Actor Greets Fans and Receives Birthday Gifts (Watch Video).\n\nOne of the most dashing men in Indian cinema, Feroz Khan succumbed to lung cancer in 2009. The actor-filmmaker was diagnosed with the illness when he was working on Welcome 2. This was revealed by filmmaker Anees Bazmee. It seems Khan knew it was a terminal case and that he had little chance of survival. The late Feroz Khan remains one of the most stylish actors of Bollywood.\n\nAfter India's title win in the 2011 World Cup, former India national cricket team vice-captain Yuvraj Singh was diagnosed with lung cancer. The tumour was detected in his left lung, and it was mediastinal seminoma lung cancer. It was a rare form of cancer of lungs. He underwent three cycles of chemotherapy at Boston and Indianapolis in the USA. The whole nation prayed for his recovery and wellbeing. Yuvraj Singh is a cancer survivor and went on to write a book on his journey towards recovery, titled The Test of My Life: From Cricket to Cancer and Back.\n\nKannada actress, television presenter, anchor and radio jockey Aparna Vastarey passed away on July 11, 2024, due to lung cancer. She was in the fourth stage of cancer. Aparna Vastarey's voice is familiar to all Namma Metro commuters as the Kannada announcer. She was just 51 when she succumbed to the disease.\n\nThe Malayalam actor died at 35 in 2016 due to throat and lung cancer. Jishnu Raghavan had gone into remission after his initial treatment. but when it returned, it turned out to be fatal for him. In his final days, Jishnu wrote that alternative therapies are of little use in cancer cure.\n\nAmerican actor Paul Newman who was nominated for eight Oscar Awards and won once, died of lung cancer in 2008. He was 83. Some of his famous films include Cat on a Hot Tin Roof (1958), The Hustler (1961), The Verdict (1982), The Color of Money (1986), Road To Perdition (2002), and more. He was ranked in the Top 50 Hottest Men of All Time list.\n\nThe Disney pioneer gave the world so much to smile about with his unforgettable cartoon characters, shows, films, Disneyland theme parks and toys. In December 1966, Walt Disney died of a heart attack following a surgery for lung cancer. This was 10 days after his birthday on December 5.\n\nLike in all forms of cancer, early detection can make a lot of difference. In India, around 15 percent of those affected by cancer do not smoke. We hope that awareness campaigns on World Lung Cancer Day 2024 would help to save more lives in the future.", "source": {"uri": "latestly.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "LatestLY"}, "authors": [],

In India, it accounts for 6.9% of all new instances of cancer.\n\nLung cancer is one of the most prevalent malignancies and a major contributor to cancer-related fatalities worldwide. Worldwide, lung cancer stands as the second most common cancer and is responsible for a significant number of lives lost every year. It accounts for 6.9% of all new instances of cancer in India and 9.3% of all cancer-related fatalities in people of both sexes.\n\nThe tissues of the lungs, namely the cells lining the airways, are the source of lung cancer. Uncontrolled growth of these cells damages lung tissue and may impair lung function. Unfortunately, only 15% of instances of lung cancer are discovered early, and symptoms usually manifest at severe stages.\n\nThere is a significant chance that lung cancer will spread to other areas of your body, including the brain, if it is not detected early. Brain metastases, sometimes known as brain mets, is when the cancer cells spread to the brain. This may result in the formation of one or more brain tumors, which may cause severe symptoms including headaches, seizures, impaired speech, and blurred vision. Although brain mets are widespread in many other cancers, they are most common in lung cancer occuring in around 50% of lung cancer patients.\n\nLung cancer cells can spread to other areas of the body, including the brain, if the disease goes undetected in the initial stages. Actually, lung cancer is the initial cause of most brain mets. What connection exists? It is not entirely understood by experts.\n\nAccording to several recent studies on mice, lung cancer cells swiftly form blood vessel branches when they reach the brain. They now have the blood supplies they need to thrive and proliferate. Research suggests that nicotine from cigarette smoke may be one of the reasons, however, further research is required in this regard.\n\nSmall-cell lung cancer (SCLC) is the type of lung cancer that has the highest risk of brain metastases. Particular types of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that result from modifications to particular genes, such as EGFR-positive lung cancer, can also induce brain metastases. Others being those with NSCLC (ROS1) and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) and positivity.\n\nRoughly 50 60% of patients with lung cancer that is EGFR- or ALK-positive go on to develop brain metastases. Why does this occur? Scientists are not sure. However, NSCLC patients typically live for a few of years following their diagnosis. This might give the disease additional time to travel to the brain, according to experts. According to certain beliefs, targeted therapy for lung cancer may not adequately target brain tumors. Alternatively, these cancer cells with mutations may be genetically predisposed to brain metastases.\n\nBrain mets that form inside the brain matter are the most prevalent. However, malignancy has the potential to spread to the fluid around your brain. Termed as Leptomeningeal disease (LMD).\n\nBrain tumors can impact brain regions that govern speech, motor skills, hearing, balance, and memory; thus, rehabilitation may be necessary as part of your recovery process following treatment. This can involve treatments including speech, occupational, and physical therapy. In the event that available treatment choices are insufficient to fight the cancer, your physician may recommend palliative and/or hospice care. These therapies assist you and your loved ones have a better quality of life while you have advanced lung cancer and brain mets.

Chronic exposure to these pollutants can lead to mutations in lung cells and ultimately cancer. The risk is significant even for non-smokers who breathe polluted air every day, the doctors said.\n\nApart from genetic factors, several occupations in India expose workers to substances that cause lung cancer. Workers in mining, construction and certain manufacturing industries are at higher risk.\n\nVinayak Maka, head of medical oncology at Ramaiah Memorial Hospital, said lung cancer among non-smokers is an alarming trend. \"Passive smoking remains a major risk factor and many non-smokers inhale the smoke around them, increasing their risk of developing lung cancer,\" he said.\n\n\"Apart from air pollution, occupational exposure to carcinogens such as asbestos, radon and certain chemicals further increase the risk among non-smokers. Genetic predisposition is also an important factor. Some people may be susceptible to lung cancer due to genetic mutations despite never having smoked. In addition, lifestyle factors such as diet and physical activity, as well as underlying conditions such as chronic lung disease, can also affect cancer risk,\" he pointed out.\n\nNiti Raizada, senior director, medical oncology and haematology-oncology, Fortis Hospital, Bengaluru, said the health effects of smoke are far more far-reaching than the act of smoking itself.\n\n\"It is widely known that lighting a cigarette is dangerous, but many people are unaware of the dangerous hazards that linger in the smoke that lingers long after the cigarette has been extinguished. Understanding the risks associated with direct, passive and even thirdhand smoke is essential to understanding the full extent of the lung cancer threat and protecting our health from this deadly disease,\" she said.\n\nPassive smoking, or active smoking, is inhaling smoke directly from a cigarette, cigar or pipe. This type of smoke contains thousands of harmful chemicals, many of which are known carcinogens. The risks associated with passive smoking - direct lung damage and significant cancer risk - are well documented. Beyond cancer, smoking is a leading cause of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), heart disease and stroke, affecting overall health and quality of life, she said.\n\nDr Raizada said there was a hidden danger in secondhand or passive smoke, saying: \"Smoke that non-smokers inhale from the end of a lit cigarette or a smoker's exhaled breath poses serious health risks even without direct contact.\"\n\nChildren and pregnant women are especially at risk. In children, secondhand smoke can cause respiratory infections, asthma and developmental problems. Pregnant women exposed to secondhand smoke are at higher risk of low birth weight and premature birth. Additionally, because secondhand smoke floats in the air and settles on surfaces, it can pose an ongoing health risk in enclosed spaces, she explained.\n\nThird-hand smoke refers to residues of nicotine and other toxic chemicals that remain on indoor surfaces long after a person has stopped smoking. \"Third-hand smoke residue can get on walls, furniture and clothing. Children and pets who come into contact with contaminated surfaces can ingest or inhale the harmful substances, putting them at increased risk of health problems,\" the doctor said.\n\n\"Furthermore, thirdhand smoke residues can interact with other indoor pollutants to produce even more harmful compounds, which can exacerbate health risks, especially in environments where smoking is a common occurrence. Even if you have never smoked or been exposed to secondhand smoke, living in an environment with thirdhand smoke pollution can pose health risks, especially over the long term,\" she explained.\n\nSymptoms of lung cancer include a cough (often bloody), chest pain, wheezing, and weight loss. These symptoms often do not appear until the cancer is advanced. Treatment options vary but may include surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, targeted drug therapy, and immunotherapy.\n\nDoctors say the most effective way to reduce the risk of lung cancer is to avoid smoking and limit exposure to secondhand smoke. Additionally, maintaining a smoke-free environment and reducing exposure to residual smoke are also essential preventative measures.\n\nA multifaceted approach is now required to effectively tackle lung cancer. The general public needs to be educated about the risk factors, symptoms and importance of early detection of lung cancer through intensive public and social media campaigns, the doctors added.", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_smoking", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Passive smoking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen_dioxide", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nitrogen dioxide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lung cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_pollution", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Air pollution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particulates", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Particulates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Smoking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollutant", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pollutant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Risk factor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mutation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cigarette", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cigarette"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Oncology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carcinogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Genetics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chemical substance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inflammation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mortality rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mining", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mining"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Cardiovascular_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Cardiovascular Disorders", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances/Tobacco", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances/Tobacco", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Wounds_and_Injuries", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Wounds and Injuries", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Women's_Health/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Women's Health/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://th-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/x3pmrl/article68469792.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/IMG_iStock-1341427905_2_1_ROC208EK.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9779527", "eventUri": "eng-9779527", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.584313725490196, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

As per the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) even in India, the cases of lung cancer are increasing rapidly and are the cause of 10% cancer deaths. As a result, World Lung Cancer Day is observed worldwide every year on August 1, to raise awareness and highlight the importance of early detection. Let's take a look at these 6 surprising signs of lung cancer that don't involve your lungs.\n\nOfficially termed 'Finger Clubbing', it happens when an underlying disease changes the appearance, shape or size of your fingertips and the area surrounding your nails. According to a study, sometimes conditions linked to lung health can increase the flow of blood to your fingertips making them appear larger.\n\nsfwio.com/Pinterest\n\nPersistent shoulder pain that worsens when you are breathing deeply or coughing is often linked to diseases involving the lungs. Also, a rare type of lung cancer called Pancoast tumour causes your shoulder, back and arms to hurt instead of affecting the respiratory system because it grows in the upper part of the lung and spreads to your ribs, vertebrae in your spine, nerves, and blood vessels.\n\nA sudden and significant change in vision or persistent pain around an eye is an indicator that the lung cancer has metastasized or spread to the area behind the eye. According to a 2014 research study, in several cases, this change was the first sign symptom which led to the diagnosis of the underlying lung cancer.\n\nmedicalnewstoday.com/Pinterest\n\nIn some cases, a puffy face, especially in the morning, can be a sign of Superior Vena Cava Syndrome resulting from partial or complete obstruction of blood flow from the upper body to the heart which indicates a tumour near the vein in the lung.\n\nIn cases when a tumour presses on nerves controlling the voice box, it can bring about a change in your voice. Additionally, most lung cancer patients complain of hoarseness with a significant number of them reporting having perpetual difficulty in speaking.\n\ngethealthyu.com/Pinterest\n\nAs per WebMD, small-cell lung cancer can sometimes lead to your own immune system attacking you. This can adversely affect your muscles and you can have difficulty standing after you've been sitting or you may feel off-balance or unsteady when you do so. Further, if you have a tumour crowding the superior vena cava, a vein responsible for the flow of blood from head to your heart, in the upper right lung it can make you feel dizzy.\n\nWhile early detection of lung cancer is paramount, its prevention is equally important. Avoiding smoking as well as secondhand smoke, using protective face masks in times of excessive air pollution, staying up-to-date with health checkups, exercising regularly and generally taking care of overall health are just some of the ways people can protect their lungs.\n\nAlso Read: 6 reasons why you should stop walking barefoot at home right now", "source": {"uri": "indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "IndiaTimes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lung cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nail_clubbing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nail clubbing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Council_of_Medical_Research", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indian Council of Medical Research"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Neoplasm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebra", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vertebra"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_column", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vertebral column"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nail_(anatomy)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nail (anatomy)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Metastasis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Blood vessel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nerve", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nerve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Diagnosis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rib", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rib"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cough", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cough"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Respiratory system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venae_cavae", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Venae cavae"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superior_vena_cava", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Superior vena cava"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small-cell_carcinoma", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Small-cell carcinoma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_smoking", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Passive smoking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebMD", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "WebMD"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Cardiovascular_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Cardiovascular Disorders", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://im.indiatimes.in/content/template/share/639135.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9779527", "eventUri": "eng-9779527", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-01", "textStart": 58, "textEnd": 66, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.3960784313725491, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

According to Global Cancer Observatory, lung cancer accounted for 20,963 deaths and has become the second most common cancer in terms of incidence with other 23,700 new cases in 2022.\n\nLung cancer's high mortality rate and low survival rate, both mainly determined by the stage at diagnosis, is a challenge to Filipino patients, having low access for early screening. In fact, 60 percent of lung cases are already in the advanced setting, significantly decreasing the five-year survival to 2.9 percent.\n\nThe earlier the disease gets diagnosed, the better the survival rate becomes, with stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) having a five-year survival rate ranging from 13 to 36 percent while in stage 1 NSCLC, it can be as high as 68 to 92 percent.\n\n\"That is the reason why we are pushing for this 'Lung Ambition Alliance.' It is an alliance to move the needle in terms of driving a stage shift in early diagnosis in lung cancer but also working through the whole ecosystem to make sure that the patients are guided from awareness, screening, diagnosis up to treatment,\" Ramin said.\n\nGlobal coalition\n\nThe Lung Ambition Alliance is a global coalition with the bold ambition to eliminate lung cancer as a cause of death. By building a network of partners across various health sectors, the alliance aims to accelerate progress in lung cancer survival rates and outcomes. The alliance represents patient groups, scientific and medical communities and industry, bringing knowledge and skills together to help reach this bold ambition.\n\n\"This is a huge feat and we believe that not one organization can do this alone. AstraZeneca started this project tin the Philippines more than three years ago and we have activated multiple partners including laboratories, private and public hospitals and even with a party list,\" Ramin said.\n\n\"In line with our bold ambition to eliminate lung cancer as a cause of death, AstraZenca is committed to creating value for Filipinos beyond the impact of our life-changing medicines through early detection, education, and treatment. With our partners in the alliance, we pledge to screen at least one million Filipino patients by 2026 for lung cancer, enabling early intervention that will change disease trajectory of lung cancer in the Philippines,\" Ramin added.\n\nBenefit to patient\n\nPaolo Borromeo, President and CEO of AC Health, underscored that ultimately, it is the patient who benefit when innovation comes to healthcare.\n\n\"AC Medical Network and Healthway Cancer Care Hospital continue to deliver the best value oncology services because we work with some of the best partners all over the world, AstraZeneca being one of them,\" he said.\n\nAstra Zeneca have partnered with Qure.AI to bring qXR, an AI solution, a triaging tool for lung cancer screening to the Healthway Cancer Care Hospital in Taguig and Healthway Qualimed Hospital in Sta. Rosa, Laguna. Through qXR, Filipino patients get a means to avail themselves of early lung screening backed by the efficiency of artificial intelligence.\n\nQure.AI's qXR is a world's most widely used AI for chest screenings using a simple chest X-ray. It is a triaging tool designed to improve diagnosis, promote better efficiencies on who should be screened with low dose computed tomography (LDCT) scan, and boost optimal management of patients with lung cancer. This breakthrough technology can provide physicians with pre-read assistance in as fast as 20 seconds. The scans made via qXR can get findings on the lungs, heart, diaphragm and bones.\n\nCost-effective\n\nThe use of LDCT Is established to be cost-effective and has demonstrated a 20 percent reduction in lung cancer mortality due to diagnosis at earlier stages of the disease. However, this is not widely implemented in routine lung cancer screening due to limited access.\n\nThe integration of AI-supported chest X-rays with LDCT would further improve cost- efficiencies and enable more opportunities for routine lung cancer screenings and early detection for lung cancer.\n\n\"We are looking at this collaboration as a bright spot in shoring up our ecosystem.

(Image: Canva)\n\nSmoking is frequently linked to lung cancer and remains the primary cause of this illness. However, it's important to remember that lung cancer can also strike non-smokers. In people who have never smoked, lung cancer can be caused by various factors, including exposure to radon, second hand smoke, air pollution, and occupational risks such as asbestos and diesel exhaust. Furthermore, some cases of lung cancer occur in individuals with no known risk factors; these cases may be caused by unknown factors or sporadic genetic abnormalities.\n\nAdopting safety precautions and being aware of the risks non-smokers encounter can help lower the incidence of lung cancer in this demographic, says Dr Kuldeep Kumar Grover, head of critical care and pulmonology at CK Birla Hospital, Gurgaon. Several environmental and genetic factors, including smoke, have been linked to lung cancer in non-smokers. According to Dr Grover, these are some of the factors that can influence the chances of having lung cancer:\n\nRadon exposure: Radon is a radioactive gas that occurs naturally and can build up in homes and buildings, increasing the risk of lung cancer.\n\nSecond hand smoke: Lung cancer can result from breathing in smoke from the cigarettes of others.\n\nAir pollution: Over time, lung tissue can be harmed by fine particulate matter and other air pollutants.\n\nWorkplace exposures: Workers exposed to industrial chemicals, diesel exhaust, asbestos, and other substances may develop lung cancer.\n\nLung cancer in non-smokers can sometimes be caused by inherited gene alterations (germline mutations) or by spontaneous genetic mutations that increase a person's susceptibility to the disease. The symptoms of lung cancer, similar in both smokers and non-smokers, include:\n\nContinuous coughing: A persistent cough that worsens over time.\n\nBlood in sputum: The discharge of mucus from the lungs that contains blood.\n\nNon-smokers may be more likely to attribute these symptoms to other conditions, potentially delaying diagnosis until the disease is at a more advanced stage.Treatment regimens for non-smokers with lung cancer can be tailored based on the distinct genetic alterations present in their tumours compared to smokers. Both smokers and non-smokers often receive the same lung cancer treatment, which may include:\n\nRadiation therapy: Targeting and eliminating cancer cells using high-energy radiation.\n\nTargeted therapy: Medications designed to target specific genetic alterations in cancerous cells.\n\nNon-smokers should adopt these following safety measures to reduce their risk of lung cancer:\n\nAvoid secondhand smoke: Stay away from areas where people smoke.\n\nReduce exposure to air pollution: Avoid high-pollution areas and use air filters at home.\n\nMinimise occupational hazards: Follow safety precautions to reduce exposure to chemicals, diesel exhaust, and asbestos.\n\nTest for radon: Ensure your home is tested for radon and take remedial action if necessary.\n\nMaintain a healthy lifestyle: Eating a balanced diet and exercising regularly can improve overall health and lower cancer risk.\n\nMonitor family history: Inform your doctor of any family history of lung cancer to determine appropriate screening measures.", "source": {"uri": "moneycontrol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MoneyControl"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lung cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Radon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_pollution", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Air pollution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Smoking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_smoking", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Passive smoking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pulmonology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diesel_exhaust", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Diesel exhaust"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asbestos", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Asbestos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Risk factor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Genetic disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_care_medicine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Intensive care medicine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mutation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Genetics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chemical industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cigarette", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cigarette"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particulates", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Particulates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioactive_decay", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Radioactive decay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cough", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cough"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Blood_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Blood Disorders", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Cardiovascular_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Cardiovascular Disorders", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Nutritional_and_Metabolic_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Nutritional and Metabolic Disorders", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://images.moneycontrol.com/static-mcnews/2024/08/20240801061840_smoking.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9779527", "eventUri": "eng-9779527", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.4980392156862745, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

It is frequently misunderstood as a disease that only affects smokers. However, approximately 50% of lung cancer cases occur in non-smokers. Recognising this reality is crucial for early detection and effective treatment shared by Dr Aravind Badiger Technical Director BDR Pharmaceuticals.\n\nSpotting lung cancer early can significantly enhance treatment success and survival rates. By staying informed about the symptoms, seeking timely diagnostic tests, and adopting preventive measures, individuals can take proactive steps toward managing lung cancer. With advancements in medical technology and early detection methods, there is hope for more effective treatments and better health outcomes.\n\nEarly detection is vital in improving survival rates for lung cancer. Awareness of the symptoms can lead to timely medical intervention. Common signs to watch for include:\n\n* Persistent Cough: A cough that lingers or worsens over time could be a warning sign.\n\n* Chest Pain: Persistent or worsening chest pain should not be ignored.\n\n* Shortness of Breath: Difficulty in breathing, especially with minimal exertion, might indicate lung issues.\n\n* Unexplained Weight Loss: Losing weight without a known cause can be a symptom of lung cancer.\n\n* Coughing Up Blood: Hemoptysis, or coughing up blood, is a serious symptom that requires immediate medical attention.\n\nIf you notice any of these symptoms, seeking medical advice promptly is crucial. Early diagnosis improves treatment options and outcomes. Diagnostic methods include:\n\n* HRCT (High-Resolution Computed Tomography): HRCT is particularly effective for early detection, especially for individuals with a persistent cough lasting more than two to three weeks.\n\n* Chest X-ray: This initial imaging test helps identify abnormalities in the lungs.\n\n* Biopsy: A biopsy involves taking a sample of lung tissue to confirm the presence of cancer cells.\n\nThe treatment for lung cancer depends on various factors, including the stage and type of cancer. Common treatment methods include:\n\n* Surgery: Removing the tumor and surrounding tissue is often a viable option for early-stage cancer.\n\n* Chemotherapy: This involves using drugs to kill or halt the growth of cancer cells.\n\n* Radiation Therapy: High-energy rays target and destroy cancer cells.\n\n* Targeted Therapy: These drugs specifically target molecules involved in cancer growth.\n\n* Immunotherapy: This treatment enhances the body's immune response to fight cancer.\n\nPreventing lung cancer involves reducing risk factors and embracing a healthy lifestyle. Key preventive strategies include:\n\n* Avoiding Tobacco: Whether smoking or chewing tobacco, avoiding these habits is crucial for lung health.\n\n* Maintaining a Healthy Diet: A diet rich in fruits and vegetables supports overall lung health.\n\n* Engaging in Regular Exercise: Physical activity can reduce cancer risk and improve overall well-being.\n\n* Improving Air Quality: Minimize exposure to environmental and indoor pollutants, such as radon, to protect lung health.", "source": {"uri": "zeenews.india.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Zee News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lung cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cough", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cough"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medication", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Medication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoptysis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hemoptysis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chest_pain", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chest pain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_test", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Medical test"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_stigma", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social stigma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Smoking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CT_scan", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CT scan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortness_of_breath", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shortness of breath"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-resolution_computed_tomography", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "High-resolution computed tomography"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Biopsy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Diagnosis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_loss", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Weight loss"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_response", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Immune response"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parenchyma", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Parenchyma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chewing_tobacco", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chewing tobacco"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chest_radiograph", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chest radiograph"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollutant", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pollutant"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Cardiovascular_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Cardiovascular Disorders", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Cancer", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Cancer", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Men's_Health/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Men's Health/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://english.cdn.zeenews.com/sites/default/files/2024/08/01/1456487-image-7.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9779527", "eventUri": "eng-9779527", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1686274509803921, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

It is observed on August 1st every year, and the day serves as a reminder of the devastating impact lung cancer has on individuals and their families, and the urgent need to combat this disease.\n\nLung cancer is a disease when cells in the lungs begin to grow rapidly into tumours. In India, according to a study, irrespective of gender, the number of people affected by lung cancer is 72, 510 and men are largely susceptible to the disease.\n\nWhen we spoke to Dr Indranil Banerjee MBBS, MD, DNB, DAA Consultant Pulmonary, Critical Care, Allergy & Sleep, Apollo Spectra Hospitals, about the causes of lung cancer in non-smokers, he said that secondhand smoke; for a non-smoker, when a person is exposed to the cigarette smoke of the other person in the same environment, chances of developing lung cancer are high. Exposure to certain chemicals asbestos, and arsenic. Prolonged exposure to air pollutants particles in the environment such as nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and higher rates of carbon dioxide, all may cause respiratory diseases. These pollutants can also alter the airway cells in the body and can trigger lung cancer.\n\nRadon is a natural radioactive gas that has no color or and smell, is primarily produced by the decay of uranium in soil, rocks, and water. It can seep into buildings through cracks, and walls and get accumulate in basements. Radon quickly gets attached to dust enters the human body while inhaling and gets deposited in the lungs.\n\nAnother cause of lung cancer in non-smokers is genetic factors and family history. Not all respiratory problems lead to lung cancer, based on the severity of the condition lung cancer can be detected. Symptoms of lung cancer are change in voice, frequent chest infections(bronchitis or pneumonia), coughing blood, shortness of breath, wheezing, and bone fracture.\n\nThe doctor conducts physical tests such as abnormal breath sounds or enlarged lymph nodes. CT scan or chest X-ray helps in identifying the enlarged or abnormal masses in the lungs. In PET scans a radioactive sugar molecule is used to detect the cancer cells.\n\nTreatment varies on the type of cancer detected. Surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy where high energy beams are used to treat early to advanced cancer. In immunotherapy treatment, certain drugs are suggested that help the body's immune system recognize and attack cancer cells.", "source": {"uri": "indiatvnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "India TV News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lung cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Neoplasm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_smoke", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tobacco smoke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_tract", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Respiratory tract"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_smoking", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Passive smoking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollutant", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pollutant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen_dioxide", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nitrogen dioxide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfur_dioxide", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sulfur dioxide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asbestos", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Asbestos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Radon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_care_medicine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Intensive care medicine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Respiratory disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_pollution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Air pollution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arsenic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carbon dioxide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chemical substance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioactive_decay", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Radioactive decay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Allergy"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Blood_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Blood Disorders", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Cancer", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Cancer", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Women's_Health/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Women's Health/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://resize.indiatvnews.com/en/resize/newbucket/1200_-/2024/08/lung-cancer-in-non-smokers-1722492645.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9779527", "eventUri": "eng-9779527", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-01", "textStart": 180, "textEnd": 190}], "sentiment": -0.4588235294117647, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

Despite significant medical advancements, the disease continues to present major challenges. Understanding the complexities of lung cancer, particularly the role of tobacco usage patterns and the need for early detection, is crucial in addressing this persistent health issue.\n\nWhen we spoke to Dr Sanjay Deshmukh, Director, of Surgical Oncology, at Ruby Hall Clinic, regarding lung cancer, he said one of the major barriers to effective lung cancer management is the widespread stigma associated with the disease. There is a prevailing misconception that lung cancer primarily affects smokers, overshadowing the fact that nearly 50% of lung cancer cases occur in non-smokers. This misunderstanding can delay diagnosis and treatment, particularly in regions where tobacco is consumed in forms other than smoking, such as chewing.\n\nIn countries like India, tobacco usage is often through chewing rather than smoking. This cultural pattern means that many individuals who might be at risk for lung cancer do not fit the typical profile of a smoker. As a result, the focus on smoking as the primary risk factor can lead to a delay in diagnosis for those who chew tobacco or do not smoke at all. The lack of awareness about the broader risk factors for lung cancer can further contribute to late-stage diagnoses.\n\nLate diagnosis is a significant challenge in managing lung cancer. Symptoms such as a persistent cough, chest pain, and shortness of breath are often mistaken for less severe illnesses, leading to delays in seeking medical care. Early detection is key to improving outcomes, and HRCT (High-Resolution Computed Tomography) of the thorax has proven to be an effective diagnostic tool. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the increased use of HRCT led to a notable rise in early lung cancer detections, demonstrating its importance in identifying the disease at a more treatable stage.\n\nTo address the challenges of late diagnosis, implementing a population-based screening program is essential. Low-dose HRCT thorax screenings should be made available to high-risk groups, including individuals with a history of tobacco use (both smoking and chewing), those exposed to environmental pollutants, and people experiencing a persistent cough lasting more than two to three weeks. This approach would enhance early detection, allowing for timely intervention and potentially improving survival rates.\n\nLung cancer remains a leading global health challenge, exacerbated by stigma, misconceptions, and the difficulties associated with late-stage diagnosis. By broadening our understanding of risk factors, including the role of tobacco chewing and environmental exposures, and implementing effective early detection strategies such as low-dose HRCT screenings, we can make significant strides in reducing the impact of lung cancer.", "source": {"uri": "indiatvnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "India TV News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lung cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Diagnosis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Smoking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tobacco"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_stigma", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Social stigma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Risk factor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oncology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-resolution_computed_tomography", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "High-resolution computed tomography"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorax", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thorax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chest_pain", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chest pain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_smoking", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tobacco smoking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cough", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cough"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CT_scan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CT scan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortness_of_breath", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shortness of breath"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollution", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pollution"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances", "wgt": 35}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances/Tobacco", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances/Tobacco", "wgt": 34}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Cancer", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Cancer", "wgt": 42}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Women's_Health/Smoking", "label": "dmoz/Health/Women's Health/Smoking", "wgt": 36}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://resize.indiatvnews.com/en/resize/newbucket/1200_-/2024/07/world-lung-cancer-day-1722431234.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9779527", "eventUri": "eng-9779527", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.5137254901960784, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

Kim has also spoken about what to do if your doctor has missed your symptoms.\n\nKim said: \"Red flag symptoms include a persistent cough that can deteriorate, coughing up blood and chest pain that is worse with deep breathing, coughing or laughing. A loss of appetite, weight loss that cannot be explained and fatigue are also key signs of lung cancer. Watch out for hoarseness, breathlessness, a new onset of wheezing and infections such as bronchitis and pneumonia that are persistent.\"\n\nKim said: \"If you visit your GP with symptoms suggestive of lung cancer, a GP should examine you and ask you to breathe into a device called a spirometer, which measures how much air you breathe in and out. A blood test might be requested to rule out some of the possible causes of your symptoms. The main test to diagnose lung cancer is a chest X-ray. A CT scan will also be advised as well as a PET-CT scan.\"\n\nKim said: \"More than half of people diagnosed with lung cancer will die within one year of diagnosis, even with treatment. Obviously, the sooner lung cancer is detected, the greater chance you have of survival. However, it all depends on the staging of the lung cancer and the health of the person overall.\"\n\nKim said: \"A person has three years from their date of knowledge to bring a claim before the Court. In order to establish negligence, a person must prove that there has been a breach of duty of care and as a result, causation has arisen i.e. a person has suffered injury as a direct result of negligence. It can be difficult to be successful in a claim for negligence in cancer cases, particularly when proving causation.

According to studies, a sizable portion of patients with lung cancer stated that their chronic cough was one of their first symptoms.\n\nKey characteristics of a cough potentially linked to lung cancer include:\n\nIt's important to keep in mind that lung cancer can only be diagnosed by a medical specialist. A chronic cough must be evaluated in combination with other symptoms and circumstances.\n\nAlthough anyone can get lung cancer, certain people are more likely to have it than others. Among them are:\n\nSmoking is a contributing factor in the vast majority of lung cancer cases. Your risk increases with the amount and duration of your smoking.\n\nThe risk of lung cancer lasts for a long time even after stopping.\n\nCohabiting with a smoker raises your risk considerably.\n\nThere is a higher risk for those who work in industries where radon, asbestos, or other carcinogens are present.\n\nYour risk may be somewhat elevated if you have a close family who has lung cancer.\n\nDiagnosing lung cancer involves several steps:\n\nThe treatment for lung cancer depends on the type, stage, and overall health of the patient. Common treatments include:\n\nYou should see a doctor if your cough does not get better after a few weeks, especially if it is accompanied by additional symptoms like chest discomfort, shortness of breath, or blood in the cough.

He's president and CEO of the American Lung Association (ALA), which conducted the 2024 Lung Health Barometer survey.\n\nGetting a tumor detected via an annual CT lung scan raises the odds of five-year survival from stage 1 to 4 lung cancer by 63%, according to the ALA.\n\nUnder current American Cancer Society guidelines, yearly lung cancer screening with a low-dose CT scan is currently recommended for all people aged 50 to 80 who smoke or used to smoke, and who have at least a 20 pack-year history of smoking (meaning a pack of cigarettes smoked per day for 20 years).\n\nThe new ALA survey canvassed 4,000 people across the United States about their knowledge of lung health and lung cancer.\n\nOnly 38% of respondents knew that CT scans were now an available screening option for folks at high risk for lung cancer.\n\nStill, even that number is an increase from prior years, Wimmer noted.\n\n\"Compared to our 2022 Lung Health Barometer, we saw a 27% increase in awareness of lung cancer screening,\" he said in an ALA news release.\n\nIn other findings:\n\n\"The American Lung Association's new survey provides a critical look at public awareness and attitudes regarding lung cancer, which is the leading cause of cancer deaths in the U.S.,\" Wimmer said.\n\nMore information\n\nFind out more about lung cancer screening guidelines from another respected group, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force.\n\nSOURCE: American Lung Association, news release, Aug. 1, 2024", "source": {"uri": "healthday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "healthday.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ernie_mundell@healthday.com", "name": "Ernie Mundell", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CT_scan", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "CT scan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lung cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_cancer_screening", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lung cancer screening"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Smoking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five-year_survival_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Five-year survival rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Lung_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American Lung Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Cancer_Society", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American Cancer Society"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cigarette", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cigarette"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Neoplasm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Preventive_Services_Task_Force", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Preventive Services Task Force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances/Tobacco", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances/Tobacco", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Cancer", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Cancer", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 72}], "image": "https://media.assettype.com/healthday-en%2F2024-07-31%2F146li460%2FAdobeStock_390810564%20(1).jpeg?w=1200&ar=40%3A21&auto=format%2Ccompress&ogImage=true&mode=crop&enlarge=true&overlay=false&overlay_position=bottom&overlay_width=100", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9779527", "eventUri": "eng-9779527", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.4431372549019608, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

Dr Smitha Saldanha, senior medical oncologist at HCG Hospitals, says cases like Seema's whose lung cancer was in an advanced stage when diagnosed, are increasingly common.\n\n\"In recent years, we have seen a rise in younger women with lung cancer. More than 60% of the cases are in advanced stages -- III or IV. Lung cancer, once predominantly seen in individuals over 50 years of age, now affects patients in their 20s through 40s,\" Dr Saldahna says.Doctors who had earlier seen women from rural areas suffer lung cancer because of use of biofuel for cooking, have been treating urban women and youngsters with advanced stages of the cancer over the past decade.\n\nDr Radheshyam Naik, consultant medical oncologist and hematologist at Sammprada Multi-Speciality Hospital, and his colleagues agree that there is a delay in diagnosing lung cancer. \"In India, we have to unfortunately address TB, which is more rampant. Its features overlap a lot with lung cancer. By the time patients reach the oncologist, the cancer would have progressed,\" he says.Patients with symptoms such as blood in sputum, chest pain, significant weight loss, persistent cough, headache and blurred vision, are seeking treatment only in the later stages of lung cancer, doctors say.\n\nDr Mangesh P Kamath, additional director of medical oncology at Fortis Hospital, Cunningham Road, also reports a higher incidence of lung cancer in individuals aged 20 to 40. \"Factors contributing to this trend include smoking during college days, e-cigarette use (perceived as a safer alternative), high levels of air pollution, and indoor pollution.\"\"In urban environments, apartments often suffer from inadequate ventilation, leading to poor indoor air quality.\n\nConstruction dust, cooking stove emissions and moisture in walls causing fungal infections contribute to this problem. Exposure to organic chemicals can also damage DNA and increase cancer risk,\" he notes.Dr Naik emphasizes that smoking, including use of cigarettes and beedis, remains a significant risk factor in the city. \"Second-hand smoke exposure also contributes to lung cancer cases,\" he adds.\"High levels of air pollution, driven by rapid urban growth and traffic congestion, are a major concern.\n\nThis pollution is associated with respiratory diseases and lung cancer. A significant issue is lack of early screening,\" he says. Doctors, however, agree that advancements in diagnostic tools and treatment -- targeted therapy, immunotherapy and minimally invasive surgical techniques -- have improved survival rates, extending lifespans from a few months to approximately five years.", "source": {"uri": "timesofindia.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Times of India"}, "authors": [{"uri": "pearl_d_souza@timesofindia.indiatimes.com", "name": "Pearl D'souza", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lung cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Oncology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headache", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Headache"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_loss", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Weight loss"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortness_of_breath", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shortness of breath"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_chorionic_gonadotropin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Human chorionic gonadotropin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenocarcinoma", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Adenocarcinoma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palliative_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palliative care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Neoplasm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syncope_(medicine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Syncope (medicine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Smoking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Magnetic resonance imaging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chemotherapy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_tumor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brain tumor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blurred_vision", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Blurred vision"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sputum", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sputum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chest_pain", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chest pain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hematology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tuberculosis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Cancer", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Cancer", "wgt": 42}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Support_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Health/Support Groups", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Support_Groups/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Support Groups/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Women's_Health/Smoking", "label": "dmoz/Health/Women's Health/Smoking", "wgt": 33}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9779527", "eventUri": "eng-9779527", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.4352941176470588, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

James Cancer Hospital and Richard J. Solove Research Institute (OSUCCC - James) and College of Public Health. These findings were consistent across gender and race.\n\nThis is the first study to provide evidence that smoking in combination with vaping increases the risk for cancer compared to smoking alone. Researchers reported their findings in the Journal of Oncology Research and Therapy.\n\nStudy design and methods\n\nLung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, resulting in 1.8 million deaths in 2020 alone. The American Thoracic Society has found that about 87% of these cancers can be directly linked to persistent tobacco smoking.\n\nFor this case-control study, researchers analyzed cigarette smoking and use of electronic cigarettes (also known as vaping) in 4,975 people with lung cancer compared to a control group of 27,294 people without cancer. All study subjects were from the same general geographic location (treated in Columbus, Ohio) and had the same distribution of age, gender and race.\n\nResearchers found that vaping combined with cigarette smoking was eight times more common in people with lung cancer compared to the control group of people without lung cancer. In addition, the data showed that the risk of developing lung cancer was four times higher among people who combined vaping and smoking compared to those who only smoked.\n\n\"Our findings provide the first evidence that smoking in combination with vaping significantly increases the risk of lung cancer compared to smoking alone. Most people know that tobacco smoke contains cancer-causing chemicals but, overall, there is less knowledge about the chemicals that are inhaled through vape vapors,\" said Randall Harris, MD, PhD, corresponding author of the study and professor of epidemiology in the College of Public Health.\n\nResearchers say it is critical that regulators consider these additional health exposures in their regulation of the tobacco product industry to further protect public health, particularly when it comes to inhaled flavorings and nicotine dose concentrations.\n\n\"From a public health perspective, we have always been concerned about dual-use of both traditional and e-cig products. This study presents clear evidence showing that vaping in addition to smoking can increase your risk for lung cancer. This is especially concerning given the rate of youth and young adults using these products,\" said lead author Marisa Bittoni, PhD, a researcher in the medical oncology division in the College of Medicine. \"More research about the health effects of alternative tobacco products is critically needed to put science behind the regulation of the tobacco industry.\"\n\nThis study was supported by a grant from the National Cancer Institute and the Richard B. Early Cancer Research Fund at The Ohio State University College of Public Health. David Carbone, MD, PhD, professor and director of the Thoracic Oncology Center at the OSUCCC - James, is also a coauthor.\n\nTobacco research at Ohio State\n\nThe OSUCCC - James is home to the Center for Tobacco Research, which brings together tobacco researchers from across the colleges of medicine, public health, law and nursing as well as the Ohio State Wexner Medical Center and the Comprehensive Cancer Center to conduct research on tobacco product use, regulation and health impact. The center is funded by the National Institutes of Health to provide critical research to inform the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's evidence-based regulation of tobacco products through a Tobacco Center of Regulatory Science (TCORS) grant.\n\nTo learn more about research at the OSUCCC - James, visit cancer.osu.edu.\n\n/Public Release.

The report, titled Empowering Asian Lung Cancer Advocates, draws on global best practices as well as insights from the Hopeful Voices Patient Advocate Roundtable Meeting, hosted by Lung Cancer Education and Advocacy for Patients (LEAP) and the Lung Cancer Consortium Singapore (LCCS) in late 2023.\n\nDuring roundtable discussions attended by lung cancer patients and their families, several key priorities in the lung cancer care continuum were identified:\n\n1. Increasing the influence of patient advocates in decision-making and healthcare service development\n\n2. Improving early-stage lung cancer diagnoses by raising awareness or improving access to early screening.\n\n3. Improving access to innovative treatments and diagnostics.\n\nLung cancer remains the most frequently diagnosed cancer worldwide, representing about 12.4% of all cases in 2022. It is the primary cause of cancer-related deaths globally, with over 1.8 million fatalities annually. In Singapore, it is the third most common cancer and leading cause of cancer deaths. With ageing populations in Asia, more people are expected to be diagnosed with cancer. Inevitably, they and their caregivers, as well as their healthcare teams may encounter challenges across the cancer care continuum, including education, screening, diagnosis, treatment, survivorship, rehabilitation, and end-of-life care.\n\nDr Teh Yi Lin, Medical Oncologist and Lead for LEAP said, \"Robust support services, such as medical treatment support, psychosocial care, and educational resources, are essential to ensure that lung cancer patients and their loved ones are well-informed and supported. Patient advocates play a pivotal role in helping to ensure that there is effective support for those affected by cancer.\"\n\nThe white paper outlines actionable recommendations for patient advocacy groups to address the issued identified and enhance lung cancer advocacy in Singapore. They include:\n\n1. Enhancing patient advocacy for better cancer care\n\n2. Advocate for better access to lung cancer screening\n\n3. Advocate for better access to potentially life-saving treatments and clinical trials\n\nThe white paper is supported by AstraZeneca.

LEAP promotes lung cancer awareness to patients and the public through regular educational activities and campaigns. LEAP also provides individualised navigational support to newly diagnosed patients to help mitigate the challenges of a lung cancer diagnosis. LEAP has also set up a Patient Advocate Council, providing opportunities for advocates to share their valuable lived experiences with the aim of shaping future policy-making in Singapore and in the region.", "source": {"uri": "portal.sina.com.hk", "dataType": "news", "title": "\u65b0\u6d6a\u9999\u6e2f"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient_advocacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Patient advocacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lung cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Singapore"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Singapore"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_paper", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "White paper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision-making", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Decision-making"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Diagnosis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oncology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychosocial", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Psychosocial"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caregiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Caregiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_medicine_and_rehabilitation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Physical medicine and rehabilitation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ageing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-of-life_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "End-of-life care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AstraZeneca", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "AstraZeneca"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Clinical trial"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Cardiovascular_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Cardiovascular Disorders", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Cancer", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Cancer", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Women's_Health/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Women's Health/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Men's_Health/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Men's Health/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://release.media-outreach.com/release.php/Images/CompanyThumb/390x205/316423/Lung", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9779527", "eventUri": "eng-9779527", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Singapore"}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3568627450980392, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

James Cancer Hospital and Richard J. Solove Research Institute (OSUCCC -- James) and College of Public Health. These findings were consistent across gender and race.\n\nThis is the first study to provide evidence that smoking in combination with vaping increases the risk for cancer compared to smoking alone. Researchers reported their findings in the Journal of Oncology Research and Therapy.\n\nLung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, resulting in 1.8 million deaths in 2020 alone. The American Thoracic Society has found that about 87% of these cancers can be directly linked to persistent tobacco smoking.\n\nFor this case-control study, researchers analyzed cigarette smoking and use of electronic cigarettes (also known as vaping) in 4,975 people with lung cancer compared to a control group of 27,294 people without cancer. All study subjects were from the same general geographic location (treated in Columbus, Ohio) and had the same distribution of age, gender and race.\n\nResearchers found that vaping combined with cigarette smoking was eight times more common in people with lung cancer compared to the control group of people without lung cancer. In addition, the data showed that the risk of developing lung cancer was four times higher among people who combined vaping and smoking compared to those who only smoked.\n\n\"Our findings provide the first evidence that smoking in combination with vaping significantly increases the risk of lung cancer compared to smoking alone. Most people know that tobacco smoke contains cancer-causing chemicals but, overall, there is less knowledge about the chemicals that are inhaled through vape vapors,\" said Randall Harris, MD, Ph.D., corresponding author of the study and professor of epidemiology in the College of Public Health.\n\nResearchers say it is critical that regulators consider these additional health exposures in their regulation of the tobacco product industry to further protect public health, particularly when it comes to inhaled flavorings and nicotine dose concentrations.\n\n\"From a public health perspective, we have always been concerned about dual-use of both traditional and e-cig products. This study presents clear evidence showing that vaping in addition to smoking can increase your risk for lung cancer. This is especially concerning given the rate of youth and young adults using these products,\" said lead author Marisa Bittoni, Ph.D., a researcher in the medical oncology division in the College of Medicine.\n\n\"More research about the health effects of alternative tobacco products is critically needed to put science behind the regulation of the tobacco industry.\"", "source": {"uri": "medicalxpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Medical Xpress - Medical and Health News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lung cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_cigarette", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electronic cigarette"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_smoking", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tobacco smoking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Smoking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Thoracic_Society", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American Thoracic Society"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_university", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public university"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ohio State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chemical substance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oncology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbus,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Columbus, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Columbus, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flavoring", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Flavoring"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tobacco industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vapor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vapor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Medicine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Doctor of Medicine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Philosophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Doctor of Philosophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tobacco"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nicotine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Epidemiology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Public health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Adolescence"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances/Tobacco", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances/Tobacco", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Cancer", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Cancer", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Senses", "label": "dmoz/Health/Senses", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/2024/vaping-and-smoking-tog.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9779527", "eventUri": "eng-9779527", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.4980392156862745, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

You can check out at any time. More info\n\nToday marks World Lung Cancer Day.\n\nEach year, August 1 is dedicated to raising awareness about lung cancer - promoting education about the causes and treatments, and advocating for better patient care and support.\n\nLung cancer remains one of the most common and deadliest forms of cancer worldwide, with a high mortality rate primarily because it is often diagnosed at an advanced stage. So in a bid to tackle this issue, it's important to familiarise yourself with warning signs.\n\nOne of the ways to do this is the five second 'diamond test', which can help detect lung cancer. The test can be done at home, and is also known as the Schamroth window test, or window gap test.\n\nA woman called Ashley, 35, was diagnosed with lung cancer last year despite never being a smoker. She has since been using her TikTok page to spread awareness on warning signs to look out for - and the diamond test is one of them.\n\nAshley explained that both herself, and her friend Aurora, both experienced the symptom finger clubbing. This is apparent when they place their hands into the diamond shape.\n\nTo give it a go yourself, press your thumbnails or index finger together to see if there is a small diamond-shaped window between them.\n\nIf you can't see it, then it's possible you have something known as finger clubbing, which is something experienced by more than 35% of people with non-small cell lung cancer, according to Cancer Research UK.\n\nThis isn't the only warning sign of lung cancer you should familiarise yourself with. The NHS lists more indicators of the deadly disease, which often appear when patients get past the early stages.\n\nThe main symptoms of lung cancer include:\n\na cough that does not go away after 3 weeks a long-standing cough that gets worse chest infections that keep coming back coughing up blood an ache or pain when breathing or coughing persistent breathlessness persistent tiredness or lack of energy loss of appetite or unexplained weight loss\n\nThe less common symptoms of lung cancer include:\n\nchanges in the appearance of your fingers, such as becoming more curved or their ends becoming larger (this is known as finger clubbing) difficulty swallowing (dysphagia) or pain when swallowing wheezing a hoarse voice swelling of your face or neck persistent chest or shoulder pain\n\nIf you are concerned about your health, it is important to see a doctor for professional advice.

James Cancer Hospital and Richard J. Solove Research Institute (OSUCCC -- James) and College of Public Health has found that people who both vape and smoke are four times more likely to develop lung cancer than those who only smoke.\n\nThis groundbreaking study, published in the Journal of Oncology Research and Therapy, is the first to show that combining smoking with vaping increases cancer risk compared to smoking alone. The findings were consistent across different genders and races.\n\nLung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, causing 1.8 million deaths in 2020 alone. According to the American Thoracic Society, about 87% of these cancers can be directly linked to persistent tobacco smoking.\n\nFor this study, researchers conducted a case-control analysis involving 4,975 individuals with lung cancer and a control group of 27,294 people without cancer. All participants were from the same geographic area (treated in Columbus, Ohio) and had similar distributions of age, gender, and race.\n\nThe study revealed that vaping combined with cigarette smoking was eight times more common in people with lung cancer compared to those without the disease.\n\nFurthermore, the data indicated that the risk of developing lung cancer was four times higher among individuals who both vaped and smoked compared to those who only smoked.\n\n\"Our findings provide the first evidence that smoking in combination with vaping significantly increases the risk of lung cancer compared to smoking alone.\n\nMost people know that tobacco smoke contains cancer-causing chemicals, but overall, there is less knowledge about the chemicals inhaled through vape vapors,\" said Randall Harris, MD, Ph.D., corresponding author of the study and professor of epidemiology in the College of Public Health.\n\nThe study's authors emphasize the importance of considering these additional health risks in the regulation of the tobacco product industry, particularly concerning inhaled flavorings and nicotine concentrations. This is crucial to protect public health.\n\n\"From a public health perspective, we have always been concerned about the dual use of both traditional and e-cig products. This study presents clear evidence showing that vaping in addition to smoking can increase your risk for lung cancer.\n\nThis is especially concerning given the rate of youth and young adults using these products,\" said lead author Marisa Bittoni, Ph.D., a researcher in the medical oncology division in the College of Medicine.\n\nThe researchers call for more studies on the health effects of alternative tobacco products to provide a scientific basis for regulating the tobacco industry. This is particularly important given the rising popularity of vaping among younger populations.\n\nIf you care about lung health, please read studies about marijuana's effects on lung health, and why some non-smokers get lung disease and some heavy smokers do not.\n\nFor more information about health, please see recent studies that olive oil may help you live longer, and vitamin D could help lower the risk of autoimmune diseases.", "source": {"uri": "knowridge.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Knowridge Science Report"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lung cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_cigarette", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electronic cigarette"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Smoking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_smoking", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tobacco smoking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Thoracic_Society", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American Thoracic Society"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ohio State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oncology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vapor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vapor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Philosophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Doctor of Philosophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chemical substance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Public health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbus,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Columbus, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Columbus, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flavoring", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Flavoring"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tobacco industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Medicine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Doctor of Medicine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vitamin D"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Respiratory disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoimmune_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Autoimmune disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tobacco"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis_(drug)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cannabis (drug)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances/Tobacco", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances/Tobacco", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Cancer", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Cancer", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Nutrition/Disease_Prevention", "label": "dmoz/Health/Nutrition/Disease Prevention", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances/Coffee", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances/Coffee", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://knowridge.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Combined-vaping-and-smoking-increases-lung-cancer-risk-by-400.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9779527", "eventUri": "eng-9779527", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.4745098039215686, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

It is frequently misdiagnosed as an allergy, cold, bronchitis, or flu-related cough.\n\nChest Pain\n\nContinuous pain that worsens when you breathe deeply, cough, or laugh can indicate lung cancer. Such chest pain can also be due to musculoskeletal issues like costochondritis, pleurisy, heart problems, or referred pain from digestive system disorders.\n\nCoughing Up Blood\n\nEven small amounts of blood in sputum can indicate lung cancer, although this serious symptom usually raises concern. It is often overlooked as a minor respiratory infection or bronchitis.\n\nFatigue\n\nExcessive fatigue or weakness can be caused by numerous illnesses, including lung cancer. It is often linked to anemia, insomnia, chronic fatigue syndrome, myalgia, or a sedentary lifestyle.\n\nHoarseness\n\nWhen a tumor presses against or invades the recurrent laryngeal nerve, hoarseness of voice can occur. This can be mistaken for benign conditions like a cold, voice strain, laryngitis, or thyroid problems. Persistent or unexplained hoarseness lasting more than a few weeks should be evaluated as it could be an early sign of lung cancer.\n\nRecurrent Lung Infections\n\nLung cancer can be indicated by recurrent infections such as pneumonia or bronchitis. These infections are often misdiagnosed as typical respiratory ailments, lowered immunity, or viral or bacterial infections.\n\nLoss of Appetite and Unexplained Weight Loss\n\nSudden or unexplained weight loss can be indicators of various diseases, including lung cancer. Individuals may attribute this to stomach problems, stress, depression, or anxiety.\n\nSwelling in the Face or Neck\n\nSwelling in the face or neck can occur if a tumor presses on the superior vena cava, the major vein carrying blood from the upper body to the heart. This is sometimes mistaken for allergic reactions, insect bites, or other less serious problems.\n\nMaintaining a healthy lifestyle is crucial to preventing lung cancer. Quitting smoking is the most effective measure since smoking is the primary cause of lung cancer. Avoiding exposure to second-hand smoke is also vital. Regular physical activity promotes general health and reduces cancer risk, and a nutritious diet rich in fruits and vegetables can enhance lung health.

These findings were consistent across gender and race.\n\nThis is the first study to provide evidence that smoking in combination with vaping increases the risk for cancer compared to smoking alone. Researchers reported their findings in the Journal of Oncology Research and Therapy.\n\nStudy design and methods\n\nLung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, resulting in 1.8 million deaths in 2020 alone. The American Thoracic Society has found that about 87% of these cancers can be directly linked to persistent tobacco smoking.\n\nFor this case-control study, researchers analyzed cigarette smoking and use of electronic cigarettes (also known as vaping) in 4,975 people with lung cancer compared to a control group of 27,294 people without cancer. All study subjects were from the same general geographic location (treated in Columbus, Ohio) and had the same distribution of age, gender and race.\n\nResearchers found that vaping combined with cigarette smoking was eight times more common in people with lung cancer compared to the control group of people without lung cancer. In addition, the data showed that the risk of developing lung cancer was four times higher among people who combined vaping and smoking compared to those who only smoked.\n\nOur findings provide the first evidence that smoking in combination with vaping significantly increases the risk of lung cancer compared to smoking alone. Most people know that tobacco smoke contains cancer-causing chemicals but, overall, there is less knowledge about the chemicals that are inhaled through vape vapors.\"\n\nRandall Harris, MD, PhD, corresponding author of the study and professor of epidemiology, College of Public Health, Ohio State\n\nResearchers say it is critical that regulators consider these additional health exposures in their regulation of the tobacco product industry to further protect public health, particularly when it comes to inhaled flavorings and nicotine dose concentrations.\n\n\"From a public health perspective, we have always been concerned about dual-use of both traditional and e-cig products. This study presents clear evidence showing that vaping in addition to smoking can increase your risk for lung cancer. This is especially concerning given the rate of youth and young adults using these products,\" said lead author Marisa Bittoni, PhD, a researcher in the medical oncology division in the College of Medicine. \"More research about the health effects of alternative tobacco products is critically needed to put science behind the regulation of the tobacco industry.\"\n\nThis study was supported by a grant from the National Cancer Institute and the Richard B. Early Cancer Research Fund at The Ohio State University College of Public Health. David Carbone, MD, PhD, professor and director of the Thoracic Oncology Center at the OSUCCC - James, is also a coauthor.\n\nTobacco research at Ohio State\n\nThe OSUCCC - James is home to the Center for Tobacco Research, which brings together tobacco researchers from across the colleges of medicine, public health, law and nursing as well as the Ohio State Wexner Medical Center and the Comprehensive Cancer Center to conduct research on tobacco product use, regulation and health impact. The center is funded by the National Institutes of Health to provide critical research to inform the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's evidence-based regulation of tobacco products through a Tobacco Center of Regulatory Science (TCORS) grant.\n\nOhio State University Wexner Medical Center\n\nJournal reference:\n\nBittoni, M., et al.

The report, titled Empowering Asian Lung Cancer Advocates, draws on global best practices as well as insights from the Hopeful Voices Patient Advocate Roundtable Meeting, hosted by Lung Cancer Education and Advocacy for Patients (LEAP) and the Lung Cancer Consortium Singapore (LCCS) in late 2023.\n\nDuring roundtable discussions attended by lung cancer patients and their families, several key priorities in the lung cancer care continuum were identified:\n\n1. Increasing the influence of patient advocates in decision-making and healthcare service development\n\n2. Improving early-stage lung cancer diagnoses by raising awareness or improving access to early screening.\n\n3. Improving access to innovative treatments and diagnostics.\n\nLung cancer remains the most frequently diagnosed cancer worldwide, representing about 12.4% of all cases in 2022. It is the primary cause of cancer-related deaths globally, with over 1.8 million fatalities annually[1]. In Singapore, it is the third most common cancer and leading cause of cancer deaths[2]. With ageing populations in Asia, more people are expected to be diagnosed with cancer. Inevitably, they and their caregivers, as well as their healthcare teams may encounter challenges across the cancer care continuum, including education, screening, diagnosis, treatment, survivorship, rehabilitation, and end-of-life care[3].\n\nDr Teh Yi Lin, Medical Oncologist and Lead for LEAP said, \"Robust support services, such as medical treatment support, psychosocial care, and educational resources, are essential to ensure that lung cancer patients and their loved ones are well-informed and supported. Patient advocates play a pivotal role in helping to ensure that there is effective support for those affected by cancer.\"\n\nThe white paper outlines actionable recommendations for patient advocacy groups to address the issued identified and enhance lung cancer advocacy in Singapore. They include:\n\n1. Enhancing patient advocacy for better cancer care\n\nFoster empowered communities: Build and support communities that provide evidence-based information, psychosocial support, and financial guidance to help patients and families manage the complexities of their cancer journey Utilise social networks and media platforms for engagement: Develop and leverage social media and traditional media platforms to connect patients and advocates, enabling them to share experiences, personal stories and advice to raise public awareness. Integrate patient insights in research: Collaborate with researchers to integrate patient needs and perspectives in clinical trials and studies Advocacy training and mentorship: Offer training and mentorship programs to equip individuals with the skills needed for effective advocacy 2. Advocate for better access to lung cancer screening\n\nIncrease public awareness and participation: Implement broad education campaigns and community outreach to increase awareness of lung cancer risks and the benefits of early screening. Policy advocacy for screening access: Establish strong partnerships between patient advocacy groups, scientists, and policy-makers to keep up-to-date with the latest scientific findings on the importance of lung cancer screening. 3. Advocate for better access to potentially life-saving treatments and clinical trials Raise public awareness and educate patients: Collaborate with healthcare professionals to inform patients about the availability of new treatments and companion diagnostic tests to improve early detection and diagnosis. Lower financial barriers: Work towards ensuring access to treatments and diagnostic tests and reducing the financial burden on patients. Facilitate clinical trial participation: Increase public and patient education on the benefits of participating in clinical trials. The white paper is supported by AstraZeneca.

The truth is, in India, over half of lung cancer patients are non-smokers. And as compared to the West, lung cancer strikes a decade earlier. The culprit? The very air we breathe.

These findings were consistent across gender and race.\n\nThis is the first study to provide evidence that smoking in combination with vaping increases the risk for cancer compared to smoking alone. Researchers reported their findings in the Journal of Oncology Research and Therapy.\n\nStudy design and methods\n\nLung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, resulting in 1.8 million deaths in 2020 alone. The American Thoracic Society has found that about 87% of these cancers can be directly linked to persistent tobacco smoking.\n\nFor this case-control study, researchers analyzed cigarette smoking and use of electronic cigarettes (also known as vaping) in 4,975 people with lung cancer compared to a control group of 27,294 people without cancer. All study subjects were from the same general geographic location (treated in Columbus, Ohio) and had the same distribution of age, gender and race.\n\nResearchers found that vaping combined with cigarette smoking was eight times more common in people with lung cancer compared to the control group of people without lung cancer. In addition, the data showed that the risk of developing lung cancer was four times higher among people who combined vaping and smoking compared to those who only smoked.\n\n\"Our findings provide the first evidence that smoking in combination with vaping significantly increases the risk of lung cancer compared to smoking alone. Most people know that tobacco smoke contains cancer-causing chemicals but, overall, there is less knowledge about the chemicals that are inhaled through vape vapors,\" said Randall Harris, MD, PhD, corresponding author of the study and professor of epidemiology in the College of Public Health.\n\nResearchers say it is critical that regulators consider these additional health exposures in their regulation of the tobacco product industry to further protect public health, particularly when it comes to inhaled flavorings and nicotine dose concentrations.\n\n\"From a public health perspective, we have always been concerned about dual-use of both traditional and e-cig products. This study presents clear evidence showing that vaping in addition to smoking can increase your risk for lung cancer. This is especially concerning given the rate of youth and young adults using these products,\" said lead author Marisa Bittoni, PhD, a researcher in the medical oncology division in the College of Medicine. \"More research about the health effects of alternative tobacco products is critically needed to put science behind the regulation of the tobacco industry.\"\n\nThis study was supported by a grant from the National Cancer Institute and the Richard B. Early Cancer Research Fund at The Ohio State University College of Public Health. David Carbone, MD, PhD, professor and director of the Thoracic Oncology Center at the OSUCCC - James, is also a coauthor.\n\nTobacco research at Ohio State\n\nThe OSUCCC - James is home to the Center for Tobacco Research, which brings together tobacco researchers from across the colleges of medicine, public health, law and nursing as well as the Ohio State Wexner Medical Center and the Comprehensive Cancer Center to conduct research on tobacco product use, regulation and health impact. The center is funded by the National Institutes of Health to provide critical research to inform the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's evidence-based regulation of tobacco products through a Tobacco Center of Regulatory Science (TCORS) grant.", "source": {"uri": "eurekalert.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "EurekAlert!"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lung cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_cigarette", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electronic cigarette"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_smoking", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tobacco smoking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Smoking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbus,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Columbus, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Columbus, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Thoracic_Society", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American Thoracic Society"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_university", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public university"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ohio State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chemical substance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oncology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Medicine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Doctor of Medicine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Philosophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Doctor of Philosophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tobacco"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Epidemiology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Public health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flavoring", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Flavoring"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_State_University_Wexner_Medical_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Evidence-based medicine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tobacco industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Cancer_Institute", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Cancer Institute"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "wgt": 49}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances", "wgt": 63}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances/Tobacco", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances/Tobacco", "wgt": 62}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Cancer", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Cancer", "wgt": 48}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Women's_Health/Smoking", "label": "dmoz/Health/Women's Health/Smoking", "wgt": 53}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://www.eurekalert.org/images/EurekAlert-bluebg_Twitter_601X601.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9779527", "eventUri": "eng-9779527", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.403921568627451, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1}

A recent study done by Indian Council of Medical Research - National Centre for Disease Informatics and Research (ICMR-NCDIR) in Bengaluru, looking at various published studies found a strong link between air pollution and cancer, specifically showing that fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) in the air are associated with higher rates of lung cancer and deaths resulting from it.\n\nMicroscopic pollutants deeply penetrate the lungs, causing inflammation and damaging lung tissue. Chronic exposure to such pollutants can trigger mutations in lung cells, eventually leading to cancer. This risk is significant even for non-smokers who breathe polluted air daily, doctors pointed out.\n\nApart from genetics, several occupations in India expose workers to lung cancer causing agents. Workers in mining, construction and certain manufacturing industries are at a heightened risk.\n\nSecond-hand smoke\n\nVinayak Maka, who heads the department of Medical Oncology in Ramaiah Memorial Hospital, said lung cancer in non-smokers is a concerning trend. \"Exposure to second-hand smoke remains a significant risk factor, as many non-smokers inhale smoke from their environment, increasing their risk of developing lung cancer,\" he said.\n\n\"Apart from air pollution, occupational exposure to carcinogens such as asbestos, radon, and certain chemicals further elevates the risk for non-smokers. Genetic predisposition is another critical factor; some individuals possess genetic mutations that make them more susceptible to lung cancer despite never having smoked. Additionally, lifestyle factors like diet and physical activity, along with underlying health conditions such as chronic lung diseases, can influence cancer risk,\" he pointed out.\n\nNiti Raizada, Senior Director - Medical Oncology and Hemato Oncology, Fortis Hospitals, Bengaluru, said the impact of smoke on health is far more extensive than just the act of smoking.\n\n\"While it is widely known that lighting up a cigarette is hazardous, many are unaware of the insidious dangers lurking in the smoke that lingers long after the cigarette is extinguished. Understanding the risks associated with first-hand, second-hand, and even third-hand smoke is crucial for grasping the full spectrum of lung cancer threats and safeguarding your health against this deadly disease,\" she said.\n\nActive smoking\n\nFirst-hand smoke, or active smoking, involves inhaling smoke directly from cigarettes, cigars, or pipes. This type of smoke is laden with thousands of harmful chemicals, many of which are known carcinogens. The risks associated with first-hand smoke - direct lung damage and significant cancer risk - are well-documented. Beyond cancer, smoking is a major cause of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), heart disease, and stroke, affecting overall health and quality of life, she said.\n\nStating that the hidden danger lies with exposure to second-hand smoke or passive smoke, Dr Raizada said: \"The smoke inhaled by non-smokers from the burning end of a cigarette or from a smoker's exhalation poses serious health risks, even without direct contact.\"\n\nChildren and pregnant women are especially at risk. For children, exposure to second-hand smoke can lead to respiratory infections, asthma, and developmental issues. Pregnant women exposed to second-hand smoke are at higher risk for low birth weight and preterm delivery. Besides, second-hand smoke can linger in the air and settle on surfaces, creating an ongoing health risk in enclosed spaces, she explained.\n\nThird-hand smoke\n\nThird-hand smoke refers to the residual nicotine and other toxic chemicals that remain on indoor surfaces long after smoking has stopped. \"Residues from third-hand smoke can cling to walls, furniture, and clothing. Children and pets who come into contact with these contaminated surfaces may ingest or inhale harmful substances, increasing their risk of health problems,\" the doctor said.\n\n\"Besides, third-hand smoke residues can interact with other indoor pollutants, potentially creating additional harmful compounds. This can exacerbate health risks, particularly in environments where smoking has occurred regularly. Even if a person has never smoked or been exposed to second-hand smoke, living in an environment with third-hand smoke contamination can pose health risks, especially over prolonged periods,\" she explained.\n\nSymptoms, precautions\n\nSymptoms of lung cancer include a cough (often with blood), chest pain, wheezing and weight loss. These symptoms often do not appear until the cancer is advanced. Treatments vary but may include surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, targeted drug therapy and immunotherapy.\n\nDoctors said the most effective way to reduce lung cancer risk is to avoid smoking and limit exposure to second-hand smoke. Besides, maintaining smoke-free environments and mitigating exposure to residual smoke are essential precautionary steps.\n\nA multifaceted approach is the need of the hour to tackle lung cancer effectively. The general public should be educated about the risk factors, symptoms, and the importance of early detection of lung cancer through intensive public and social media campaigns, doctors added.\n\nRead Comments", "source": {"uri": "thehindu.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hindu"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_smoking", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Passive smoking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lung cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_pollution", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Air pollution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Smoking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollutant", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pollutant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen_dioxide", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nitrogen dioxide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Risk factor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mutation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cigarette", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cigarette"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particulates", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Particulates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Oncology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third-hand_smoke", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Third-hand smoke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carcinogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Genetics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chemical substance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inflammation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mining", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mining"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pollution"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances", "wgt": 49}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances/Tobacco", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances/Tobacco", "wgt": 49}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Women's_Health/Smoking", "label": "dmoz/Health/Women's Health/Smoking", "wgt": 46}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Smoked", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Smoked", "wgt": 37}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Support_Groups/Smoking_Cessation", "label": "dmoz/Health/Support Groups/Smoking Cessation", "wgt": 38}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://th-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/x3pmrl/article68469792.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/IMG_iStock-1341427905_2_1_ROC208EK.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9779527", "eventUri": "eng-9779527", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.5450980392156863, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

While the disease predominantly affects individuals who smoke, rising air pollution and dietary factors play major roles as well.\n\n\"Smoking in any form can lead to lung cancer, whether you're an active or passive smoker,\" said pulmonologist Dr Vibhu Kawatra, who is also an allergy specialist in New Delhi.\n\nIn India, cannabis smoking and inhalation of radon, an important indoor pollutant, are unique risk factors. While smoking should be avoided, inhalation of radon can be reduced if living spaces are properly ventilated, suggested Dr Kawatra.\n\nWhen it comes to lung cancer, one cannot forgo the dangers of particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) in the air.\n\nWhile PM10 can be avoided by wearing a mask, PM2.5 can penetrate deep into the lungs and cause DNA mutations leading to cancer.\n\nDr Kawatra highlighted the need for a nutritious diet that can help prevent lung cancer or cancer of any form. \"A diet rich in fibre, vitamins A, C and E, fruits and other micronutrients are good for cellular function. It also avoids the abnormal growth of cancerous cells in the body,\" he said.\n\nOther precautionary measures include recognising the warning signs. These are severe cough or coughing blood, breathlessness and chest pain, happening for a long time, besides family history of cancer, smoking, chewing tobacco and air pollution.\n\nThe diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer involve multiple modalities, like advanced imaging techniques like PET CT scans and Brain MRI.\n\nEarly-stage cancers (Stages 1 and 2) are often operable and potentially curable, while more advanced stages (Stages 3 and 4) require a combination of surgery, radiotherapy, targeted therapy, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy.\n\nDr Shyam Aggarwal, Chairman of Medical Oncology at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, stated, \"To identify actionable targets, NGS - next gen sequencing is done. Potent EGFR, Alk, Ros drugs are readily available. In case no target is detected, chemotherapy and immunotherapy is used. With multi modality therapy, currently half the patients can be cured.\"\n\nAs the number of lung cancer cases continues to rise in India, awareness about the risk factors, early detection, and preventive measures is crucial.", "source": {"uri": "indiatoday.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "India Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lung cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particulates", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Particulates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inhalation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Inhalation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radon", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Radon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Smoking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pulmonology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollutant", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pollutant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_smoking", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tobacco smoking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_pollution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Air pollution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis_(drug)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cannabis (drug)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Allergy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_A", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vitamin A"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Risk factor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micronutrient", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Micronutrient"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mutation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fruit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cough", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cough"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CT_scan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CT scan"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Cardiovascular_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Cardiovascular Disorders", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Cancer", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Cancer", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Men's_Health/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Men's Health/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202408/lung-cancer--illustration-011251760-16x9_0.jpg?VersionId=yyL5p4PgN8DaV8pZAtIBtcH3b9cna.3n", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9779527", "eventUri": "eng-9779527", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1450980392156863, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

Avoiding smoking and exposure to secondhand smoke can significantly improve lung health.\n\nEngaging in regular physical activity, such as walking, running, or swimming, helps improve lung capacity and efficiency.\n\nEating a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains provides essential nutrients that support lung health. Foods high in antioxidants, such as berries, nuts, and leafy greens, are particularly beneficial.\n\nLimit exposure to indoor and outdoor pollutants, such as dust, chemicals, and fumes. Use air purifiers at home, ensure proper ventilation, and wear masks in polluted environments.\n\nWash your hands frequently and avoid close contact with sick individuals to reduce the risk of respiratory infections. Get vaccinated for flu and pneumonia.\n\nDrinking plenty of water helps keep the mucosal linings in the lungs thin, which makes it easier to breathe and for the lungs to function efficiently.\n\nIncorporate deep breathing exercises, such as diaphragmatic breathing or pursed-lip breathing, into your routine. These exercises can help improve lung capacity and efficiency.\n\nSchedule regular checkups with your healthcare provider to monitor lung health and detect any potential issues early on.

In 1988, 90 per cent of my patients were smokers. In 2018, I found that over 50 per cent were non-smokers. In 1988, the peak age of occurrence was the 50s and 60s. Now, the peak age is 40. So it's down by a decade and a half. In 1988, there were hardly any women patients. And now, 40 per cent of the patients are women. And 90 per cent of the patients present are beyond the scope of surgery by the time they present, which means they are in advanced stage three or stage four,\" he says.\n\nHe attributes this to the presence of carcinogens in the air. \"If you start smoking in the early 20s, you would take about 30 years of exposure to the 70 carcinogens in cigarettes to develop lung cancer. You would get it in your 50s. Unfortunately, air pollution exposure begins at birth. The average AQI in Delhi on non-rainy days equals about ten cigarettes. So, a newborn becomes a smoker from the first breath of life. By the time they are 30 or 40, they have actually been smokers for that much time. That explains it,\" he says. The WHO has called air pollution the second smoking epidemic.\n\nWhat impact does early detection have on treatment outcomes and patient survival?\n\nIf you detect cancer at stage one, you have something like 95 per cent five-year survival. If you detect it late, survival drops to around 10 per cent in stage four, according to Dr Kumar. Likewise, stages two and three are placed in between. Dr Jyoti Bajpai from Apollo Cancer Centre says the real challenge of early detection is overlapping of symptoms. \"Respiratory symptoms like cough, chest pain, and at times, a blood clot, which we call pneumocystosis, are not specific and can occur in various infections, including tuberculosis. Because of this, it can be confusing for both patients and primary care practitioners to identify the cause. Sometimes, people ignore these symptoms, and even when they seek medical help, they may be prescribed antibiotics for suspected infection. This delays diagnosis.\"\n\nIf there are suggestive symptoms, and you have a family history, then get investigated, advises Dr Kumar.\n\nAny tech advances in screening procedures?\n\nMolecular profiling can identify changes in cell DNA. \"There are identifiable mutations, targets and immune markers that respond well to immunotherapy,\" says Dr Kumar. Then there's a low-dose CT scan for an at-risk (smoking over 25 years) but normal population. This can detect lung cancers even before they become symptomatic. \"These detect abnormalities that mimic the spots seen in lung cancer. Still, you need to do a biopsy to confirm it is lung cancer,\" he adds.", "source": {"uri": "indianexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Indian Express"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lung cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Smoking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cancer staging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lancet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Lancet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carcinogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Diagnosis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cigarette", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cigarette"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_pollution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Air pollution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Western world"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gurgaon", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gurgaon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gurgaon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Epidemic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Health Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Surgery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Antibiotic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CT_scan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CT scan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_history_(medicine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Family history (medicine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chest_pain", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chest pain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Biopsy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thrombus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tuberculosis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mutation"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Cancer", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Cancer", "wgt": 32}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Support_Groups/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Support Groups/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Women's_Health/Smoking", "label": "dmoz/Health/Women's Health/Smoking", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/08/lung-cancer.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9779527", "eventUri": "eng-9779527", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2156862745098039, "wgt": 135, "relevance": 1}

These trials not only contribute to improving treatment practices but also directly impact human health.\n\nAstraZeneca is actively involved in Vietnam, conducting studies with over 6,500 patients across various diseases.\n\nA significant focus lies on non-communicable diseases like lung cancer, which has the highest new case rate globally and ranks third in Vietnam.\n\n\"We have witnessed remarkable progress, from traditional chemotherapy methods to targeted drugs and advanced immunotherapies. These achievements not only improve treatment efficacy but also bring hope to many patients,\" Huong said at the conference.\n\nWith the support of the Ministry of Health, the commitment of medical experts, the active and high-quality participation of hospitals/research institutions, and the cooperation of international research organizations, the deputy minister believes that research institutions will participate in more clinical trials, especially international and multi-center studies, to contribute to the improvements in community healthcare.\n\nOver the years, many hospitals in Vietnam have passed the stringent evaluation procedures of large pharmaceutical companies, medical management agencies and organizations, and reputable clinical trial management organizations.\n\nThese hospitals demonstrate not only the capacity to recruit patients effectively but also a commitment to high-quality research data and adherence to good clinical practice and ethical principles in biomedical research.\n\nDr. Nguyen Ngo Quang, Acting Director of the Administration of Science, Technology, and Training, praised the collaboration and exchange of experiences between Vietnamese medical units and international organizations in clinical trials.\n\n\"The rapid increase in clinical trials in Vietnam is a testament to the dedication and commitment of scientists, doctors, and the entire healthcare system. This growth is a beacon of our potential and aspirations for progress in the medical field, reflecting a healthcare system that is growing strong and ready to integrate and compete with the region and the world,\" said Quang.\n\nThe conference showcased numerous studies conducted in Vietnam with significant results, marking significant advancements in lung cancer treatment and cancer prevention in general. It also provided updates on pivotal clinical trial findings recently presented at major international conferences.\n\nThese research findings are poised to revolutionize the clinical practice of lung cancer treatment.\n\nA prime example is the ADAURA study on early-stage lung cancer patients, in which Vietnam has been involved since 2015.\n\nThe Phase III study is the first to demonstrate the benefits of osimertinib in terms of overall survival and disease-free survival (DFS) in the early-stage lung cancer patient population.\n\nFor example, data updated in January 2023 revealed a median DFS of 65.8 months compared to 28.1 months in the placebo group.\n\nA prime example is the ADAURA study on patients with resected epidermal growth factor receptor mutation-positive non-small cell lung cancer, in which Vietnam has participated since 2015.\n\nThis was the first global Phase III study to demonstrate the benefit of a third-generation TKI on overall survival, as well as progression-free survival (PFS), in the EGFR-positive, post-surgical non-small cell lung cancer patient, compared to placebo.\n\nAccording to Professor Le Van Quang, Director of K Hospital, among the numerous clinical trials conducted in Vietnam, the study on patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer who are not indicated for surgery was one of the studies presented at the recently concluded ASCO 2024 Conference in the United States.\n\nThe study's outcomes surpassed expectations, with a median PFS of 39.1 months, far exceeding the initial projections of only a few months.\n\n\"This remarkable achievement is a testament to the collaborative efforts and dedication of researchers across various hospitals nationwide,\" Quang said.\n\nLeaders from the Ministry of Health, the Department of Science, Technology, and Training, along with hospital leaders and researchers, gathered to reflect on the decades-long development of clinical trials in Vietnam.\n\nThey engaged in discussions centered on the challenges and solutions for improving clinical trial processes, implementation methods, and expanding the network of participating healthcare facilities across the country.\n\nA representative from K Hospital acknowledged the challenges Vietnam faces in treating lung cancer due to economic constraints and barriers.He emphasized that the introduction of innovative medicines and advancements in diagnostic and therapeutic tools have significantly improved survival rates for late-stage lung cancer patients.\n\nWhereas survival rates for such patients were previously measured in months, they can now be measured in years and even multiple years.\n\nAtul Tandon, General Director of AstraZeneca Vietnam, said that the company has invested over US$70 million in clinical trials in Vietnam.\n\n\"Beyond innovative treatments, the company's bold ambition is to eliminate cancer, including lung cancer as a cause of death.\" Tandon said. \"To achieve this goal, AstraZeneca is not only focusing on developing life-changing treatments but also on other crucial aspects such as raising disease awareness, strengthening prevention, early screening, diagnosis, and patient care.\"\n\nIn 2023, AstraZeneca and the Ministry of Health signed a five-year strategic partnership to strengthen their bilateral relationship and promote comprehensive collaboration in research and development, pharmaceutical manufacturing, disease prevention and control, and the development of a sustainable healthcare system.", "source": {"uri": "e.vnexpress.net", "dataType":

Although some go on to develop persistent cough and breathlessness, unexplained tiredness and weight loss or aches or pains when breathing, it's key to detect the condition as early as possible.\n\nOne of the ways to do this is the five second 'diamond test', which can help detect lung cancer. The test can be done at home, and is also known as the Schamroth window test, or window gap test.\n\nSimply press your thumbnails or index finger together to see if there is a small diamond-shaped window between them.

She explained that both herself, and her friend Aurora, both experienced the symptom finger clubbing.\n\nAshley explained: \"Clubbing is an early sign of lung cancer and can indicate problems with the lungs or the heart, or I believe, the digestive tract.

So this is a good indicator.\"\n\nAccording to Cancer Research UK, finger clubbing can also be found in some people with thyroid problems, or other conditions, like ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. If you have done the test and you can't see a 'window' you should seek medical advice.\n\nOn its website, the charity says: \"Finger clubbing is unusual.

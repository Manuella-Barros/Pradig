During her performance, the pop superstar brought out Tame Impala\u2019s Kevin Parker for a duet of the band\u2019s 2015 hit, \u201cThe Less I Know the Better.\u201d As seen in clips circulating social media, the duo traded verses before coming together on to sing and dance around onstage during the chorus. \u201cI have written this moment down, I\u2019ve wished for it, I\u2019ve dreamt it,\u201d Lipa told the crowd of what headlining Glastonbury means to her. \u201cWhen I wrote it down, I said I really want to headline the Pyramid stage on a Friday night so I can party the next two days at the best place on earth.\u201d Parker worked with Lipa as a co-producer and co-writer on seven tracks off her recently released album, Radical Optimism. \u201cDua had this focus on finding this sound, which was so elusive,\u201d Parker previously said in an interview with Elle. \u201cBut it was nice to be in the engine room of the creative process, rather than worry about being the face of it. It was the experience that I\u2019ve been waiting for.\u201d He described the origins of the first single, the bouncy \u201cHoudini,\u201d as starting with a bass line he plunked out weeks before their session that he realized could work once the singer added a \u201cmoody,\u201d post-disco melody. \u201cShe started singing, and it just immediately made sense,\u201d he added. \u201cThis feeling of early-\u201980s sleaze, in some strange, dark, sweaty club. Gloriously suffocating. Hypnotic.\u201d Of the songs Parker collaborated on, three became U.K. top 10 singles including \u201cHoudini,\u201d \u201cTraining Season\u201d and \u201cIllusion.\u201d", "summary": "The pop star headlined Glastonbury on Friday night (June 28).", "url": "https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/dua-lipa-the-less-i-know-the-better-with-tame-impalas-kevin-parker-1235720746/", "image": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Dua-Lipa-01-credit-Tyrone-Lebon-press-2024-billboard-1548.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 00:37:53", "author": "Rania Aniftos", "authors": ["Rania Aniftos"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.491}

Police confirmed \u201cthere has been an incident\u201d with Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen on Friday and that a 39-year-old man was arrested. They didn\u2019t provide further details and it wasn\u2019t clear if Frederiksen was hurt. The man is expected to arrive at 1100 GMT at the Copenhagen District Court in Frederiksberg, a municipality enclave within the Danish capital. The prime minister\u2019s office told the Danish state broadcaster DR on Friday that Frederiksen was \u201cshocked\u201d by what happened. Two eyewitnesses, Anna Ravn and Marie Adrian, told the daily BT that they saw a man walking toward Frederiksen and then \u201cpushing her hard on the shoulder so she was shoved aside.\u201d They stressed that the premier did not fall down. Another witness, Kasper J\u00f8rgensen, told the Ekstra Bladet tabloid that a well-dressed man, who seemed part of Frederiksen\u2019s protection unit, and a police officer took down the alleged assailant. S\u00f8ren Kj\u00e6rgaard who was working at a local bar on Kultorvet Square where the incident happened told the BT that he saw Frederiksen after the incident and she had no visible injuries to her face but walked away quickly. Politicians in the Scandinavian country and abroad condemned the reported assault. Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson said that \u201can attack on a democratically elected leader is also an attack on our democracy,\u201d while Charles Michel, president of the European Council, condemned on X what he called a \u201ccowardly act of aggression.\u201d European Union parliamentary elections are currently underway in Denmark and the rest of the 27-nation bloc and will conclude on Sunday. Frederiksen has been campaigning with the Social Democrats\u2019 EU lead candidate, Christel Schaldemose. Media reports said the attack was not linked to a campaign event. Violence against politicians has become a theme in the run-up to the EU elections. In May, a candidate from Germany\u2019s center-left Social Democrats was beaten and seriously injured while campaigning for a seat in the European Parliament. In Slovakia, the election campaign was overshadowed by an attempt to assassinate populist Prime Minister Robert Fico on May 15, sending shockwaves through the nation of 5.4 million and reverberating throughout Europe. Frederiksen, 46, is the leader of the Social Democratic Party and has been Denmark\u2019s prime minister since 2019. She has steered Denmark through the global COVID-19 pandemic and a controversial 2020 decision to wipe out Denmark\u2019s entire captive mink population to minimize the risk of the small mammals retransmitting the virus. Assaults on politicians in Denmark are rare. On March 23, 2003, two activists threw red paint on then-Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen inside the parliament and were immediately arrested. Foreign Minister Per Stig M\u00f8ller also suffered some splashes that day.", "summary": "A man who reportedly assaulted the Danish Prime Minister in central Copenhagen will appear in a pre-trial custody hearing on Saturday, authorities said.", "url": "https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2024/jun/8/man-who-reportedly-assaulted-danish-prime-minister/", "image": "https://media.washtimes.com/media/image/2024/06/07/Denmark_Prime_Minister_Assault_18029.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 15:53:58", "author": "Associated Press", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.178}

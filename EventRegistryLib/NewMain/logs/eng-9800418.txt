Along the way the jeweler overcame jealousy, the secret police and being sent into internal exile to rise to the pinnacle of his profession. It all began for Pirro -- as he is known in his homeland -- in 1985 when he was asked to make a medal in red and gold bearing the head of Enver Hoxha, the paranoid dictator who ruled the small Balkan nation with an iron fist for more than four decades.\n\n\"That saved me,\" he told AFP from his workshop tucked away in an alley in the capital Tirana.

The regime began to crumble and the collapse of Albania's communist rule in 1991 was followed by years of violent tumult as the country transitioned to a free-market economy. Amid the ups and downs, Pirro stayed busy designing pieces for officials and celebrities. During a trip to Basel in Switzerland in 2016, something new caught his eye. \"I wanted to make a watch.

ADNAN BECI / AFP\n\nAlbanian jeweler Pirro Ruco labored day and night for five years to capture the essence of his country in a spectacular luxury watch.\n\nNow the timepiece, worth roughly $1.4 million, is set to face off against the best watches from across the world at the Geneva Watchmaking Grand Prix in November, AFP said.\n\nSet under a sapphire dome, the hours are marked by 12 golden folk dancers -- each in different regional dress -- set on Murano glass, the minute and hour hands adorned with eagle talons in homage to Albania's national symbol.\n\nRuco's rollercoaster rise mirrors that of Albania, from poverty and isolation as the most closed communist regime in Europe, to rollicking capitalism.\n\nAlong the way the jeweler overcame jealousy, the secret police and being sent into internal exile to rise to the pinnacle of his profession.\n\nIt all began for Pirro -- as he is known in his homeland -- in 1985 when he was asked to make a medal in red and gold bearing the head of Enver Hoxha, the paranoid dictator who ruled the small Balkan nation with an iron fist for more than four decades.\n\n\"That saved me,\" he told AFP from his workshop tucked away in an alley in the capital Tirana.\n\nThe medals were awarded to the regime's most loyal supporters and later caught the eye of Hoxha's wife.\n\nThe turn of fortune saw thousands more produced and worn by communist cadres across Albania.\n\n\"All the congressional delegates had to wear it. I made a name for myself with it,\" he said. It also saved him from the textile mills where he had been sent because his family had been deemed \"rebellious\".\n\n'Priceless'\n\nAll this, however, was nearly derailed by an anonymous letter sent to authorities accusing Pirro of working with foreign agents.\n\nHe was questioned by intelligence agents and his workshop raided.\n\nDown but not out, he was able to bounce back after crafting a ring bearing the image of the late husband of a member of the communist politburo and in July 1990 won a prize for a piece featuring Albania's 15th-century national hero Skanderberg.\n\nBut the very next day history intervened. The regime began to crumble and the collapse of Albania's communist rule in 1991 was followed by years of violent tumult as the country transitioned to a free-market economy.\n\nAmid the ups and downs, Pirro stayed busy designing pieces for officials and celebrities.\n\nDuring a trip to Basel in Switzerland in 2016, something new caught his eye.\n\n\"I wanted to make a watch.

It was my new dream,\" he told reporters.\n\nFor the next five years, Ruco said that he focused on \"doing something special, Albanian, and at the same time completely new and never before seen in the watch industry.\"\n\nThe new timepiece, which he calls Primordial Passion, was designed in collaboration with Swiss watchmaker Agenhor.\n\n\"I never wanted to make jewelry, but art,\" the jeweler said. \"Sculptures, images of the country, pieces of culture... This watch is the culmination of all that, of this love for Albania.\"\n\n\"It is more than just a watch. It combines the rich heritage of ancient Albanian culture with the notion of chronometry,\" he said.\n\nRuco refuses to divulge the methods used to craft the watch, but remains hopeful the painstaking details would be recognized by the judges at the Geneva event.\n\nSeveral collectors have already contacted him about buying the timepiece, he said, although it would be difficult to part with his creation.\n\n\"I set a price because I had to, but for me, it is priceless,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "taipeitimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Taipei Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewellery", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jewellery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albania", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Albania"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Albania"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enver_Hoxha", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Enver Hoxha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venetian_glass", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Venetian glass"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist_Republic_of_Romania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Socialist Republic of Romania"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sapphire", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sapphire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_police", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Secret police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eagle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eagle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchmaker", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Watchmaker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dome", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exile", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Exile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Capitalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clock", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folk_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Folk music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watch", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Watch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Communism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Poverty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneva", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Geneva"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Geneva"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leninism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Leninism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textile_manufacturing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Textile manufacturing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paranoia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paranoia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politburo", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Politburo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balkans", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Balkans"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Espionage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tirana", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tirana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tirana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Albania"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basel", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basel"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Basel"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.taipeitimes.com/images/2024/08/09/P05-240809-310.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9800418", "eventUri": "eng-9800418", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "1990-07-", "textStart": 1880, "textEnd": 1889}], "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 195, "relevance": 1}

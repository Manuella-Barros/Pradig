During a recent interview with another famed Texas quarterback in his own right, Baylor's Heisman Trophy winner Robert Griffin III, the Texas signal-caller, explained why things did not work out for him at Ohio State.\n\n\"I made great relationships up there and still have good friends that go there. And for me, first off, it was really cold up there; you know, look, we're not quite used to all that,\" Ewers said jokingly on RG3 and The Ones. \"I just have so much more resources down here. I mean, this is where I'm from. I'm close to Austin, being up in Dallas. There's a lot more resources, [I'm] close to home, close to family members. It was just a little bit too far for me.\n\nAfter his junior year at Southlake Carroll High School, Ewers reclassified from the 2022 class to the 2021, forgoing his high school senior year to become a Buckeye. Still considered and ranked the number one overall recruit, according to On3's industry rankings, Ewers joined the Ohio State quarterback room with CJ Stroud and Kyle McCord. However, after one year in Columbus, the Dallas area native opted to return to his home state, and the rest is history.\n\nOhio State may not have been the ideal fit for Ewers, but at Texas, with head coach Steve Sarkisian, he appears to be right at home. After leading Texas to the College Football Playoff in 2023, the former number one overall recruit is looking to take it a step further in 2024 and bring the college football national championship back to Austin, TX, a place it has not been in nearly 20 years.\n\nSarkisian has continued his hot start on the recruiting trail at Texas. He made a big splash by landing Arch Manning. The top recruit in the country committed to the Longhorns, knowing Quinn Ewers would be the starter in 2023. That will again be the case in 2024 after he chooses to return to Austin for one more season.\n\nThat means Manning will again be in a backup role. But to Ewers, the nephew of Peyton and Eli is in a good situation entering his sophomore year - especially since he's now QB2 behind Ewers.\n\nManning might not be the starter at Texas yet, but Ewers thinks another year as a backup will pay off for him in the big picture. It goes beyond football, though. Manning will continue to learn more about representing UT while also honing in his knowledge of Sarkisian's system, and it'll help him find success when he takes the reins of the offense.\n\n\"I think that he gains a lot,\" Ewers told Griffin on RG3 and The Ones. \"Not being from the state and coming in, and it's obviously a little different. I think he's got more time to grow his pride and love for the university. Obviously, he loves the university and loves the Longhorns. But kind of being able to sit back and watch, I think it's different than playing. So him seeing what's going on from inside, but also outside, I think that he can get a lot of intel from that.\n\n\"And then, obviously, another year to learn the offense and just get more comfortable within the smaller details. It's, like, the best situation for him, I think.\"", "source": {"uri": "on3.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "On3"}, "authors": [{"uri": "justin_rudolph@on3.com", "name": "Justin Rudolph", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_State_Buckeyes_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ohio State Buckeyes football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Ewers", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dave Ewers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quinn_Ewers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Quinn Ewers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Griffin_III", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Robert Griffin III"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Austin, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Austin, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Sarkisian", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Steve Sarkisian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Longhorns_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas Longhorns football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heisman_Trophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Heisman Trophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carroll_Senior_High_School", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carroll Senior High School"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas\u2013Fort_Worth_metroplex", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dallas\u2013Fort Worth metroplex"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_State_Buckeyes", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ohio State Buckeyes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football_national_championships_in_NCAA_Division_I_FBS", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "College football national championships in NCAA Division I FBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_Football_Playoff", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "College Football Playoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbus,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Columbus, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Columbus, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Utah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Utah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Fitness", "label": "dmoz/Health/Fitness", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Fitness/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Fitness/Organizations", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Human_Resources/Recruiting_and_Retention", "label": "dmoz/Business/Human Resources/Recruiting and Retention", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Recruiting", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Recruiting", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://on3static.com/uploads/dev/assets/cms/2024/06/19223159/USATSI_22810851-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9668531", "eventUri": "eng-9668531", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 226, "relevance": 1}

Texas is returning a lot of their top talent, and they are expected to be one of the best teams in college football next year. Ewers has been a big reason why Texas has had success in recent years, but he didn't start his career with the Longhorns. He started it with Ohio State football, and he was there at the same time as CJ Stroud.\n\nCJ Stroud had a great career with the Ohio State football team, and Quinn Ewers started his career there before he transferred to Texas football. Ewers was rated extremely highly as a recruit, and Stroud said that he felt disrespected when Ohio State brought Ewers in. Robert Griffin III and Ewers talked about that experience during an episode of RG3 and The Ones, and Ewers did have some positives to take away from the experience despite the fit not being right.\n\nRobert Griffin III: \"How was the experience there with a guy like CJ Stroud, who came out and said that he felt he was a little disrespected that they brought you in there, how was that experience in itself being there?\"\n\nQuinn Ewers: \"I thought it was a good experience, I mean I learned a whole lot through Coach Day and that whole quarterback room, because we had some good quarterbacks in that room. Just learning from them being, like, the new guy coming in. I mean I came in the middle of fall camp up there, so that's, like, all I knew, that's what college football was for me, just fall camp. So, you know, going into that was definitely tough and you know I learned a lot from CJ, like how to prepare for games and what not, and it was just a good experience. But at the end of the day it just wasn't the right fit for me.\"\n\nQuinn Ewers is now in that position with Arch Manning\n\nNow, Quinn Ewers is in the same position at Texas football that CJ Stroud was in at Ohio State.

As former Five Star Plus+ prospects, they were among the only players ranked by all four major recruiting media companies as a five star during their respective cycles. They are also former No. 1-rated recruits from the 2021 and 2023 cycles, respectively, according to the On3 Industry Ranking, a weighted average that utilizes all four major recruiting media companies.\n\nManning appeared in two games last season, making his college debut in a blowout victory over Texas Tech in Lubbock. He not only sat behind Ewers on the depth chart, but also Maalik Murphy, who took over as the starter when Ewers suffered an injury.\n\nBut now, Murphy is at Duke after entering the transfer portal ahead of the College Football Playoff. Even after Ewers announced his plans to return to Texas, Manning followed through on his promise to stay even though some argued he should've hit the portal, as well. That helped Texas fortify its quarterback room once again with the SEC move looming, and Ewers thinks there's a case to call the Longhorns the best unit in the nation.\n\n\"I mean, you can call me biased, but I really think it's us,\" Ewers said. \"The way that we all prepare - y'all saw how the spring game went.

So him seeing kinda what's going on from inside but also outside, he can gain a lot of intel from that.\"\n\nEwers believes a second season as a backup will better prepare Manning to lead the Longhorns when his number is called.\n\n\"And then, obviously, another year to learn the offense and just get more comfortable within the smaller details,\" he added. \"It's like the best situation for him, I think.\"\n\nManning joined Austin as college football's most hyped recruit, but Ewers tightly grasped the starting job by steering Texas to the College Football Playoff. He finished his second season on Steve Sarkisian's team with 8.8 yards per pass attempt and a 69.0 completion percentage.\n\nEwers' return creates an enviable problem for Sarkisian, who brings back both former No. 1 recruits in 2024. Manning might also view his circumstances positively, as numerous programs likely would have gladly offered him a starting opportunity if he transferred.\n\nOf course, there's no guarantee Ewers will keep Manning sidelined for another full season.\n\nRelated: Quinn Ewers Reacts To Arch Manning's Spring Game Performance", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "andrew_gould@postandcourier.com", "name": "Andrew Gould", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Griffin_III", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Robert Griffin III"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Ewers", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dave Ewers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Longhorns_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Texas Longhorns football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quinn_Ewers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quinn Ewers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Sarkisian", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steve Sarkisian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_Football_Playoff", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "College Football Playoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "College football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Austin, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Austin, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Canadian", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Canadian", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Human_Resources/Recruiting_and_Retention", "label": "dmoz/Business/Human Resources/Recruiting and Retention", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Strength_Sports/Strongman", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Strength Sports/Strongman", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 53}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/e/1f/e1f205e4-c511-58c4-9731-59c5436f2818/66738b65d42fd.image.jpg?crop=1200%2C630%2C0%2C85&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9668531", "eventUri": "eng-9668531", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 219, "relevance": 1}

Deion Sanders' nice touch with one of his Colorado players after showing his amputated foot on Good Morning America\n\nArch Manning, the highly-touted recruit, is set to spend his second season as the backup quarterback to Quinn Ewers at the University of Texas. Ewers, the current starting quarterback, believes that this extended period of waiting will be beneficial for Manning's growth and development.\n\nDuring an interview on RG3 and The Ones, Ewers shared his thoughts with Robert Griffin III, emphasizing that Manning will benefit greatly from a gradual transition to the starting role. This approach allows Manning to adjust to his new environment both on and off the field.\n\n\"Coming from out of state, it's a different experience,\" Ewers mentioned, on RG3 and The Ones. \"This time gives him the opportunity to build a strong connection with the university. Watching and learning from the sidelines provides a unique perspective that playing right away can't offer. He can gather valuable insights from observing both the internal and external aspects of the game.\"\n\nEwers believes that another season as a backup will better equip Manning to take on the QB1 role when his time comes.\n\n\"Having an additional year to learn the offensive system and fine-tune the smaller details will be incredibly beneficial,\" Ewers added. \"It's an ideal situation for him to grow and prepare.\"\n\nManning arrived in Austin with immense hype, being one of the most celebrated recruits in recent memory. As the grandson of Archie Manning and the nephew of Peyton and Eli Manning, expectations were sky-high.\n\nDespite the excitement surrounding his arrival, Ewers solidified his starting position by guiding Texas to the College Football Playoff, posting impressive stats, including 8.8 yards per pass attempt and a 69.0 completion percentage.\n\nThe return of Ewers for the upcoming season presents a favorable scenario for head coach Steve Sarkisian, who will have the luxury of two former No.1 recruits on the roster in 2024.\n\nWhile Manning might have opted for immediate playing time at another program, remaining at Texas provides him with the chance to develop without the immediate pressure of leading the team.\n\nManning likely sees the benefits of his current situation. His role as a backup allows him to learn the complexities of the college game and master the Longhorns' playbook, ensuring he is fully prepared when he eventually steps into the starting role.\n\nWhile Ewers is expected to maintain his starting position, the unpredictable nature of college football means that circumstances could change, providing Manning with an opportunity to step up sooner than anticipated.\n\nAs the Longhorns gear up for the 2024 season, the quarterback situation will be closely watched by fans and analysts.

There are plenty of players lining up to be coached by Sarkisian and the first big name he recruited was Quinn Ewers. Originally at Ohio State, Ewers committed to Texas out of the NCAA transfer portal and is now entering his third season on the 40 Acres.\n\nEwers feels like there is no better place for a quarterback to play, saying Sarkisian knows what he's doing. Between his playing days at BYU and into professional football before moving into the coaching world, Sarkisian has a lengthy and successful resume when it comes to quarterback.\n\n\"He knows what it feels like to be in our shoes,\" Ewers told Robert Griffin III on RG3 and The Ones. \"We're getting a PhD in quarterback play here. He's been there, he's done that, he's had Heisman Trophy winners, he's had first-round draft picks. You'd be silly to not trust the guy.\"\n\nA lot of quarterbacks are trusting Sarkisian at the moment. Ewers should see results pay off next April where he is a projected first-round pick in the 2025 NFL Draft. And then there is Arch Manning hanging in the balance, getting a stamp of approval from arguably the first family in football.\n\nTexas just recently signed Trey Owens while having four-star KJ Lacey committed in the 2025 class and future five-star Dia Bell verbally pledged in 2026. Not a bad haul for Sarkisian, finding a signal caller he likes every cycle and locking them down.\n\nMore than just Ewers has decided to have faith in Sarkisian and what he does to develop the position. Theoretically, Texas has its quarterback plans sorted for the rest of the decade.\n\nGriffin then asked Ewers the main thing he has learned from Sarkisian, pointing to an old coaching adage about being smart with the football. Ewers has one of the best arms in college football but forcing deep shots is not on Sarkisian's agenda.\n\n\"From the day I got here, I think the thing I heard most from him was 'You can't go broke taking a profit.' Don't try to force those deep shots. He'll call them but he will call more of them if he trusts you to check one down if it's not there.\"\n\nEwers is hoping to improve there even more this season.

So much so, that he had ignored some issues just because he didn't want to miss out on the trip to the Grand Canyon.\n\nIt turns out, he had an infection. He had an infection and needed to be admitted to the hospital to receive fluids and antibiotics. After a day in a Vegas hospital, he was released and cleared to fly home one day later than planned. He got home safely and got some much needed rest and is doing much better.\n\nOh, and the cold I caught, wasn't a cold at all - it was COVID. And ... I wasn't the only one. My wife also caught it and has been much worse than I was. So ... I've been dealing with that all week and just wasn't able to come up with a clear topic for this week's column. (Just so you all know - everyone is now fine.)\n\nAll that being said, it dawned on me early this morning (Thursday) that what I really needed to do was reach into my past and go back to the old potluck suppers that we used to go to at church. You know, those dinners where there would be a little bit of everything spread out on the table in the refectory of the church?\n\nI always loved potluck dinners because it was the only place I ever had this kind of marshmallow fruit salad dish. I call it a marshmallow fruit salad dish ... but I honestly have no idea what it is. All I know is it is creamy, sweet, filled with fruit and I have never had it anywhere else other than at a potluck dinner. It's never been on any menu I've ever seen and my mother never made it either.\n\nSo, with all that being said, here is my potluck of Longhorn topics for you today and hopefully you'll find something in here that you love like I love that fruit salad stuff.\n\nTEXAS QUARTERBACKS:\n\nI have been bullish on Texas head coach Steve Sarkisian for a long time now. I believe that last season's college football playoff run will not be a flash in the pan season. We're not going to see a collapse like what we saw after UT beat Georgia in the 2019 Sugar Bowl. This team is built to last.\n\nThe biggest reason why I say that is simple ... Sarkisian is always going to have talent in the most important position in all of sports ... the quarterback.\n\nDia Bell, the 4-star talent out of Florida, gave a surprise commitment to Sark and the Longhorns this week (thank you @Anwar Richardson for going on vacation).\n\nBell is the nation's No. 2-ranked dual-threat quarterback and is currently No. 39 on the 2026 Rivals100.\n\nIn other words, he's good.\n\nBell also happens to be the son of former NBA Raja Bell. Bell was twice named to the All-NBA Defensive Team ... which means he put in the work.\n\nIn fact, Dia credits his Dad's work ethic as an example that he's tried to follow.\n\n\"He's always been someone I look up to,\" Bell said on Chalupa Batman's podcast. \"He went undrafted but still found a way to work himself back into the CBA (Continental Basketball Association) and then got picked up by the Sixers (Philadelphia). But just the work ethic you've seen throughout his career, I've been able to look up and kind of model my work ethic after him.\"\n\nNot for nothing, but Bell's mother was a star athlete as well. Cindy Greenman was an all-conference soccer player at Florida International University and is FIU's third all-time leading scorer. She met Bell his first day on campus and he had to use his work ethic to win her over as well. Or, as he put it; \"I pursued and conquered.\"\n\nBell joins an incredibly talented QB room led by Quinn Ewers, Arch Manning, Trey Owens and soon to be signed KJ Lacey.\n\nLacey said he's excited to see Bell joining him in Austin and the two are already friends.\n\n\"We played on the same seven-on-seven team, that's how I got to know him,\" Lacey told Longhorn Country while attending this week's Elite 11 competition. \"We just kinda clicked, we're homeboys now. After he went on his first visit at Texas he said they were his number one right now, I was like 'I already told you how it would be when you go up there'.\"\n\nLacey went on to say that nobody is a better quarterback recruiter than Sarkisian.\n\n\"When you go there you feel like a home, (there are) family vibes,\" Lacey said. \"On top of that, it's not just what they show you there but what you can be when you get there. They'll develop you to be the best.\"\n\nThe Texas quarterback room is STACKED and that means that Texas not only is back, but they aren't going anywhere for a long time.\n\nQUINN EWERS GOLDEN NUGGETS\n\nQuinn Ewers was on Robert Griffin III's podcast \"RG3 & The Ones\" this week and there were so many damn good nuggets, I'm making its own section.\n\nBy the way, what I am putting below is just SOME of the great comments from Quinn and RG3. I highly recommend giving the whole thing a watch or listen.\n\nEwers told RG3 that the competition is what sets the Texas QB room apart from any other school.\n\n\"The way we all prepare,\" Ewers told RG3 when explaining why Texas' QB room is the best. \"Y'all saw how the spring game went. We're all capable of making great plays. Sark and Coach Milwee have us dialed up.\"\n\nRG3 asked Ewers about the benefits for Arch sticking around Austin and not leaving for more immediate playing time.\n\n\"Him seeing what's going on from inside but also outside, I think that he can get a lot of intel from that,\" Ewers said. \"But obviously, another year to learn the offense and just get more comfortable within the smaller details. It's just the best situation for him, I think.\"\n\nAnd Ewers added that there is a very close bond among all of the quarterbacks.\n\n\"I think we're really intense competitors and we all want the same outcome, but at the end of the day I think we're better humans and I think we're better people. We really enjoy each other's company in that quarterback room. During the season, we do quarterback dinners every Tuesday and we go have dinner together after Tuesday meetings. I've never been in a closer room. All three years we've had a super close room. My first year here, me and Hudson Card were in a quarterback battle but at the same time, we're all hanging out on weekends, going to dinners, enjoying each others company. So yeah, football means a lot to all of us but being good humans means more.\"\n\nThe bond in the quarterback room does not stop the QB's from competing against each other every day. And that's because Ewers says competition is at the core of what the Longhorns do every day.\n\nWhenever I hear about strong competitions in football, I always think about Pete Carroll. I heard Carroll talk about competition when he was the head coach at USC and it stuck with me. He said that he recruited the best to play against the best because he wanted a heated competition at every position and if a freshman or sophomore beat out an upper classman who had been starting, he was ok with that.\n\nCompetition is so ingrained in Pete Carroll's football DNA that he is still talking about it to this day (or at least, he talked about it on Wednesday).\n\nObviously Sark cut his coaching teeth under Carroll at USC. And now he has brought that love of competition (which was reinforced during his time at Alabama under Nick Saban) to Austin.\n\n\"I think that he (Sarkisian) has brought a winning culture back to the university and I think that's the main thing,\" Ewers said. \"The way that we practice and the way that we work out, I don't think there's another team in the country that takes more pride in how hard we practice, and I believe that.\"\n\nIf that doesn't get you pumped up for the upcoming football season, I don't know what will.\n\nSurely, by now, most of you have lost some of the bitterness over Texas coming up short in the college football playoff game against Washington? Ewers didn't have even a trace of bitterness in his voice when RG3 asked him about the game, but he did say he learned a lesson from the loss that he is continuing to work on.\n\n\"I didn't start out how I wanted to,\" Ewers told RG3. \"We went three and out with a false start in the first drive and that's just a terrible start. You just have to learn how to flush those. I think that's the biggest thing for me, continuing on this year is just flushing those bad plays and bad drives.\"\n\nAfter hearing that, I made a mental note that throughout the season, I will be watching Ewers to see how he responds to slow starts or adverse plays.\n\nEwers also said he has learned, in previous games and in practice, to really listen and take to heart a Sark saying that he repeats often ... 'you can't go broke taking a profit.\"\n\nIn other words, if the deep ball isn't there, take the checkdown.\n\n\"I just wish I knew that when I had Bijan in the backfield,\" Ewers said with a chuckle. \"But all of these guys (currently on the roster) can make the same plays. Just having those playmakers, just like you said, get the ball in the playmakers hands. You never know what's going to happen. They could break one tackle and it could be a game changer.\"\n\nThe checkdown is a big lesson for Ewers to learn, but it has been the deep ball that has given the redshirt junior the most trouble in his time in Austin. But Ewers reportedly had a very good spring throwing deep.\n\n\"I've gained a lot of confidence in pushing the ball down field and having to fit the ball in a smaller window,\" he said.\n\nIf the deep ball starts hitting at a higher rate, this offense will be among the very best in the country ... even going up against SEC defenses every week as part of the new conference.\n\nEwers said he's always wanted to play in the SEC.\n\n\"It's just like that Southern lifestyle, football and family,\" said Ewers. \"We just feel like it means more and we're excited to be a part of it.\"\n\nIt just means more? Sounds like QB1 is ready for the SEC Media Days which kicks off in just a few weeks on Monday, July 15th.\n\nWHAT'S GOING ON WITH BASEBALL?\n\nWe're still waiting for the axe to fall on Texas baseball coach David Pierce (not to be too crass about a man losing his job). But every source Orangebloods has spoken with has indicated that a change is going to be made ... we just don't know when.\n\nLogic would dictate that the fact that athletic director Chris Del Conte hasn't made a move yet means that he is waiting for his preferred replacement coach to wrap up his season before making a change. That would indicate that Texas A&M head coach Jim Schlossnagle is the guy.\n\nI've long thought Schloss was the eventual replacement (even knowing that A&M will do what they can to try to keep him).\n\nHowever, I'm now not so certain that will be the case if A&M goes on to win its first ever College World Series.\n\nI don't believe A&M has the same resources they had when they money-whipped Jimbo Fisher. In addition to still paying Fisher to sit on the beach, they have already laid off a lot of their athletic department staff and the impending House vs. NCAA settlement means they are going to have to add close to $30 million a year in expenditures to players. Money is just plain tighter.\n\nHowever, they did get $80 million earmarked to update their baseball facilities. They have clearly funneled a lot of money into their baseball NIL collective (exceeding what Texas has done so far). And if Schloss wins it all this weekend, they will move heaven and earth to keep him away from Austin.\n\nIf you're cheering for Schlossnagle to make it to UT, then you have to bank on two things. One, that the other UT (Tennessee) beats A&M in Omaha this weekend. Two, that Schloss' personal relationship with Del Conte is enough to sway the day.\n\nIf A&M does win it all and Del Conte still is able to pull Schloss away from College Station then that would be the coup to end all coups. Nothing would say \"little brother\" more than that.\n\nIt wouldn't be the first time this year that Del Conte will have hired away a coach after winning a national championship at another school. CDC patiently waited and then hired Bob Bowman to lead the swim team just days after Bowman won the NCAA's with Arizona State. But hiring away a swim coach from the Sun Devils is a whole rung (or three) below being able to hire away a baseball coach from your arch rivals after he brings them their first ever CWS title.\n\nIn the meantime, Texas baseball is caught in limbo and it is hurting their ability to put together a competitive team for next season.\n\nTexas has been non-existent in the baseball transfer portal which is currently up and running. None of the top players who have gone in (and have yet to commit somewhere) are talking about UT.\n\nThat will obviously change is Del Conte gets an exciting new hire put in place ... but if CDC doeesn't hire someone new and decides to stick with Pierce instead then Texas' first season playing baseball in the SEC could be pretty rough.\n\nSo for now ... we wait.\n\nBIG RECRUITING WEEKEND:\n\nI can't lay claim to being much of a recruiting maven but I know enough to know that this is another huge recruiting weekend on the 40 Acres.\n\nThe aforementioned KJ Lacey will be in town for his official visit. This is Sark's chance to put to bed any concerns anyone might have about Lacey going somewhere else (like Auburn) ... not that I think you need to worry too much about that.\n\nAlso, Lacey has been working on 5-star wide receiver Jamie Ffrench while the two have been competing at this week's Elite 11 camp. French will be in town for his official visit as well so those two can continue to build a bond which can only help in Ffrench's recruitment.\n\nKaliq Lockett is another five-star receiver who will be here for his official visit.\n\nThe dream of Dakorien Moore, Jamie Ffrench and Kaliq Lockett all coming to Austin is still alive - for now. And if Sark can pull that off, there will be no one more happy about that development than the loaded QB room that we talked about earlier in the column.\n\nBut the big dog (literally big) coming to campus is 5-star offensive tackle Michael Fasusi.\n\nAs @Alex Dunlap said in his column this week ... it's Fasusi, no matter what.\n\nBy the way, I know the movie \"Draft Day\" is cheesy and unrealistic, but I still thoroughly enjoy the flick and watch it every year.\n\nJust look at this \"nugget\" from Alex's column:\n\nTWEETS OF INTEREST:\n\nJust how important is portal recruiting when it comes to baseball? Apparently it is the new lifeblood of every winning program.\n\nYou need look no further than last year to see what a team can do when it comes to winning with portal players. LSU loaded up on portal guys and then balled out on their way to an NCAA title.\n\nTennessee and A&M have done a damn good job in the portal as well.\n\n#######################\n\nFor all of you who bemoan the portal ... it protects the players. Period. Just listen to this little story about what life was like before the portal.\n\n#######################\n\nThis is the cold, hard truth in recruiting. It's almost ALWAYS about the physical attributes.\n\n#######################\n\nThis is news you can use while Texas starts is SEC journey and y'all venture out for new road trip destinations.\n\n#######################\n\nThe Texas football team may be enduring ungodly heat during their summer workouts right now ... but things are a little different at Montana State.\n\n#######################\n\nMy man @AaronLittleOB , who is the only Chargers fan I know, is pumped up for what Jim Harbaugh is bringing to his LA Chargers ... but not more pumped up than Harbaugh is to have Dicker the Kicker wearing the powder blues.\n\n#######################\n\nThis is the cold, hard truth in recruiting. It's almost ALWAYS about the physical attributes.\n\n#######################\n\nI mentioned I was in Vegas last week (only lost $100 ... which I consider a win). Poker players have been selling stakes of themselves for a long time. You can buy a percentage of a players buy-in for a tournament and if they win, you get a cut of the prize pool.\n\nThat move is now making it's way to the NFL.\n\nBarron Browning, who snubbed an offer from UT to go play for Ohio State back in the day, is selling a piece of his future NFL contract in exchange for cold, hard cash today.\n\nHere's the offer.\n\nFor just $10 per share, you can buy a piece of Browning's future NFL earnings. He is making between 60,000 and 100,000 shares available for sale. The investors will then split 1% of his future NFL earnings.\n\nBrowning is currently playing on his rookie contract but he will soon be up for a second contract and that's when the real money kicks in.\n\nOf course, if he were to get hurt or something were to prevent him from ever signing a second deal, then he would be screwed.\n\nBy taking the money now, he is getting cash up front that he can invest or spend as he sees fit.\n\nHis investors now assume some of the risk of injury.\n\nBut here's the thing ... if this kind of deal catches on in the NFL, then it is only a matter of time before some industrious young high school football player makes the same type of bet against future NIL earnings.\n\n#######################\n\nSpeaking of investments ... I am down to throw some dollars into this little venture.", "source": {"uri": "texas.forums.rivals.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Texas Longhorns fan forums - Orangebloods"}, "authors": [],

In an interview with Richie Sadlier for the Second Captains podcast, the Tolka Park boss admitted that the prospect of taking on the international job would drive him \u201cinsane\u201d and he has no desire to take a job in England for at least six or seven years while his two children are still in school. Duff has taken Shels to the top of the League of Ireland Premier Division and could deliver the club\u2019s first top flight title in 18 years. He was outspoken earlier this week about the FAI\u2019s handling of appointing a permanent manager as well as the future of John O\u2019Shea who was named in interim charge for a second time ahead of next month\u2019s friendlies with Hungary and Portugal. Duff, who earned 100 caps for his country, previously revealed how he was contacted by a third party at the start of the FAI\u2019s search process last year and stressed again how the Ireland job wouldn\u2019t entice him away from his current role having previously experienced the working dynamics while an assistant coach on Stephen Kenny\u2019s staff. \u201cNo, it would drive me insane. Here, I had the eight, nine months with Stephen and you\u2019re in an office everyday doing nothing. Just pottering around. Here, I love a siesta, going back to bed. No, there is nothing better than going in and being with the players, our players. \u201cIt\u2019s special, it\u2019s beautiful, you\u2019re building bonds everyday, whereas what do international coaches, managers do? They might fly over and meet the player at the training ground. \u201cAre you really building a bond? Nah, you build bonds on Friday nights here in Ireland, Monday nights. In England Saturday afternoon. It doesn\u2019t interest me whatsoever [to manage Ireland] because I\u2019m learning too much at the moment.\u201d Step into Damien Duff's very, very nice garden shed with Richie and IOut now on Episode with Richie Sadlier ??https://t.co/DotTFCt6cI pic.twitter.com/gKZZeBbcAD\u2014 Killian Down (@KillianDown) May 29, 2024 When pressed if it was something more likely to interest him in the future, Duff added: \u201cNot really. I honestly don\u2019t look beyond tomorrow, and I\u2019m poor at that. As a player I knew what I wanted. Now, post [playing] career, I didn\u2019t know what I wanted. People have criticised me. \u2018Oh, you\u2019re a coach now, do you want to manage in England, do you want to manage Ireland? No, I\u2019m just happy where I am. It\u2019s not a right mindset, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good mindset, but I am incredibly happy just working with special, special people everyday at Shelbourne. \u201cTo look that far ahead, do I want to manage Ireland? Do you know what? I just want to win trophies with Shelbourne. That is the ambition. Would I go to England? I\u2019ve no interest. My kids have six, seven years left in school. Celtic was bloody amazing, a special time of my life the learning I got, I was spoiled but I\u2019m not leaving my kids again when they\u2019re this young. \u201cMaybe that\u2019s why I don\u2019t look too far down the line with ambition and Ireland manager. If you\u2019re happy, why change? I don\u2019t know.\u201d", "summary": "The Shelbourne boss wants to deliver trophies at Tolka Park and says there is no desire to move back to England.", "url": "https://www.the42.ie/damien-duff-ireland-3-6392787-May2024/", "image": "https://img2.thejournal.ie/article/6392787/river/?height=400&version=6392824", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 13:45:52", "author": "View All Articles", "authors": ["View All Articles"], "language": "en", "source_country": "ie", "sentiment": -0.074}

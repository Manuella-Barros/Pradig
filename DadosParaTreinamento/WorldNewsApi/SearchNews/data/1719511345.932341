{"id": 223786322, "title": "Learn from how business does business", "text": "\u201cYou will eat the fruit of your labour; blessings and prosperity will be yours.\u201d \u2013 Psalm 128:2 In the ever-evolving landscape of global and Caribbean business practices, the distinction between the private sector practices and operations of non-private enterprises, statutory corporations, trade unions, NGOs, churches, and the civil service is becoming increasingly blurred. This trend toward integration is primarily driven by implementing private-sector methodologies within traditionally non-commercial spaces. Throughout my career, spanning leadership roles in private sector organisations (local, regional, and global) and Caribbean business startups to consultancy in transforming statutory bodies and strategising for trade unions and NGOs, I\u2019ve observed first-hand the global shift towards efficiency. The evolution of Singapore from a fledgling small island state to a first-world country is a primary example. My interactions, ranging from discussions with clergy to understanding the civil service through literature, have reinforced my belief in the universal applicability of private sector strategies. I recall engaging in robust discussions with clergy members to persuade them that managing a church requires business acumen. On a different note, my first-hand experience with the civil service was a six-week internship as a student at age 21. However, this year, I found Selwyn Smith\u2019s book My Journey Through the Civil Service a fascinating read, offering me deeper insights into the sector. Private sector organisations are often lauded for their efficiency, agility and innovative approaches. These approaches manifest as technology integration for streamlined operations, utilisation of performance metrics, adoption of lean management, formation of strategic partnerships, and fostering adaptive leadership. However, these strategies, rooted in the pursuit of profit maximisation and shareholder value, can be adapted to significantly benefit non-private sector organisations without compromising their core values or objectives. One notable contribution of the private sector is the application of technology to streamline operations. Many Caribbean public agencies and NGOs have begun leveraging digital tools for improved data management, communication, and service delivery. For example, a government department transitioning to a digital-first approach for public inquiries and services can significantly minimise redundancies and improve response times. Similarly, integrating Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems is a testament to this shift. Adopting performance metrics and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) is another practice gaining traction outside the private sector. Traditionally, entities like trade unions and churches may not have focused on performance beyond financial audits. However, now utilising SMART criteria, these organisations can better evaluate their programmes\u2019 effectiveness. A trade union, for example, could employ KPIs to assess and refine its member education programmes, relying on data rather than anecdotal evidence. Lean management techniques, which focus on maximising value while minimising waste, are proving invaluable across various organisations, especially when resources are scarce. Training staff in lean management enables NGOs and similar bodies to allocate a greater portion of their funds towards programme goals rather than administrative expenses. Strategic partnerships, a hallmark of private sector success, are finding resonance within public entities and NGOs in the Caribbean. These alliances allow businesses to leverage each other\u2019s strengths, underscoring the potential of cross-sector collaboration. Lastly, the concept of adaptive leadership, prevalent in the private sector, proves invaluable for organisations outside the private sphere. This leadership approach underscores the importance of continuous learning, resilience and flexibility \u2013 qualities essential for navigating these organisations\u2019 complex challenges. By integrating an adaptive leadership model, leaders in these sectors can cultivate an environment ripe for innovation and continuous improvement. As the boundaries between various organisational types blur, sharing best practices becomes increasingly vital. This pragmatic approach incorporates proven strategies that boost efficiency and effectiveness. In doing so, these organisations are better positioned to serve their communities and achieve their overarching goals. Dr Basil Springer GCM is a corporate governance adviser.

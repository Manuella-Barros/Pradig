Emotional moment two candidates are elected on first count for Kilkenny", "text": "There were scenes of celebration at the count centre in Lyrath Estate this afternoon, as Cllrs Andrew McGuinness (FF) and David Fitzgerald (FG) were sucessfully elected on the first count for Kilkenny City LEA. Andrew was lifted aloft by his brothers MJ and John Jnr, and his son Jack, and cheered by supporters including parents John and Margaret as the votes were confirmed. David, with his votes also surpassing the quota, embraced his wife Paula and was congratulated by friends and family. Both men had a long time to wait to find out the result, with results only announced at 5pm, despite starting more or less first thing this morning. The number of candidates and the length of the ballot paper has played a role in delays, plus a double-checking of the bundles from the initial count. Now, Andrew's surpluses will be distributed, with the remaining five seats of Kilkenny LEA to be determined over the coming hours. Stay posted here - more analysis and reaction to follow, including intereviews with successful candidates on Kilkenny Live.", "summary": "<table><tr><td><img src=\"https://www.kilkennypeople.ie/resizer/300/200/true/5d3826334ba2b727c48d6e8a9cce2aec.jpg--.jpg\" alt=\"\" align=\"left\" />There were scenes of celebration at the count centre in Lyrath Estate this afternoon, as Cllrs Andrew McGuinness (FF) and David Fitzgerald (FG) were sucessfully elected on the first count for Kilkenny City LEA.

It had taken away some of the joy of golf. But I decided I had to be nice to myself.\"\n\nIn the mixture of rain and sun, she birdied the second and then four in a row from the fifth. More birdies came at the 11th and 12th.\n\nPark Inbee, the 2015 champion at Turnberry, made a surge through the field by equalling the course record 64. On ten under, she is still a threat.\n\nThe 29-year-old seven-time major winner made the cut with just a shot to spare, but a flawless eight-birdie round raised hopes of a second win in Scotland.\n\nPark played alongside another former champion, Stacy Lewis, and the American, who won over the Old Course at St Andrews four years ago, also showed her hunger for a second victory at the 'home of golf' with a 65 for nine-under.\n\nPark ruled women's golf and was the world number one for over a year in 2013/14, but she came into the week unhappy with a normally plus point of her game, her ball striking. \"But today was much better,\" she said.\n\n\"Over the first two days I struggled with the putter. But I holed some and to have eight birdies and no dropped shots makes me very happy.\n\n\"I always enjoy playing in twosomes. Play is much quicker and Stacy and I both played some great golf.

It had taken away some of the joy of golf. But I decided I had to be nice to myself.\"\n\nIn the mixture of rain and sun, she birdied the second and then four in a row from the fifth.

Heavy rain was falling. The temperature was dropping. If that wasn't enough, Inbee Park had just toured Kingsbarns Links in a course record-tying 64 and was one shot behind. Stacy Lewis, another past Women's British Open champion, was another shot back after a 65.\n\nKim answered every challenge Saturday.\n\nIn weather that turned out better than expected - only one heavy shower - Kim shot a bogey-free 66 by converting a string of birdie putts. With one round to play, the 29-year-old South Korean was at 17-under 199 and had a six-shot lead over Georgia Hall (70) and Moriya Jutanugarn (67), the older sister of defending champion Ariya Jutanugarn.\n\nLexi Thompson, who started the third round just two shots behind, stumbled to a 74 and wound up 10 shots back.\n\nKim, five years removed from infamously missing a 1-foot putt to win the Kraft Nabisco Championship, now is poised for redemption with her first major.\n\nEven armed with such a substantial lead, there will be pressure on her stamina and usually reliable putting stroke. Even five years on, the memory lives on of her clasping her hand over her mouth when she missed her tap-in for victory, eventually losing in a playoff to Sun-Young Yoo.\n\n\"I have finally been able to let go of that,\" Kim said. \"I was disappointed with my golf after 2012. I criticized myself too much, which is not healthy. So it was tough. I never stopped liking the game, but what happened did take away some of the joy. I certainly don't get surprised by anything anymore.\"\n\nShould she falter in the race for her first major and the $487,500 first-place prize, there is plenty of experience in her wake - from Park, the biggest star on the LPGA Tour over the last decade, and from Lewis.\n\nBoth took advantage of the benign morning weather to make substantial progress up the leaderboard. Park rose from a tie for 48th to a tie for fourth alongside Ally McDonald, who shot a 70. Lewis moved all the way up to a tie for sixth.\n\n\"I putted great and hit the ball great,\" Park said. \"That's something I have been really struggling with for the last month. It doesn't matter how many shots I'm back. I'll just try to play my golf tomorrow. That's all I can do.\"\n\nLewis also credited an improved performance to her putting - and her mother.\n\n\"I really putted pretty poorly the first two days,\" Lewis said. \"My mom told me I needed to take my putter straighter back. And that's what I worked on today.\"\n\nIn contrast to the success of those players still owning a vague chance of victory, Thompson ended her chances with a sloppy display both on and off the greens. Despite three birdies on the back nine, Thompson took a double bogey on the 16th hole on her way to 74.\n\nShe was tied for 13th, along with Michelle Wie, who rallied from a 76 on Friday to post a 69.", "eventUri": "eng-3334995", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2017-08-05", "title": "Kim builds a 6-shot lead in Women's British Open", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-05", "id": "15602360", "extractedDates": null, "storyUri": "eng-3340141", "time": "21:06:00", "details": {}, "concepts": [{"score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}, "id": "121", "location": {"label": {"eng": "South Korea"}, "type": "country"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kingsbarns"}, "id": "87299", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Kingsbarns"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingsbarns", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "label": {"eng": "Golf"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "302727"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LPGA", "label": {"eng": "LPGA"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "305037"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_British_Open", "label": {"eng": "Women's British Open"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "363429"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stacy_Lewis", "label": {"eng": "Stacy Lewis"}, "type": "person", "id": "372026"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexi_Thompson", "label": {"eng": "Lexi Thompson"}, "type": "person", "id": "372027"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inbee_Park", "label": {"eng": "Inbee Park"}, "type": "person", "id": "456101"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariya_Jutanugarn", "label": {"eng": "Ariya Jutanugarn"}, "type": "person", "id": "650302"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moriya_Jutanugarn", "label": {"eng": "Moriya Jutanugarn"}, "type": "person", "id": "1041414"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANA_Inspiration", "label": {"eng": "ANA Inspiration"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "1272858"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoo_Sun-young", "label": {"eng": "Yoo Sun-young"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "1435241"}], "url": "http://www.wftv.com/news/kim-builds-a-6shot-lead-in-womens-british-open/582705437", "timeCrawl": "21:06:00", "image": "https://cmgfeeds.cmgdigital.com/photo/2017/08/05/Britain_Golf_Womens_Open_93079_8782133_ver1.0_1280_720.jpg", "location": null, "dateTime": "2017-08-05T21:06:00Z", "originalArticle": null, "sim": 0.8235294222831726}

The 27-year-old American shot 30 on the back nine and wound up one shot ahead of I.K. Kim of South Korea.\n\nLindy Duncan was another shot behind at 66, with Lexi Thompson among those at 67.\n\nWie, showing no sign of the neck spasms that forced her to withdraw from last month's U.S. Women's Open, posted nine birdies during a morning round played in almost perfect weather on the eastern coast of Scotland.\n\nOnly later did torrential downpours and the threat of lightning twice disrupt play for a total of 74 minutes.\n\nLaura Davies was one who suffered from the interruptions. Six-under par through 14 holes, the 53-year old from England finished in a mildly disappointing 68, the same score posted by Charley Hull, Britain's top player.\n\nThere were no such problems for Wie. Such was the overall serenity of her progress, the Hawaii native even had time to take in the stunning vistas across what she referred to as the \"ocean,\" which is actually the Tay Estuary.\n\nFollowing the early dropped shot - a badly skulled lob wedge finished far over the second green - she reeled off three birdies before the turn. Over the back nine, it only got better with six birdies in the final eight holes.\n\n\"It's so gorgeous here,\" said Wie, who has not won since claiming the U.S. Women's Open at Pinehurst in 2014. \"When the weather is nice, it almost felt like I was playing back home in Hawaii with the views and everything. I feel like I got extremely lucky with the conditions out there.\"\n\nStill, no one else in the 144-player field took as much advantage. The lack of wind and softness underfoot left the 6,697-yard course all but defenceless and allowed Wie to use her high-flying lofted woods to great effect. Six of her nine birdies resulted from approach shots with metals, the 9- and 11-woods that have been in her bag since June proving most effective.\n\n\"Callaway has done a great job of accommodating me,\" Wie said. \"They had to look back into their archives to find me an 11-wood. I've never played such high-lofted woods before. The 11-wood goes 180-yards, the same distance as my 5-iron but is a lot easier to hit than a blade. The 9-wood replaces my 4-hybrid and goes 190 to 195 yards.\"\n\nAs for Thompson, the big-hitting Floridian relied less on the yardage book and more on her caddie.

ANDREWS, Scotland -- Finishing fast after a slow start, Michelle Wie birdied her last three holes Thursday for an 8-under 64 for a one-shot lead in the Women's British Open.\n\nWie bogeyed the par-5 second hole at Kingsbarns Links, and that was the last of her mistakes. The 27-year-old American shot 30 on the back nine and wound up one shot ahead of I.K. Kim of South Korea.\n\nLindy Duncan was another shot behind at 66, with Lexi Thompson among those at 67.\n\nWie, showing no sign of the neck spasms that forced her to withdraw from last month's U.S. Women's Open, posted nine birdies during a morning round played in almost perfect weather on the eastern coast of Scotland.\n\nOnly later did torrential downpours and the threat of lightning twice disrupt play for a total of 74 minutes.\n\nLaura Davies was one who suffered from the interruptions. Six-under par through 14 holes, the 53-year old from England finished in a mildly disappointing 68, the same score posted by Charley Hull, Britain's top player.\n\nThere were no such problems for Wie. Such was the overall serenity of her progress, the Hawaii native even had time to take in the stunning vistas across what she referred to as the \"ocean,\" which is actually the Tay Estuary.\n\nFollowing the early dropped shot -- a badly skulled lob wedge finished far over the second green -- she reeled off three birdies before the turn. Over the back nine, it only got better with six birdies in the final eight holes.\n\n\"It's so gorgeous here,\" said Wie, who has not won since claiming the U.S. Women's Open at Pinehurst in 2014. \"When the weather is nice, it almost felt like I was playing back home in Hawaii with the views and everything. I feel like I got extremely lucky with the conditions out there.\"\n\nStill, no one else in the 144-player field took as much advantage. The lack of wind and softness underfoot left the 6,697-yard course all but defenseless and allowed Wie to use her high-flying lofted woods to great effect. Six of her nine birdies resulted from approach shots with metals, the 9- and 11-woods that have been in her bag since June proving most effective.\n\n\"Callaway has done a great job of accommodating me,\" said Wie. \"They had to look back into their archives to find me an 11-wood.

However, 12 pars in a row would follow from there, leaving her eight shots ahead of My Leander - the only other amateur to make the cut.\n\nIn the final group of the day there was drama to finish after six birdies in the first 12 holes had taken Kim into a six-shot lead only for playing partner Hall -- who had earlier driven the green on the fifth to set up an eagle -- to birdie the 13th, 14th and 15th.\n\nHowever, Hall then bogeyed the 16th and four-putted the 17th for a double-bogey six to card a two-under-par 70, her highest score of the week.\n\n\"I played a lot better than two under, just on 17 I could hardly see the green,\" Hall, 21, told Sky Sports.\n\n\"I thought I hit a good shot but ended up with a very hard putt and the green is so steep.

who was unable to defend her title last year due to injury, raced to the turn in 31 and picked up three more shots on the back nine in a bogey-free round which was almost matched by playing partner Stacy Lewis, who returned a 65.\n\n\"I hadn't putted that well the first two days but they cut the greens a little more today and they were a bit faster and suited perfectly to my putter,\" Park said.\n\n\"I was able to hole a lot of putts.\n\n\"I haven't been striking the ball well but a couple of things clicked this week and I started to get some confidence back.\"\n\nLewis, who won at St

ANDREWS, Scotland (AP) -- I.K. Kim stood on the first tee at the Women's British Open and seemed to have everything going against her.\n\nThe wind was rising. Heavy rain was falling. The temperature was dropping. If that wasn't enough, Inbee Park had just toured Kingsbarns Links in a course record-tying 64 and was one shot behind. Stacy Lewis, another past Women's British Open champion, was another shot back after a 65.\n\nKim answered every challenge Saturday.\n\nIn weather that turned out better than expected - only one heavy shower - Kim shot a bogey-free 66 by converting a string of birdie putts. With one round to play, the 29-year-old South Korean was at 17-under 199 and had a six-shot lead over Georgia Hall (70) and Moriya Jutanugarn (67), the older sister of defending champion Ariya Jutanugarn.\n\nLexi Thompson, who started the third round just two shots behind, stumbled to a 74 and wound up 10 shots back.\n\nKim, five years removed from infamously missing a 1-foot putt to win the Kraft Nabisco Championship, now is poised for redemption with her first major.\n\nEven armed with such a substantial lead, there will be pressure on her stamina and usually reliable putting stroke. Even five years on, the memory lives on of her clasping her hand over her mouth when she missed her tap-in for victory, eventually losing in a playoff to Sun-Young Yoo.\n\n\"I have finally been able to let go of that,\" Kim said. \"I was disappointed with my golf after 2012. I criticized myself too much, which is not healthy. So it was tough. I never stopped liking the game, but what happened did take away some of the joy. I certainly don't get surprised by anything anymore.\"\n\nShould she falter in the race for her first major and the $487,500 first-place prize, there is plenty of experience in her wake - from Park, the biggest star on the LPGA Tour over the last decade, and from Lewis.\n\nBoth took advantage of the benign morning weather to make substantial progress up the leaderboard. Park rose from a tie for 48th to a tie for fourth alongside Ally McDonald, who shot a 70. Lewis moved all the way up to a tie for sixth.\n\n\"I putted great and hit the ball great,\" Park said. \"That's something I have been really struggling with for the last month. It doesn't matter how many shots I'm back. I'll just try to play my golf tomorrow.

And that's what I worked on today.\"\n\nIn contrast to the success of those players still owning a vague chance of victory, Thompson ended her chances with a sloppy display both on and off the greens.

An unusual comparison to be sure six miles from the Auld Grey Toon, but it did feel an awful lot like paradise on Day 1 of the Ricoh Women's British Open.\n\nWie took advantage of tame, sunny conditions at Kingsbarns to post an 8-under 64 and leads a major championship for the first time since she won the 2014 U.S. Women's Open.\n\n\"I think Kingsbarns is definitely one of the most scenic golf courses I've ever played on,\" Wie said. \"You definitely get lost in the views out there.\"\n\nThe leaderboard is awash in red, white and blue, though not all the names will be familiar to casual golf fans. Lindy Duncan, a former college player of the year at Duke who is playing in her first Women's British Open, shot 66 . Morgan Pressel posted a 68, her best round since late June, as did Ally McDonald (also a first-timer at the WBO) and Jaye Marie Green. Cristie Kerr, who has shown good form of late, added a 69.\n\n\"It's definitely one of the best golf courses I've ever played,\" Pressel said. \"It's gorgeous, but a great test of golf.\"\n\nPressel hasn't cracked the top 20 since the ShopRite LPGA Classic on June 4. While the Solheim Cup looms, Pressel simply wants to ride the momentum of a fine opening round.\n\n\"It's been a struggle this year,\" she said, \"and I just really would love to continue to play well this week. That's my plan, not really too much worried about Solheim.\"\n\nWie withdrew from the U.S. Women's Open with neck spams and went immediately to New York City, where she had an epidural and a block injection. She didn't pick up a club until the day before she left to play in the Aberdeen Asset Ladies Scottish Open.\n\n\"I'm pretty confident out there that my neck is going to hold up,\" Wie said. \"It's just a couple of times, it's so hard here, it's just sometimes it feels like you're hitting into concrete. It kind of vibrates a little bit, but it's never to the point where there's pain or anything, so I feel extremely lucky.\"\n\nWie skulled a lob wedge straight over the green from the \"perfect spot\" on the second hole and made bogey. She got angry after that and \"nuked\" her next drive. A birdie on the fourth hole from 15 feet sent her sailing. She carded six birdies in her last eight holes.\n\nAt the KPMG Women's PGA Championship, Wie put an 11-wood in the bag to replace her 5-iron. This week she also has a 9-wood in the bag, which she used to make birdie from 20 feet on the 12th, 4 feet on the 14th and 6 feet on the 16th.\n\n\"I was talking to Meg Mallon about it,\" said Wie. \"I was like, you won't believe what's in my bag right now. I've got an 11-wood. She's like 'Yeah, I won the U.S. Open with a 13-wood.' \"\n\nWie said Callaway had to go to the archives to find her the 11-wood. She hits the 9-wood from 190 yards and the 11-wood from 180. She's also using the 11-wood from off the green for bump-and-run shots.\n\nWie's last three starts at the WBO can be summed up in five different letters: CUT-WD-CUT. In the past, Wie said, she has tried to change too much about her game to fit links golf. Competing in last week's Scottish Open helped her to acclimate to a style of golf the creative player has grown to love.\n\nWill she tune in for the afternoon coverage and hope that the wind kicks up?\n\n\"No, I actually don't watch golf,\" she said. \"I'll probably take a nap for sure.\"", "eventUri": "eng-3334995", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2017-08-03", "title": "Michelle Wie fires

Six-under par through 14 holes, the 53-year old from England finished in a mildly disappointing 68, the same score posted by Charley Hull, Britain's top player.\n\nThere were no such problems for Wie. Such was the overall serenity of her progress, the Hawaii native even had time to take in the stunning vistas across what she referred to as the \"ocean,\" which is actually Tay Estuary.\n\nFollowing the early dropped shot - a badly skulled lob wedge finished far over the second green - she reeled off three birdies before the turn. Over the back nine, it only got better with six birdies in the final eight holes.\n\n\"It's so gorgeous here,\" said Wie, who has not won since claiming the U.S Women's Open at Pinehurst in 2014. \"When the weather is nice, it almost felt like I was playing back home in Hawaii with the views and everything. I feel like I got extremely lucky with the conditions out there.\"\n\nStill, no one else in the 144-player field took as much advantage. The lack of wind and softness underfoot left the 6,697-yard course all but defenseless and allowed Wie to use her high-flying lofted woods to great effect.\n\nSix of her nine birdies resulted from approach shots with metals, the 9- and 11-woods that have been in her bag since June proving most effective.\n\n\"Callaway has done a great job of accommodating me,\" said Wie. \"They had to look back into their archives to find me an 11-wood. I've never played such high-lofted woods before. The 11-wood goes 180-yards, the same distance as my 5-iron but is a lot easier to hit than a blade. The 9-wood replaces my 4-hybrid and goes 190 to 195 yards.\"\n\nAs for Thompson, the big-hitting Floridian relied less on the yardage book and more on her caddie. Kevin McAlpine, a former Scottish Amateur champion, worked at Kingsbarns for four summers prior to taking the Thompson bag.\n\n\"His local knowledge helps tremendously,\" Thompson said.\n\nSo Yeon Ryu, the No. 1 player in the world, opened with a 71.\n\nPGA: Rory McIlroy had his best friend on the bag and his best start on American soil in 18 months. For Jordan Spieth, it was more of the same with two long putts and another comment filled with bravado directed at his caddie.\n\nBoth of them opened with a 3-under 67 at the Bridgestone Invitational in Akron, Ohio, leaving them two shots behind Thomas Pieters of Belgium.\n\nPieters, playing only for the sixth time since he challenged briefly at the Masters this year, holed a 30-foot birdie putt on his final hole at Firestone to finish a day of good scoring with a one-shot lead over Russell Knox.\n\nThe opening two rounds were moved up to the morning because of a forecast of thunderstorms in the afternoon.\n\nMcIlroy split with J.P. Fitzgerald, his caddie of nine years, after the British Open. He decided to use Harry Diamond, who played amateur golf for Ireland and was the best man at McIlroy's wedding, for the Bridgestone Invitational and the PGA Championship next week.\n\nIt didn't have much bearing on McIlroy's game, which was fine. McIlroy won at Firestone the last time he played it in 2014.\n\nShare\n\nSend questions/comments to the editors.\n\nWant the news vital to Maine? Our daily headlines email is delivered each morning.

ANDREWS, Scotland (AP) - I.K. Kim stood on the first tee at the Women's British Open and seemed to have everything going against her.\n\nThe wind was rising. Heavy rain was falling. The temperature was dropping. If that wasn't enough, Inbee Park had just toured Kingsbarns Links in a course record-tying 64 and was one shot behind. Stacy Lewis, another past Women's British Open champion, was another shot back after a 65.\n\nKim answered every challenge Saturday.\n\nKorea's In-Kyung Kim plays her approach to the 17th hole during day three of the Women's British Open at Kingsbarns Golf Links, St Andrews, Scotland, Saturday Aug. 5, 2017. (Kenny Smith/PA via AP)\n\nIn weather that turned out better than expected - only one heavy shower - Kim shot a bogey-free 66 by converting a string of birdie putts. With one round to play, the 29-year-old South Korean was at 17-under 199 and had a six-shot lead over Georgia Hall (70) and Moriya Jutanugarn (67), the older sister of defending champion Ariya Jutanugarn.\n\nLexi Thompson, who started the third round just two shots behind, stumbled to a 74 and wound up 10 shots back.\n\nKim, five years removed from infamously missing a 1-foot putt to win the Kraft Nabisco Championship, now is poised for redemption with her first major.\n\nEven armed with such a substantial lead, there will be pressure on her stamina and usually reliable putting stroke. Even five years on, the memory lives on of her clasping her hand over her mouth when she missed her tap-in for victory, eventually losing in a playoff to Sun-Young Yoo.\n\n\"I have finally been able to let go of that,\" Kim said. \"I was disappointed with my golf after 2012. I criticized myself too much, which is not healthy. So it was tough. I never stopped liking the game, but what happened did take away some of the joy. I certainly don't get surprised by anything anymore.\"\n\nShould she falter in the race for her first major and the $487,500 first-place prize, there is plenty of experience in her wake - from Park, the biggest star on the LPGA Tour over the last decade, and from Lewis.\n\nBoth took advantage of the benign morning weather to make substantial progress up the leaderboard. Park rose from a tie for 48th to a tie for fourth alongside Ally McDonald, who shot a 70. Lewis moved all the way up to a tie for sixth.\n\n\"I putted great and hit the ball great,\" Park said. \"That's something I have been really struggling with for the last month. It doesn't matter how many shots I'm back. I'll just try to play my golf tomorrow. That's all I can do.\"\n\nLewis also credited an improved performance to her putting - and her mother.\n\n\"I really putted pretty poorly the first two days,\" Lewis said. \"My mom told me I needed to take my putter straighter back. And that's what I worked on today.\"\n\nIn contrast to the success of those players still owning a vague chance of victory, Thompson ended her chances with a sloppy display both on and off the greens. Despite three birdies on the back nine, Thompson took a double bogey on the 16th hole on her way to 74.\n\nShe was tied for 13th, along with Michelle Wie, who rallied from a 76 on Friday to post a 69.\n\nSouth Korea's In-Kyung Kim lines up her putt on the 4th hole, during day three of the Women's British Open at Kingsbarns Golf Links, St Andrews, Scotland, Saturday Aug. 5, 2017.

A British Open winner in 1986, 15 years before it became a major, the 53-year-old birdied the 18th hole for a four-under-par 68.\n\nHaving had to qualify, Davies said it would be \"ludicrous\" to suggest she could win. But she did remind everyone that a 59-year-old Tom Watson nearly won the Open in 2009. \"Links is a great leveller,\" she said.\n\nA teenage phenomenon, Wie has had a rollercoaster ride on the LPGA Tour. She won the 2014 US Women's Open, but a catalogue of ailments have blighted her progress.\n\n\"I've had a lot of injuries the last two years, and I was starting to take things too seriously,\" she reflected after the eight-under round.\n\n\"But I've got to remember that golf is only a game. I'm lucky to be playing it for a living so I want to enjoy it.\"\n\nAsked if she was fully fit, she retorted: \"I'm not going to answer that. I've said I'm fine in the past and then something has happened.\"\n\nWie's best result in the British Open was a tie for third on her debut as a 15-year-old at Royal Birkdale in 2005. But the nine-birdie round raised her hopes of collecting a second major title.\n\nShe has stashed a few new clubs in her bag in recent weeks, with nine and 11 woods replacing her mid-irons. \"It's a sign I'm getting old,\" she joked.\n\nShe used both to good effect over the scenic course on Scotland's Fife coast.\n\nBut her round started poorly, as she skulled a wedge shot across over the green and dropped a shot at the par-five second. \"At that stage, I was thinking more of shooting par than course records,\" she admitted.\n\nBut Wie managed to get on a roll, making birdies at the fourth, sixth, eighth, 11th, 12th, 14th and then at the final three holes. A 15-footer at the last was one of her longest putts and it completed a six-under-par back nine of 30.\n\nFor Kim, a first major would help erase haunting memories of when she missed a one-foot putt to lose the 2012 ANA Inspiration at Rancho Mirage in California. She had eight birdies to finish the day alone in second, one ahead of American Lindy Duncan.\n\nDefending champion Ariya Jutanugarn and world number one Ryu So-Yeon were playing together and both shot one-under rounds of 71.\n\nWorld number two Lexi Thompson was the third member of that marquee group and the best-placed after a birdie at the last sealed a 67.", "eventUri": "eng-3334995",

ANDREWS, Scotland -- Predictably, Michelle Wie enjoyed her early morning stroll around the picturesque links of Kingsbarns out there on the East Neuk of Fife. Opening the Ricoh Women's British Open with an eight-under par 64 -- a new course record for the 17-year-old Kyle Phillips design -- will do that, of course. Making nine birdies wasn't too shabby either, especially after an ugly bogey at the par-5 second hole, the result of a skulled lob-wedge from the \"perfect\" lay-up spot, that turned out to be nothing more than a false alarm.\n\nIndeed, that early dropped shot was merely the harbinger of greater things ahead. And lots of \"fun.\" Such was her peace of mind, the 27-year-old Hawaiian even had time to take in the stunning vistas across the \"ocean\" that is actually the indeterminate border between the Firth of Tay and the North Sea known as the Tay Estuary.\n\n\"It's so gorgeous here,\" Wie said. \"When the weather is nice, it almost felt like I was playing back home in Hawaii with the views and everything. I feel like I got extremely lucky with the conditions out there.\"\n\nMaybe, but no one else was going quite so low or making quite as many birdies. The first of the nine appeared at the 399-yard fourth and two more were on the card before the turn. At which point the floodgates sprang apart. Six more red numbers translated into a back-nine 30 and an early three-stroke lead over England's Mel Reid that was soon enough usurped by I.K. Kim's 65.\n\nRELATED: How a team of Aussies turned a talented Korean golfer into the new World No. 1\n\nEver the iconoclast, Wie compiled her unprecedented round in a manner best described as \"eccentric.\" While conventional wisdom has it that lon irons are generally more useful on a links than lofted woods, the former U.S. Women's Open champion made good use of both a 9-wood and an 11-wood that have been in the bag since the KPMG Women's PGA Championship in June. Three of her nine birdies resulted from approach shots struck with those two clubs.\n\n\"Callaway has done a great job of accommodating me,\" said Wie, looking only slightly embarrassed. \"They had to look back into their archives to find me an 11-wood. I've never played such high-lofted woods before. The 11-wood goes 180 yards, the same distance as my 5-iron, and is a lot easier to hit than a blade. The 9-wood replaces my 4-hybrid and goes 190-195 yards, although maybe not that far in these conditions.\"\n\nPerhaps just as important for Wie as she goes about trying to win for the first time since that Women's Open at Pinehurst in 2014 is the fact that she is fully fit. A troublesome neck strain caused her to withdraw from this year's Women's Open in the second round last month, but all is well after a 19th-place showing last week at the Aberdeen Asset Ladies Scottish Open.\n\n\"I hurt my neck the Sunday of KPMG,\" she said. \"I hit one shot and started getting neck spasms. I didn't hit a single golf ball until the U.S. Open. I was doing everything I could -- three physio treatments a day -- but it just wasn't enough time. The spasms were pretty bad. But I got to see my doctors in New York City after that, got a couple injections, and I feel pretty good.\"", "eventUri": "eng-3334995", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2017-08-03", "title": "A pain-free Michelle Wie jumps to a fast start with 64 at the Women's British Open - Golf Digest", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-03", "id": "15136925", "extractedDates": null, "storyUri": "eng-3334995", "time": "14:56:00", "details": {"liCnt": 3}, "concepts": [{"score": 4, "label": {"eng": "St Andrews"}, "id": "84462", "location": {"label": {"eng": "St Andrews"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Andrews", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kingsbarns"}, "id": "87299", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Kingsbarns"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingsbarns", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hawaii"}, "id": "236169", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Hawaii"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "United States of America"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaii", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 2, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "id": "242110", "location": {"label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 4, "label": {"eng": "East Neuk"}, "id": "286497", "location": {"label": {"eng": "East Neuk"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Neuk", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "label": {"eng": "Golf"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "302727"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelle_Wie", "label": {"eng": "Michelle Wie"}, "type": "person", "id": "305032"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wood", "label": {"eng": "Wood"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "307585"}, {"score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North Sea"}, "id": "314636", "location": null, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Sea", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KPMG", "label": {"eng": "KPMG"}, "type": "org", "id": "330189"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_British_Open", "label": {"eng": "Women's British Open"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "363429"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Women's_Open_Championship_(golf)", "label": {"eng": "United States Women's Open Championship (golf)"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "393941"}, {"score": 1, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ladies_Scottish_Open", "label": {"eng": "Ladies Scottish Open"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "410806"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firth_of_Tay", "label": {"eng": "Firth of Tay"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "517260"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_screw_drives#Phillips", "label": {"eng": "Phillips screwdriver"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "928837"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-Kyung_Kim", "label": {"eng": "In-Kyung Kim"}, "type": "person", "id": "1066828"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_PGA_Championship", "label": {"eng": "Women's PGA Championship"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "1315613"}], "url": "https://www.golfdigest.com/story/a-pain-free-michelle-wie-jumps-to-a-fast-start-with-64-at-the-womens-british-open", "timeCrawl": "14:56:00", "image": "https://media.golfdigest.com/photos/59832d27b28217621c0c5699/master/pass/michelle-wie-womens-british-open-2017-thursday.jpg", "location": {"label": {"eng": "St Andrews"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "dateTime": "2017-08-03T14:56:00Z", "originalArticle": null, "sim": 0.7176470756530762}

She even had time to take in the stunning vistas across what she referred to as the \"ocean,\" which is actually the Tay Estuary.\n\nAfter the early dropped shot, Wie reeled off three birdies before the turn.

I feel like I got extremely lucky with the conditions out there.\"\n\nNo one else in the 144-player field took as much advantage. The lack of wind and softness underfoot left the 6,697-yard course all but defenseless and allowed Wie to use her high-flying lofted woods to great effect. Six of her nine birdies resulted from approach shots with metals, the 9- and 11-woods that have been in her bag since June proving most effective.\n\n\"Callaway has done a great job of accommodating me,\" Wie said. \"They had to look back into their archives to find me an 11-wood. I've never played such high-lofted woods before. The 11-wood goes 180 yards, the same distance as my 5-iron but is a lot easier to hit than a blade. The 9-wood replaces my 4-hybrid and goes 190 to 195 yards.\"\n\nAs for Thompson, the big-hitting Floridian relied less on the yardage book and more on her caddie.

The 27-year-old American shot 30 on the back nine and wound up one shot ahead of I.K.

Six-under par through 14 holes, the 53-year old from England finished in a mildly disappointing 68, the same score posted by Charley Hull, Britain's top player.\n\nThere were no such problems for Wie.

He finished at 4-over 74 with a bogey on the last hole.\n\n\"It was an amazing experience, I've been looking forward to this since I found out and to finally hit my first shot in tournament play was a really, really nervous moment but it was everything I hoped for,\" Curry said. \"If you told me I was going to shoot 74 going into the first round I'd take that all day, every day. I'm pretty happy with it.\"\n\nCurry drew quite a crowd to the Web.com Tour's Ellie Mae Classic, where Hall of Fame wide receiver Jerry Rice has played a few times in the past. The star point guard of the champion Warriors high-fived fans -- some 300-plus at the picturesque course providing panoramic views overlooking San Francisco Bay -- between some holes and chatted with

Yet Michelle Wie felt as though she was back home in Hawaii. The stunning seaside holes on this gem of a course on the Fife coast helped create that impression. As did the gorgeous morning weather the 27-year-old took full advantage of to light up the opening day of the \u00a32.5 million Ricoh Women's British Open with a course-record eight-under-par 64.\n\n\"I had a lot of fun today,\" admitted Wie, smiling, after recovering from an early bogey caused by a \"skulled\" wedge at the par-5 second to card nine birdies, six of which came in the last eight holes as she stormed home in 30 to lead by a shot from Korean\n\nIn-Kyung Kim at the end of a day interspersed with two delays caused by rain of biblical proportions.\n\nBefore the first disruption of just under an hour in the middle of the afternoon, Laura Davies had Wie in her sights after moving menacingly to six-under after 14 holes on her 37th consecutive appearance in the event, but three dropped shots in two holes immediately after the resumption left her having to settle for a 68.\n\nWorld No 2 Lexi Thompson birdied the last to beat that effort by one, as did Mel Reid and Jodi Ewart Shadoff, while two more English players, Charley Hull and Georgia Hall, also got off to good starts with 68s, but the day belonged to Wie, the one-time child superstar who seems to have been around forever yet has never really fulfilled her potential.\n\nAdmittedly, a spate of injuries haven't helped, but, for all the hype that has surrounded her from the moment she qualified for the US Amateur when she was just 10, the fact Wie's sole major success so far came in the 2014 US Women's Open and she has just four LPGA titles in total to her name - Lydia Ko has 14 by comparison - seems something of an under-achievement.\n\nHaving missed the cut in this event twice in the last three years and withdrawn in between, Wie was under the radar coming into this week. But, helped by some perfect preparation in last week's Scottish Open at Dundonald, she led the way on a day when the world's best players found the Kyle Phillips-designed course scoreable without really bringing it to its knees. \"It's definitely up there, for sure,\" replied Wie, who was forced to withdraw in the second round of last month's US Women's Open due to neck spasms, to being asked where her effort ranked. \"The fact it's a course record is a huge honour for me, especially at a place like Kingsbarns, which is definitely one of the most scenic courses I've ever played. You get lost in the views out there and it almost feels like playing back home in Hawaii.\"\n\nShe probably wished she'd been back in Honolulu after sending her third shot skittering through the back of the green at the second, but that actually stung her into action. \"It was definitely a rocky start, but I think that got me a little pissed,\" admitted the world\n\nNo 35, who used both her 9-wood and an 11-wood to dazzling effect thereafter. \"I was angry after that, so I nuked a drive on the next hole and that got me into a good position.\"\n\nKim, a 29-year-old who has won twice on the LPGA in the past two months, signed for eight birdies to sit a shot ahead of American Lindy Duncan, with Reid, Thompson, Ewart Shadoff, Korea's Chella Choi and Dutch player Anne Van Dam all a stroke further back. \"I think playing the Scottish Open really helped me to prepare for this week because we had so much wind over there,\" admitted Kim after her effort, with Reid also having been at Dundonald Links to prepare for the fourth women's major of the season.\n\nShe is coached by Kevin Craggs and heaped praise on him after carding seven birdies, including four around the turn. \"He's saved my career, he really has,\" said the 29-year-old of Craggs, who is based at Kingsfield Golf Centre on the outskirts of Linlithgow. \"I've said to him I want him out on the LPGA a bit more with me. I feel he's a performance coach, I feel he's a Tour coach, and I feel that doing what he's doing right now, he's not getting the most out of his potential.\"\n\nOn a day when Catriona Matthew struggled to a 76, Pamela Pretswell, Heather MacRae and Sally Watson shared the honour of being the top Scots with matching level-par 72s. Pretswell, who gets married in a fortnight's time, had both weather delays to contend with. \"Yesterday,\" she replied, jokingly, to being asked when she'd teed off at the end of a round that took six-and-a-half hours to complete.\n\nMacRae, a qualifier along with Watson, had mixed feelings about her effort. \"I would have taken that at the start but maybe not after nine holes, when I was three-under,\" said the Dunblane woman, who is based these days in Portugal. \"I started really well before having a little blip at the 11th (a double-bogey 7).\"", "eventUri": "eng-3334995",

For Jordan Spieth, it was more of the same with two long putts and another comment filled with bravado directed at his caddie.\n\nBoth of them opened with a 3-under 67 at the Bridgestone Invitational, leaving them two shots behind Thomas Pieters of Belgium.\n\nPieters, playing only for the sixth time since he challenged briefly at the Masters this year, holed a 30-foot birdie putt on his final hole at Firestone to finish a day of good scoring with a one-shot lead over Russell Knox.\n\nThe opening two rounds were moved up to the morning because of a forecast of thunderstorms in the afternoon.\n\nMcIlroy split with J.P. Fitzgerald, his caddie of nine years, after the British Open. He decided to use Harry Diamond, who played amateur golf for Ireland and was the best man at McIlroy's wedding, for the Bridgestone Invitational and the PGA Championship next week.\n\nIt didn't have much bearing on McIlroy's game, which was fine. McIlroy won at Firestone the last time he played it in 2014.\n\n\"We both did the numbers and I sort of consulted him a couple of times. Yeah, it was good,\" McIlroy said. \"There was a couple of shots that I hit or a couple of clubs that I pulled that I maybe should have just thought a little bit more about. It's been a while since I've paced yardages off and written notes in my book.\"\n\nOne of them was at No. 9, his last hole, when he went some 50 feet long on his approach and three-putted for bogey. Even so, it was a solid start, and that's what has held back McIlroy in recent months when he missed three cuts in four tournaments, and then started poorly at the British Open.\n\nSpieth has no such concerns, having won two straight events going into this World Golf Championship with an eye toward next week at the PGA Championship and his shot at becoming the youngest player to complete the Grand Slam.\n\nWinning a major turned this into a great year for Spieth, regardless of what happens at the PGA Championship. He is feeling as good as ever about his game, particularly the way he finished off Royal Birkdale with the amazing escape on the 13th hole and the birdie-eagle-birdie-birdie stretch that followed. The biggest putt was the eagle from 50 feet on the par-5 15th at the Open, now famous for Spieth playfully barking at his caddie, \"Go get that!\" when it dropped in.\n\nThursday brought another such moment.\n\nSpieth got back into range of the lead with a 30-foot birdie putt on No. 5 and a 50-foot birdie putt on the next hole that got him to 3 under. But he was in trouble at No. 8, well right of the fairway with trees blocking his view of the green. He couldn't punch under them because he had too much rough to cover with a punch shot beneath the branches. But he did see about a 3-foot gap way up in the trees. And he was feeling it.\n\nHis caddie, Michael Greller, got the yardage and came over to see what Spieth had in mind.\n\n\"I said, 'Michael, just put the bag over there, stand over there and watch this,'\" Spieth said.\n\nSpieth rehearsed his swing with a pitching wedge and pulled it off.\n\n\"I split a hole that was 60 yards in front of me and cut it to get onto the green,\" Spieth said. \"It was really a cool shot. I was shocked I pulled it off.\"\n\nGreller smiled, bumped fists with his boss and handed him the putter.\n\nWie takes the lead at Women's British Open\n\nST. ANDREWS, Scotland -- Finishing fast after a slow start, Michelle Wie birdied her last three holes Thursday for an 8-under 64 for a one-shot lead in the Women's British Open.\n\nWie bogeyed the par-5 second hole at Kingsbarns Links, and that was the last of her mistakes. The 27-year-old American shot 30 on the back nine and wound up one shot ahead of I.K. Kim of South Korea.\n\nLindy Duncan was another shot behind at 66, with Lexi Thompson among those at 67.\n\nWie, showing no sign of the neck spasms that forced her to withdraw from last month's U.S Women's Open, posted nine birdies during a morning round played in almost perfect weather on the eastern coast of Scotland.\n\nOnly later did torrential downpours and the threat of lightning twice disrupt play for a total of 74 minutes.\n\nLaura Davies was one who suffered from the interruptions. Six-under par through 14 holes, the 53-year old from England finished in a mildly disappointing 68, the same score posted by Charley Hull, Britain's top player.\n\nThere were no such problems for Wie. Such was the overall serenity of her progress, the Hawaii native even had time to take in the stunning vistas across what she referred to as the \"ocean,\" which is actually the Tay Estuary.\n\nFollowing the early dropped shot -- a badly skulled lob wedge finished far over the second green -- she reeled off three birdies before the turn. Over the back nine, it only got better with six birdies in the final eight holes.\n\n\"It's so gorgeous here,\" said Wie, who has not won since claiming the U.S Women's Open at Pinehurst in 2014. \"When the weather is nice, it almost felt like I was playing back home in Hawaii with the views and everything. I feel like I got extremely lucky with the conditions out there.\"\n\nStill, no one else in the 144-player field took as much advantage. The lack of wind and softness underfoot left the 6,697-yard course all but defenseless and allowed Wie to use her high-flying lofted woods to great effect. Six of her nine birdies resulted from approach shots with metals, the 9- and 11-woods that have been in her bag since June proving most effective.\n\n\"Callaway has done a great job of accommodating me,\" said Wie. \"They had to look back into their archives to find me an 11-wood. I've never played such high-lofted woods before. The 11-wood goes 180-yards, the same distance as my 5-iron but is a lot easier to hit than a blade. The 9-wood replaces my 4-hybrid and goes 190 to 195 yards.\"\n\nAs for Thompson, the big-hitting Floridian relied less on the yardage book and more on her caddie. Kevin McAlpine, a former Scottish Amateur champion, worked at Kingsbarns for four summers prior to taking the Thompson bag.\n\n\"His local knowledge helps tremendously,\" Thompson said.\n\nSo Yeon Ryu, the No. 1 player in the world, opened with a 71.", "eventUri": "eng-3334995", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2017-08-04", "title": "Pieters takes 1-shot lead at Firestone", "dateCrawl":

The 27-year-old shot 30 on the back nine and wound up one shot ahead of I.K. Kim of South Korea.\n\nLindy Duncan was another shot behind at 66, with Lexi Thompson among those at 67.\n\nWie, showing no sign of the neck spasms that forced her to withdraw from last month's U.S. Women's Open, posted nine birdies during a morning round played in almost perfect weather on the eastern coast of Scotland.\n\n\"It's so gorgeous here,\" said Wie, a Stanford alum who has not won since the U.S. Women's Open at Pinehurst in 2014. \"When the weather is nice, it almost felt like I was playing back home in Hawaii with the views and everything. I feel like I got extremely lucky with the conditions out there.\"\n\nOnly later did torrential downpours and the threat of lightning twice disrupt play for a total of 74 minutes.\n\nLaura Davies was one who was hurt by the interruptions. Six-under par through 14 holes, the 53-year-old from England finished with a 68, as did Charley Hull, Britain's top player.\n\nSo Yeon Ryu, the No. 1 player in the world, opened with a 71.\n\nBridgestone Invitational: Thomas Pieters rolled in a 30-foot birdie putt on his final hole for a 5-under 65 that gave him a one-shot lead at Firestone Country Club in Akron, Ohio.\n\nRussell Knox had a 66 with a bogey on his final hole.\n\nRory McIlroy got by just fine with his best friend as his caddie, opening with a 67, his lowest opening round in the U.S. since February 2016.\n\nMcIlroy split with J.P. Fitzgerald, his caddie of nine years, after the British Open. McIlroy decided to use Harry Diamond, who played amateur golf for Ireland and was the best man at McIlroy's wedding, for the Bridgestone Invitational and the PGA Championship next week.\n\nAlso at 67 was Jordan Spieth, feeling so confident about his game that on one shot, he asked his caddie how he should escape trouble from the trees. Before Michael Greller could answer, Spieth told him to stand aside and watch. He hit through a tiny gap onto the green.\n\nSpieth has won two straight events going into this World Golf Championship with an eye toward the PGA Championship and his shot at becoming the youngest player to complete the Grand Slam.\n\nBarracuda Championship: John Huh made his eighth birdie on his final hole to finish with 15 points and take the first-round lead.\n\nHuh has a one-point lead over Stuart Appleby and Miguel Angel Carballo under the modified Stableford format at Montreaux Golf and Country Club in Reno.\n\nAppleby also had eight birdies, against two bogeys. Carballo had two eagles, one in which he holed out from 160 yards.\n\nThis is the only PGA Tour event that uses the scoring format in which an eagle is worth five points and birdies are worth two points. Players lose one point for a bogey and three points for a double bogey or worse.

The 29-year-old from Seoul returned a third round, 6-under 66 to move to 17 under.\n\nJutanugarn equalled Hall's 67 to join her in second spot. Inbee Park matched the course record 64 Michelle Wie set in Round One to sit in fourth place alongside Ally McDonald, who returned a 70.\n\nKim's 199, 54-hole mark sets a new Women's British Open record since it became a major in 2001. She beats Ariya Jutanugarn's 200 last year. Kim ties Lorena Ochoa's 2007 record for the largest 54-hole lead in the Women's British since it became a major.\n\nShe is also on course to break the Women's British Open scoring record Karen Stupples set at Sunningdale 13 years ago when she totaled 269, 19 under. Kim needs a closing 69 to break that record.\n\nThat missed par putt five years ago cost her the title. She lost in a playoff to Sun-Young Yoo.\n\nIt's taken a while, but Kim no longer lets 2012 beat her up.\n\n\"I've finally let go of that title of having not won a major,\" Kim admitted.\n\n\"I was quite disappointed at myself after 2012 when I made that mistake. I kind of criticized myself a lot.\n\n\"I started to work on myself not only on the golf course, but off the golf course. Just to be nice to myself and able to have some compassion and gentleness with myself. I think that's really helped me play better.\n\n\"It was kind of taking away the joy of golf.\n\n\"I got questions all the time from other people. So I thought it was coming from other people that I was quite angry or unhappy, but actually it was me that was disappointed at myself.\n\n\"I can control my state of mind now. I can be positive now and that's what I'm doing. I don't really get surprised now by sport. I kind of look at my life that way.\n\n\"It's already happened so I have to make the best out of it.\"\n\nNo wonder Kim was a picture of contentment as intermittent rain showers poured down on the course just south of St. Andrews. The five-time LPGA winner went out in 32, 4 under, and then turned up the heat with two birdies in the first three holes of her back nine.\n\nHall's 67 should have been much better. She began the third round two shots behind Kim in the final group on the golf course. She fell six shots behind after 12 holes but reeled off three straight birdies from the 13th to get within three. Then disaster struck.\n\nThe 21-year-old bogeyed the par-4 16th hole after a bad drive and then four-putted the 17th green from 60 feet for a double-bogey six.\n\n\"I wasn't nervous at all today, which I was a bit surprised by,\" Hall said. \"I made a silly mistake on 17 but apart from that hole, I actually played solid.\n\nEnglish golf fans have been waiting 13 years for another English winner since Stupples in 2004. Although Mel Reid and Jody Ewart Shadoff are in the top 10 along with Hall, they are nine shots off the pace in equal seventh place.\n\nHall is the only viable English hope with a round to go.\n\n\"Six shots is quite a lot, but on this course you can make a lot of birdies,\" she said. \"I'm going to have to go quite low tomorrow.\"\n\nMake that really low. She also has to hope Kim blows up.\n\nThat doesn't look possible even if stranger things have happened in this crazy stick and ball game.\n\nKim seems to have found an inner peace that should help her lay to rest that 14-inch nightmare.", "eventUri": "eng-3334995", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2017-08-05", "title": "In-Kyung Kim, looking to bury demons, takes 6-shot lead at Women's British Open",

It was a remarkable display by the American considering the fact that neck spasms forced her withdrawal from last month's US Women's Open and she required an epidural.\n\nThe one-time girl wonder, who finished third in this major as an amateur when 15, could not even pick up a club a fortnight ago. And the links terrain on the Fife coastline hardly helped.\n\n\"It's so hard here, it's just sometimes it feels like you're hitting into concrete,\" Wie said. \"It kind of vibrates a little bit. Kingsbarns is definitely one of the most scenic golf courses I've ever played, and you definitely get lost in the views out there. But, you know, my neck was good, especially just after the [US Women's] Open. I'm just happy to be playing and happy to be playing at full capacity.\"\n\nCertainly her famous name in first place caused a stirring in the galleries, who braved a day that started in sunshine but descended into thunderstorms which forced two suspensions.\n\nBut then, there was a raft of British challengers riding high to cheer on. Jodi Ewart Shadoff and Mel Reid shot 67s to stand in a tie fourth on five-under, while Charley Hull, Georgia Hall and Dame Laura Davies, the last two-named being the youngest and eldest in the quintet, all posted 68s.\n\nLike Wie - and indeed Hull, who has been suffering from a wrist problem - Reid has endured her own injury problems, which has blighted her rookie season on the LPGA Tour.\n\n\"I'm having to do a lot of maintenance on my back injury - I did it from sneezing,\" Reid said. \"I actually just sneezed at an awkward angle, which sounds ridiculous, but my trainer and I have done a lot of work.\"\n\nDavies's 68 was perhaps the most remarkable. The 1986 champion, playing in her 37th Women's British Open, was a 1500-1 shot at the start after being forced to come through qualifying after not recording a top 10 in any event in more than two years. But she made a mockery of those odds with seven birdies.\n\n\"That's the first time I can remember for a long time actually coming off the course feeling like I've achieved something because you don't want to be 50th or 40th, Davies said. \"It's actually a bit of a confidence boost to be honest with you and I cant wait for the next round.\"", "eventUri": "eng-3334995", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2017-08-03", "title": "Michelle Wie leads by a neck after record 64 at British Women's Open", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-03", "id": "15213586", "extractedDates": null, "storyUri": "eng-3334995", "time": "21:14:00", "details": {}, "concepts": [{"score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "id": "76", "location": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States of America"}, "id": "233", "location": {"label": {"eng": "United States of America"}, "type": "country"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kingsbarns"}, "id": "87299", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Kingsbarns"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingsbarns", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fife"}, "id": "89046", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Fife"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fife", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "id": "182942", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "United States of America"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 4, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "id": "242110", "location": {"label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Woods", "label": {"eng": "Tiger Woods"}, "type": "person", "id": "305028"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelle_Wie", "label": {"eng": "Michelle Wie"}, "type": "person", "id": "305032"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LPGA", "label": {"eng": "LPGA"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "305037"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Open_Championship", "label": {"eng": "The Open Championship"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "305039"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege", "label": {"eng": "Siege"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "306645"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "307398"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_British_Open", "label": {"eng": "Women's British Open"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "363429"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Women's_Open_Championship_(golf)", "label": {"eng": "United States Women's Open Championship (golf)"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "393941"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charley_Hull", "label": {"eng": "Charley Hull"}, "type": "person", "id": "409778"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laura_Davies", "label": {"eng": "Laura Davies"}, "type": "person", "id": "707649"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jodi_Ewart_Shadoff", "label": {"eng": "Jodi Ewart Shadoff"}, "type": "person", "id": "845471"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidural_administration", "label": {"eng": "Epidural administration"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "1288209"}], "url": "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/golf/2017/08/03/michelle-wie-leads-neck-record-64-british-womens-open/", "timeCrawl": "21:14:00", "image": "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/golf/2017/08/03/TELEMMGLPICT000136472481-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq2R5Kz26mTnoB08cbS3FOzoUvOJOjaWQZSz8tG-qdf3E.jpeg", "location": null, "dateTime": "2017-08-03T21:14:00Z", "originalArticle": null, "sim": 0.6352941393852234}

said.\n\n\"I'm really proud of myself for how I played, I really took advantage of the [morning] conditions, but it was a really fun round.\"\n\nThe 27 year old came into the tournament on the back of

British golfers are tied with Chella Choi, Ann Van Dam and Lexi Thompson in fourth.\n\nMel Reid posted bogeys on the 14th and 16th holes to finish five under par, three shots behind the leader.\n\nAnd despite playing in the worst of the fluctuating weather conditions, Jodi Ewart Shadoff played a strong back nine to sneak up alongside her compatriot.\n\nTaking part in her 37th consecutive British Women's Open, Dame Laura Davies carded seven birdies with a round of 68.\n\nWeather disrupted the 53-year-old's round, after the threat of lightning paused play for nearly an hour and 20 minutes.\n\nA double bogey and a bogey after the delay dropped her out of tied fourth position.\n\nAnd British No 1 Charley Hull, also playing in the trickier afternoon weather, finished on 68 alongside Davies despite a terrific eagle putt on the 11th.\n\nLeading the Scots after round one is Pamela Prestwell, as the 28 year old coped well with the afternoon's inclement weather to go into her second round one under par.\n\nAn early start, with the advantage of the favourable weather, saw Sally Watson and Heather Macrae both finish on even-par 72.\n\nTwo bogeys at the start of her round and two to finish left Kylie Henry unable to make ground, as she finished three over par with a round of 75.\n\nAnd Catriona Matthew, looking to earn a playing spot at the Solheim Cup, was joint poorest performing Scot on four-over-par 76, finishing her first day in 133rd position.\n\nCarly Booth, who was the top performing Scot at the Ladies Scottish Open, struggled on the back nine resulting in a

ANDREWS, Scotland (AP) - I.K. Kim, the best player in women's golf right now, emerged from the cold and wet with a 4-under 68 to build a two-shot lead in the Women's British Open going into the weekend.\n\nA two-time winner on the LPGA Tour over the last two months, Kim dropped only one shot in some of the worst conditions at Kingsbarns Links and reached the halfway point at 11-under 133. She was two shots clear of Lexi Thompson and Georgia Hall of England.\n\nKim displayed a remarkable fortitude in weather that veered erratically toward the end of the day between bright sunshine and torrential downpours. The 29-year-old from South Korea atoned for her lone bogey with three birdies and an eagle on the 538-yard 11th hole.\n\nIn-Kyung Kim of Korea plays her approach shot at the 18th hole during day two of the Women's British Open at Kingsbarns Golf Links, St Andrews Scotland, Friday Aug. 4, 2017. (Kenny Smith/PA via AP)\n\n\"The eagle was very unexpected,\" Kim said before conceding her drive landed on a friendly downslope and gained an extra 30 yards or so. \"I think this was kind of as bad as the weather could get. I expected rain, but not like this. It's not easy to play in this kind of weather. But I feel really good about my game. I've been hitting the ball very well and I'm starting to make some putts. That's when I shoot low scores.\"\n\nStill, perhaps the most significant move came from Thompson, the No. 2 player in the world.\n\nTwo-over par and birdie-free after nine-holes, the big-hitting Floridian played the homeward nine in 30 with six birdies - five in succession. In addition, she found time to add a new phrase to golf's already voluminous terminology.\n\n\"I ball-striked it out there,\" she said. That was fair enough, if grammatically flawed. Even on that disappointing front nine, the eight-time LPGA champion struck her shots with an authority few in the women's game can match.\n\n\"I actually hit it the same throughout both nines,\" she said. \"I just left myself with 30-40 feet on my two bogeys and three-putted them. I hit great shots. Going in, they were going right at the flag, but they both got bounces that went sideways. Then I didn't make the second putt. But I hit it great the whole day and just got on a roll there on the back.\"\n\nAnother key to Thompson's success so far is her caddie, Kevin McAlpine. The former Scottish Amateur champion worked four summers at Kingsbarns and knows the course well.\n\n\"Kevin has helped with my decision-making on basically every hole,\" said Thompson. \"His input going into the greens is especially valuable. He tells me where to land the ball and he's been spot on every time. He knows the greens like the back of his hand, as well. He's helped me out a lot out there.\"\n\nFirst-round leader Michelle Wie did not fare so well. The 27-year old American made only one birdie in a 76 that leaves her seven shots off the pace and in a tie for 21st with two rounds remaining. Wie has not won since the 2014 U.S. Women's Open at Pinehurst No. 2.\n\nIn-Kyung Kim of Korea gets her line before she putts for birdie on the 18th green during day two of the Women's British Open at Kingsbarns Golf Links, St Andrews Scotland, Friday Aug. 4, 2017.

That tiddly effort lipped out and she was defeated in the subsequent extra holes, as she has been in all five playoffs she has competed in on the LPGA Tour.\n\nIf that record suggests she is a flaky operator under pressure, her six LPGA titles would indicate otherwise, as would the fact that should she complete the victory on Sunday, it would be a fifth in her past 18 starts on the LPGA and Ladies European tours.\n\nThat latter wave of success comes after she spent years in the doldrums, the cause, she admitted after her round, being her inability to overcome the disappointment of that calamitous miss five years ago.\n\n\"I really criticized myself a lot for that putt and it wasn't very healthy,\" she conceded. \"I think I have finally been able to let go of that mistake. Everybody makes mistakes, but it became a problem for me.\n\n\"I had to work at being nice to myself, to show compassion and gentleness. I like to meditate. I have a mental and emotional coach. I work with Lanny Bassham, who was an Olympic gold medalist in rifle shooting.\"\n\nIn Round 3, it was Kim's putting that was dead aim as she repeatedly delivered shots to the bow of the field. Highlights were 30-foot efforts on the sixth and seventh, the former dropping in the hole even as she wafted her putter in exasperation, believing the effort was set to pull up short.\n\nHer ability to hole out for par was just as important; a 15-foot example at the third was key to maintaining momentum.\n\n\"It was a lot of fun,\" Kim said, reflecting on the fact that she is now 35 holes without a bogey. \"It was kind of simple out there. I adjusted to the green out there.\"\n\nPlaying partner Georgia Hall was her closest rival for much of the day. The 21-year-old Englishwoman, the first from her nation to play in the final group on the weekend in this tournament since Karen Stupples in 2004, obeyed the instruction of the tattoo on her wrist (\"Deep Breath\") when she stood contemplating her first shot of the day and then proceeded to chase the leader hard.\n\nShe drove the 290-yard par-4 fifth hole to claim eagle from 12 feet, withstood a flat patch in the middle of the round, and completed a hat trick of birdies from the 13th to get within three swings of the leader.\n\nA final-round duel became a possibility until she dropped three shots at 16 and 17 on her way to an 11-under-par total of 205, falling back into a share of second.\n\nAlongside her is Thailand's Moriya Jutanugarn, who is seeking to complete a family defense of the title. Sister Ariya was victorious 12 months ago at Woburn, but her woes on linksland continued this week, most particularly when it took her six shots to escape a bunker on the 12th hole in Round 2. She failed to withstand the disaster and missed the cut.\n\nMoriya is yet to win on the LPGA Tour and admitted that the two, while best friends, are also typical siblings. \"Oh yeah,\" she laughed. \"We're competitive about everything.\"\n\nOne shot further back is American rookie Ally McDonald, whose first appearance in the tournament continues to laugh in the face of her lack of links experience.\n\n\"I got off to a little bit of a shaky start,\" McDonald said. \"The nerves got to me on the first tee for sure, but I was able to stay composed. I played steady golf from there.\"\n\nA six-time top-three finisher on the Symetra Tour in 2016, she's 10 under for the week and eyeing an LPGA career-best finish. Her previous best is T-30, achieved three times -- including in last year's final major of the year, the Evian Championship.\n\nEarlier in the day, previous tournament winners Inbee Park and Stacy Lewis raced around the course setting clubhouse targets long before the final group had even left the driving range for the first tee.\n\nPark equaled the course record with an eight-birdie, no-bogey 64 that allowed the 2015 champion to post 10-under 206, tied with McDonald.\n\nLewis, the 2013 winner at nearby St. Andrews, had her mom to thank for being just a shot further back at 9-under 207 after her 65 that included six birdies and two bogeys in the final eight holes.\n\n\"We were all talking technical stuff last night,\" Lewis said. \"Mom didn't understand how a putter should swing. She said, 'Shouldn't it go straight back and straight through?' I hate to give her credit, but she was right. I might buy her dinner tonight.\"\n\nThe final word went to Kim, who revealed that her lucky number this week is seven.\n\nIn practice on Wednesday, she made her seventh hole-in-one on the seventh hole using a 7-iron. Next day she opened the tournament with a 7-under-par score and she heads into the final day 17 shots under the card in the year 2017.\n\nHad she holed her final putt, she would have held a 7-shot lead. Six might be enough as she seeks a seventh LPGA title that would finally, blissfully and wonderfully, banish the ghosts of 2012.", "eventUri": "eng-3334995", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2017-08-05", "title": "Armed with 6-shot lead in Women's British Open, I.K.

earlier made cuts at ANA Inspiration and KPMG, while missed the cut at US Women's Open.\n\nShe has played all four Majors so far this year.\n\nThe cut fell at one-under and many names fell by the wayside on a day when the rain poured down on Kingsbarns Golf Links.\n\nIn-Kyung Kim used her experience of two decades to manage a four-under par, 68 in cold and windy conditions to lead at the halfway mark of the season's fourth major championship.\n\nKim sits at 11-under par, two-strokes ahead of Lexi Thompson and Georgia Hall.\n\nTwo behind Kim sits Lexi Thompson, whose secret weapon this week has been her caddie Kevin McAlpine, a former bagman at Kingsbarns Golf Links, who has guided Thompson around the course like a seasoned veteran.\n\nAt four-over par, defending champion Ariya

ANDREWS, Scotland -- Finishing fast after a slow start, Michelle Wie birdied her last three holes Thursday for an 8-under 64 for a one-shot lead in the Women's British Open.\n\nWie bogeyed the par-5 second hole at Kingsbarns Links, and that was the last of her mistakes. The 27-year-old American shot 30 on the back nine and wound up one shot ahead of I.K. Kim of South Korea.\n\nLindy Duncan was another shot behind at 66, with Lexi Thompson among those at 67.\n\nStacy Lewis (Arkansas Razorbacks) shot a 2-under 70. Gaby Lopez (Razorbacks) had a 71.\n\nSo Yeon Ryu, the No. 1 player in the world, opened with a 71.\n\nWie, showing no sign of the neck spasms that forced her to withdraw from last month's U.S Women's Open, posted nine birdies during a morning round played in almost perfect weather on the eastern coast of Scotland.\n\nOnly later did torrential downpours and the threat of lightning twice disrupt play for a total of 74 minutes.\n\nLaura Davies was one who suffered from the interruptions. Six-under par through 14 holes, the 53-year old from England finished with a mildly disappointing 68, the same score posted by Charley Hull, Britain's top player.\n\nThere were no such problems for Wie.\n\nFollowing her early dropped shot -- a badly skulled lob wedge finished far over the second green -- she reeled off three birdies before the turn. Over the back nine, it only got better with six birdies in the final eight holes.\n\nRENO, Nev. -- John Huh had eight birdies and one bogey for 15 points and the lead after the first round Thursday at the PGA Tour's Barracuda Championship.\n\nMiguel Angel Carballo and Stuart Appleby were tied for second place with 14 points apiece at the Montreaux Golf and Country Club course.\n\nBrandon Hagy, Ben Martin, Ryan Palmer, Dicky Pride and Patton Kizzire each had 13 points.\n\nThe players are using a Modified Stableford scoring format.\n\nTag Ridings (Arkansas Razorbacks) had 7 birdies and 4 bogeys for 10 points. Ken Duke (Arkadelphia, Henderson State) had 5 birdies and 4 bogeys for 6 points.\n\nHAYWARD, Calif. -- There was the animated, confident Stephen Curry that NBA fans know so well, the two-time league MVP finally feeling it and making the tough shots on the challenging course at TPC Stonebrae while playing in his highly anticipated professional golf debut.\n\nHe finished at 4-over 74 with a bogey on the last hole.\n\nCurry drew quite a crowd to the Web.com Tour's Ellie Mae Classic, where Hall of Fame wide receiver Jerry Rice has played a few times in the past.\n\nBrandon Harkins, Nicholas Thompson and Carlos Ortiz lead the first round, each with a 6-under 64.\n\nCurry missed badly on his initial ball of the day, landing his tee shot off a hill that kicked it perfectly into the cup holder of a golf cart. He then took a drop.\n\nCurry finished the par-5 15th by sinking a 5-foot, downhill birdie putt. He made par on No. 16, then survived a tee shot to the bunker and a near stumble climbing out of the sand on the par-4 18th and made about an 8-footer to save par.\n\nCurry has a sponsor exemption and is one of three amateurs in the event.\n\nTaylor Moore (Arkansas Razorbacks) shot a 2-under 68. Austin Cook (Jonesboro, Razorbacks) ... Matt Atkins (Henderson State) had an even-par 70. Zack Fischer (Little Rock) had a 1-over 71. Ethan Tracy (Razorbacks) had a 73.", "eventUri": "eng-3334995", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2017-08-04", "title": "Wie finishes fast, ahead by 1", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-04", "id": "15289717",

ANDREWS, Scotland -- I.K. Kim, the best player in women's golf right now, emerged from the cold and wet Friday with a 4-under 68 to build a two-shot lead in the Women's British Open going into the weekend.\n\nA two-time winner on the LPGA Tour over the last two months, Kim dropped only one shot in some of the worst conditions at Kingsbarns Links and reached the halfway point at 11-under 133. She was two shots clear of Lexi Thompson and Georgia Hall of England.\n\nKim displayed a remarkable fortitude in weather that veered erratically toward the end of the day between bright sunshine and torrential downpours. The 29-year-old from South Korea atoned for her lone bogey with three birdies and an eagle on the 538-yard 11th hole.\n\n\"The eagle was very unexpected,\" Kim said before conceding her drive landed on a friendly downslope and gained an extra 30 yards or so. \"I think this was kind of as bad as the weather could get. I expected rain, but not like this. It's not easy to play in this kind of weather. But I feel really good about my game. I've been hitting the ball very well and I'm starting to make some putts. That's when I shoot low scores.\"\n\nStill, perhaps the most significant move came from Thompson, the No. 2 player in the world.\n\nTwo-over par and birdie-free after nine-holes, the big-hitting Floridian played the homeward nine in 30 with six birdies -- five in succession. In addition, she found time to add a new phrase to golf's already voluminous terminology.\n\n\"I ball-striked it out there,\" she said. That was fair enough, if grammatically flawed. Even on that disappointing front nine, the eight-time LPGA champion struck her shots with an authority few in the women's game can match.\n\n\"I actually hit it the same throughout both nines,\" she said. \"I just left myself with 30-40 feet on my two bogeys and three-putted them. I hit great shots. Going in, they were going right at the flag, but they both got bounces that went sideways. Then I didn't make the second putt. But I hit it great the whole day and just got on a roll there on the back.\"\n\nAnother key to Thompson's success so far is her caddie, Kevin McAlpine. The former Scottish Amateur champion worked four summers at Kingsbarns and knows the course well.\n\n\"Kevin has helped with my decision-making on basically every hole,\" said Thompson. \"His input going into the greens is especially valuable. He tells me where to land the ball and he's been spot-on every time. He knows the greens like the back of his hand, as well. He's helped me out a lot out there.\"\n\nFirst-round leader Michelle Wie did not fare so well. The 27-year old American made only one birdie in a 76 that leaves her seven shots off the pace and in a tie for 21st with two rounds remaining. Wie has not won since the 2014 U.S. Women's Open at Pinehurst No. 2.\n\nStacy Lewis (Arkansas Razorbacks) was 2 under after a 72.

A British Open winner in 1986, 15 years before it became a major, the 53-year-old birdied the 18th hole for a four-under-par 68.\n\nHaving had to qualify, Davies said it would be \"ludicrous\" to suggest she could win. But she did remind everyone that a 59-year-old Tom Watson nearly won the Open in 2009. \"Links is a great leveller,\" she said.\n\nA teenage phenomenon, Wie has had a rollercoaster ride on the LPGA Tour. She won the 2014 US Women's Open, but a catalogue of ailments have blighted her progress.\n\n\"I've had a lot of injuries the last two years, and I was starting to take things too seriously,\" she reflected after the eight-under round.\n\n\"But I've got to remember that golf is only a game. I'm lucky to be playing it for a living so I want to enjoy it.\"\n\nAsked if she was fully fit, she retorted: \"I'm not going to answer that. I've said I'm fine in the past and then something has happened.\"\n\nWie's best result in the British Open was a tie for third on her debut as a 15-year-old at Royal Birkdale in 2005. But the nine-birdie round raised her hopes of collecting a second major title.\n\nShe has stashed a few new clubs in her bag in recent weeks, with nine and 11 woods replacing her mid-irons. \"It's a sign I'm getting old,\" she joked.\n\nShe used both to good effect over the scenic course on Scotland's Fife coast.\n\nBut her round started poorly, as she skulled a wedge shot across over the green and dropped a shot at the par-five second. \"At that stage, I was thinking more of shooting par than course records,\" she admitted.\n\nBut Wie managed to get on a roll, making birdies at the fourth, sixth, eighth, 11th, 12th, 14th and then at the final three holes. A 15-footer at the last was one of her longest putts and it completed a six-under-par back nine of 30.\n\nFor Kim, a first major would help erase haunting memories of when she missed a one-foot putt to lose the 2012 ANA Inspiration at Rancho Mirage in California. She had eight birdies to finish the day alone in second, one ahead of American Lindy Duncan.\n\nDefending champion Ariya Jutanugarn and world number one Ryu So-Yeon were playing together and both shot one-under rounds of 71.\n\nWorld number two Lexi Thompson was the third member of that marquee group and the best-placed after a birdie at the last sealed a 67.", "eventUri": "eng-3334995", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2017-08-03", "title": "Wie storms into British Open lead", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-03", "id": "15199118", "extractedDates": null, "storyUri": "eng-3334995", "time": "19:52:00", "details": {}, "concepts": [{"score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "id": "76", "location": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 4, "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}, "id": "121", "location": {"label": {"eng": "South Korea"}, "type": "country"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States of America"}, "id": "233", "location": {"label": {"eng": "United States of America"}, "type": "country"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "id": "84296", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fife"}, "id": "89046", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Fife"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fife", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 1, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "id": "227084", "location": {"label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "United States of America"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rancho Mirage, California"}, "id": "229011", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Rancho Mirage, California"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "United States of America"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rancho_Mirage,_California", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "label": {"eng": "Golf"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "302727"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LPGA", "label": {"eng": "LPGA"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "305037"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Open_Championship", "label": {"eng": "The Open Championship"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "305039"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Men's_major_golf_championships", "label": {"eng": "Men's major golf championships"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "309229"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Watson_(golfer)", "label": {"eng": "Tom Watson (golfer)"}, "type": "person", "id": "316751"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Women's_Open_Championship_(golf)", "label": {"eng": "United States Women's Open Championship (golf)"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "393941"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Birkdale_Golf_Club", "label": {"eng": "Royal Birkdale Golf Club"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "528058"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laura_Davies", "label": {"eng": "Laura Davies"}, "type": "person", "id": "707649"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wedge_(golf)", "label": {"eng": "Wedge (golf)"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "1271956"}, {"score": 1, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANA_Inspiration", "label": {"eng": "ANA Inspiration"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "1272858"}], "url": "http://www.sport24.co.za/Golf/wie-storms-into-british-open-lead-20170803", "timeCrawl": "19:52:00", "image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/2813/298ebfe958ea47398d60be8c5b2068ab.jpg", "location": null, "dateTime": "2017-08-03T19:52:00Z", "originalArticle": null, "sim": 0.5882353186607361}

Two behind Kim sits Lexi Thompson, whose secret weapon this week has been her caddie Kevin McAlpine, a former bagman at Kingsbarns Golf Links, who has guided Thompson around the course like a seasoned veteran.\n\nAt four-over par, defending champion Ariya Jutanugarn missed the cut in her third consecutive major championship, due in large part to a second round 77 that included a nine at the par 3, 12th hole.\n\nThe cut line fell at one-under par which sends home notables Nelly Korda (E), Suzann Pettersen (E), Minjee Lee (+1), Karrie Webb (+3) and Danielle Kang (+3).\n\nFor all the latest Sports News, download Indian Express App", "eventUri": "eng-3334995", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2017-08-05", "title": "Aditi Ashok misses cut at Women's British Open", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-05", "id": "15573209", "extractedDates": [{"date": "2017-08-05", "textStart": 34, "amb": false, "textEnd": 48}], "storyUri": "eng-3340242", "time": "16:14:00", "details": {}, "concepts": [{"score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Uttar Pradesh"}, "id": "51434", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Uttar Pradesh"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uttar_Pradesh", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Adugodi"}, "id": "55338", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Adugodi"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 4, "label": {"eng": "St Andrews"}, "id": "84462", "location": {"label": {"eng": "St Andrews"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Andrews", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kingsbarns"}, "id": "87299", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Kingsbarns"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingsbarns", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}, "type": "org", "id": "302866"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_Message_Service", "label": {"eng": "Short Message Service"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "303499"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "304427"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp", "label": {"eng": "WhatsApp"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "306307"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KPMG", "label": {"eng": "KPMG"}, "type": "org", "id": "330189"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_British_Open", "label": {"eng": "Women's British Open"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "363429"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_major_golf_championships", "label": {"eng": "Women's major golf championships"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "363430"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexi_Thompson", "label": {"eng": "Lexi Thompson"}, "type": "person", "id": "372027"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Women's_Open_Championship_(golf)", "label": {"eng": "United States Women's Open Championship (golf)"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "393941"}, {"score": 5, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aditi", "label": {"eng": "Aditi"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "395084"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabaddi", "label": {"eng": "Kabaddi"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "456288"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bagman", "label": {"eng": "Bagman"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "495162"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariya_Jutanugarn", "label": {"eng": "Ariya Jutanugarn"}, "type": "person", "id": "650302"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-Kyung_Kim", "label": {"eng": "In-Kyung Kim"}, "type": "person", "id": "1066828"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANA_Inspiration", "label": {"eng": "ANA Inspiration"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "1272858"}], "url": "http://indianexpress.com/article/sports/golf/aditi-ashok-misses-cut-at-womens-british-open-4784051/", "timeCrawl": "16:14:00", "image": "http://images.indianexpress.com/2017/08/aditi-ashok.jpg?w=759", "location": {"label": {"eng": "St Andrews"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "dateTime": "2017-08-05T16:14:00Z", "originalArticle": null, "sim": 0.5764706134796143}

She was two shots clear of Lexi Thompson and Georgia Hall of England.\n\nKim displayed a remarkable fortitude in weather that veered erratically toward the end of the day between bright sunshine and torrential downpours. The 29-year-old from South Korea atoned for her lone bogey with three birdies and an eagle on the 538-yard 11th hole.\n\n\"The eagle was very unexpected,\" Kim said before conceding her drive landed on a friendly downslope and gained an extra 30 yards or so. \"I think this was kind of as bad as the weather could get. I expected rain, but not like this. It's not easy to play in this kind of weather. But I feel really good about my game. I've been hitting the ball very well and I'm starting to make some putts. That's when I shoot low scores.\"\n\nStill, perhaps the most significant move came from Thompson, the No. 2 player in the world.\n\nTwo-over par and birdie-free after nine-holes, the big-hitting Floridian played the homeward nine in 30 with six birdies - five in succession. In addition, she found time to add a new phrase to golf's already voluminous terminology.\n\n\"I ball-striked it out there,\" she said. That was fair enough, if grammatically flawed. Even on that disappointing front nine, the eight-time LPGA champion struck her shots with an authority few in the women's game can match.\n\n\"I actually hit it the same throughout both nines,\" she said. \"I just left myself with 30-40 feet on my two bogeys and three-putted them. I hit great shots. Going in, they were going right at the flag, but they both got bounces that went sideways. Then I didn't make the second putt. But I hit it great the whole day and just got on a roll there on the back.\"\n\nAnother key to Thompson's success so far is her caddie, Kevin McAlpine. The former Scottish Amateur champion worked four summers at Kingsbarns and knows the course well.\n\n\"Kevin has helped with my decision-making on basically every hole,\" said Thompson. \"His input going into the greens is especially valuable. He tells me where to land the ball and he's been spot on every time. He knows the greens like the back of his hand, as well. He's helped me out a lot out there.\"\n\nFirst-round leader Michelle Wie did not fare so well. The 27-year old American made only one birdie in a 76 that leaves her seven shots off the pace and in a tie for 21st with two rounds remaining.

ANDREWS, Scotland (AP) - I.K. Kim, the best player in women's golf right now, emerged from the cold and wet with a 4-under 68 to build a two-shot lead in the Women's British Open going into the weekend.\n\nA two-time winner on the LPGA Tour over the last two months, Kim dropped only one shot in some of the worst conditions at Kingsbarns Links and reached the halfway point at 11-under 133. She was two shots clear of Lexi Thompson and Georgia Hall of England.\n\nKim displayed a remarkable fortitude in weather that veered erratically toward the end of the day between bright sunshine and torrential downpours. The 29-year-old from South Korea atoned for her lone bogey with three birdies and an eagle on the 538-yard 11th hole.\n\n\"The eagle was very unexpected,\" Kim said before conceding her drive landed on a friendly downslope and gained an extra 30 yards or so. \"I think this was kind of as bad as the weather could get. I expected rain, but not like this. It's not easy to play in this kind of weather. But I feel really good about my game. I've been hitting the ball very well and I'm starting to make some putts. That's when I shoot low scores.\"\n\nStill, perhaps the most significant move came from Thompson, the No. 2 player in the world.\n\nTwo-over par and birdie-free after nine-holes, the big-hitting Floridian played the homeward nine in 30 with six birdies - five in succession. In addition, she found time to add a new phrase to golf's already voluminous terminology.\n\n\"I ball-striked it out there,\" she said. That was fair enough, if grammatically flawed. Even on that disappointing front nine, the eight-time LPGA champion struck her shots with an authority few in the women's game can match.\n\n\"I actually hit it the same throughout both nines,\" she said. \"I just left myself with 30-40 feet on my two bogeys and three-putted them. I hit great shots. Going in, they were going right at the flag, but they both got bounces that went sideways. Then I didn't make the second putt. But I hit it great the whole day and just got on a roll there on the back.\"\n\nAnother key to Thompson's success so far is her caddie, Kevin McAlpine. The former Scottish Amateur champion worked four summers at Kingsbarns and knows the course well.\n\n\"Kevin has helped with my decision-making on basically every hole,\" said Thompson. \"His input going into the greens is especially valuable. He tells me where to land the ball and he's been spot on every time. He knows the greens like the back of his hand, as well. He's helped me out a lot out there.\"\n\nFirst-round leader Michelle Wie did not fare so well. The 27-year old American made only one birdie in a 76 that leaves her seven shots off the pace and in a tie for 21st with two rounds remaining. Wie has not won since the 2014 U.S. Women's Open at Pinehurst No. 2.\n\nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

ANDREWS, Scotland (AP) I.K. Kim, the best player in women's golf right now, emerged from the cold and wet with a 4-under 68 to build a two-shot lead in the Women's British Open going into the weekend.\n\nA two-time winner on the LPGA Tour over the last two months, Kim dropped only one shot in some of the worst conditions at Kingsbarns Links and reached the halfway point at 11-under 133. She was two shots clear of Lexi Thompson and Georgia Hall of England.\n\nKim displayed a remarkable fortitude in weather that veered erratically toward the end of the day between bright sunshine and torrential downpours. The 29-year-old from South Korea atoned for her lone bogey with three birdies and an eagle on the 538-yard 11th hole.\n\n\"The eagle was very unexpected,\" Kim said before conceding her drive landed on a friendly downslope and gained an extra 30 yards or so. \"I think this was kind of as bad as the weather could get. I expected rain, but not like this. It's not easy to play in this kind of weather. But I feel really good about my game. I've been hitting the ball very well and I'm starting to make some putts. That's when I shoot low scores.\"\n\nStill, perhaps the most significant move came from Thompson, the No. 2 player in the world.\n\nTwo-over par and birdie-free after nine-holes, the big-hitting Floridian played the homeward nine in 30 with six birdies - five in succession. In addition, she found time to add a new phrase to golf's already voluminous terminology.\n\n\"I ball-striked it out there,\" she said. That was fair enough, if grammatically flawed. Even on that disappointing front nine, the eight-time LPGA champion struck her shots with an authority few in the women's game can match.\n\n\"I actually hit it the same throughout both nines,\" she said. \"I just left myself with 30-40 feet on my two bogeys and three-putted them. I hit great shots. Going in, they were going right at the flag, but they both got bounces that went sideways. Then I didn't make the second putt. But I hit it great the whole day and just got on a roll there on the back.\"\n\nAnother key to Thompson's success so far is her caddie, Kevin McAlpine. The former Scottish Amateur champion worked four summers at Kingsbarns and knows the course well.\n\n\"Kevin has helped with my decision-making on basically every hole,\" said Thompson. \"His input going into the greens is especially valuable. He tells me where to land the ball and he's been spot on every time. He knows the greens like the back of his hand, as well. He's helped me out a lot out there.\"\n\nFirst-round leader Michelle Wie did not fare so well. The 27-year old American made only one birdie in a 76 that leaves her seven shots off the pace and in a tie for 21st with two rounds remaining. Wie has not won since the 2014 U.S. Women's Open at Pinehurst No. 2.", "eventUri": "eng-3334995", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2017-08-04", "title": "I.K.

She has made the cut in two of the first three Majors in her rookie season on the LPGA.\n\nAditi had just two birdies on fifth and eighth, but she dropped shots on third, fourth and then a double on par-4 10th before two more bogeys on 14th and 16th for a 76.\n\nMichelle Wie shot a women's course record eight-under-par 64 in fair conditions at Kingsbarns Golf Links to take a one stroke

LPGA Tour a fortnight ago.\n\nLindy Duncan from the United States was a stroke behind in the third position.\n\nThe Britons were especially inspired, with English pair Mel Reid and Jodi Ewart Shadoff tied for fourth place on five-under-par, alongside Anne Van Dam from the Netherlands, Chella Choi of South Korea and Lexi Thompson of the United States.\n\nDame Laura Davies, who qualified for her 37th consecutive appearance in the championship, was in vintage form as she shot a 68 for a share of ninth position with compatriots Charley Hull and Georgia Hall, Swede Anna Nordqvist and American trio Ally McDonald, Morgan Pressel and Jaye Marie Green.\n\nDavies had been six-under through 14 holes before the first of two weather delays, due to the threat of lightning, but after a torrential downpour and a one-hour suspension, she double bogeyed the 15th and then dropped another shot at the 16th only to birdie the 18th hole.\n\nFor all the latest Sports News, download Indian Express App",

She remains the only English winner since the British became a major in 2001.\n\nEnglish golfers haven't fared too well ever since. This year could be different. Five English players occupy the top 10 after the first round at Kingsbarns.\n\nMel Reid and Jodi Ewart Shadoff are tied for fourth on five under par after matching 67s, three shots behind Michelle Wie. Charley Hull, Georgia Hall and Laura Davies are a shot further back.\n\nReid should be closer to the lead, but squandered shots with two bogeys in her last five holes. \"I definitely left a few out there for sure,\" said Reid, who also missed a 12-foot birdie opportunity on the final green. \"Hopefully I'm saving them for the next three days.\"\n\nThe 29-year-old finished T-9 at Turnberry two years ago, her best finish in her home Open. However, she's a different player this year after qualifying for the LPGA Tour.\n\n\"The strength and depth of the girls out there is very, very strong, which is amazing to be around because it helps you get better.\"\n\nShadoff knows all about the strength and depth of the LPGA. She's played most of her career in the United States, although she has yet to win. That may come this week at Kingsbarns.\n\nShe had to endure two rain weather delays before she finished her round. Yet she managed to maintain her patience to go bogey free.\n\nDavies is the biggest surprise on the leaderboard. The 53-year-old had to go through qualifying to get into the field, and didn't play a practice round. No wonder she didn't give herself much of a chance in her pre-tournament press conference.\n\n\"I'm not saying I can win,\" Davies said. \"Obviously that's a ridiculous statement.\"\n\nEspecially since she hasn't recorded a top-10 anywhere in the world since finishing fourth in Japan three years ago. Yet the Hall of Famer went out in five-under-par 31. She got to six under, two shots off the lead, with a birdie at the 15th. Then she lapsed into ridiculous mode to back up a pre-tournament claim: \"Even if I got into contention, I don't know if I'd be able to handle it.\"\n\nShe didn't.\n\nShe double bogeyed the par-5 15th hole and dropped another shot at the 16th. Still, a 68 has her looking to improve on a ninth-place finish at Royal Birkdale three years ago.\n\n\"I'm under no illusions of winning, but I would love to have a good week and just try to scare the leaders a bit.\"\n\nThe same can't be said for Hull. She thinks she can win every time she tees it up.\n\nHull could also be closer to Wie's lead if not for three-putting the 16th and 17th greens, which she blamed on heavy rain slowing down the putting surfaces. Yet she still enjoyed her round.\n\n\"I like the challenge and the struggle,\" she said. \"I like the battle. I think it's more fun.\n\n\"I'm confident going into tomorrow.\"\n\nHall's having a hard time focussing this week because she's got the Solheim Cup on her mind.\n\nThe 21-year-old leads the LET Solheim Cup Points race for the match to be played at Des Moines Golf and Country Club. She's set to make her debut.\n\n\"It's hard for me because the Solheim Cup is massive,\" Hall said. \"It's a dream for me, and it's only two weeks away. I kind of have to put that out of my head at the moment and focus on the British Open. I've had a good first round, so hopefully I can continue that.\"\n\nEnglish golf fans will be hoping that applies to the rest of her compatriots.", "eventUri": "eng-3334995", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2017-08-03", "title": "Mel Reid, other English contenders look to end drought at Women's British Open", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-03", "id": "15235825", "extractedDates": null, "storyUri": "eng-3334995", "time": "23:42:00", "details": {}, "concepts": [{"score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "id": "76", "location": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "id": "113", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "type": "country"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States of America"}, "id": "233", "location": {"label": {"eng": "United States of America"}, "type": "country"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Turnberry (golf course)"}, "id": "82938", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Turnberry (golf course)"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turnberry_(golf_course)", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "id": "84296", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kingsbarns"}, "id": "87299", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Kingsbarns"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingsbarns", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "id": "182942", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "United States of America"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 4, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "id": "242110", "location": {"label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 1, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "label": {"eng": "Golf"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "302727"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelle_Wie", "label": {"eng": "Michelle Wie"}, "type": "person", "id": "305032"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LPGA", "label": {"eng": "LPGA"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "305037"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Open_Championship", "label": {"eng": "The Open Championship"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "305039"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_British_Open", "label": {"eng": "Women's British Open"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "363429"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charley_Hull", "label": {"eng": "Charley Hull"}, "type": "person", "id": "409778"}, {"score": 1, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ladies_European_Tour", "label": {"eng": "Ladies European Tour"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "410805"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solheim_Cup", "label": {"eng": "Solheim Cup"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "456103"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Birkdale_Golf_Club", "label": {"eng": "Royal Birkdale Golf Club"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "528058"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laura_Davies", "label": {"eng": "Laura Davies"}, "type": "person", "id": "707649"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jodi_Ewart_Shadoff", "label": {"eng": "Jodi Ewart Shadoff"}, "type": "person", "id": "845471"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karen_Stupples", "label": {"eng": "Karen Stupples"}, "type": "person", "id": "1103266"}, {"score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Des Moines Golf and Country Club"}, "id": "1422283", "location": null, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Des_Moines_Golf_and_Country_Club", "type": "loc"}], "url": "http://golfweek.com/2017/08/03/mel-reid-other-english-contenders-look-to-end-drought-at-womens-british-open/", "timeCrawl": "23:42:00", "image": "https://usatgolfweek.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/gettyimages-825875954.jpg?w=640", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "dateTime": "2017-08-03T23:42:00Z", "originalArticle": null, "sim": 0.4862745106220245}

But the lack of rest did not seem to hurt the 2014 Kraft Nabisco champion as she shot a 4-under 68 to grab an early share of the 36-hole lead at the Women's British Open.\n\n\"I didn't get too much sleep last night with the quick turn-around,\" Thompson, who overcame Thursday afternoon's lousy weather that forced a couple of halts in play, told Golf Channel after a six-birdie back nine. \"Just focus on relaxing tonight and get a good night's rest.\"\n\nThe day could have gone sidewise for the big-hitting 22-year-old after a sluggish start with two straight bogeys on holes three and four. Once she made the turn, though, Thompson took off, making five straight birdies.\n\nThompson added another birdie on the par-4 17th to waltz into a tie with Georgia Hall (68-67).\n\n\"I just had a little bit of a slow start but I hit it great the whole day,\" Thompson said. \"I knew it was a matter of time before I was about to make a few birdies and just got on a roll there.\"\n\nWith a win and five runner-up finishes in 14 starts this year, as well as achieving the No. 2 spot in the world rankings, Thompson was bound to keep the good times rolling. Having a caddie who knows his way around the Scottish links track certainly has helped.\n\n\"His local knowledge has helped me out tremendously,\" Thompson said Thursday about Kevin McAlpine, who caddied for four summers at Kingsbarns, is an accomplished amateur golfer in his own right, and has looped for Thompson since March. \"I'm very lucky to have him on the bag every week, but especially this week.\"\n\nIn other action, 18-hole leader Michelle Wie began her second round much as she did her first, with an early bogey after she bladed a chip shot across the green on the par-4 third.

She atoned for her lone bogey with three birdies and an eagle on the 538-yard 11th hole.\n\n\"The eagle was very unexpected,\" Kim said before conceding her drive landed on a friendly downslope and gained an extra 30 yards or so. \"I think this was kind of as bad as the weather could get.

But I hit it great the whole day and just got on a roll there on the back.\"\n\nThat \"roll\" included five consecutive birdies from the turn, a run that was, ironically given the power Thompson routinely displays from the tee, broken by a par on the 539-yard par-5 15th.\n\nRELATED: Lexi Thompson perfectly pokes fun at LPGA's stricter dress code\n\nStill, it wasn't her distance off the tee that Thompson felt had been the biggest key to her success. Most of the credit, she felt, should go to her caddie, Kevin McAlpine. The former Scottish Amateur champion - the son of a famous Scottish footballer, the former Dundee United goalkeeper, Hamish - worked four summers at Kingsbarns and so knows the course well.\n\n\"Kevin has helped with my decision-making on basically every hole,\" said Thompson. \"His input going into the greens is especially valuable. He tells me where to land the ball and he's been spot on every time. He knows the greens like the back of his hand, as well. He's helped me out a lot out there.\"\n\nAs for Hall, the 21-year old - who is already all-but assured of making her Solheim Cup debut later this month - underlined her enormous promise with a second-round 67 that included as many as seven birdies. Four of those came in succession, a run the former Curtis Cup player claimed as her longest-ever visit to the land of red numbers.\n\n\"I try to play level-headed all the time, whether I get a birdie or a bogey,\" said Hall, who intends to compete at the LPGA qualifying school later this year. \"I'm just trying to get as many birdies as I can out there. The course is quite 'scoreable' today because it wasn't that windy. It was a bit tougher yesterday, so I tried to get off to a good start. Which I did. And I managed to hole a couple of good putts on the back nine.\"\n\nA word too for the defending champion Ariya Jutanugarn. Cruising along at three-under par for the tournament after 29-holes, the 21-year old Thai came unstuck at the diminutive 135-yard par-3 12th. Her first shot found sand by the green. Her second shot finished in the same bunker. As did the third. And the fourth. And the fifth. And the sixth. The seventh emerged onto the putting surface and two-putts later a big fat '9' was on the card.\n\nFive pars and a bogey later, Jutanugarn finished on four-over par, a figure that will comfortably allow her the luxury of finding something else to do over the weekend.", "eventUri": "eng-3334995", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2017-08-04", "title": "Lexi Thompson gets it half right, takes share of the lead - Golf Digest", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-04", "id": "15389758", "extractedDates": null, "storyUri": "eng-3334995", "time": "15:19:00", "details": {}, "concepts": [{"score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "id": "84296", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kingsbarns"}, "id": "87299", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Kingsbarns"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingsbarns", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "id": "181655", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "United States of America"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "id": "242110", "location": {"label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "label": {"eng": "Golf"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "302727"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goalkeeper_(association_football)", "label": {"eng": "Goalkeeper (association football)"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "303977"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LPGA", "label": {"eng": "LPGA"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "305037"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_in_Scotland", "label": {"eng": "Football in Scotland"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "329347"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_British_Open", "label": {"eng": "Women's British Open"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "363429"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexi_Thompson", "label": {"eng": "Lexi Thompson"}, "type": "person", "id": "372027"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caddy", "label": {"eng": "Caddy"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "376875"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dundee_United_F.C.", "label": {"eng": "Dundee United F.C."}, "type": "wiki", "id": "391428"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualifying_school", "label": {"eng": "Qualifying school"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "395080"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curtis_Cup", "label": {"eng": "Curtis Cup"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "415380"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solheim_Cup", "label": {"eng": "Solheim Cup"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "456103"}, {"score": 1, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariya_Jutanugarn", "label": {"eng": "Ariya Jutanugarn"}, "type": "person", "id": "650302"}], "url": "https://www.golfdigest.com/story/lexi-thompson-gets-it-half-right-takes-share-of-the-lead", "timeCrawl": "15:19:00", "image": "https://media.golfdigest.com/photos/598482fb1125241370011382/master/pass/Lexi-Thompson.jpg", "location": null, "dateTime": "2017-08-04T15:19:00Z", "originalArticle": null, "sim": 0.4313725531101227}

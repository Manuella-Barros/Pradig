A victory against their rivals is crucial for Babar Azam's team to regain momentum in the tournament.The contrasting starts to the competition for the two sides have set the stage for an intriguing clash. India commenced their campaign with a commanding eight-wicket triumph over Ireland. On the other hand, Pakistan suffered a stunning defeat against co-hosts USA, with the match being decided in a dramatic Super Over.\u201cVirat Kohli and Jasprit Bumrah will make an impact for India in the game because of their experience and also the quality of both of them. They can easily take the game away from Pakistan,\u201d Alam told PTI.\u201cAs a team, India is well-balanced, and it will be really hard to get past them.\u201d 110814728Alam, who played 19 Tests, 38 ODIs and 24 T20Is for his country, said left-arm pacer Mohammad Amir will have to come up with a match-turning effort against India, similar to his burst against them in the Champions Trophy final 2017.\u201cI feel Mohammad Amir will redeem himself and give a match-winning performance against India alongside captain Babar who has had a pretty decent record against them,\u201d said Alam, whose last T20I for Pakistan came back in 2010.Amir had an ordinary Super Over against the USA, conceding 18 runs, but Alam warned against writing the pacer off.\u201cBased on that super over, you can't blame Amir. He is not the same bowler as he was four years back.\u201cHe has been playing cricket in different leagues and is still Pakistan's best and most experienced bowler,\u201d he added. 110819333Alam, however, accepted that losing to the USA was not \u201cacceptable\u201d and Pakistan would feel pressure against India.\u201cPakistan losing to the USA is very shocking. The USA is playing in their first World Cup, so it is not acceptable at all. 110746013\u201cNow the pressure is on Pakistan in the game against India. All I can hope is for a good game of cricket,\u201d he said.Alam hoped that Pakistan bowling would come good against India, despite lacking good spin options.\u201cImad Wasim's injury has come as a shock. Shadab is completely out of form with the ball in his hand. Pakistan is clearly lagging in bowling, especially in the spin department. 110817058\u201cIndia has Bumrah, (Mohammad) Siraj, and Kuldeep (Yadav) who can pose a threat. But if Pakistan bowling clicks in the improved conditions as claimed by ICC then we may witness them having an edge over India,\u201d he noted.The left-arm spinner said the International Cricket Council (ICC) should have inspected the drop-in pitch in New York well in advance to the tournament.The deck at the Nassau County stadium has been offering variable bounce to pacers, often posing a threat to batters' limbs.India's Rohit Sharma and Rishabh Pant took hits during the match against Ireland.\u201cIf the wickets are well-prepared in Dallas and Florida then why didn't you host the games there? Now, you are trying to cover up but what about those teams who have already played their games and lost those matches? Who is responsible for that?\u201d he said.(With inputs from PTI)", "summary": "Pakistan's all-rounder Fawad Alam highlighted the importance of neutralizing the influence of Indian stars Virat Kohli and Jasprit Bumrah in their upcoming high-stakes T20 World Cup clash on Sunday.

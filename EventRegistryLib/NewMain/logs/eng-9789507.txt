The report also highlighted that at least 60 Palestinian detainees have died in Israeli custody since October 7, with 48 of these deaths occurring among prisoners from Gaza.\n\nThe report's release follows the detention of nine Israeli soldiers accused of severe abuse, including the sexual assault of a prisoner at a military facility in the Negev desert. This incident has further intensified scrutiny on Israel's treatment of Palestinian detainees.\n\n'Israel is committing torture that amounts to a war crime'\n\nA spokesperson for the Israel Prison Service (IPS) denied the allegations, stating that all prisoners are treated in accordance with the law and that their basic rights are fully upheld by professionally trained guards. The spokesperson also mentioned that detainees have the right to file complaints, claiming they are thoroughly investigated.\n\nHowever, videos and images of Palestinian detainees following their release show otherwise, with traces of torture, malnutrition, and psychological trauma evident on the wide-eyed and trembling prisoners.\n\nThe findings have added to the mounting international pressure on Israel regarding its immoral conduct in the ongoing war on Gaza. Qadura Fares, head of the Palestine Liberation Organization's Commission for Prisoners and Ex-Detainees Affairs, has called for an international commission of inquiry to hold Israel accountable for its crimes against Palestinian detainees.\n\nB'Tselem points out that the number of Palestinians held in Israeli jails has doubled to 9,623 since the war on Gaza began. The report said that this policy is being implemented under the direction of National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, with the full support of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\n\"Given the severity of the acts, the extent to which the provisions of international law are\n\nbeing violated, and the fact that these violations are directed at the entire population of\n\nPalestinian prisoners daily and over time - the only possible conclusion is that in carrying out these acts, Israel is committing torture that amounts to a war crime and even a crime against humanity,\" the report concluded.\n\nRead also: Freed Palestinian Prisoners Accuse Israeli Occupation Forces of Torture\n\n\u00a9 Morocco World News.

(Reuters)\n\nThousands of Palestinian prisoners are facing systematic abuse and torture in Israeli jails since the war sparked by Hamas's October 7 attack, an Israeli human rights group said Tuesday.\n\nTestimonies from 55 ex-detainees revealed \"inhuman conditions\", according to the report by B'Tselem, which said more than a dozen prison facilities were being used as \"de facto torture camps\".\n\n\"The testimonies clearly indicated a systematic, institutional policy focused on the continual abuse and torture of all Palestinian prisoners held by Israel,\" the report said, AFP reported.\n\nEx-inmates described \"frequent acts of severe, arbitrary violence; sexual assault; humiliation and degradation, deliberate starvation; forced unhygienic conditions (and) sleep deprivation\", it added.\n\nThe Israel Prison Service, the body that runs Israel's prisons, responded that \"all prisoners are held legally, and their basic rights are fully provided by skilled and professional prison officers and commanders\".\n\nThe report's allegations are \"baseless\", the body said in a statement sent to AFP, but added that all prisoners and detainees have the right to file an official complaint.\n\nThe Israeli military said \"any abuse of detainees, whether during arrest or interrogation, is illegal and against (Israeli military) guidelines, and is strictly prohibited.\n\n\"The army categorically rejects allegations of systematic abuse, including sexual abuse, in its detention facilities.\"\n\nThe B'Tselem dossier comes a week after a United Nations report said Palestinian prisoners were subjected to treatment that may amount to torture.\n\nOn Monday, a panel of UN experts also warned of the \"escalating use of torture\" by Israel against Palestinian prisoners since the war in Gaza began.\n\nLast month, Israel's military said nine soldiers were being held for the suspected abuse of a Palestinian detainee at a facility holding Palestinians arrested from Gaza.\n\nB'Tselem said Israeli authorities declared a \"prison state of emergency\" on October 18, 11 days after the Hamas attack on Israeli soil that triggered the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nThe report said \"unrelenting physical and psychological violence, denial of medical treatment, starvation, withholding of water, sleep deprivation and confiscation of all personal belongings\" are now applied across all prisons.\n\nThe number of Palestinians in Israeli prisons and detention facilities has almost doubled since before the war to 9,623 by early July, nearly half of them detained without trial and without being informed of the allegations against them, B'Tselem said.\n\n\"More than a dozen Israeli prison facilities, both military and civilian, were converted into a network of camps dedicated to the abuse of inmates,\" the report added.\n\n\"Such spaces, in which every inmate is intentionally condemned to severe, relentless pain and suffering, operate as de facto torture camps.\"", "source": {"uri": "english.aawsat.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Asharq Al-Awsat English"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Israeli press reports said the soldiers were accused of sexually abusing a member of an elite Hamas unit.\n\nThe report detailed allegations that Palestinian prisoners were subjected to arbitrary beatings, degrading and humiliating treatment and sleep deprivation, as well as \"the repeated use of sexual violence, in varying degrees of severity\".\n\n\"The overall picture indicates abuse and torture carried out under orders, in utter defiance of Israel's obligations both under domestic law and international law,\" it said.\n\n'Utter humiliation'\n\nFathiyeh Abu Mousa said the treatment she received was routinely humiliating and that she was held in handcuffs and chains even as she was being released from detention in July without charges being laid.\n\n\"The food is very bad and they give it to us in a humiliating manner,\" she told Reuters. \"They gave us two meals a day, no clothes or shampoo to bathe or shower. My face flared up with a rash from the mattress. It was utter humiliation there.\"\n\nAllegations of prisoner abuse have surfaced repeatedly during the Gaza war, adding to mounting international pressure on Israel over its conduct of the 10-month-old conflict.\n\nThe report from B'Tselem, a group that documents human rights violations by Israel in the occupied West Bank and other areas, said the treatment accorded to prisoners was a deliberate policy implemented under the direction of the far-right national security minister Itamar Ben-Gvir.\n\nThe prison service spokesperson said that since the October 7 attack, Ben-Gvir had ordered that prison conditions be made more strict to reverse an improvement in conditions allowed previously.\n\nQadura Fares, head of the Palestine Liberation Organization's Commission for Prisoners and Ex-Detainees Affairs, reiterated a call for an international commission of inquiry into the treatment of prisoners to hold Israel accountable.\n\n\"We have documentation of the crimes committed by Israel against Palestinian detainees in its prisons and we have horrific testimonies of what detainees are subjected to, whether related to torture, rape and other crimes,\" he said.\n\nReuters",

The Israeli judiciary has a terrible record of failing to credibly investigate torture allegations by Palestinians,\" she added.\n\nThe international community must also demand that the Israeli authorities grant \"immediate and unrestricted access\" for independent monitors to all places of detention to assess conditions, she added.\n\nOn Sunday, an Israeli military court decided to extend the detention of five soldiers accused of sexually assaulting a Palestinian detainee from Gaza at Sde Teiman Prison in the Negev desert in southern Israel, local media reported.\n\nOn July 29, Israel's official broadcasting authority KAN reported that 10 Israeli soldiers had been detained after causing serious injuries to the Palestinian detainee, but five of them were later released.\n\nPalestinian, Israeli and international human rights reports have recently indicated that prisoners from Gaza have been tortured at the prison, which has led to the deaths of dozens of them.\n\nIsrael, flouting a UN Security Council resolution demanding an immediate cease-fire, has faced international condemnation amid its continued brutal offensive on Gaza since an attack last October by the Palestinian resistance group Hamas.\n\nNearly 39,600 Palestinians have since been killed, mostly women and children, and nearly 91,400 injured, according to local health authorities.\n\nAlmost 10 months into the Israeli war, vast tracts of Gaza lie in ruins amid a crippling blockade of food, clean water and medicine.\n\nIsrael stands accused of genocide at the International Court of Justice, which ordered it to immediately halt its military operation in the southern city of Rafah, where more than 1 million Palestinians had sought refuge from the war before

One night, they had a barbecue next to us, sang and talked about soccer loudly. They did all that to make it hard for us to sleep.\"\n\nAllegations of prisoner abuse have emerged repeatedly since the war on Gaza began, increasing international pressure on Israel over its conduct during the ten-month onslaught.\n\nB'Tselem, an Israeli NGO which documents human rights violations by Israel in the occupied West Bank and other areas, claimed that the treatment of prisoners was a deliberate policy directed by hardline National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir.\n\nA spokesperson for the prison service noted that since the October 7 attack, Ben-Gvir had ordered stricter prison conditions to reverse previous improvements.\n\nBen-Gvir himself has often boasted that, under his oversight, conditions for Palestinian detainees have significantly worsened.\n\n\"I take pride in the fact that during my tenure, we altered all the conditions,\" he stated to members of the Knesset during a heated parliamentary session in July.\n\nThe Jerusalem-based group concluded in its months-long investigation that Israeli prisons should be named \"torture camps\".\n\nThe report was released days after the Israeli military detained nine soldiers accused of the severe assault of a Palestinian detainee in the Sde Teiman military facility in the Negev desert.\n\nAccording to Israeli media, the soldiers are suspected of sexually abusing a Palestinian prisoner.\n\nB'tselem's report also follows a series of other reports, including by the UN, which disclose allegations of abuse against Palestinian detainees.\n\nThe United Nations human rights office said late last month that thousands of Palestinians have been detained in Gaza, the West Bank and Israel since the start of the conflict.\n\nThey have mostly been held in secret and in some cases subjected to treatment that may amount to torture, the OHCHR reported.", "source": {"uri": "newarab.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New Arab"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

This number does not include all Gaza detainees.\n\nMany testimonies, which came following limited lawyers' visits to several Gaza detainees, revealed being subjected to brutal maltreatment, including torture, rape, starvation and medical crimes, along with other human rights violations.\n\nPPS and the Commission renewed their demand to open an impartial international investigation into the crimes and grave violations committed against Palestinian detainees in the occupation's prisons and camps.\n\nThe number of Palestinians detained since the start of the aggression and until the beginning of August amounted to about 9,900.

Israeli human rights group said Tuesday.\n\nTestimonies from 55 ex-detainees revealed \"inhuman conditions\", according to the report by B'Tselem, which said more than a dozen prison facilities were being used as \"de facto torture camps\".\n\n\"The testimonies clearly indicated a systematic, institutional policy focused on the continual abuse and torture of all Palestinian prisoners held by Israel,\" the report said.\n\nEx-inmates described \"frequent acts of severe, arbitrary violence; sexual assault; humiliation and degradation, deliberate starvation; forced unhygienic conditions [and] sleep deprivation\", it added.\n\nThe Israel Prison Service, the body that runs Israel's prisons, responded that \"all prisoners are held legally, and their basic rights are fully provided by skilled and professional prison officers and commanders\".\n\nThe report's allegations are \"baseless\", the body said in a statement sent to AFP, but added that all prisoners and detainees have the right to file an official complaint.\n\nThe B'Tselem dossier comes a week after a United Nations report said Palestinian prisoners were subjected to treatment that may amount to torture.\n\nOn Monday, a panel of UN experts also warned of the \"escalating use of torture\" by Israel against Palestinian prisoners since the war in Gaza began.\n\nLast month, Israel's military said nine soldiers were being held for the suspected abuse of a Palestinian detainee at a facility holding Palestinians arrested from Gaza.\n\nB'Tselem said Israeli authorities declared a \"prison state of emergency\" on October 18, 11 days after the Hamas attack on Israeli soil that triggered the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nThe report said \"unrelenting physical and psychological violence, denial of medical treatment, starvation, withholding of water, sleep deprivation and confiscation of all personal belongings\" are now applied across all prisons.\n\nThe number of Palestinians in Israeli prisons and detention facilities has almost doubled since before the war to 9,623 by early July, nearly half of them detained without trial and without being informed of the allegations against them, B'Tselem said.\n\n\"More than a dozen Israeli prison facilities, both military and civilian, were converted into a network of camps dedicated to the abuse of inmates,\" the report added.\n\n\"Such spaces, in which every inmate is intentionally condemned to severe, relentless pain and suffering, operate as de facto torture camps.\"", "source": {"uri": "jordantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jordan Times"}, "authors":

The report came out days after the Israeli military detained nine soldiers accused of severe abuse of a prisoner in a military facility in the Negev desert.\n\nIsrael has conducted a systematic policy of prisoner abuse and torture since the start of the war in Gaza, subjecting Palestinian detainees to acts ranging from arbitrary violence to sexual abuse, a report from Israeli rights group B'Tselem said on Monday.\n\nThe group said the report was based on interviews with 55 Palestinians from Gaza, the West Bank and Israel, who were detained in Israeli prisons since the Oct. 7 attack on Israel that set off the war, most of them without being tried.\n\n\"The testimonies clearly indicate a systematic, institutional policy focused on the continual abuse and torture of all Palestinian prisoners held by Israel,\" the report said.\n\nThe report was issued days after the Israeli military detained nine soldiers accused of severe abuse of a prisoner in a military facility in the Negev desert. According to Israeli press reports, the soldiers are accused of sexually abusing a member of an elite Hamas unit.\n\nA spokesperson for the Israel Prison Service said that all prisoners were treated according to the law and all basic rights were fully applied by professionally trained guards.\n\n\"We are not aware of the claims you described and as far as we know, no such events have occurred under IPS responsibility,\" the spokesperson said, adding that detainees had the right to file complaints that would be fully examined and investigated.\n\nB'Tselem detailed allegations that Palestinian prisoners were subjected to arbitrary beatings, degrading and humiliating treatment and sleep deprivation, as well as \"the repeated use of sexual violence, in varying degrees of severity\".\n\n\"The overall picture indicates abuse and torture carried out under orders, in utter defiance of Israel's obligations both under domestic law and international law,\" the report said.\n\nAllegations of prisoner abuse have surfaced repeatedly during the war in Gaza, adding to mounting international pressure on Israel over its conduct of the 10 month-old war.\n\nThe report from B'Tselem, a group that documents human rights violations by Israel in the occupied West Bank and other areas, said the treatment accorded to prisoners was a deliberate policy implemented under the direction of the hardline National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir.\n\nThe prison service spokesperson said that since the Oct. 7 attack, Ben-Gvir had ordered that prison conditions be made more strict to reverse an improvement in conditions allowed previously.\n\nRead more'We don't know where he is': Israel's administrative detention rates soar after October 7\n\nQadura Fares, head of the

This is the definition of a torture camp: a place that once you enter - no matter who you are or why you were arrested - you will be subjected to severe, deliberate, relentless pain and suffering.\"\n\nNovak added the government \"cynically exploited our collective trauma\" caused by the Hamas-led 7 October attack to employ the \"racist, violent agenda\" of National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir, who oversees prison authorities.\n\n\"This government has driven us to an all-time moral low, proving again its utter disregard for human lives - of the Israeli hostages in Gaza, of Israelis and Palestinians living through ongoing war, and of the Palestinians held in torture camps.\"\n\nThe abuse described in the B'Tselem report matches dozens of testimonies given to Middle East Eye and other media outlets since the war started.\n\nLast month, MEE spoke with Palestinian bodybuilder Muazzaz Abayat after he was released from prison emaciated, unable to walk unaided, his right arm jerking shapelessly in front of him and his face a picture of confusion.\n\nBefore the Israeli army arrested him late last year, Abayat was a muscular and confident man. An amateur bodybuilder, he weighed 109kg. After nine months in Israeli prisons, the Palestinian lost more than half of his body weight and was suffering from psychological problems caused by the trauma he experienced.\n\nAbayat was beaten so regularly, so brutally and by so many different people in prison that he now sees everyone as a potential threat. His first words to MEE were: \"I have not been beaten for the three days since I left jail. I was told that I was not going to be beaten in this hospital.\"\n\nSpeaking slowly but fluently, he said he could not recall his life before Israeli soldiers arrested him: \"I can't get the prison out of my head and can't remember. I am still living in the prison. I have the prison inside me.\"\n\nB'Tselem detailed similar testimonies, with several people reporting sexual assault.\n\nThe rights group announced reports of sexual violence suggested it was \"recurring with varying severity and carried out by soldiers or prison guards against Palestinian prisoners\".\n\nLast week, nine Israeli soldiers in the notorious Sde Teiman facility were detained for questioning over alleged sexual abuse against a Palestinian detainee, which led to him being hospitalised with serious injuries to his rectum area. The soldiers deny the charges.\n\nSince 7 October, Israeli authorities unleashed a massive crackdown on Palestinians across the occupied territories and within Israel.\n\nNearly 10,000 people were arrested from the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem alone in the past 10 months, and around 3,000-5,000 were taken from the Gaza Strip.\n\nAround 10,000 people remain in custody as of July, nearly double the number of Palestinian detainees before the war, according to HaMoked, an Israeli-based human rights group.\n\nB'Tselem added the Israeli violations against Palestinian detainees lead to the \"inevitable conclusion that Israel is committing torture that amounts to a war crime and even a crime against humanity\".\n\nThe group called for international bodies, including the International Criminal Court (ICC), to immediately intervene to \"stop the brutal treatment of Palestinians in these detention facilities\".", "source": {"uri": "ifpnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Iran

Another unknown number are arbitrarily being held in detention facilities and ad hoc camps following a wave of arrest and abduction campaigns across Palestinian territory that targeted men, women and children particularly following 7 October.\n\nThe experts received substantiated reports of widespread abuse, torture, sexual assault and rape, amid atrocious inhumane conditions, with at least 53 Palestinians apparently dying as a result in 10 months.\n\nCountless testimonies by men and women speak of detainees in cage-like enclosures, tied to beds blindfolded and in diapers, stripped naked, deprived of adequate healthcare, food, water and sleep, electrocutions including on their genitals, blackmail and cigarette burns. In addition, victims spoke of loud music played until their ears bled, attacks by dogs, waterboarding, suspension from ceilings and severe sexual and gender-based violence.\n\n\"Allegations of gang-rape of a Palestinian detainee, now shockingly supported by voices in the Israeli political establishment and society, provide irrefutable evidence that the moral compass is lost,\" the experts said. In February 2024, a number of experts also expressed grave concern regarding the reports of sexual and other forms of gender-based violence committed against Palestinian women and girls in Israeli detention.\n\nThe Special Rapporteur on the occupied Palestinian territory investigated Israel's detention practices in 2023 and called on UN Member States to intervene and the International Criminal Court to promptly investigate what appeared to be a consolidated crime against humanity.

They called for oversight and accountability over all Israeli practices and policies in the territory.\n\n\"Decrying the silence by Member States following the emergence of testimonies and reports of alleged maltreatment and torture, the experts called for pressure on Israel with a view to implementing a cogent system of access, monitoring and protection of Palestinian detainees. The Human Rights Council, in particular, must urgently demand the deployment of special procedures mandate holders and the Commission of Inquiry to facilities holding Palestinians, they said.\n\n\"What is required now is nothing short of an independent, international presence of human rights observers.

Some allegedly have suffered electrocutions on their genitals, together with cigarette burns, the experts said.\n\nSome victims also spoke of loud music played until their ears bled, being attacked by dogs, waterboarding, suspension from ceilings and severe sexual and gender-based violence.\n\n\"Allegations of gang-rape of a Palestinian detainee, now shockingly supported by voices in the Israeli political establishment and society, provide irrefutable evidence that the moral compass is lost,\" the experts said.\n\nPrevious warnings unheeded\n\nIn February 2024, a number of experts had expressed grave concern regarding the reports of sexual and other forms of gender-based violence committed against Palestinian women and girls in Israeli detention.\n\nFrancesca Albanese, the Special Rapporteur on the Occupied Palestinian Territory, investigated Israel's detention practices in 2023 and called on UN Member States to intervene and the International Criminal Court (ICC) to promptly investigate what appeared to be a consolidated crime against humanity.\n\nOn Monday, the experts said they regretted this call was not heeded.\n\n\"Torture practices are irredeemably unlawful and constitute international crimes yet form part of the modus operandi of Israel's notorious detention and torture system,\" the experts warned. \"These practices are intended to punish Palestinians for resisting occupation and seek to destroy them individually and collectively.\"\n\nDe facto hostages\n\nMost Palestinian detainees are \"de facto hostages of an unlawful occupation\", the experts said, referring to the July 2024 advisory opinion from the International Court of Justice (ICJ) on the legal consequences of Israel's occupation of Palestinian territory.\n\nAs such, the experts called for oversight and accountability over all Israeli practices and policies in the territory.\n\n\"Israel's genocidal destruction in Gaza, which is spreading across the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, serves as the backdrop to its abusive detention programme today,\" the experts said.\n\nUN Member States must end their silence\n\nDecrying the silence by Member States following the emergence of testimonies and reports of alleged maltreatment and torture, the experts called for greater pressure to be applied to Israel with a view to implementing a cogent system of access, monitoring and protection of Palestinian detainees.\n\nThe Human Rights Council must urgently demand the deployment of special procedures mandate holders and the Commission of Inquiry, to facilities holding Palestinians, they said.\n\nSpecial Rapporteurs and other UN rights experts are part of what is known as the Special Procedures.

violence against Palestinian detainees 'war crime,' says Amnesty International | News", "body": "Amnesty International documents harrowing torture, ill-treatment of Palestinian detainees at Israel's Sde Teiman military camp\n\nIsrael's inhumane treatment of Palestinian detainees at Sde Teiman Prison in southern Israel, including torture and sexual violence, are \"war crimes,\" according to an official of Amnesty International, a global human rights watchdog.\n\n\"In its recent research, Amnesty International documented the harrowing torture and other ill-treatment of Palestinian detainees at Sde Teiman military camp and other detention facilities,\" Sara Hashash, deputy regional director for the Middle East and North Africa at Amnesty International, told Anadolu.\n\nShe said the organization interviewed 27 former detainees -- all civilians arrested from the occupied Gaza Strip -- including 20 men, six women and one child, who were held for periods ranging from two weeks to up to 140 days in military or Israeli Prison Service-run detention facilities.\n\n\"All of them said that during their incommunicado detention, Israeli military, intelligence and police forces subjected them to torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment,\" she added.\n\n- 'Blindfolded and handcuffed'\n\nShe said they described being forced to remain in stressful positions for long hours and being prevented from talking to one another or raising their heads.\n\nThese accounts are consistent with findings of other human rights organizations and the UN bodies as well as numerous reports based on accounts of whistleblowers and released detainees, she added.\n\nDue to Israel's poor track record on impartial investigation, she said there must be an independent impartial investigation by the International Criminal Court's (ICC) Prosecutor's office to ensure perpetrators are brought to justice and to deter future violations.\n\nShe highlighted the urgent need for Israel to grant immediate access for independent monitors to places of detention.\n\n- ICC urged to investigate\n\nThe international community must also demand that the Israeli authorities grant \"immediate and unrestricted access\" for independent monitors to all places of detention to assess conditions, she added.\n\nOn Sunday, an Israeli military court decided to extend the detention of five soldiers accused of sexually assaulting a Palestinian detainee from Gaza at Sde Teiman Prison in the Negev desert in southern Israel, local media reported.\n\nPalestinian, Israeli and international human rights reports have recently indicated that prisoners from Gaza have been tortured at the prison, which has led to the deaths of dozens of them.\n\nIsrael, flouting a UN Security Council resolution demanding an immediate cease-fire, has faced international condemnation amid its continued brutal offensive on Gaza since an attack last October by the Palestinian resistance group Hamas.\n\nNearly 39,600 Palestinians have since been killed, mostly women and children, and nearly 91,400 injured, according to local health authorities.\n\nAlmost 10 months into the Israeli war, vast tracts of Gaza lie in ruins amid a crippling blockade of food, clean water and medicine.\n\nIsrael stands accused of genocide at the International Court of Justice, which ordered it to immediately halt its military operation in the southern city of Rafah, where more than 1 million Palestinians had sought refuge from the war before it was invaded on May 6.", "source": {"uri": "yenisafak.com", "dataType": "news",

Another unknown number are arbitrarily being held in detention facilities and ad hoc camps following a wave of arrest and abduction campaigns across Palestinian territory that targeted men, women and children particularly following 7 October.\n\nThe experts received substantiated reports of widespread abuse, torture, sexual assault and rape, amid atrocious inhumane conditions, with at least 53 Palestinians apparently dying as a result in 10 months.\n\nCountless testimonies by men and women speak of detainees in cage-like enclosures, tied to beds blindfolded and in diapers, stripped naked, deprived of adequate healthcare, food, water and sleep, electrocutions including on their genitals, blackmail and cigarette burns. In addition, victims spoke of loud music played until their ears bled, attacks by dogs, waterboarding, suspension from ceilings and severe sexual and gender-based violence.\n\n\"Allegations of gang-rape of a Palestinian detainee, now shockingly supported by voices in the Israeli political establishment and society, provide irrefutable evidence that the moral compass is lost,\" the experts said. In February 2024, a number of experts also expressed grave concern regarding the reports of sexual and other forms of gender-based violence committed against Palestinian women and girls in Israeli detention.\n\nThe Special Rapporteur on the occupied Palestinian territory investigated Israel's detention practices in 2023 and called on UN Member States to intervene and the International Criminal Court to promptly investigate what appeared to be a consolidated crime against humanity. The experts regret this call was not heeded.\n\n\"Torture practices are irredeemably unlawful and constitute international crimes, yet form part of the modus operandi of Israel's notorious detention and torture system,\" they warned. \"These practices are intended to punish Palestinians for resisting occupation and seek to destroy them individually and collectively.\"\n\n\"Israel's genocidal destruction in Gaza, which is spreading across the West Bank, including east Jerusalem, serves as the backdrop to its abusive detention programme today,\" the experts said.\n\n\"Most Palestinian detainees are de facto hostages of an unlawful occupation,\" they said, referring to the July 2024 Advisory Opinion from the International Court of Justice on the legal consequences of Israel's occupation of Palestinian territory. They called for oversight and accountability over all Israeli practices and policies in the territory.\n\n\"Decrying the silence by Member States following the emergence of testimonies and reports of alleged maltreatment and torture, the experts called for pressure on Israel with a view to implementing a cogent system of access, monitoring and protection of Palestinian detainees. The Human Rights Council, in particular, must urgently demand the deployment of special procedures mandate holders and the Commission of Inquiry to facilities holding Palestinians, they said.\n\n\"What is required now is nothing short of an independent, international presence of human rights observers. They must become the world's eyes in light of Israel's brazen failure to prevent and address the heinous rights violations against prisoners and detainees,\" the experts said.\n\n/Public Release.

The report says they come from widely divergent backgrounds and have only one thing in common: \"being Palestinian.\"\n\nAt least 60 Palestinians have died in Israeli custody since October, B'Tselem found, and at least one detainee had to have a leg amputated due to injuries caused by guard violence.\n\nAfter October 7, more than a dozen Israeli civilian and military prisons were converted to \"de-facto torture camps\" in which \"every inmate is condemned to severe, relentless pain and suffering,\" the report says.\n\nThe violence of Israeli prison guards has come in many forms, including \"setting dogs on prisoners, beating, punching, and kicking\" and using \"pepper spray, stun grenades, sticks, wooden clubs and metal batons, gun butts and barrels, brass knuckles, and tasers,\" the report says.\n\nA Palestinian man from Hebron in the West Bank, identified as W.H., shared a particularly gruesome account with B'Tselem. Guards forcefully dragged him from his cell to a former mess hall, where other detainees had already been brought. W.H. recalled that:\n\nEveryone was stark naked and bleeding. They threw them one on top of the other. People were crying and shouting, and the guards were yelling at them and cursing them and their mothers. They forced us to curse our mothers, as well as Hamas and [its leader Yahya] Sinwar. They also forced us to kiss the Israeli flag and sing the Israeli national anthem. I was shaking with fear, and then they pounced on me. One of them slapped me, and the other spat in my face and said to me in Arabic: \"Yahya Sinwar will die.\" They ordered me to repeat what he said. Two of them stripped me like the other prisoners, and then threw me on top of the other prisoners. One of them brought a carrot and tried to shove it in my anus. While he was trying to shove the carrot in, some of the others filmed me on their cell phones. I screamed in pain and terror. It went on like that for about three minutes. Then they shouted at us that we had two minutes to get dressed, and left. I felt broken inside. Tears rolled down my face while I was getting dressed.\n\nThe report says that W.H. burst into tears while giving the account.\n\nOn top of \"unrelenting\" physical and psychological abuse, the day-to-day living conditions were extremely difficult, the report says. B'Tselem cited \"overpopulation and crowding in cells\"; \"no sunlight and no air to breathe\" -- many never saw daylight during their time in detainment; \"violent roll calls\"; and \"confiscation of personal possessions.\"\n\nThe detainees have no way to petition for better treatment. Most of the 55 former detainees who were interviewed didn't have access to a lawyer even once during their detainment, and they were also denied access to rights and humanitarian groups such as the International Committee of the Red Cross. Israel hasn't so far allowed such groups or neutral observers into its facilities, despite international pressure.\n\nThose detainees who did have hearings with lawyers and judges were carefully monitored by Arabic-speaking guards who threatened them with punishment if they spoke about the harsh conditions in detainment, the report says.\n\nThe conditions are harsh by design. Israel's Minister of National Security Itamar Ben-Gvir, a far-right politician, and one of his deputies intentionally \"downgraded\" conditions for \"terrorists\" as part of an October overhaul of the prison system. Ben-Gvir even ordered changes to the prison menu, removing meat products, and said that \"they will get the minimum that we are obligated to give them.\"\n\nOf the 55 interviewed Palestinians, 30 were from the West Bank including East Jerusalem, 21 were from Gaza, and four had Israeli citizenship.\n\nThe B'Tselem report came as a group of United Nations special rapporteurs on Monday called out the systematic abuse in Israeli detention centers and the silence of U.N. member countries.

Most were released without trial. Among the male and female detainees there were \"physicians, academics, lawyers, students, children and political leaders\". Some were detained for \"expressing sympathy for Palestinians,\" some were \"men of fighting age,\" and others were suspected of belonging to armed groups, B'Tselem reported, adding; \"The only thing they have in common is being Palestinian\".\n\nAccording to B'Tselem, accusations of abuse include \"frequent acts of severe, arbitrary violence; sexual assault humiliation and degradation; deliberate starvation; forced unhygienic conditions; sleep deprivation, prohibition on, and punitive measures for religious worship; confiscation of communal and personal belongings, and denial of adequate medical treatment\".\n\nReuters news agency reported that the Israeli military, which runs some detention facilities where Palestinian prisoners have been held, said that it operated according to the rule of law and any specific claims of abuse were investigated.\n\n\"The IDF categorically rejects allegations of systematic abuse, including sexual abuse, in its detention facilities,\" it said, adding that monitoring mechanisms were in place to ensure facilities were run in accordance with the law.\n\nA spokesperson for the Israel Prison Service said that all prisoners were treated according to the law and all basic rights were fully applied by professionally trained guards.\n\n\"We are not aware of the claims you described and as far as we know, no such events have occurred under IPS responsibility,\" the spokesperson said, adding that detainees had the right to file complaints that would be fully examined and investigated.\n\nBefore the war, Israel had incarcerated 5,192 \"security prisoners\", with 1,319 under indefinite administrative detention without trial or access to defence. In early July, there were 9,623 security prisoners, of whom 4.781 were administrative detainees. During the last 10 months, \"thousands more Palestinians have been arrested, held for varying periods of time, and released without charges,\" B'Tselem said.\n\nIt argued that this \"organised, declared policy [is being] implemented under the direction of national security minister Itamar Ben Gvir\" with the \"full support\" of the government under prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu. Mr Ben Gvir began the process of \"downgrading conditions\" before the war by cancelling early release, limiting family visits, reducing time for showers, and denying prisoners the right to prepare food or buy from canteens, B'Tselem reported.\n\nAt least 60 Palestinians, 48 from Gaza, have died in postwar custody.\n\nIn \"some cases, the circumstances suggest abuse and deliberate withholding of medical attention,\" said B'Tselem, which estimates that 800,000 Palestinians from the West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza have been incarcerated since Israel's 1967 occupation.

Others were rounded up in Gaza as Israel's invasion got under way, or were arrested in Israel or the occupied West Bank.\n\nMany were later released without charge.\n\nFiras Hassan was already in jail in October, held under \"administrative detention\", a measure by which suspects - though it has overwhelmingly been applied to Palestinians - can be detained, more or less indefinitely, without charge.\n\nIsrael says that its use of the policy is necessary, and compliant with international law.\n\nFiras says he saw with his own eyes how conditions quickly deteriorated after 7 October.\n\n\"Life totally changed,\" he told me when we met in Tuqu', a West Bank village south of Bethlehem.\n\n\"I call what happened a tsunami.\"\n\nHassan has been in and out of jail since the early nineties, twice charged with membership of Palestinian Islamic Jihad, an armed group designated as a terrorist organization by Israel and much of the West.\n\nHe makes no secret of his past affiliation, saying he was \"active\".\n\nFamiliar with the rigours of life in prison, he said nothing prepared him for what happened when officers entered his cell two days after 7 October.\n\n\"We were severely beaten by 20 officers, masked men using batons and sticks, dogs and firearms,\" he said.\n\n\"We were tied from behind, our eyes blindfolded, beaten severely. Blood was gushing from my face. They kept beating us for 50 minutes. I saw them from under the blindfold. They were filming us while beating us.\"\n\nHassan was eventually released, without charge, in April, by which time he said he had lost 3 stone (20kg).\n\nA video filmed on the day of his release shows a gaunt figure.\n\n\"I spent 13 years in prison in the past,\" he told B'tselem researchers later that month, \"and never experienced anything like that.\"\n\nBut it's not just Palestinians from Gaza and the West Bank who talk about the abuse in Israeli prisons.\n\nIsraeli citizens, like Sari Khourieh, an Israeli Arab lawyer from Haifa, say it has also happened to them.\n\nKhourieh was held at the Megiddo prison in northern Israel for 10 days last November. The police said that two of his Facebook posts had glorified the actions of Hamas - a charge quickly dismissed.\n\nBut his brief experience of prison - his first - nearly broke him.\n\n\"They just lost their mind,\" he says of the scenes he witnessed at Megiddo.\n\n\"There was no law. There was no order inside.\"\n\nKhourieh says he was spared the worst of the abuse. But he says he was stunned by the treatment of his fellow inmates.\n\n\"They were hitting them badly for no reason,\" he told us. \"They were screaming, the guys, 'we didn't do nothing. You don't have to hit us.'\"\n\nSpeaking to other detainees, he quickly learned that what he was seeing was not normal.\n\n\"It wasn't the best treatment before 7 October, they told me, but afterward everything was different.\"\n\nDuring a brief spell in an area of isolation cells known by the prisoners as Tora Bora (a reference to al-Qaeda's network of caves in Afghanistan), Khourieh says he heard a beaten inmate pleading for medical help in an adjacent cell.\n\nAccording to Khourieh, doctors tried to revive him, but he died shortly afterward.\n\nAccording to last week's UN report, \"announcements by IPS (Israel Prison Service) and prisoners organisations indicate that 17 Palestinians have died in the custody of the IPS between 7 October and 15 May\".\n\nIsrael's military advocate, meanwhile, said on 26 May that it was investigating the deaths of 35 Gaza detainees in army custody.\n\nSeveral months after Khourieh's release - again, without charge - the lawyer is still struggling to make sense of what he witnessed at Megiddo.\n\n\"I'm an Israeli...I'm a lawyer,\" he told us. \"I've seen the world outside the prison. Now I'm inside. I see another world.\"\n\nHis faith in citizenship and the rule of law, he says, has been shattered.\n\n\"It was all crushed after this experience.\"\n\nWe put claims of the widespread mistreatment of Palestinian detainees to the authorities involved.\n\nThe army said it \"rejects outright allegations of systematic abuse of detainees\".\n\n\"Concrete complaints regarding misconduct or unsatisfactory conditions of detention,\" the army told us, \"are forwarded to relevant bodies in the IDF, and are dealt with accordingly.\"\n\nThe prison service said it \"was not aware of the claims you described, and as far as we know, no such events have occurred\".\n\nSince 7 October, Israel has refused to grant the International Committee of the Red Cross access to Palestinian detainees, as international law requires.\n\nNo explanation has been given for this refusal, but the government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has frequently expressed its frustration over the ICRC's failure to gain access to Israeli and other hostages being held in Gaza.\n\nThe Association for Civil Rights in Israel (ACRI) has accused the government of \"consciously defying international law\".\n\nLast week, the treatment of Palestinian prisoners ignited a furious public row, as far right demonstrators - including members of Israel's parliament - violently tried to prevent the arrest of soldiers accused of sexually abusing a prisoner from Gaza at the Sde Teiman military base.\n\nSome of those protesting were followers of Israel's hardline security minister, Itamar Ben Gvir, the man in overall charge of the prison service.\n\nBen Gvir has frequently boasted that under his watch, conditions for Palestinian detainees have deteriorated sharply.\n\n\"I'm proud that during my time we changed all the conditions,\" he told members of Israel's parliament, the Knesset, during a rowdy session in July.\n\nFor B'Tselem, Ben Gvir bears a heavy responsibility for the abuses now being reported.\n\n\"These systems were put in the hands of the most right wing, most racist minister that Israel ever had,\" Yuli Novak told us.\n\nFor her, Israel's treatment of prisoners, in the wake of the traumatic events of 7 October, is a dangerous indicator of the nation's moral decline.\n\n\"The trauma and anxiety walks with us each and every day,\" she says.\n\n\"But to let this thing turn us into something that it not human, that doesn't see people, I think is tragic.\" -- BBC", "source": {"uri": "saudigazette.com.sa", "dataType": "news", "title": "Saudi Gazette"}, "authors": [],

Some describe severe abuse and violence.\n\nMore than 9,600 Palestinians were recently held in Israeli prisons, around half of them without official charges, the report said.\n\nThe Israeli military said it is currently investigating allegations of serious sexual abuse of a Palestinian militant by soldiers in the Sde Teiman military camp in southern Israel.\n\nThe UN Human Rights Office recently announced that at least 53 people had died in Israeli custody.\n\n\u201cThe testimonies presented in this report provide an account of how Israeli prison facilities have been turned into a network of torture camps,\u201d the report said.\n\nThe report said \u201csuch spaces, in which every inmate is intentionally condemned to severe, relentless pain and suffering, operate as de facto torture camps.\n\n\u201cThe abuse consistently described in the testimonies of dozens of individuals held in different facilities was so systematic, that there is no room to doubt an organised declared policy of the Israeli prison authorities,\u201d Betselem wrote.\n\nThis policy was implemented under the orders of far-right Police Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir and with the full support of the Israeli government and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the authors said.\n\nThe unprecedented terrorist attack by the Palestinian militant Hamas group and others on Israel on October 7 had deeply traumatised Israeli society and are \u201cevoking deep-seated fears and an instinct for revenge among many,\u201d Betselem wrote.\n\nThe right-wing religious government has used this to \u201cpress harder with applying their racist ideology, using the oppressive mechanisms at their disposal.\u201d\n\nBetselem is a donation-funded Israeli human rights group that campaigns against the occupation of the Palestinian territories and for equal rights for Jews and Palestinians.\n\nAn Israeli army spokesman said the allegations were being investigated. A spokeswoman for the Israeli Prison Authority said all prisoners were being held in accordance with the law and their basic rights were being upheld.\n\nThe allegations made by Betselem had not been officially communicated to the authority, \u201cand to our knowledge they have no basis whatsoever.\u201d\n\nHowever, she said since the beginning of the Gaza war 10 months ago, the conditions of detention of so-called security prisoners had been tightened on the instructions of Ben-Gvir.", "source": {"uri": "scmp.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "South China Morning Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_fedayeen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian fedayeen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torture", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Torture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Human rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Itamar_Ben-Gvir", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Itamar Ben-Gvir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_the_United_Nations_High_Commissioner_for_Human_Rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_facto", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "De facto"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Gaza_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2014 Gaza War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_of_Israel", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Prison_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israel Prison Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Right-wing politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_territories", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian territories"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jews"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_and_political_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Civil and political rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 65}], "image": "https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/d8/images/canvas/2024/08/06/06ebd2b4-fce6-4f6c-acf4-f9e23f7a1737_20a37072.jpg?itok=O6bKK0X_", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9789507", "eventUri": "eng-9789507", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 1738, "textEnd": 1747}], "sentiment": -0.584313725490196, "wgt": 156, "relevance": 1}

to B'Tselem and testimony from detainees, the mistreatment of Palestinian prisoners has become an integral part of Israel's detention system and has been orchestrated by the far-right national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir.\n\nThe Guardian also carried out separate interviews with eight detainees and found a similar pattern of abuse which matched those documented by B'Tselem.\n\nThe investigation found the majority of people were arrested without charge and released without trial.\n\nField researchers in Israel and occupied East Jerusalem, the West Bank and Gaza also collected multiple testimonies, medical reports, autopsies and other evidence into the abuse faced by prisoners.\n\nThey found consistent and widespread testimony of severe violence, sexual assault, humiliation and degradation, starvation, deliberately unhygienic conditions, overcrowding, denial of medical treatment, prohibitions on religious worship, and denial of legal counsel and family visits.\n\nThe Israel Prison Service (IPS) told The Guardian it operated according to the law and under the oversight of the state comptroller.\n\nIn a statement it said: \"We are not aware of the claims you

according to the law and all basic rights were fully applied by professionally trained guards.\n\n\"We are not aware of the claims you described and as far as we know, no such events have occurred under IPS responsibility,\" the spokesperson said, adding that detainees had the right to file complaints that would be fully examined and investigated.\n\nB'Tselem detailed allegations that

severity\".\n\n\"The overall picture indicates abuse and torture carried out under orders, in utter defiance of Israel's obligations both under domestic law and international law,\" the report said.\n\nAllegations of prisoner abuse have surfaced repeatedly during the war in Gaza, adding to mounting international pressure on Israel over its conduct of the 10 month-old war.\n\nThe report from B'Tselem, a group that documents human rights violations by Israel in the occupied West Bank and other areas, said the treatment accorded to prisoners was a deliberate policy implemented under the direction of the hardline National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir.\n\nThe prison service spokesperson said that since the Oct. 7 attack, Ben-Gvir had ordered that prison conditions be made more strict to reverse an improvement in conditions allowed previously.\n\nQadura Fares, head of the Palestine Liberation Organization's Commission for Prisoners and Ex-Detainees Affairs, reiterated a call for an international commission of inquiry into the treatment of prisoners to hold Israel accountable.\n\n\"We have documentation of the crimes committed by Israel against Palestinian detainees in its

The Israeli judiciary has a terrible record of failing to credibly investigate torture allegations by Palestinians,\" she added.\n\nThe international community must also demand that the Israeli authorities grant \"immediate and unrestricted access\" for independent monitors to all places of detention to assess conditions, she added.\n\nOn Sunday, an Israeli military court decided to extend the detention of five soldiers accused of sexually assaulting a Palestinian detainee from Gaza at Sde Teiman Prison in the Negev desert in southern Israel, local media reported.\n\nOn July 29, Israel's official broadcasting authority KAN reported that 10 Israeli soldiers had been detained after causing serious injuries to the Palestinian detainee, but five of them were later released.\n\nPalestinian, Israeli and international human rights reports have recently indicated that prisoners from Gaza have been tortured at the prison, which has led to the deaths of dozens of them.\n\nIsrael, flouting a UN Security Council resolution demanding an immediate cease-fire, has faced international condemnation amid its continued brutal offensive on Gaza since an attack last October by the Palestinian resistance group Hamas.\n\nNearly 39,600 Palestinians have since been killed, mostly women and children, and nearly 91,400 injured, according to local health

The highly respected Jerusalem-based group concluded that Israel's prisons should now be labelled \"torture camps\".\n\n\"When we started the project we thought we would find sporadic evidence and extreme cases here and there, but the picture that has emerged is completely different,\" said Yuli Novak, the organisation's executive director.\n\n\"We were shocked by the scale of what we heard. It is uncomfortable as an Israeli-Palestinian organisation to say Israel is running torture camps. But we realised that is what we are looking at.\"\n\nThe Israel Prison Service (IPS) said it operated according to the law and under the oversight of the state comptroller. \"We are not aware of the claims you described and as far as we know, no such events have occurred under IPS responsibility,\" it said in a statement. The IPS also claimed that several petitions regarding jail conditions filed by human rights organisations had been rejected by the supreme court.\n\nThe IDF said it \"rejects outright allegations concerning systematic abuse of detainees in detention facilities\" and acts \"in accordance with Israeli law and international law\". Allegations of abuse were thoroughly examined, a statement said. Conditions for detainees had significantly improved throughout the war, it added.\n\nThere have been multiple reports of arbitrary, cruel and degrading treatment of Palestinian detainees since the Hamas attack of 7 October - the outside world's only glimpses of conditions inside the jails, since Israel has denied access to lawyers, family members and Red Cross inspectors.\n\nIn late July, multiple members of parliament broke into two military bases, backed by a far-right crowd, to protest against the arrest of nine men over the violent rape of a detainee in Sde Teiman detention centre. The MP Tally Gotliv told the crowd that Israeli troops deserved total immunity, regardless of their actions.\n\nA former barracks that became a processing centre for people seized in Gaza, there have been suggestions that suffering at Sde Teiman is a horrific and temporary exception created by the Gaza war.\n\nDetainees' testimony and the B'Tselem report suggest, however, that it is just one particularly violent component of an abusive system, and cases of abuse are not unsanctioned acts of violence.\n\nInstead, it is suggested that under the direction of the far-right national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, the mistreatment has become an integral part of Israel's detention system.\n\nAt least 60 people have died in Israeli custody since the war in Gaza broke out, compared to one or two deaths a year previously.\n\nThe Guardian carried out separate interviews with eight detainees, the majority arrested without charge and released without trial, who detailed patterns of abuse matching those documented by B'Tselem.\n\nField researchers in Israel and occupied East Jerusalem, the West Bank and Gaza collected dozens of testimonies, medical reports, autopsies and other evidence.\n\nThey found consistent and widespread testimony of severe, arbitrary violence, sexual assault, humiliation and degradation, starvation, deliberately unhygienic conditions, overcrowding, denial of medical treatment, prohibitions on religious worship, and denial of legal counsel and family visits.\n\nSeveral witnesses the Guardian spoke to gave details of three killings: Thaer Abu Asab and Abdul Rahman al-Maari, who were allegedly beaten to death by guards, and Mohammad al-Sabbar, who died from a chronic medical condition. Cellmates said that after 7 October he was not given medicine or the special diet he needed.\n\nAlong with the use of direct violence and restrictions on movement, Palestinians have long alleged that imprisonment is a key element of Israel's 56-year-old occupation: various estimates suggest that up to 40% of Palestinian men have been arrested at least once in their lives.\n\nBefore 7 October, 5,200 Palestinians were held in Israeli jails, including 1,200 in administrative detention, which allows indefinite detention without charge or trial. Intense waves of arrests in the aftermath of the Hamas attack mean that prisoner numbers soared to 9,623 as of early July.\n\nAnother 1,402 prisoners from Gaza are classed as \"unlawful combatants\" under emergency legislation, which also allows detention without charge or trial. The IDF says the measure complies with international law.\n\nFiras Hassan, a 50-year-old youth ministry worker from Bethlehem, was arrested under an administrative detention order in 2022. Conditions then were acceptable, he told the Guardian: there were hot showers, decent food, time outside in the yard, and about six prisoners to a cell, each with his own bunk.\n\nIn early 2023, Ben-Gvir was appointed the minister in charge of prisons. He immediately set about getting rid of what he called \"perks\" for Palestinian inmates, such as fresh bread, and limiting shower times to four minutes.\n\nBut those changes were nothing compared to what happened after 7 October, Hassan said. \"There was respect before. But after 7 October I was sure I was going to die there. I lost all hope.\"\n\nHassan described conditions common to many of the interviews. He said he and his cellmates - up to 20 people in the same cell designed for seven - were beaten, sometimes several times a day. He said one injured cellmate claimed to him through tears after a particularly brutal incident in November that guards had raped him with a baton.\n\nWith little water and no washing facilities or clean clothes, conditions quickly became extremely unsanitary. Food for the entire room consisted of a piece of meat, a cup of cheese, half a tomato and half a cucumber in the morning, and about five spoonfuls of uncooked rice per person for dinner. There was one 2-litre bottle of water for the whole room to share.\n\n\"The guards told me, we are giving you enough to keep you alive, but if it was up to us we will let you starve,\" he said. On his release without charge in April, Hassan had lost 22kg in weight.\n\nHassan also heard the screams of 38-year-old Thaer Abu Asab, who was allegedly beaten to death in the cell next door after refusing to bow his head to guards.\n\nAnother witness, Mousa Aasi, 58, from Ramallah governorate, told the Guardian that after the beating, Asab was dragged into the courtyard in view of all the inmates. \"They said he died in hospital later, but I think he was already dead,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Others were rounded up in Gaza as Israel's invasion got under way, or were arrested in Israel or the occupied West Bank.\n\nMany were later released without charge.\n\nFiras Hassan was already in jail in October, held under \"administrative detention\", a measure by which suspects - though it has overwhelmingly been applied to Palestinians - can be detained, more or less indefinitely, without charge.\n\nIsrael says that its use of the policy is necessary, and compliant with international law.\n\nFiras says he saw with his own eyes how conditions quickly deteriorated after 7 October.\n\n\"Life totally changed,\" he told me when we met in Tuqu', a West Bank village south of Bethlehem.\n\n\"I call what happened a tsunami.\"\n\nMr Hassan has been in and out of jail since the early nineties, twice charged with membership of Palestinian Islamic Jihad, an armed group designated as a terrorist organisation by Israel and much of the West.\n\nHe makes no secret of his past affiliation, saying he was \"active\".\n\nFamiliar with the rigours of life in prison, he said nothing prepared him for what happened when officers entered his cell two days after 7 October.\n\n\"We were severely beaten by 20 officers, masked men using batons and sticks, dogs and firearms,\" he said.\n\n\"We were tied from behind, our eyes blindfolded, beaten severely. Blood was gushing from my face. They kept beating us for 50 minutes. I saw them from under the blindfold. They were filming us while beating us.\"\n\nMr Hassan was eventually released, without charge, in April, by which time he said he had lost 3 stone (20kg).\n\nA video filmed on the day of his release shows a gaunt figure.\n\n\"I spent 13 years in prison in the past,\" he told B'tselem researchers later that month, \"and never experienced anything like that.\"\n\nBut it's not just Palestinians from Gaza and the West Bank who talk about the abuse in Israeli prisons.\n\nIsraeli citizens, like Sari Khourieh, an Israeli Arab lawyer from Haifa, say it has also happened to them.\n\nMr Khourieh was held at the Megiddo prison in northern Israel for 10 days last November. The police said that two of his Facebook posts had glorified the actions of Hamas - a charge quickly dismissed.\n\nBut his brief experience of prison - his first - nearly broke him.\n\n\"They just lost their mind,\" he says of the scenes he witnessed at Megiddo.\n\n\"There was no law. There was no order inside.\"\n\nMr Khourieh says he was spared the worst of the abuse. But he says he was stunned by the treatment of his fellow inmates.\n\n\"They were hitting them badly for no reason,\" he told us. \"They were screaming, the guys, 'we didn't do nothing. You don't have to hit us.'\"\n\nSpeaking to other detainees, he quickly learned that what he was seeing was not normal.\n\n\"It wasn't the best treatment before 7 October, they told me, but afterwards everything was different.\"\n\nDuring a brief spell in an area of isolation cells known by the prisoners as Tora Bora (a reference to al-Qaeda's network of caves in Afghanistan), Mr Khourieh says he heard a beaten inmate pleading for medical help in an adjacent cell.\n\nAccording to Mr Khourieh, doctors tried to revive him, but he died shortly afterwards.\n\nAccording to last week's UN report, \"announcements by IPS (Israel Prison Service) and prisoners organisations indicate that 17 Palestinians have died in the custody of the IPS between 7 October and 15 May\".\n\nIsrael's military advocate, meanwhile, said on 26 May that it was investigating the deaths of 35 Gaza detainees in army custody.\n\nSeveral months after Mr Khourieh's release - again, without charge - the lawyer is still struggling to make sense of what he witnessed at Megiddo.\n\n\"I'm an Israeli...I'm a lawyer,\" he told us. \"I've seen the world outside the prison. Now I'm inside. I see another world.\"\n\nHis faith in citizenship and the rule of law, he says, has been shattered.\n\n\"It was all crushed after this experience.\"\n\nWe put claims of the widespread mistreatment of Palestinian detainees to the authorities involved.\n\nThe army said it \"rejects outright allegations of systematic abuse of detainees\".\n\n\"Concrete complaints regarding misconduct or unsatisfactory conditions of detention,\" the army told us, \"are forwarded to relevant bodies in the IDF, and are dealt with accordingly.\"\n\nThe prison service said it \"was not aware of the claims you described, and as far as we know, no such events have occurred\".\n\nSince 7 October, Israel has refused to grant the International Committee of the Red Cross access to Palestinian detainees, as international law requires.\n\nNo explanation has been given for this refusal, but the government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has frequently expressed its frustration over the ICRC's failure to gain access to Israeli and other hostages being held in Gaza.\n\nThe Association for Civil Rights in Israel (ACRI) has accused the government of \"consciously defying international law\".\n\nLast week, the treatment of Palestinian prisoners ignited a furious public row, as far right demonstrators - including members of Israel's parliament - violently tried to prevent the arrest of soldiers accused of sexually abusing a prisoner from Gaza at the Sde Teiman military base.\n\nSome of those protesting were followers of Israel's hardline security minister, Itamar Ben Gvir, the man in overall charge of the prison service.\n\nMr Ben Gvir has frequently boasted that under his watch, conditions for Palestinian detainees have deteriorated sharply.\n\n\"I'm proud that during my time we changed all the conditions,\" he told members of Israel's parliament, the Knesset, during a rowdy session in July.\n\nFor B'Tselem, Mr Ben Gvir bears a heavy responsibility for the abuses now being reported.\n\n\"These systems were put in the hands of the most right wing, most racist minister that Israel ever had,\" Yuli Novak told us.\n\nFor her, Israel's treatment of prisoners, in the wake of the traumatic events of 7 October, is a dangerous indicator of the nation's moral decline.\n\n\"The trauma and anxiety walks with us each and every day,\" she says.\n\n\"But to let this thing turn us into something that it not human, that doesn't see people, I think is tragic.\"", "source": {"uri": "the-star.co.ke", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Star"}, "authors": [{"uri":

B'Tselem, a group that documents human rights violations by Israel in the occupied West Bank and other areas, said the treatment accorded to prisoners was a deliberate policy implemented under the

When we got off the bus, a soldier said to us: \"Welcome to hell,\" is the testimony of Fouad Hassan 45, from Qusrah in Nablus District.\n\nB'Tselem said the detainees' testimonies \"reveal the outcomes of the rushed transformation of more than a dozen Israeli prison facilities, military and civilian, into a network of camps dedicated to the abuse of inmates as a matter of policy.\"\n\n\"Facilities in which every inmate is deliberately subjected to harsh, relentless pain and suffering operate as de-facto torture camps,\" the report said.\n\nThirty of the witnesses are residents of the West Bank, including East Jerusalem; 21 are residents of the Gaza Strip; and four are Israeli citizens.\n\n'Palestinian Detainees Held in Prolonged, Secret Detention, Tortured and Abused' - UN Report\n\n\"The testimonies clearly indicate a systemic, institutional policy focused on the continual abuse and torture of all Palestinian prisoners held by Israel,\" the organization said.\n\nIt documented frequent acts of severe, arbitrary violence; sexual assault; humiliation and degradation, deliberate starvation; forced unhygienic conditions; sleep deprivation, prohibition on, and punitive measures for, religious worship; confiscation of all communal and personal belongings; and denial of adequate medical treatment.\n\nThese descriptions, B'Tselem said, appear time and again in the testimonies, \"in horrifying detail and with chilling similarities.\"\n\n\"The abuse consistently described in the testimonies of dozens of individuals held in different facilities was so systematic, that there is no room to doubt an organized, declared policy of the Israeli prison authorities,\" said the organization. \"This policy is implemented under the direction of the Minister of National Security Itamar Ben Gvir, whose office oversees the Israel Prison Service (IPS), with the full support of the Israeli government and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\"\n\nB'Tselem said, \"The overall picture indicates abuse and torture carried out under orders, in utter defiance of Israel's obligations both under domestic law and under international law.\"\n\n'Dead or Alive?' - NYT Report Reveals Torture, Abuse inside Israel's Detention Center\n\nThe report includes testimonies given to B'Tselem regarding three of these deaths.\n\nThaer Abu 'Asab, a 38-year-old from Qalqiliyah held in the Negev (Ketziot) Prison, was found dead in his cell on 18 November 2023. On his body were severe signs of violence. 'Arafat Hamdan, a 24-year-old diabetic from Beit Beit Sira who relied on insulin treatments, was found dead in his cell on October 24, 2023, two days after his arrest. The testimonies reveal he was denied proper medical treatment.\n\nMuhammad a-Sabbar, a 20-year-old from the town of a-Dhahiriyah who had an intestinal disease requiring a special diet, died at Ofer Prison on 8 February, according to testimonies due to lack of proper nutrition, poor medical care and brazen disregard for his condition.\n\n'Horrific Conditions' - Two Detainees Confirmed Dead Due to Torture in Israeli Prisons\n\nThe testimonies given to B'Tselem reveal prevalent, consistent and widespread conditions inside Israel's \"torture camps\" such as overpopulation and crowding in cells; no sunlight and no air to breathe; violent roll calls, increased frequency; withholding access to the courts, aid agencies and legal counsel; and confiscation of personal possessions.\n\n\"We were also forbidden to go outside to the yard, unlike before. For 191 days, I didn't see the sun,\" said Thaer Halahleh, 45, who was held in the Ofer and Nafha prisons.\n\nThe report also documented \"unrelenting physical and psychological abuse,\" with testimonies attesting to physical, sexual, psychological and verbal violence, directed at all Palestinian prisoners and \"perpetrated in an arbitrary, menacing fashion, usually under a shroud of anonymity.\"\n\n\"The scope of violence emerging from the testimonies clarifies that these are not isolated, random incidents, but rather an institutional policy integral to the treatment of prisoners,\" said B'Tselem.\n\n\"I leaned against a wall. I had broken ribs and was injured in my right shoulder, my right thumb, and a finger on my left hand. I couldn't move or breathe for half an hour. Everyone around me was screaming in pain, and some inmates were crying. Most were bleeding. It was a nightmare beyond words,\" testified Ashraf al-Muhtaseb, 53, a father of five and resident of Hebron District, who was held in the Etzion detention facility and the Ofer and Negev.\n\n'Like Guantanamo Bay' - Released Detainee Speaks of Torture in Israeli Prison\n\nAnother detainee said: \"We were stripped naked and even had to take off our underwear...They forced us to spread our legs and then sit half crouching. Then they started hitting us on our private parts with the detector. They rained blows down on us. Then they ordered us to salute an Israeli flag that was hanging on the wall.\"\n\nSome detainees reported sleep deprivation as \"an integral part of daily abuses meted out on inmates.\"\n\nIn some cases, the lighting in the cells is on throughout the night; in others, guards played loud music or unpleasant sounds to keep prisoners from sleeping.\n\n\"These are acts that sometimes amount to actual torture,\" said the report.\n\n\"The next day, two guards came and took me to a cell the size of 1.5 square meters with no toilet. I was in that cell alone for more than three months. [...] The light was on 24/7 and I lost track of time. I didn't know what time it was or what day was. I had no one to talk to. I almost went crazy in there,\" said a detainee identified as M.A. from the Hebron (Al Khalil) District.\n\n'Like Guantanamo Bay' - Released Detainee Speaks of Torture in Israeli Prison\n\nVarious testimonies revealed repeated use of sexual violence, in varying degrees of severity, by soldiers or prison guards against Palestinian detainees.\n\nThe witnesses \"described blows to the genitals and other body parts of naked prisoners; the use of metal tools and batons to cause genital pain; the photographing of naked prisoners; genitals being grabbed; and strip-searches for the sake of humiliation and degradation. The testimonies also reveal cases of gang sexual violence and assault committed by a group of prison guards or soldiers.\"\n\nThe report also documented testimonies of absence and denial of medical treatment, food deprivation and starvation, and hygiene and cutting off the water supply.\n\nAmong the prison service's special units, the Initial Reaction Force (IRF), known in Hebrew as Keter, which operates at the Negev (Ketziot) and Ofer prisons, featured prominently in the testimonies given to B'Tselem. Two witnesses referred to it as the \"death squad.\"\n\nThe collection of testimonies given to B'Tselem shows the IRF has been heavily involved in the torture and physical, sexual and mental abuse of prisoners since October 7, said B'Tselem.\n\nAccording to the witnesses, \"IRF personnel wear masks and black uniforms with no identification tags.\"\n\nThey are armed with batons and firearms, and often accompanied by dogs. In one case, the unit reportedly used a stun grenade.\n\n'Worse than Abu Ghraib' - This is How Israel Tortures Its Palestinian Hostages\n\n\"Impossible to identify, and safe in the knowledge they would face no consequences for their actions, members of the unit employed brazen, unbridled violence that amounts to abuse and torture,\" said B'Tselem.\n\nIn early July 2024, there were 9,623 Palestinians held in Israeli prisons and detention facilities almost double the number just before the war began, according to B'Tselem.\n\nOf these, 4,781 were detained without trial, without being presented with the allegations against them, and without access to the right to defend themselves, in what Israel terms \"administrative detention.\"\n\nRemoving Shackles from Palestinian Hostages at Israel's Sde Teiman Black Hole Not Enough - It Must Be Shut Down\n\nB'Tselem said that given the severity of the acts, \"the extent to which the provisions of international law are being violated, and the fact that these violations are directed at the entire population of Palestinian prisoners daily and over time - the only possible conclusion is that in carrying out these acts, Israel is committing torture that amounts to a war crime and even a crime against humanity.\"", "source": {"uri": "palestinechronicle.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Palestine Chronicle"}, "authors": [],

This is the definition of a torture camp: a place that once you enter - no matter who you are or why you were arrested - you will be subjected to severe, deliberate, relentless pain and suffering.\"\n\nNovak said the government \"cynically exploited our collective trauma\" caused by the Hamas-led 7 October attack to employ the \"racist, violent agenda\" of National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir, who oversees prison authorities.\n\n\"This government has driven us to an all-time moral low, proving again its utter disregard for human lives - of the Israeli hostages in Gaza, of Israelis and Palestinians living through ongoing war, and of the Palestinians held in torture camps,\" Novak added.\n\nThe abuse described in the B'Tselem report matches dozens of testimonies given to Middle East Eye and other media outlets since the war started.\n\nLast month, MEE spoke with Palestinian bodybuilder Muazzaz Abayat after he was released from prison emaciated, unable to walk unaided, his right arm jerking shapelessly in front of him and his face a picture of confusion.\n\nBefore the Israeli army arrested him late last year, Abayat was a muscular and confident man. An amateur bodybuilder, he weighed 109kg. After nine months in Israeli prisons, the Palestinian lost more than half of his body weight and was suffering from psychological problems caused by the trauma he experienced.\n\nAbayat was beaten so regularly, so brutally and by so many different people in prison that he now sees everyone as a potential threat. His first words to MEE were: \"I have not been beaten for the three days since I left jail. I was told that I was not going to be beaten in this hospital.\"\n\nSpeaking slowly but fluently, he said he could not recall his life before Israeli soldiers arrested him: \"I can't get the prison out of my head and can't remember. I am still living in the prison. I have the prison inside me.\"\n\nB'Tselem detailed similar testimonies, with several people reporting sexual assault.\n\nThe rights group said reports of sexual violence suggested it was \"recurring with varying severity and carried out by soldiers or prison guards against Palestinian prisoners\".\n\nLast week, nine Israeli soldiers in the notorious Sde Teiman facility were detained for questioning over alleged sexual abuse against a Palestinian detainee, which led to him being hospitalised with serious injuries to his rectum area. The soldiers deny the charges.\n\nSince 7 October, Israeli authorities unleashed a massive crackdown on Palestinians across the occupied territories and within Israel.\n\nNearly 10,000 people were arrested from the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem alone in the past 10 months, and around 3,000-5,000 were taken from the Gaza Strip.\n\nAround 10,000 people remain in custody as of July, nearly double the number of Palestinian detainees before the war, according to HaMoked, an Israeli-based human rights group.\n\nB'Tselem said the Israeli violations against Palestinian detainees lead to the \"inevitable conclusion that Israel is committing torture that amounts to a war crime and even a crime against humanity\".\n\nThe group called for international bodies, including the International Criminal Court (ICC), to immediately intervene to \"stop the brutal treatment of Palestinians in these detention facilities\".", "source": {"uri": "middleeasteye.net", "dataType": "news", "title":

The report, titled \"Welcome to Hell\" by B'tselem, reveals that the treatment of these individuals can be classified as torture, reflecting a significant deterioration in prison conditions since the onset of intensified conflict in October 2022.\n\nTestimonies from 55 recently released detainees were compiled, highlighting widespread abuse and inhumane conditions. The reports indicate a surge in detainees, with numbers reportedly doubling to around 10,000 since the recent escalation of hostilities, particularly after attacks by Hamas.\n\nAccording to Yuli Novak, the executive director of B'tselem, there is a disturbing consistency in the accounts given by the detainees. \"All of them again and again, told us the same thing,\" she stated. Elements of psychological and physical abuse have emerged from these accounts, including:\n\nNovak's conclusion emphasized the systemic nature of the abuse, describing the Israeli prison system as \"a network of torture camps.\"\n\nWith the major ramp-up of military operations and detentions, the Israeli prison system has become overburdened. Reports suggest that prison cells, designed for a limited number of inmates, are now housing many more than intended, leading to unsanitary and crowded conditions.\n\nB'tselem's findings detail that many prisoners are compelled to sleep on floors without proper bedding, and others have been subjected to filthy living environments. Some detainees are arrested without charges and later released, raising concerns over the legality and humanitarian aspects of such practices.\n\nIndividuals like Firas Hassan have shared their harrowing experiences in the system. Already imprisoned at the start of October, Hassan describes a drastic change in the prison atmosphere. He witnessed rampant violence when armed officers invaded his cell, resulting in severe beatings. \"We were tied from behind, our eyes blindfolded, beaten severely. Blood was gushing from my face,\" he recounted, emphasizing the brutality of the encounter.\n\nAfter months of imprisonment, Hassan reported losing substantial weight during his time behind bars. His experiences mark a troubling precedent for how detainees are treated in Israel's custody.\n\nThe issue of abusive conditions is not limited to Palestinian detainees. Israeli citizens, including those from Arab backgrounds, have also reported severe mistreatment. Sari Khourieh, an Israeli Arab lawyer, was detained for ten days under allegations linked to social media posts. His testimony highlighted a lack of order and rampant violence against inmates during his confinement.\n\nKhourieh stated, \"They just lost their mind,\" referring to the chaotic scenes he observed. Many inmates reported that conditions had worsened significantly after the renewed hostilities, indicating a broader issue of civil rights violations within the prison system.\n\nThe Israeli authorities have responded to allegations of mistreatment by denying that any systemic abuse occurs. The Israeli Prison Service has stated that it was unaware of the claims made against it and that no such events had been recorded, attempting to dismiss the chilling reports from various organizations.\n\nAs the crisis continues, the refusal to grant access to international humanitarian organizations, such as the International Committee of the Red Cross, raises further questions about accountability and oversight within the Israeli prison system.\n\nAmidst ongoing conflicts, the treatment of Palestinian detainees has sparked significant international concern. Advocates and human rights organizations continue to call attention to the various abuses reported, pressing for reforms and adherence to international law regarding detainee treatment.", "source": {"uri": "theglobalherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Global Herald"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B'Tselem", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "B'Tselem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torture", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Torture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Physical abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prison", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prison"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Psychology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Human rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarianism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarianism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arabs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_citizens_of_Israel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arab citizens of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Prison_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israel Prison Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Committee_of_the_Red_Cross", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International Committee of the Red Cross"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israelis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israelis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aid_agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aid agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accountability", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Accountability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precedent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Precedent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_and_political_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Civil and political rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prisons", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prisons", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 48}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9789507", "eventUri": "eng-9789507", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.5607843137254902, "wgt": 143, "relevance": 1}

global criticism of the actions of the national penitentiary service.\n\nThe Israeli Information Center for Human Rights in the Occupied Territories (B'Tselem) published a 90-page report titled \"Welcome to Hell: The Transformation of Israeli Prisons into a Network of Torture Camps\" containing the testimonies of 55 Palestinian detainees after their release and details the treatment given to Palestinian prisoners since the outbreak of the new cycle of violence on October 7th, 2023.\n\nTestimonies show that more than a dozen Israeli detention centers, both civilian and military, were transformed into a network of camps whose main objective is to abuse the inmates, the organization warned. \"Anyone who passes through the doors of this space is condemned to the most intense, deliberate, and continuous pain and suffering, a space that practically functions as a torture field,\" it condemned.\n\nAmong the abuses, the NGO cited sexual assault, humiliation, deliberate starvation, poor sanitary conditions, sleep deprivation, the refusal to allow detainees to worship, and the lack of medical care.\n\nOver the years, Israel locked up hundreds of thousands of Palestinians in prisons, which were always used as a tool for oppression and control of the Arab population, indicated the institution, which estimated that these practices are possible because

Wednesday, August 7, 2024 (WAFA) - The Israeli Supreme Court resumed hearing a petition filed by five Israeli human rights organizations since May to close the notorious Sde Teiman prison due to acts of torture and sexual assault against Palestinian detainees from the Gaza Strip.\n\nToday, Israeli media circulated a video documenting the incident of Israeli occupation soldiers sexually assaulting a detainee from Gaza in the said prison.\n\nThe Israeli Channel 12 published the internal cameras' documentation in the prison, which is under the responsibility of the occupation army, of the assault on the detainee whose identity has not yet been revealed.\n\nThe video documentation, the date of which and how it reached the channel were not specified, shows a number of occupation soldiers choosing a detainee from among more than 30 detainees who were lying on the ground in the prison yard with their eyes covered.\n\nAccording to researcher and activist in the field of human rights and prisoners' issues, and lawyer in the legal department of the Committee Against Torture, Janan Abdo, and during an interview with WAFA, based on what the detainees described, the area of the the said prison is not large, as the detention center includes buildings and animal pens surrounded by nets, each building is an average size of 20 meters and contains between 120-130 detainees.\n\nShe added that among the testimonies of one of the detainees released from the detention center.\n\n\"He said that he spent 52 consecutive days there, adding that his leg was amputated due to violence and beatings and medical neglect and failure to treat his pain, until the situation reached the point where he was given a choice while his eyes were closed: either your leg or your life, and after his leg was amputated, he was released to Gaza,\" she said.\n\nAbdo explained that the detainees were not brought before a judge until about 70 days later through a soldier's phone screen, while the judge on the other side tells them that they are detained until the end of the war.\n\nThe Center for the Defense of Liberties and Civil Rights \"Hurriyat\" confirmed that Sde Teiman prison is witnessing systematic brutal torture programs in which all methods of torture are used, including electricity, dogs, beatings, and shackling in handcuffs on a permanent and continuous basis.\n\nThe center

Advertisement\n\n\"All prisoners are held in accordance with the law, and their rights are upheld in full by prison service combat soldiers and professional and trained commanders.\"\n\nThe IPS said that the claims in the report were not formally presented to it and are, as far as it knows, completely untrue. The IPS added that every prisoner and detainee can submit an official complaint, which will be examined.\n\nThe IPS added that \"since the outbreak of the war, under the direction of National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, the conditions for security prisoners in prison were worsened. In accordance with the minister's policy, improved conditions for the prisoners that they received in the past were stopped.\"\n\nB'Tselem detailed allegations that Palestinian prisoners were subjected to arbitrary beatings, degrading and humiliating treatment, and sleep deprivation, as well as \"the repeated use of sexual violence, in varying degrees of severity.\"\n\n\"The overall picture indicates abuse and torture carried out under orders, in utter defiance of Israel's obligations both under domestic law and international law,\" the report said. Advertisement\n\nReliability of B'Tselem\n\nCritics have raised significant concerns about the reliability of B'Tselem's data collection methods. Prominent among them is former senior IDF officer Yonatan Dahoah-Halevy, who argues that B'Tselem's methods are flawed, particularly in classifying casualties and omitting crucial information. For instance, Dahoah-Halevy claims that B'Tselem significantly underreports the number of military combatants killed, misclassifying many as non-combatants. Additionally, the \"Armed with Cameras\" project has come under fire, with accusations that some of the footage results from deliberate provocations by Palestinians, thereby questioning the accuracy of B'Tselem's descriptions of events and their impact on Israel's image.\n\nThe credibility of B'Tselem's field investigators, most of whom are Palestinians living in conflict areas, has also been a point of contention. Specific instances, such as the revelation of an investigator being a Holocaust denier, have cast doubt on the impartiality and accuracy of their reports. While B'Tselem's spokespersons defend their data, citing on-ground investigations as a basis for reliability, critics argue that the organization's reliance on internet sources and amateur data collection leads to unreliable conclusions. This criticism extends to the perceived impact on Israeli security, with officials like former Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman asserting that B'Tselem's activities hinder the effectiveness of Israeli security forces in combating terrorism.\n\nThe public and political backlash against B'Tselem has intensified following primary military operations such as Operation Cast Lead and Operation Protective Edge. This has resulted in actions like closing a B'Tselem video exhibition and revoking their right to national service volunteers, reflecting widespread disapproval. Internal disputes within B'Tselem have further complicated the situation, with disagreements over the organization's stance towards Hamas and the portrayal of events leading to the dismissal of senior member Roy Yelin. These internal tensions highlight ongoing debates about the organization's direction and policies, adding another layer to the controversy surrounding B'Tselem's work and its broader implications.", "source": {"uri": "m.jpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Jerusalem Post | JPost.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "reuters@m.jpost.com", "name": "Reuters", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter_Press_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inter Press Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B'Tselem", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "B'Tselem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_prisoners_of_Israel", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian prisoners in Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Prison_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Israel Prison Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torture", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Torture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sexual abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prison", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prison"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Left-wing politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Bank", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "West Bank"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "West Bank"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Itamar_Ben-Gvir", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Itamar Ben-Gvir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yitzhak_Rabin", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yitzhak Rabin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_violence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sexual violence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Gaza_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2014 Gaza War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_War_(2008\u20132009)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gaza War (2008\u20132009)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-combatant", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Non-combatant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avigdor_Lieberman", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Avigdor Lieberman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_security_forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israeli security forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocaust_denial", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Holocaust denial"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Foreign_Affairs_(Israel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Israel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prisons", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prisons", "wgt": 41}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Life/Iterated_Prisoner_Dilemma", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Life/Iterated Prisoner Dilemma", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 76}], "image": "https://images.jpost.com/image/upload/q_auto/f_auto,fl_lossy/c_fill,g_faces:center,h_407,w_690/612565", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9789507", "eventUri": "eng-9789507", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 553, "textEnd": 559}], "sentiment": -0.5137254901960784, "wgt": 133, "relevance": 1}

Another met an excruciating end because a chronic condition went untreated. A third screamed for help for hours before dying.\"\n\nThe three prisoners are among at least 12 Palestinians from the West Bank and Israel to die in Israeli jails since 7 October, according to Physicians for Human Rights Israel (PHRI), whose members sat in on the autopsies.\n\nAn unknown number of Palestinians abducted by the Israeli military from the Gaza Strip have also died in detention camps outside of Israel's formal prison system.\n\nPrevious reports published by CNN and The New York Times have documented the torture and rape of Palestinian detainees from Gaza at the notorious Sde Teiman camp in the Negev Desert.\n\nHowever, similar conditions exist in Israel's formal penal system.\n\n\"Violence is pervasive,\" Jessica Montell, executive director of the Israeli rights group HaMoked, told The Post. \"It's very overcrowded. Every prisoner that we've met with has lost 30 pounds.\"\n\nItamar Ben Gvir, Israel's far-right national security minister who oversees the prison system, has been unapologetic about his \"war\" on Palestinian detainees and advocates executing prisoners to alleviate overcrowding.\n\nThe Post documented the death of Abdulrahman Bahash, 23, who died at Megiddo Prison.\n\nBahash, a member of the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades, a Palestinian resistance group, was arrested in connection with armed clashes with Israeli forces in the occupied West Bank city of Nablus.\n\nIsrael's prison service said it could not detail what if any, charges were brought against Bahash.\n\nTwo of Bahash's fellow inmates at Megiddo Prison said he died after guards severely beat him in December.\n\nGuards went at Bahash and several other prisoners \"in a crazy way,\" one prisoner told The Post. \"They used their batons, they kicked us ... all over our bodies.\"\n\nAfter the beating, he said, Bahash and others were taken to an area of isolation cells.\n\n\"The noise of the screams was all over the section,\" the prisoner said.\n\nBahash died about three weeks later, on 1 January.\n\nThe autopsy \"revealed signs of traumatic injury to the right chest and left abdomen, causing multiple rib fractures and spleen injury, potentially the result of assault,\" read a report from Daniel Solomon, a doctor with PHRI.\n\nSeptic shock and respiratory failure following the beating were listed as potential causes of death. The Israeli Prison Service has not provided the official autopsy results to Bahash's family, nor have they returned his body.\n\nThe prison service did not respond to questions about why his body had not been returned to his relatives.\n\nThe Post also documented the case of Abdul Rahman al-Maari, 33, who died in Megiddo Prison on 13 November.\n\nThe father of four, Maari, had been in prison since February 2023, after he was detained at a temporary Israeli army checkpoint and accused of being affiliated with Hamas and possessing a firearm.\n\nA PHRI report based on the autopsy stated that \"Bruises were seen over the left chest, with broken ribs and chest bone underneath ... External bruises were also seen on the back, buttocks, left arm and thigh, and right side of the head and neck.\"\n\nA fellow prisoner, Khairy Hamad, told The Post that prison guards kicked Maari down a flight of about 15 metal stairs while handcuffed.\n\nMaari remained conscious, but was bleeding from the head. Guards then put him in an isolation cell. Fellow prisoner, 53-year-old lawyer Sariy Khourieh, listened to him wail in pain for hours.\n\n\"He was screaming all day and night,\" Khourieh said. \"I need a doctor,\" he remembers Maari repeatedly shouting before falling silent.\n\nThe Post also documented the case of 21-year-old, Muhammed al-Sabbar who died after prison authorities denied him medical treatment.\n\nIsraeli police detained Sabba for a social media post that allegedly constituted \"incitement.\"\n\nHe has suffered since childhood from Hirschsprung's disease, which causes painful blockages to the bowels and requires a special diet and medication. Sabbar's stomach began to swell in October after he was denied his medication and he died on 28 February.\n\nBy the time he was rushed to an emergency room, \"his condition was already such that the chance of saving him was slim,\" a PHRI report concluded.\n\nA policy of slow starvation accompanied the torture and medical neglect. Former prisoners told The Post that they had lost significant weight in jail, often between 30 and 50 pounds.\n\nThe food given to prisoners is \"barely enough to survive,\" said lawyer Aya al-Haj Odeh. Some of his clients said they received as little as three slices of bread a day or a few spoonfuls of rice and were given little water to drink.\n\nThe Association for Civil Rights in Israel petitioned the Supreme Court in April over what it called a \"policy of starvation\" in Israeli prisons.\n\nAnother detainee, 37-year-old weightlifter Moaziz Abayad, could barely walk after his release. He said he lost 100 pounds while detained without charge in Israel's Ktzi'ot prison and was raped by a guard using a broom. \"It is Guantanamo,\" he said.\n\nSome 9,700 Palestinian security detainees were being held captive in Israeli prisons in May, according to Addameer, a Palestinian prisoner rights organization. Some 3,380 were administrative detainees, meaning Israel holds them without charge or trial.\n\nThe numbers do not include prisoners from Gaza. The Post reports that Israeli authorities will not reveal exactly how many have been detained or where they are held.", "source": {"uri": "scheerpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

The little he was allowed to see, or made to see, he says, will haunt him forever.\n\nSince the war on Gaza began in October, Israel has conducted a systematic policy of torture and abuse of Palestinians illegally detained in its prison system.\n\nTestimonies from prisoners and reports from Palestinian and international rights groups say the horrifying acts of violence range from sexual abuse, electrocution, and waterboarding to sleep deprivation, playing loud music until prisoners' ears bleed, and gang rape.\n\nAccording to UN estimates, at least 53 Palestinian detainees are known to have died in Israeli military facilities and prisons since October.\n\nBakr, a law graduate, was captured by Israeli soldiers on 5 January. He had been with three friends looking for flour and food in Tal Al-Hawa in Gaza City when they were fired at by Israeli soldiers.\n\nTwo of his friends were immediately killed, the third was wounded, and Bakr was detained after he sustained wounds to his left leg, right arm, and abdomen.\n\nHe says the whole duration of his incarceration was \"horrid\", but one particular incident of abuse will never leave him.\n\n\"A dog raped another hostage before my eyes,\" Bakr told The New Arab in clear distress, his eyebrows immediately clinching.\n\nHandcuffed and blindfolded, Bakr was among three prisoners pulled out of a cell and led into an asphalt yard, where they were ordered to stand in line, he recalled.\n\n\"The man on my right was called to step forward, he was forcefully undressed by between 10 to 12 soldiers, who shoved him onto all fours, his wrists and legs tied,\" Bakr told The New Arab.\n\n\"They then poured some liquid on his behind and the animal immediately attacked him and raped him. There was immediate panic. The prisoner - helpless, shocked, and in pain - screamed and shouted in horror, tried to jolt and push the dog away but couldn't, and neither could we. We too were screaming that this must stop. We were unable to do anything. Unable to believe what was happening,\" narrated the traumatised witness and survivor.\n\n\"Eventually, his shouts stopped as he lost consciousness. We were then brutally beaten and returned to our cells, in a complete state of anguish, disbelief, and shock,\" Bakr added. \"This was the only time they allowed us to be without the blindfolds,\" he recalls.\n\nThe sexual abuse of Palestinians in Israeli jails has been widely documented by countless Palestinian testimonies, independent human rights groups, and UN experts since October.\n\nThe Israeli military has been accused of using military dogs not only to attack civilians during military operations in Gaza but also to intimidate and sexually assault detained Palestinians.\n\nThe Euro-Med Human Rights Monitor has documented at least one incident of military dogs being used to allegedly rape detainees.\n\nMuneer Al Barsh, Director of the Ministry of Health in Gaza, and Qaddura Fares, Head of the Commission of Detainees Affairs in Palestine, have both reported the use of military dogs to sexually abuse Palestinians unlawfully detained by Israel.\n\nDespite the widely documented torture and sexual abuse of Palestinian prisoners since October, dozens of Israelis - backed by Israeli politicians - last month protested the arrest of soldiers accused of gang-raping a Palestinian prisoner at the Sde Teiman facility.\n\nIn response to a recent report by B'Tselem documenting the systematic abuse and torture of Palestinians, a spokesperson for the Israel Prison Service (IPS) said all prisoners were treated according to the law and all basic rights were fully applied by professionally trained guards.\n\n\"We are not aware of the claims you described and as far as we know, no such events have occurred under IPS responsibility,\" the spokesperson added.\n\nTalking to TNA, Bakr said mistreatment was the norm in Israeli prisons. He recalled how he was intentionally beaten on wounds that were never treated properly and was shot at to terrorise him into confessing to accusations he knew nothing about. \"I kept saying I'm a civilian,\" he said.\n\nIsraeli authorities have rounded up hundreds of Palestinian civilians from Gaza without producing any evidence for their arrest or following any minimum due process, rights groups say. They are then held incommunicado in secret facilities where they have no access to a lawyer or monitoring groups such as the Red Cross.\n\n\"I was stripped naked, and hung from all fours, upside down in a truck that drove on bumpy roads within Gaza, and my body was made to hit the sides of the truck as it moved, and I ended up with a deep cut on my head,\" Bakr said, pointing to the wound.\n\n\"I was taken by a military tank to some location and was ordered to lie down. I believe what I was made to lie down on was a decomposed body of a dead person, based on the smell and texture of it against my skin. Then another round of beating began,\" he recalled.\n\n\"It was nothing but humiliation and terror,\" he said, with cigarettes put out on prisoners' bodies, food and water being denied to them despite the heat, and loud music played to the point that his left ear began bleeding.\n\nThe mistreatment also continued with his transfer to another prison, which was hours away. There, he was made to wear diapers for days and was electrocuted extensively until his leg swelled and an abscess burst, causing him to lose consciousness from the pain.\n\n\"I woke up to a doctor by my side, who gave me a painkiller and a sip of water. This was it. But for days, I was writhing in pain and finally, a doctor operated on my leg without anaesthesia. There was a soldier next to him who struck me with a plastic rod each time I screamed in pain,\" he said.\n\n\"This wasn't a prison. It was hell - a military base purely for revenge. In prisons, the minimum amount of rights are guaranteed to those held captives.\"\n\n\"This wasn't a prison. It was hell - a military base purely for revenge\"\n\nLoay Al-Astal, a paramedic in Khan Younis' Nasser Medical Health Complex, was detained on 16 February during the Israeli siege of the facility. He was among 110 staff members who were rounded up.\n\nFrom the beginning, those imprisoned were humiliated by being made to strip naked and left that way for hours, recalled the 33-year-old. \"When I was called to come forward, and I identified myself as a paramedic, the beating and torture began,\" Al-Astal said.\n\nLeft naked in February and without food or water for hours, Al-Astal wept as he recalled how a soldier urinated in his mouth when he asked for water. Blindfolded, he was told to open his mouth, and he did, believing he would be given water to drink.\n\nHe was struck hard in the back of the head right after this incident and was kicked in his ribs, resulting in fractures on both sides. He said he was neither medicated nor offered any painkillers despite the immense pain.\n\nAl-Astal also recounts how he was transferred to another prison, a detention centre in northern Gaza, where he was kept for 13 days before he was taken to another facility. Throughout the roughly two months in which he was imprisoned, Al-Astal said he was blindfolded and tied up.\n\n\"Insults and slurs never stopped. Beatings and abuse never stopped. Hunger and thirst never stopped. And all this began from day one, even before I was questioned or investigated. When I denied charges of transporting Israeli hostages or Hamas fighters, I was beaten up even more,\" he said.\n\nNot allowed to use the bathroom, Al-Astal said he ended up soiling himself multiple times. Food portions they were given weren't enough to feed a two-year-old, he added, and no clothes or bed covers were provided, despite the cold weather at night.\n\nHe said he had seen prisoners die from the torture and abuse. \"They let dogs attack us in the middle of the night or during interrogations to make us confess to things we haven't done,\" he said.\n\nYasser Abdel Ghafour, deputy director of field research at the Palestinian Center for Human Rights (PCHR), says that the group has documented more than 40 types of torture used against Palestinian prisoners.\n\nThese include beatings, being hung from the ceiling, nudity, violence, sexual harassment of men, women, and children, deprivation of food, water, and medicine, denial of toilet access, and electrocution.\n\nAccording to one prisoner's testimony, a Palestinian detainee was raped using an Israeli soldier's rifle muzzle.\n\n\"We received dozens of testimonies from released detainees, including women and children, who recounted shocking incidents and types of torture that made what we used to hear about Abu Ghraib or Guantanamo seem trivial compared to what is happening, and some of them are forms of torture that are outdated,\" he told TNA.\n\nThis despicable treatment of Palestinians is because the Israeli Prison Service (IPS) has entrusted the army with the handling of detainees, he said.\n\n\"Those detained include children and people who are over 80 years old. We've also received testimonies from former female hostages who described abuses they faced, which we are ashamed to talk about in front of the media,\" he stated, adding that the centre has documented about 18 cases of deaths from torture.\n\n\"The legal description of this is deliberate killing without justification,\" he said, adding that both the arbitrary arrests and conditions of abuse and torture in Israeli jails are \"part of the crime of genocide\".", "source": {"uri": "newarab.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New Arab"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Prominent among them is former senior IDF officer Yonatan Dahoah-Halevy, who argues that B'Tselem's methods are flawed, particularly in classifying casualties and omitting crucial information. For instance, Dahoah-Halevy claims that B'Tselem significantly underreports the number of military combatants killed, misclassifying many as non-combatants. Additionally, the \"Armed with Cameras\" project has come under fire, with accusations that some of the footage results from deliberate provocations by Palestinians, thereby questioning the accuracy of B'Tselem's descriptions of events and their impact on Israel's image.\n\nThe credibility of B'Tselem's field investigators, most of whom are Palestinians living in conflict areas, has also been a point of contention. Specific instances, such as the revelation of an investigator being a Holocaust denier, have cast doubt on the impartiality and accuracy of their reports. While B'Tselem's spokespersons defend their data, citing on-ground investigations as a basis for reliability, critics argue that the organization's reliance on internet sources and amateur data collection leads to unreliable conclusions. This criticism extends to the perceived impact on Israeli security, with officials like former Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman asserting that B'Tselem's activities hinder the effectiveness of Israeli security forces in combating terrorism.\n\nThe public and political backlash against B'Tselem has intensified following primary military operations such as Operation Cast Lead and Operation Protective Edge. This has resulted in actions like closing a B'Tselem video exhibition and revoking their right to national service volunteers, reflecting widespread disapproval. Internal disputes within B'Tselem have further complicated the situation, with disagreements over the organization's stance towards Hamas and the portrayal of events leading to the dismissal of senior member Roy Yelin. These internal tensions highlight ongoing debates about the organization's direction and policies, adding another layer to the controversy surrounding B'Tselem's work and its broader implications.", "source": {"uri": "jpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Jerusalem Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B'Tselem", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "B'Tselem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torture", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Torture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Prison_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israel Prison Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sexual abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Left-wing politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Bank", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "West Bank"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "West Bank"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-combatant", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Non-combatant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_violence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sexual violence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Gaza_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2014 Gaza War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_War_(2008\u20132009)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gaza War (2008\u20132009)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter_Press_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inter Press Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avigdor_Lieberman", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Avigdor Lieberman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_security_forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israeli security forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocaust_denial", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Holocaust denial"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Foreign_Affairs_(Israel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Israel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yitzhak_Rabin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yitzhak Rabin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://images.jpost.com/image/upload/f_auto,fl_lossy/c_fill,g_faces:center,h_407,w_690/612565", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9789507", "eventUri": "eng-9789507", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 553, "textEnd": 559, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.6705882352941177, "wgt": 124, "relevance": 1}

Wednesday, August 7, 2024 (WAFA) - The Israeli Supreme Court resumed hearing a petition filed by five Israeli human rights organizations since May to close the notorious Sde Teiman prison due to acts of torture and sexual assault against Palestinian detainees from the Gaza Strip.\n\nToday, Israeli media circulated a video documenting the incident of Israeli occupation soldiers sexually assaulting a detainee from Gaza in the said prison.\n\nThe Israeli Channel 12 published the internal cameras' documentation in the prison, which is under the responsibility of the occupation army, of the assault on the detainee whose identity has not yet been revealed.\n\nThe video documentation, the date of which and how it reached the channel were not specified, shows a number of occupation soldiers choosing a detainee from among more than 30 detainees who were lying on the ground in the prison yard with their eyes covered.\n\nAccording to researcher and activist in the field of human rights and prisoners' issues, and lawyer in the legal department of the Committee Against Torture, Janan Abdo, and during an interview with WAFA, based on what the detainees described, the area of the the said prison is not large, as the detention center includes buildings and animal pens surrounded by nets, each building is an average size of 20 meters and contains between 120-130 detainees.\n\nShe added that among the testimonies of one of the detainees released from the detention center.\n\n\"He said that he spent 52 consecutive days there, adding that his leg was amputated due to violence and beatings and medical neglect and failure to treat his pain, until the situation reached the point where he was given a choice while his eyes were closed: either your leg or your life, and after his leg was amputated, he was released to Gaza,\" she said.\n\nAbdo explained that the detainees were not brought before a judge until about 70 days later through a soldier's phone screen, while the judge on the other side tells them that they are detained until the end of the war.\n\nThe Center for the Defense of Liberties and Civil Rights \"Hurriyat\" confirmed that Sde Teiman prison is witnessing systematic brutal torture programs in which all methods of torture are used, including electricity, dogs, beatings, and shackling in handcuffs on a permanent and continuous basis.\n\nThe center indicated that some of them are transferred after undergoing multiple and intensive stages of torture to the Anatot camp next to the town of Anata or Ofer prison, where they are subjected to continuous torture.", "source": {"uri": "wafa.ps", "dataType": "news", "title": "WAFA Agency"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5,

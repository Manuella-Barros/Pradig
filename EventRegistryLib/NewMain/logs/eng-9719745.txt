Al Sharpton is set to travel to Milwaukee to deliver a eulogy for a Black man who died after being pinned to the ground by hotel security guards\n\nMILWAUKEE (AP) -- The Rev. Al Sharpton is scheduled deliver a eulogy for a Black man who died last month after being pinned to the ground by hotel security guards in Milwaukee, his office said Tuesday.\n\nThe death of D'Vontaye Mitchell has drawn comparisons to the murder of George Floyd, a Black man killed in 2020 after a white police officer in Minneapolis knelt on his neck.\n\nSharpton, a longtime activist and leader who serves on the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, said in a news release that he'll speak at Mitchell's funeral Thursday. The Republican National Convention opens just days later, on July 15, and law enforcement agencies are bracing for political protests around the convention arena in Wisconsin's biggest city.\n\nSharpton said convention-goers need to know about Mitchell's death.\n\n\"We cannot watch D'Vontaye Mitchell's murder be washed out by the RNC coming to town, where they will solidify a nominee whose view of justice is pure brute force,\" Sharpton said, referring to former President Donald Trump.\n\nMitchell, 43, died on June 30 at the Hyatt Regency after four security guards held him down on his stomach, media outlets have reported. Police have said Mitchell entered the hotel, caused a disturbance and fought with the guards as they were escorting him out.\n\nMitchell's family has hired civil rights attorney Ben Crump, who represented Floyd's family. His death spurred worldwide protests against racial violence and police brutality.\n\nIt's unclear why Mitchell was at the hotel or what happened before the guards pinned him down. The Milwaukee County medical examiner's initial report said Mitchell was homeless, but his family told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that's not correct. Sharpton said in a news release announcing his Milwaukee visit that Mitchell's mother said her son was suffering a \"mental health episode.\"\n\nPolice officials were still investigating Mitchell's death on Tuesday, the Journal Sentinel reported. The police department responded to an Associated Press request for an update by emailing a statement saying that an unidentified individual had fought with security guards at the hotel on June 30 and was unresponsive when officers arrived.\n\nThe medical examiner's office has said the preliminary cause of death was homicide but the cause remains under investigation. No one had been charged criminally as of Tuesday.\n\nA spokesperson for Aimbridge Hospitality, which runs the Hyatt Regency in Milwaukee, told the Washington Post that the company extends its condolences to Mitchell's family and supports the ongoing investigation.\n\nThis story corrects the spelling of the first name of a Black man who died after being pinned to the ground by hotel security guards. He is D'Vontaye Mitchell, not Dvontaye.", "source": {"uri": "eagletribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Eagle-Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@eagletribune.com", "name":

His relatives have called for charges to be filed against those responsible for the 43-year-old's death.\n\nCrump also represented the family of Floyd, whose death spurred worldwide protests against racial violence and police brutality.\n\n\"Everybody in America, after George Floyd, should have trained their employees, especially security personnel, to not put knees on peoples' backs and peoples' necks,\" Crump added.\n\nA spokesperson for Aimbridge Hospitality, which runs the Hyatt Regency in Milwaukee, said in a statement that it extends its condolences to Mitchell's family and supports the investigation.\n\nMitchell died at the Hyatt Regency after four security guards held him down on his stomach, media outlets have reported. Police have said Mitchell entered the hotel, caused a disturbance and fought with the guards as they were escorting him out.\n\nThe medical examiner's office has said the preliminary cause of death was homicide, but the cause remains under investigation. No one has been criminally charged so far.\n\nThe Milwaukee County District Attorney's office said Wednesday that it and police investigators were awaiting full autopsy results and that the case was being reviewed as a homicide.\n\nSurveillance video from inside the hotel viewed by Mitchell's family and their lawyers Wednesday at the district attorney's office showed an unarmed man fleeing for his life while being punched and kicked, they said during an afternoon news conference.\n\n\"What I saw today was disgusting. It makes me sick to my stomach,\" Mitchell's widow, DeAsia Harmon said. \"He ran for his life. He was trying to leave. He said 'I'll go,' and they didn't let him go.\"\n\nHarmon said the video showed a bleeding Mitchell being dragged outside the hotel. \"They didn't stop. They could have let him go, but they didn't,\" she said.\n\nCrump said the family's legal team also has a signed affidavit from a hotel employee who said a security guard was striking Mitchell with a baton and that Mitchell posed no threat when he was on the ground. The worker said a security guard ordered him and a bellman to help hold Mitchell down, Crump said.\n\nAnother lawyer, William Sulton said the hotel video showed an on-duty hotel security guard take a photo of Mitchell's lifeless body as the guard was being questioned by police. \"Absolutely disgusting,\" Sulton said.\n\nIt is unclear why Mitchell was at the hotel or what happened before the guards pinned him down. The Milwaukee County medical examiner's initial report said he was homeless, but a cousin told The Associated Press on Wednesday that was incorrect.\n\nCrump said video recorded by a bystander and circulating on social media also shows excessive force was used by security guards to subdue Mitchell.\n\n\"In the video you see them with their knees on his back and neck,\" Crump said, and the security guard appears to hit Mitchell in the head with an object. \"You see them pull his shirt over his head, stifling not only his sound but, we believe, his breath.\"\n\nMitchell was born and raised in Milwaukee, according to his first cousin Samantha Mitchell, 37, and any mental illness he may have had was undiagnosed.\n\n\"D'Vontaye loved to cook,\" she said. \"He was overprotective of his family, especially his younger cousins. He was a jokester. He really clung to a lot of our male cousins growing up, enjoying life together.\"\n\nShe said the family changed his funeral from Saturday to Thursday so its significance would not be overshadowed by the GOP convention.\n\n\"We need to keep this in the light and not swept under the rug,\" Mitchell said. \"Regardless of the convention going on, this is still a matter that needs attention from everyone, no matter what party you are with. I want to see people speak about it while they're here for the convention. That will say a lot.\"\n\nThe AP sent an email Wednesday to representatives of the Republican National Convention for comment on Mitchell's death.\n\nThis story has been updated to correct the spelling of Mitchell's first name to D'Vontaye, not Dvontaye.", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Beckley Register-Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The same guard is heard calling out to witnesses, \"This is what happens when you go into the lady's room.\" It's unclear what led up to Mitchell's encounter with the security guards, how long it took police officers to arrive on the scene, and what Mitchell was doing at the hotel.\n\nBy the time police arrived on the scene, Dvontaye Mitchell was unresponsive and pronounced dead, according to Milwaukee Police.\n\nThe Milwaukee County Medical Examiner's Office initially ruled Mitchell's death as a homicide, but the final manner is yet to be determined.\n\n\"The cause and manner of death is pending toxicology and further investigation, Domagalski said. \"We do not have a timeline for when this case will be finalized.\"\n\nBut Mitchell's family says they are traumatized by his untimely death, saying that his children can't even go to the grocery store without being reminded of their father's death.\n\n\"We couldn't even go into the grocery store with my daughter without her being afraid of the security standing at the door,\" Mitchell's widow, DeAsia Harmon told CNN. She said, 'Is all security bad or just the ones who murdered my dad.'\"\n\nFamily attorney Ben Crump called the incident \"troubling\" and \"disturbing.\"\n\n\"It is deeply troubling that we have lost another Black man in an encounter with security personnel, raising serious concerns about the use of force, lack of accountability, and absence of mental health considerations,\" Crump said in a statement. \"The circumstances surrounding Dvontaye's death outside the Hyatt Regency Hotel as disturbing and as described by a witness, reminiscent of the killing of Geroge Floyd. Dvontaye's family is now left searching for answers and justice in the face of this tragic loss.\"\n\nHe continued, \"We demand a thorough and transparent investigation into the actions of the security guards involved in the incident. It is unacceptable that this case is not being considered a criminal investigation despite the fatal outcome, which the medical examiner considers a homicide. The fight for justice for Dvontaye Mitchell has just begun, and will not rest until those responsible are held accountable,\" said Crump.\n\nRev. Al Sharpton, Founder and President of NAN, also demanded justice for Mitchell's family.\n\n\"We cannot watch Dvontaye Mitchell's murder be washed out by the RNC coming to town, where they will solidify a nominee whose view of justice is pure brute force,\" said Sharpton. \"You cannot answer a Black man's cries for help during a clear mental crisis with a knee on his back or his neck. People from all over the country will descend upon Milwaukee in the days to come, and it's our mission to see the state of Black Americans and why Dvontaye's family deserves justice.\"\n\nSharpton will also deliver the eulogy for Dvontaye Mitchell in Milwaukee this Thursday, as thousands descend upon the city for the start of the Republican National Convention next week.\n\nFinding Taylor

His relatives have called for charges to be filed against those responsible for the 43-year-old's death.\n\nCrump also represented the family of Floyd, whose death spurred worldwide protests against racial violence and police brutality.\n\n\"Everybody in America, after George Floyd, should have trained their employees, especially security personnel, to not put knees on peoples' backs and peoples' necks,\" Crump added.\n\nA spokesperson for Aimbridge Hospitality, which runs the Hyatt Regency in Milwaukee, said in a statement that it extends its condolences to Mitchell's family and supports the investigation.\n\nMitchell died at the Hyatt Regency after four security guards held him down on his stomach, media outlets have reported. Police have said Mitchell entered the hotel, caused a disturbance and fought with the guards as they were escorting him out.\n\nThe medical examiner's office has said the preliminary cause of death was homicide, but the cause remains under investigation. No one has been criminally charged so far.\n\nThe Milwaukee County District Attorney's office said Wednesday that it and police investigators were awaiting full autopsy results and that the case was being reviewed as a homicide.\n\nSurveillance video from inside the hotel viewed by Mitchell's family and their lawyers Wednesday at the district attorney's office showed an unarmed man fleeing for his life while being punched and kicked, they said during an afternoon news conference.\n\n\"What I saw today was disgusting. It makes me sick to my stomach,\" Mitchell's widow, DeAsia Harmon said. \"He ran for his life. He was trying to leave. He said 'I'll go,' and they didn't let him go.\"\n\nHarmon said the video showed a bleeding Mitchell being dragged outside the hotel. \"They didn't stop. They could have let him go, but they didn't,\" she said.\n\nCrump said the family's legal team also has a signed affidavit from a hotel employee who said a security guard was striking Mitchell with a baton and that Mitchell posed no threat when he was on the ground. The worker said a security guard ordered him and a bellman to help hold Mitchell down, Crump said.\n\nAnother lawyer, William Sulton said the hotel video showed an on-duty hotel security guard take a photo of Mitchell's lifeless body as the guard was being questioned by police. \"Absolutely disgusting,\" Sulton said.\n\nIt is unclear why Mitchell was at the hotel or what happened before the guards pinned him down. The Milwaukee County medical examiner's initial report said he was homeless, but a cousin told The Associated Press on Wednesday that was incorrect.\n\nCrump said video recorded by a bystander and circulating on social media also shows excessive force was used by security guards to subdue Mitchell.\n\n\"In the video you see them with their knees on his back and neck,\" Crump said, and the security guard appears to hit Mitchell in the head with an object. \"You see them pull his shirt over his head, stifling not only his sound but, we believe, his breath.\"\n\nMitchell was born and raised in Milwaukee, according to his first cousin Samantha Mitchell, 37, and any mental illness he may have had was undiagnosed.\n\n\"D'Vontaye loved to cook,\" she said. \"He was overprotective of his family, especially his younger cousins. He was a jokester. He really clung to a lot of our male cousins growing up, enjoying life together.\"\n\nShe said the family changed his funeral from Saturday to Thursday so its significance would not be overshadowed by the GOP convention.\n\n\"We need to keep this in the light and not swept under the rug,\" Mitchell said. \"Regardless of the convention going on, this is still a matter that needs attention from everyone, no matter what party you are with. I want to see people speak about it while they're here for the convention. That will say a lot.\"\n\nThe AP sent an email Wednesday to representatives of the Republican National Convention for comment on Mitchell's death.\n\nThis story has been updated to correct the spelling of Mitchell's first name to D'Vontaye, not Dvontaye.\n\nMore from this section\n\nAvenu Insights & Analytics Launches Avenu | Records: Transforming Document Management for Local

Here's what we know", "body": "The family of Dvontaye Mitchell wants answers and accountability for his death, more than a week after Mitchell, a Black man, died after being detained by security guards at the Hyatt Regency Hotel in downtown Milwaukee. Video footage shows that Mitchell, 43, was held on the ground by multiple people before he died.\n\nIn video from the scene, Mitchell is heard yelling \"Please!\" as guards hold him, shouting at him, \"Stay down! Stop fighting!\"\n\nWhen police officers arrived, they found Mitchell unresponsive.\n\nAttorney Ben Crump, who is representing Mitchell's family, says the case raises questions about the use of force and how security personnel respond to mental health emergencies.\n\n\"The circumstances surrounding Dvontaye's death outside the Hyatt Regency Hotel are disturbing and as described by a witness, reminiscent of the killing of George Floyd,\" Crump said in a statement sent to NPR. Floyd, who was Black, died in Minneapolis in 2020 after a white police officer pressed his knee on Floyd's neck for more than nine minutes. The officer, Derek Chauvin was ultimately found guilty for Floyd's murder.\n\nHere's what we know about Mitchell's death:\n\nMitchell died sometime after 3 p.m., after a struggle began with security guards outside the entrance of the Hyatt Regency Hotel at 333 W. Kilbourn Ave, according to the Milwaukee Police Department.\n\n\"A witness reported seeing three to four security guards with their knees on Mitchell's neck and back and one of them striking him in the head with an object,\" Crump's office said.\n\nVideo footage posted online appears to show a group of security guards using their body weight against Mitchell, who seems to be held face-down on the pavement.\n\nThe Hyatt in central Milwaukee is a franchise property operated by Texas-based Aimbridge Hospitality. A spokesperson for Aimbridge told NPR on Thursday that it has fired the guards involved in the incident, saying their conduct \"violated our policies and procedures, and does not reflect our values as an organization or the behaviors we expect from our associates.\"\n\n\"We will continue our independent investigation and do everything we can to support law enforcement with their investigation into this tragic incident,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nThe guards involved in the incident were initially suspended; a Hyatt spokesperson told NPR on Wednesday that they should be terminated and face criminal charges.\n\nThe Hyatt spokesperson said each of the two companies are investigating Mitchell's death. Both of them have also offered condolences to Mitchell's family and loved ones.\n\n\"An individual entered a business and caused a disturbance. The individual fought with security guards as they were escorting the individual out,\" the police said in response to NPR's request for an account of Mitchell's death.\n\n\"Security detained the individual until police arrived. Upon arrival, the individual was unresponsive and despite lifesaving measures, the 43-year-old individual was pronounced deceased.\"\n\nWitnesses told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that the struggle lasted as long as 10 minutes or more; they also said they heard comments suggesting that Mitchell allegedly tried to go into the women's bathroom inside the hotel.\n\nThe Milwaukee County Medical Examiner's Office is treating Mitchell's death as a homicide, \"but the final manner [of death] is yet to be determined,\" Karen Domagalski, the office's operations manager, told NPR.\n\nAn autopsy was performed on Mitchell, \"and the cause of death is pending toxicology and further investigation,\" she said.\n\nWhen contacted by NPR, the Milwaukee County District Attorney's Office stated, \"Our office is reviewing Mr. Mitchell's death as a homicide case.\"\n\n\"Mr. Mitchell's death is a tragedy, and we extend our deepest condolences to his family,\" District Attorney John Chisholm said in a statement.\n\nStaff from the prosecutor's office gave an update on the investigation Wednesday to William Sulton, another attorney representing Mitchell's family.

His relatives have called for charges to be filed against those responsible for his death.\n\nCrump also represented the family of Floyd, whose death spurred worldwide protests against racial violence and police brutality.\n\nMitchell, 43, died at the Hyatt Regency after four security guards held him down on his stomach, media outlets have reported. Police have said Mitchell entered the hotel, caused a disturbance and fought with the guards as they were escorting him out.\n\nThe medical examiner's office has said the preliminary cause of death was homicide, but the cause remains under investigation. No one has been criminally charged so far.\n\nThe Milwaukee County District Attorney's office said Wednesday that it and police investigators were awaiting full autopsy results and that the case was being reviewed as a homicide.\n\n\"The autopsy results will inform the ongoing police investigation into Mr. Mitchell's death and allow our office to comprehensively evaluate the actions leading up to Mr. Mitchell's death from the perspective of potential criminal liability,\" the district attorney's office said. \"All aspects of these actions, including Mr. Mitchell's death and the use of force by hotel personnel, will be closely examined.\"\n\nMitchell's family wants some evidence, particularly security camera video, made public.\n\nCrump said video recorded by a bystander and circulating on social media shows excessive force was used by security guards to subdue Mitchell.\n\n\"In the video you see them with their knees on his back and neck,\" Crump said. \"You see what appears to be (a security guard) hitting him in the head with some object. You see them pull his shirt over his head, stifling not only his sound but, we believe, his breath.\"\n\n\"Everybody in America, after George Floyd, should have trained their employees, especially security personnel, to not put knees on peoples' backs and peoples' necks,\" Crump added.\n\nIt is unclear why Mitchell was at the hotel or what happened before the guards pinned him down. The Milwaukee County medical examiner's initial report said he was homeless, but a cousin told The Associated Press on Wednesday that was incorrect.\n\nA spokesperson for Aimbridge Hospitality, which runs the Hyatt Regency in Milwaukee, said in a statement that it extends its condolences to Mitchell's family and supports the investigation.\n\nMitchell was born and raised in Milwaukee, according to his first cousin Samantha Mitchell, 37, and any mental illness he may have had was undiagnosed.\n\n\"Dvontaye loved to cook,\" she said. \"He was overprotective of his family, especially his younger cousins. He was a jokester. He really clung to a lot of our male cousins growing up, enjoying life together.\"\n\nShe said the family changed his funeral from Saturday to Thursday so its significance would not be overshadowed by the GOP convention.\n\n\"We need to keep this in the light and not swept under the rug,\" Mitchell said. \"Regardless of the convention going on, this is still a matter that needs attention from everyone, no matter what party you are with.

Here's what we know", "body": "The family of Dvontaye Mitchell wants answers and accountability for his death, more than a week after Mitchell, a Black man, died after being detained by security guards at the Hyatt Regency Hotel in downtown Milwaukee. Video footage shows that Mitchell, 43, was held on the ground by multiple people before he died.\n\nAttorney Ben Crump, who is representing Mitchell's family, says the case raises questions about the use of force and how security personnel respond to mental health emergencies.\n\nIn video from the scene, Mitchell is heard yelling \"Please!\" as guards hold him, shouting at him, \"Stay down! Stop fighting!\"\n\nWhen police officers arrived, they found Mitchell unresponsive.\n\n\"The circumstances surrounding Dvontaye's death outside the Hyatt Regency Hotel are disturbing and as described by a witness, reminiscent of the killing of George Floyd,\" Crump said in a statement sent to NPR. Floyd, who was Black, died in Minneapolis in 2020 after a white police officer pressed his knee on Floyd's neck for more than nine minutes. The officer, Derek Chauvin was ultimately found guilty for Floyd's murder.\n\nHere's what we know about Mitchell's death:\n\nMitchell died sometime after 3 p.m., after a struggle began with security guards outside the entrance of the Hyatt Regency Hotel at 333 W. Kilbourn Ave, according to the Milwaukee Police Department.\n\n\"A witness reported seeing three to four security guards with their knees on Mitchell's neck and back and one of them striking him in the head with an object,\" Crump's office said.\n\nVideo footage posted online appears to show a group of security guards apparently using their body weight against Mitchell, who seems to be held face-down on the pavement.\n\n\"An individual entered a business and caused a disturbance. The individual fought with security guards as they were escorting the individual out,\" the police said in response to NPR's request for an account of Mitchell's death.\n\n\"Security detained the individual until police arrived. Upon arrival, the individual was unresponsive and despite lifesaving measures, the 43-year-old individual was pronounced deceased.\"\n\nWitnesses told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that the struggle lasted as long as 10 minutes or more; they also said they heard comments suggesting that Mitchell allegedly tried to go into the women's bathroom inside the hotel.\n\nThe Milwaukee County Medical Examiner's Office is treating Mitchell's death as a homicide, \"but the final manner [of death] is yet to be determined,\" Karen Domagalski, the office's operations manager, told NPR.\n\nAn autopsy was performed on Mitchell, \"and the cause of death is pending toxicology and further investigation,\" she said.\n\nWhen contacted by NPR, the Milwaukee County District Attorney's Office stated, \"Our office is reviewing Mr. Mitchell's death as a homicide case.\"\n\n\"Mr. Mitchell's death is a tragedy, and we extend our deepest condolences to his family,\" District Attorney John Chisholm said in a statement.\n\nStaff from the prosecutor's office gave an update on the investigation Wednesday to William Sulton, another attorney representing Mitchell's family. In that meeting, Sulton saw video footage and other evidence related to the investigation, the prosecutor's office said.\n\n\"The cause of death is under investigation. The investigation is ongoing,\" the police said, adding that the Milwaukee County District Attorney's Office will review its investigation.\n\nThe guards involved in the incident have been suspended, a Hyatt spokesperson told NPR.\n\nThe Hyatt in central Milwaukee is a franchise property operated by Texas-based Aimbridge Hospitality. A Hyatt spokesperson says both companies are investigating Mitchell's death. Both of them also offered condolences to Mitchell's family and loved ones.\n\n\"Hyatt is conducting its own investigation and is fully committed to supporting efforts to help ensure accountability,\" the Hyatt representative said, adding that the company requires franchisees to meet \"mandatory safety and security standards.\"\n\n\"We continue to do everything we can to support law enforcement's ongoing investigation into this incident,\" an Aimbridge spokesperson told NPR.", "source": {"uri": "npr.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "NPR"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bill_chappell@npr.org", "name": "Bill Chappell", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyatt", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hyatt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Security guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_George_Floyd", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Murder of George Floyd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPR", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NPR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use_of_force", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Use of force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Crump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Crump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downtown", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Downtown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mental health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Police officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minneapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minneapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minneapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derek_Chauvin", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Derek Chauvin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Police_Department", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Police Department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Journal_Sentinel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Journal Sentinel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "District attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homicide", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Homicide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_County,_Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee County, Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee County, Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_T._Chisholm", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John T.

The same guard is heard calling out to witnesses, \"This is what happens when you go into the lady's room.\" It's unclear what led up to Mitchell's encounter with the security guards, how long it took police officers to arrive on the scene, and what Mitchell was doing at the hotel.\n\nBy the time police arrived on the scene, Dvontaye Mitchell was unresponsive and pronounced dead, according to Milwaukee Police.\n\nThe Milwaukee County Medical Examiner's Office initially ruled Mitchell's death as a homicide, but the final manner is yet to be determined.\n\n\"The cause and manner of death is pending toxicology and further investigation, Domagalski said. \"We do not have a timeline for when this case will be finalized.\"\n\nBut Mitchell's family says they are traumatized by his untimely death, saying that his children can't even go to the grocery store without being reminded of their father's death.\n\n\"We couldn't even go into the grocery store with my daughter without her being afraid of the security standing at the door,\" Mitchell's widow, DeAsia Harmon told CNN. She said, 'Is all security bad or just the ones who murdered my dad.'\"\n\nFamily attorney Ben Crump called the incident \"troubling\" and \"disturbing.\"\n\n\"It is deeply troubling that we have lost another Black man in an encounter with security personnel, raising serious concerns about the use of force, lack of accountability, and absence of mental health considerations,\" Crump said in a statement. \"The circumstances surrounding Dvontaye's death outside the Hyatt Regency Hotel as disturbing and as described by a witness, reminiscent of the killing of Geroge Floyd. Dvontaye's family is now left searching for answers and justice in the face of this tragic loss.\"\n\nHe continued, \"We demand a thorough and transparent investigation into the actions of the security guards involved in the incident. It is unacceptable that this case is not being considered a criminal investigation despite the fatal outcome, which the medical examiner considers a homicide. The fight for justice for Dvontaye Mitchell has just begun, and will not rest until those responsible are held accountable,\" said Crump.\n\nRev. Al Sharpton, Founder and President of NAN, also demanded justice for Mitchell's family.\n\n\"We cannot watch Dvontaye Mitchell's murder be washed out by the RNC coming to town, where they will solidify a nominee whose view of justice is pure brute force,\" said Sharpton. \"You cannot answer a Black man's cries for help during a clear mental crisis with a knee on his back or his neck. People from all over the country will descend upon Milwaukee in the days to come, and it's our mission to see the state of Black Americans and why Dvontaye's family deserves justice.\"\n\nSharpton will also deliver the eulogy for Dvontaye Mitchell in Milwaukee this Thursday, as thousands descend upon the city for the start of the Republican National Convention next week.\n\nSEE ALSO:\n\nFinding Taylor Casey: Police Employ Marine Teams To Find Chicago Black Woman Missing In Bahamas\n\nFamily Seeks Answers After NY Police Shoot And Kill 13-Year-Old Myanmar Boy\n\nThe post Dvontaye Mitchell's Family Demands Answers After Black Man Killed By Milwaukee Hotel Security Guards appeared first on NewsOne.\n\nDvontaye Mitchell's Family Demands Answers After Black Man Killed By Milwaukee Hotel Security Guards was originally published on newsone.com", "source": {"uri": "theurbandaily.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Urban Daily"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bilal_g_morris@theurbandaily.com", "name": "Bilal G.

His relatives have called for charges to be filed against those responsible for the 43-year-old's death.\n\nCrump also represented the family of Floyd, whose death spurred worldwide protests against racial violence and police brutality.\n\n\"Everybody in America, after George Floyd, should have trained their employees, especially security personnel, to not put knees on peoples' backs and peoples' necks,\" Crump added.\n\nA spokesperson for Aimbridge Hospitality, which runs the Hyatt Regency in Milwaukee, said in a statement that it extends its condolences to Mitchell's family and supports the investigation.\n\nMitchell died at the Hyatt Regency after four security guards held him down on his stomach, media outlets have reported. Police have said Mitchell entered the hotel, caused a disturbance and fought with the guards as they were escorting him out.\n\nThe medical examiner's office has said the preliminary cause of death was homicide, but the cause remains under investigation. No one has been criminally charged so far.\n\nThe Milwaukee County District Attorney's office said Wednesday that it and police investigators were awaiting full autopsy results and that the case was being reviewed as a homicide.\n\nSurveillance video from inside the hotel viewed by Mitchell's family and their lawyers Wednesday at the district attorney's office showed an unarmed man fleeing for his life while being punched and kicked, they said during an afternoon news conference.\n\n\"What I saw today was disgusting. It makes me sick to my stomach,\" Mitchell's widow, DeAsia Harmon said. \"He ran for his life. He was trying to leave. He said 'I'll go,' and they didn't let him go.\"\n\nHarmon said the video showed a bleeding Mitchell being dragged outside the hotel. \"They didn't stop. They could have let him go, but they didn't,\" she said.\n\nCrump said the family's legal team also has a signed affidavit from a hotel employee who said a security guard was striking Mitchell with a baton and that Mitchell posed no threat when he was on the ground. The worker said a security guard ordered him and a bellman to help hold Mitchell down, Crump said.\n\nAnother lawyer, William Sulton said the hotel video showed an on-duty hotel security guard take a photo of Mitchell's lifeless body as the guard was being questioned by police. \"Absolutely disgusting,\" Sulton said.\n\nIt is unclear why Mitchell was at the hotel or what happened before the guards pinned him down. The Milwaukee County medical examiner's initial report said he was homeless, but a cousin told The Associated Press on Wednesday that was incorrect.\n\nCrump said video recorded by a bystander and circulating on social media also shows excessive force was used by security guards to subdue Mitchell.\n\n\"In the video you see them with their knees on his back and neck,\" Crump said, and the security guard appears to hit Mitchell in the head with an object. \"You see them pull his shirt over his head, stifling not only his sound but, we believe, his breath.\"\n\nMitchell was born and raised in Milwaukee, according to his first cousin Samantha Mitchell, 37, and any mental illness he may have had was undiagnosed.\n\n\"D'Vontaye loved to cook,\" she said. \"He was overprotective of his family, especially his younger cousins. He was a jokester. He really clung to a lot of our male cousins growing up, enjoying life together.\"\n\nShe said the family changed his funeral from Saturday to Thursday so its significance would not be overshadowed by the GOP convention.\n\n\"We need to keep this in the light and not swept under the rug,\" Mitchell said. \"Regardless of the convention going on, this is still a matter that needs attention from everyone, no matter what party you are with. I want to see people speak about it while they're here for the convention. That will say a lot.\"\n\nThe AP sent an email Wednesday to representatives of the Republican National Convention for comment on Mitchell's death.\n\n___\n\nThis story has been updated to correct the spelling of Mitchell's first name to D'Vontaye, not Dvontaye.", "source": {"uri": "wbal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WBAL"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Security guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hotel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Floyd", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "George Floyd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitchell_family", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mitchell family"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_George_Floyd", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Murder of George Floyd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Crump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Crump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyatt", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hyatt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_brutality", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Police brutality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "District attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Black people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homicide", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Homicide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Police officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_and_political_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Civil and political rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minneapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minneapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minneapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Floyd_protests", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "George Floyd protests"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Press conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_violence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ethnic violence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed-circuit_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Closed-circuit television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_examiner", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Medical examiner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autopsy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Autopsy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_County,_Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee County, Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee County, Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 55}], "image": "https://dehayf5mhw1h7.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/2100/2023/06/06143349/wbal-logo.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719745", "eventUri": "eng-9719745", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-30", "textStart": 300, "textEnd": 307}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-15", "textStart": 715, "textEnd": 722}, {"amb": false, "date": "2020-05-", "textStart": 514, "textEnd": 522}], "sentiment": -0.2784313725490196, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

Police have said Mitchell entered the hotel, caused a disturbance and fought with the guards as they were escorting him out.\n\nThe medical examiner's office has said the preliminary cause of death was homicide, but it remains under investigation. No one had been charged criminally as of Wednesday.\n\nMitchell's death carried echoes of the 2020 killing of Floyd after a white police officer in Minneapolis knelt on his neck. His death spurred worldwide protests against racial violence and police brutality.\n\nMitchell's family has hired civil rights attorney Ben Crump, who also represented Floyd's family. Crump told reporters Monday that Mitchell had mental health issues.\n\nThe investigation into his death comes amid heightened security concerns around political protests in the city days before the July 15 start of the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee.\n\nIt's unclear why Mitchell was at the hotel or what happened before the guards pinned him down. The Milwaukee County medical examiner's initial report said Mitchell was homeless, but a cousin told The Associated Press on Wednesday that was incorrect.\n\nA spokesperson for Aimbridge Hospitality, which runs the Hyatt Regency in Milwaukee, said in a statement that the company extends its condolences to Mitchell's family and supports the investigation.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

The 43-year-old's mom said her son was in the throes of a mental health episode when he was tackled by guards at the Hyatt Regency Milwaukee on June 30, as he pleaded with them to let him go.\n\nThe guards have all been suspended, Hyatt representatives said in a statement. However, Milwaukee police said Tuesday that they were not conducting a criminal investigation because there was no \"blunt force\" involved, but that a probe into what happened was ongoing.\n\nAccording to Hyatt security, the incident began after Mitchell allegedly went into the women's restroom in the hotel lobby. Four security guards then muscled Mitchell to the driveway by the hotel entrance, and can be seen on cellphone video kneeling on his back and neck as he apologizes repeatedly and pleads with them to let him go. One of the guards appears to strike Mitchell in the head with an unknown object as another commands Mitchell to \"stop fighting.\" Mitchell was unresponsive when police arrived, and he was pronounced dead at the scene, according to civil rights attorney Ben Crump, who has been retained by the Mitchell family.\n\nCrump has compared Mitchell's death to that of George Floyd, a Black man who died in 2020 when Minneapolis cops detained him and pinned him to the ground on suspicion of passing a counterfeit $20 bill.\n\nAt a press conference on Tuesday, Crump called for charges to be filed against the Hyatt guards, posting footage of his remarks on Instagram, accompanied by the caption: \"We want #JusticeForDvontaye Mitchell! Why is it that [his] death, ruled a homicide by the medical examiner, is not under criminal investigation?! The security personnel involved in... Dvontaye's death must be held accountable!\"\n\nAt an earlier press conference held Monday, where video of the shocking incident was screened for reporters, Crump's co-counsel William Sulton said, \"You're watching a murder, folks. That's what you're watching.\"\n\nIn a statement issued by his office, Crump called Mitchell's death \"deeply troubling,\" saying that the family \"is now left searching for answers and justice in the face of this tragic loss... It is unacceptable that this case is not being considered a criminal investigation despite the fatal outcome.\"\n\nFor its part, Hyatt said, \"We extend our heartfelt condolences to Dvontaye Mitchell's family, all those who knew and loved him, and the Milwaukee community in light of this tragedy. Hotels franchised under Hyatt's brands are required to comply with Hyatt's mandatory safety and security standards and ensure that the hotel is a safe and secure environment for guests, colleagues and the public. As the investigation continues, Hyatt is fully committed to supporting efforts to help ensure accountability for the circumstances that led to the death of Dvontaye Mitchell.\"\n\nThe outrage over Mitchell's death is ramping up just days before the Republican National Convention is set to begin. GOP delegates will be in town from July 15 through July 18 for the nominating confab, during which they are expected to solidify the party's choice of former Oval Office occupant and newly convicted felon Donald Trump as its 2024 presidential candidate.\n\nCrump and the Mitchell family are scheduled to hold another press conference on Wednesday afternoon to \"reveal significant new evidence from a witness,\" according to Crump.

Mitchell can be heard grunting and yelling apologies.\n\nMitchell's mother said her son had mental health issues, and Ben Crump, a civil rights lawyer representing Mitchell's family, said a witness to the June 30 incident had reported seeing one of the guards \"striking him in the head with an object.\" Police did not address those claims.\n\nMore witnesses have since come forward, according to Crump, who told The Washington Post that the security guards must be held accountable. Two witnesses will describe what they saw happen at the hotel during a news conference on Wednesday, he said.\n\nMilwaukee police did not immediately respond to questions about whether they're still collecting witness accounts.\n\n\"Dvontaye was pleading for his life. It's just heartbreaking,\" Crump said, calling for the hotel to release its video footage and to identify the security personnel involved. \"It's even more egregious that they are treating these private citizens with a cloak of immunity.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Hyatt extended condolences to Mitchell's loved ones and to the city of Milwaukee. Aimbridge Hospitality, a Texas-based company, operates the Hyatt Regency Milwaukee and manages its employees, according to the Hyatt spokesperson. Aimbridge's investigation into Mitchell's death is ongoing and the employees involved have been suspended, the Hyatt spokesperson said.\n\nA spokesperson for Aimbridge Hospitality said the company is supporting the ongoing law enforcement investigation and remains committed to providing a welcoming and safe environment for all hotel guests and employees.\n\n\"We offer our sincere condolences to Mr. Mitchell's family and loved ones,\" the spokesperson added.\n\nCrump, in comparing Mitchell's death to that of Floyd's, said stopping people from using excessive force against unarmed Black people requires action from authorities.\n\n\"Then they won't be prone to treat unarmed Black men with such inhumanity,\" said Crump, who represented Floyd's family in a lawsuit against Minneapolis.\n\nFloyd, who was Black, died there in 2020 after a White police officer knelt on his neck for more than nine minutes - an incident that sparked a wave of global protests over racial inequality. The officer, Derek Chauvin, was convicted and sent to federal prison.\n\nNo one has been charged in connection to Mitchell's death. The Milwaukee district attorney's office told The Post on Tuesday that the \"matter has been referred to our office and is currently pending further investigation.\"\n\n\"There's no timeline for a charging decision at this time,\" an office spokesperson added.\n\nPolice said they were called to the Hyatt for a person causing a disturbance about 3:20 p.m. on June 30. They received a report that the person began fighting while being escorted out. When they arrived, officers found the person unresponsive and unsuccessfully tried \"lifesaving measures.\"\n\nIt is not clear what happened immediately before or after the witness videos were recorded. In one video broadcast by local media, a guard appears to address the person recording the video, shouting, \"This is what happens when you go into the ladies' room.\" Aimbridge Hospitality did not immediately respond to a question about whether Mitchell had entered a women's restroom.\n\nIf Mitchell had entered the women's restroom, that shouldn't be a death sentence, Crump said.\n\nMitchell, who lived in Milwaukee, had two children: a 6-year-old and an 8-year old, said his mother, Brenda Giles. Mitchell struggled with his mental health in recent years and may have been suffering from a mental health episode when he was at the hotel, she said.\n\n\"He lost his dad in June 2016.

Now his family wants answers - WSVN 7News | Miami News, Weather, Sports | Fort Lauderdale", "body": "(CNN) -- The death of a Black man after he was pinned to the ground by security guards at a Wisconsin hotel last month has left his family with more questions than answers - despite parts of the encounter being captured by witnesses.\n\nDvontaye Mitchell, 43, was at the downtown Hyatt Regency in Milwaukee on June 30, where police allege he \"caused a disturbance,\" prompting security guards to escort him out of the hotel, a statement from Mitchell family attorney Ben Crump said.\n\nPart of a video posted on social media shows four security guards pinning Mitchell to the ground. In the video, Mitchell can be heard grunting and pleading with the guards, repeatedly saying \"please\" and \"I'm sorry.\"\n\nOne of the guards, who appears to be White, can be heard saying \"stay down,\" and \"stop fighting,\" as the others, who appear to be people of color, hold Mitchell down. The same guard is heard calling out to witnesses, \"This is what happens when you go into the ladies room.\"\n\nIt's unclear what led up to Mitchell's encounter with the security guards, how long it took police officers to arrive on the scene, and what Mitchell was doing at the hotel.\n\nWhen officers arrived, Mitchell was unresponsive and pronounced dead despite lifesaving measures that were taken, Milwaukee Police told CNN on Tuesday without mentioning Mitchell by name.\n\nThe preliminary manner of death for Mitchell is homicide, Karen Domagalski from the Milwaukee County Medical Examiner's Office told CNN on Tuesday, but the final manner is yet to be determined.\n\n\"The cause and manner of death is pending toxicology and further investigation, Domagalski said. \"We do not have a timeline for when this case will be finalized.\"\n\nThe encounter comes as the use of force - particularly against people of color - by police and others in authority roles remains under scrutiny nearly four years after protests flared nationwide following the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer.\n\nNow, every time Mitchell's children turn on the TV, they are reminded of how their father died, DeAsia Harmon, Mitchell's widow, told CNN affiliate WTMJ on Monday.\n\n\"We couldn't even go into the grocery store with my daughter without her being afraid of the security standing at the door,\" Harmon said. \"She said, 'is all security bad or just the ones who murdered my dad.'\"\n\nThe security guards involved in the incident have been suspended. Aimbridge Hospitality, which operates the downtown Hyatt Regency Milwaukee, is still completing its investigation, a Hyatt spokesperson told CNN on Monday.\n\n\"We extend our heartfelt condolences to Dvontaye Mitchell's family, all those who knew and loved him, and the Milwaukee community in light of this tragedy,\" the spokesperson said. \"As the investigation continues, Hyatt is fully committed to supporting efforts to help ensure accountability for the circumstances that led to the death of Dvontaye Mitchell.\"\n\nMilwaukee Police are not considering the incident as a criminal investigation because there isn't any evidence of \"blunt force,\" according to Crump.\n\n\"It is unacceptable that this case is not being considered a criminal investigation despite the fatal outcome, which the medical examiner considers a homicide,\" Crump said.\n\nThe case is pending further investigation and there's no timeline for a charging decision at the moment, the Milwaukee County District Attorney's office told CNN on Tuesday.\n\n'To know him is to love him'\n\nMitchell's mother, Brenda Giles, said her eldest son was a jolly, outgoing, brother, uncle and father who loved his family, she told WTMJ.\n\n\"Everybody that knows him, to know him is to love him, they know,\" his sister, Nayisha Mitchell told the station. \"They knew he was a good person.\"\n\nWhen Mitchell's father passed away in 2016, Mitchell fell into depression, his family told WTMJ. Giles believes her son was suffering from a mental health episode at the time of the incident, according to Crump.\n\nShawn Moore, a witness who recorded parts of the interaction, told WTMJ he wishes he had done more.\n\n\"What I ended up capturing was another Black man in Milwaukee dealing with mental issues losing his life over nothing,\" he said.\n\nFamily and friends held a vigil for Mitchell over the weekend outside the downtown Hyatt Regency echoing similar sentiments of calls for justice.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Following review of their actions, their employment has been terminated. We will continue our independent investigation and do everything we can to support law enforcement with their investigation into this tragic incident.\"\n\nHyatt said in an earlier statement that it \"joins the family of D'Vontaye Mitchell in their calls for transparency, accountability and justice for this senseless tragedy. We believe that the employees of Aimbridge Hospitality who were involved should be terminated and that criminal charges should be filed.\"\n\nThe family is also calling for charges to be brought.\n\nMitchell, 43, died at the Hyatt Regency after four security guards restrained him, holding him down on his stomach, media outlets have reported. Police have said Mitchell entered the hotel, caused a disturbance and fought with hotel employees as they were escorting him out. The family disputes that account.\n\nThe medical examiner's office has said the preliminary cause of death was homicide, but the cause remains under investigation. No one has been criminally charged so far.\n\nThe Milwaukee County District Attorney's office said Wednesday that it and police investigators were awaiting full autopsy results and that the case was being reviewed as a homicide.\n\nSurveillance and body camera video viewed by Mitchell's family and their lawyers Wednesday at the district attorney's office showed an unarmed man fleeing for his life while being punched and kicked, they said during an afternoon news conference.\n\n\"What I saw today was disgusting. It makes me sick to my stomach,\" Mitchell's widow, DeAsia Harmon said. \"He ran for his life. He was trying to leave. He said 'I'll go,' and they didn't let him go.\"\n\nHarmon said the video showed a bleeding Mitchell being dragged outside the hotel. \"They didn't stop. They could have let him go, but they didn't,\" she said.\n\nNoted civil rights attorney Benjamin Crump said the family's legal team also has a signed affidavit from a hotel employee who said a security guard was striking Mitchell with a baton and that Mitchell posed no threat when he was on the ground. The worker said a security guard ordered him and a bellman to help hold Mitchell down, Crump continued.\n\nAnother lawyer, William Sulton, said the hotel video showed an on-duty hotel security guard take a photo of Mitchell's lifeless body as the guard was being questioned by police. \"Absolutely disgusting,\" Sulton said.\n\nMitchell's sister, Nayisha Mitchell, told CBS Milwaukee affiliate WDJT-TV after watching the video, \"Actually seeing it up close and personal, I'm telling you it's much, much, much, much worse.\"\n\nDeAsia Harmon told the station \"to see the people involved, to see their faces, to see that they had no remorse\" was especially hard.\n\nSulton told WDJT the original narrative from authorities -- that security guards restrained Mitchell because he went into a women's bathroom -- is wrong. \"An off-duty security officer attacked D'Vontaye. D'Vontaye ran from that individual,\" he said.\n\nSulton added that Mitchell went into the women's bathroom to get away from the attacker. Then Hyatt employees -- including a bellman and a front desk worker -- dragged him out.\n\nSulton said they \"shoved his head into the ground so hard that he's bleeding. Forehead, nose, and mouth.\"\n\nSulton asserted to WDJT that Mitchell did nothing to instigate the incident. \"There was no criminal conduct by D'Vontaye Mitchell,\" he said.\n\nIt's unclear why Mitchell was at the hotel or what happened before the guards pinned him down. The Milwaukee County medical examiner's initial report said he was homeless, but a cousin told The Associated Press on Wednesday that was incorrect.\n\nCrump said video recorded by a bystander and circulating on social media also shows excessive force was used by security guards to subdue Mitchell.\n\n\"In the video you see them with their knees on his back and neck,\" Crump said, and the security guard appears to hit Mitchell in the head with an object. \"You see them pull his shirt over his head, stifling not only his sound but, we believe, his breath.\"\n\nShawn Moore told CBS News Tuesday that he witnessed part of the incident while walking to a nearby Walgreens to pick up some things for his son. He said he walked over to the hotel when he heard screaming.\n\nThe four guards didn't get off Mitchell until police officers got to the hotel, Moore said, recalling that \"one was holding his ankles, and you had the other three above the waist applying pressure holding him down.\"\n\nMitchell was born and raised in Milwaukee, according to his first cousin Samantha Mitchell, 37, and any mental illness he may have had was undiagnosed.\n\n\"D'Vontaye loved to cook,\" she said. \"He was overprotective of his family, especially his younger cousins. He was a jokester. He really clung to a lot of our male cousins growing up, enjoying life together.\"\n\nShe said the family changed his funeral from Saturday to Thursday so its significance would not be overshadowed by the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, which starts next week.\n\n\"We need to keep this in the light and not swept under the rug,\" Mitchell said. \"Regardless of the convention going on, this is still a matter that needs attention from everyone, no matter what party you are with. I want to see people speak about it while they're here for the convention. That will say a lot.\"\n\nMitchell's death has become the most recent flashpoint in how the nation confronts race and what some see as the systemic brutality of Black people by members of law enforcement or others in authority, four years after the May 2020 killing of George Floyd by a white police officer in Minneapolis.\n\n\"Just because they have a big event coming up in Milwaukee, the killing of D'Vontaye Mitchell is just as important as anything else that's going to happen in Milwaukee this month,\" Crump told reporters Monday.\n\nCrump also represented the family of Floyd, whose death spurred worldwide protests against racial violence and police brutality.\n\n\"Everybody in America, after George Floyd, should have trained their employees, especially security personnel, to not put knees on peoples' backs and peoples' necks,\" Crump added.", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

He died at the scene, and a preliminary cause of death was listed as homicide.\n\nVideo obtained by CBS58 showed Mitchell crying for help as he's pinned on the ground by the guards' hands and knees. He can be heard yelling \"No! Please!\" as security guards command him to \"Stay down!\" and \"Stop fighting!\"\n\nPolice said they arrived to find Mitchell unresponsive. Efforts to revive him were unsuccessful.\n\nMitchell's sister-in-law Candice Miller told the Journal Sentinel they \"treated him like he was nothing, like he was an animal.\"\n\nMitchell's attorney has said he had mental health issues. Prominent civil rights attorney Ben Crump said in a statement that a witness saw a guard hit Mitchell in the head with some sort of object, The Washington Post reported.\n\n\"It is deeply troubling that we have lost another Black man in an encounter with security personnel, raising serious concerns about the use of force, lack of accountability, and absence of mental health considerations,\" Crump said the statement, according to the Post. \"The circumstances surrounding Dvontaye's death outside the Hyatt Regency Hotel are disturbing and as described by a witness, reminiscent of the killing of George Floyd.\"\n\nBrenda Giles, Mitchell's mother, said Monday: \"I want justice for my son.\"\n\nFloyd was murdered in Minneapolis in 2020.

The statement directly refers to Aimbridge Hospitality, the hotel operator, who has said its cooperating with a police investigation.\n\n\"Hyatt joins the family of D'Vontaye Mitchell in their calls for transparency, accountability and justice for this senseless tragedy,\" Hyatt's statement said. \"We believe that the employees of Aimbridge Hospitality who were involved should be terminated and that criminal charges should be filed.\"\n\nHyatt's statement came as the Mitchell family, supporters and attorneys held a demonstration outside of a police and court building. The family has been critical of what they describe as a lack of transparency and justice, noting that charges have not been filed against the worker.\n\nAt the demonstration, attorneys said they have spoken with a hotel worker who said security acted with excessive force and is prepared to testify to that effect should the case turn into legal action.\n\nEarlier on Wednesday, the Milwaukee County District Attorney's Office said in a statement that it was investigating Mitchell's death as a homicide. The DA's office is awaiting the final autopsy from the Milwaukee County Medical Examiner's Office before making its decision.\n\nThe final autopsy results will inform the ongoing police investigation and allow the district attorney's office to \"comprehensively evaluate the actions leading up to Mr. Mitchell's death from the perspective of potential criminal liability,\" according to the statement.\n\n\"All aspects of these actions, including Mr. Mitchell's death and the use of force by hotel personnel, will be closely examined,\" the statement said.\n\nAt a separate press conference on Wednesday, Milwaukee Police Chief Jeffrey Norman said he wanted to \"set the record straight\" in response to Mitchell's death.\n\n\"If it's not something being reviewed in a criminal nature, then why is the DA looking at it? So we need to make sure that we set the record straight in regard to what's going on and who's talking in our community,\" he said. \"This is still within the medical examiner's office. This is still being reviewed for an autopsy from a standpoint of understanding exactly what happened.\"\n\nAt the press conference with the chief, Milwaukee Mayor Cavalier Johnson said he spoke with the Mitchell family on Tuesday and called the death a \"tragedy.\" He said that the city's Office of Community Wellness and Safety had been in touch with the family as well.\n\n\"It's a family member who is no longer with them and that's a tragedy regardless of how it happens,\" Johnson said.\n\nMitchell, 43, died around 4 p.m. June 30 after allegedly entering the women's bathroom at the hotel, located at Milwaukee, 333 W. Kilbourn Ave. Crump said Mitchell was having a mental health crisis, but no information has yet to be released by the Milwaukee Police Department.\n\nPolice said in an initial news release that security held him down following what it described as a disturbance and subsequent fight as he was escorted out.\n\nThe security guards involved in holding down Mitchell have been suspended, according to Hyatt.\n\nAimbridge Hospitality did not immediately respond to an email for comment on Hyatt's statement. In a previous statement, the company said it offered \"our sincere condolences to Mr. Mitchell's family and loved ones.\"\n\n\"We continue to do everything we can to support law enforcement's ongoing investigation into this incident and have no further comment at this time. We remain committed to maintaining a safe and welcoming environment for all hotel guests and associates,\" the July 5 statement said.\n\nMitchell spent the last few minutes of his life being repeatedly beaten by a security guard with a retractable baton as onlookers failed to intervene, said attorneys for his family outside the DA's office on Wednesday.\n\nMembers of Mitchell's family, now planning his funeral, told reporters they were \"repulsed and shocked\" by video footage they viewed alongside Crump, and Milwaukee lawyers B'Ivory Lamarr and William Sulton.\n\nThe footage was supplied by Hyatt, shows Mitchell running from something or someone and seeking safety in the women's bathroom in the hotel, the lawyers said.\n\n\"D'Vontaye was trying to run for his life,\" said Sulton. It's not clear what Mitchell was running from, attorneys team said.\n\nWhen he was confronted by the guards, he had his hands up, but was dragged to the floor and beaten, while he begged for the blows to stop, according to the attorneys.\n\nThey joined dozens of supporters, many wearing T-shirts with Mitchell's image, in marching from the District Attorney's Office to the Hyatt Regency Milwaukee.\n\n\"To see them beat him over and over and over .... they could have stopped at any time,\" said Mitchell's wife DeAsia Harmon, her voice choked by tears. \"They murdered him. They didn't have to do him like that.\"\n\nCrump drew comparisons between Mitchell's death, and those of Breonna Taylor, George Floyd, Trayvon Martin and other Black men and women who died during deadly encounters with law enforcement or persons acting in positions of authority.\n\nBrenda Giles described her son as a harmless teddy bear and \"a joy in his family.\" She said she was \"devastated\" watching the videos on the eve of his funeral and pleaded with prosecutors to issue charges in Mitchell's death.\n\n\"I always thought my son would be the one to bury me, not for me to be burying him,\" Giles said. \"We won't let this be swept under the rug.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The statement directly refers to Aimbridge Hospitality, the hotel operator, who has said its cooperating with a police investigation.\n\n\"Hyatt joins the family of D'Vontaye Mitchell in their calls for transparency, accountability and justice for this senseless tragedy,\" Hyatt's statement said. \"We believe that the employees of Aimbridge Hospitality who were involved should be terminated and that criminal charges should be filed.\"\n\nHyatt's statement came as the Mitchell family, supporters and attorneys held a demonstration outside of a police and court building. The family has been critical of what they describe as a lack of transparency and justice, noting that charges have not been filed against the worker.\n\nAt the demonstration, attorneys said they have spoken with a hotel worker who said security acted with excessive force and is prepared to testify to that effect should the case turn into legal action.\n\nEarlier on Wednesday, the Milwaukee County District Attorney's Office said in a statement that it was investigating Mitchell's death as a homicide. The DA's office is awaiting the final autopsy from the Milwaukee County Medical Examiner's Office before making its decision.\n\nThe final autopsy results will inform the ongoing police investigation and allow the district attorney's office to \"comprehensively evaluate the actions leading up to Mr. Mitchell's death from the perspective of potential criminal liability,\" according to the statement.\n\n\"All aspects of these actions, including Mr. Mitchell's death and the use of force by hotel personnel, will be closely examined,\" the statement said.\n\nAt a press conference on Wednesday, Milwaukee Police Chief Jeffrey Norman said he wanted to \"set the record straight\" in response to Mitchell's death.\n\n\"If it's not something being reviewed in a criminal nature, then why is the DA looking at it? So we need to make sure that we set the record straight in regard to what's going on and who's talking in our community,\" he said. \"This is still within the medical examiner's office. This is still being reviewed for an autopsy from a standpoint of understanding exactly what happened.\"\n\nAt the press conference Milwaukee Mayor Cavalier Johnson said he spoke with the Mitchell family on Tuesday and called the death a \"tragedy.\" He said that the city's Office of Community Wellness and Safety had been in touch with the family as well.\n\n\"It's a family member who is no longer with them and that's a tragedy regardless of how it happens,\" Johnson said.\n\nMitchell, 43, died around 4 p.m. June 30 after allegedly entering the women's bathroom at the hotel, located at Milwaukee, 333 W. Kilbourn Ave. Crump said Mitchell was having a mental health crisis, but no information has yet to be released by the Milwaukee Police Department.\n\nPolice said in an initial news release that security held him down following what it described as a disturbance and subsequent fight as he was escorted out.\n\nThe security guards involved in holding down Mitchell have been suspended, according to Hyatt.\n\nAimbridge Hospitality did not immediately respond to an email for comment on Hyatt's statement. In a previous statement, the company said it offered \"our sincere condolences to Mr. Mitchell's family and loved ones.\"\n\n\"We continue to do everything we can to support law enforcement's ongoing investigation into this incident and have no further comment at this time.

Down", "body": "The tragic death of Dvontaye Mitchell, a 43-year-old Black man, has ignited a firestorm of controversy and grief following a disturbing altercation with security guards at a Wisconsin hotel.\n\nMitchell's passing on June 30 has left his family shattered and the community demanding answers amid growing scrutiny over the circumstances leading to his death, according to CNN.\n\nAccording to a statement from a Wisconsin Black man's family attorney, Ben Crump, Mitchell was at the Hyatt Regency in Milwaukee when security guards intervened, alleging he had caused a disturbance.\n\nWitness accounts and a video shared on social media depict a harrowing scene: four Wisconsin security guards pinning Mitchell to the ground as he pleads and apologizes repeatedly.\n\nThe footage captures the stark contrast between Mitchell's desperate cries and the guards' commands to \"stay down\" and accusations of his behavior.\n\nREAD NEXT: Ohio: Handcuffed Black Man Dies During Arrest, Saying \"I Can't Breathe\"\n\nMilwaukee Police responded to the scene, where Mitchell was found unresponsive.\n\nDespite efforts to administer lifesaving measures, he was pronounced dead.\n\nKaren Domagalski from the Milwaukee County Medical Examiner's Office stated that the preliminary manner of death for Mitchell is classified as a homicide, pending toxicology and further investigation.\n\nThis designation has intensified public outcry and legal scrutiny, reflecting broader concerns over the use of force, particularly against Black individuals, by law enforcement and security personnel.\n\nThe death of Dvontaye Mitchell at a Wisconsin hotel has evoked comparisons to the high-profile case of George Floyd, whose murder in Minneapolis catalyzed widespread rallies against police brutality and racial injustice.\n\nReverend Al Sharpton, a prominent civil rights activist, announced plans to deliver Mitchell's eulogy, emphasizing the significance of Mitchell's death amid political and social tensions surrounding racial justice, AP News reports.\n\nMitchell's family, represented by attorney Ben Crump, has vehemently disputed initial reports and maintained that Mitchell was experiencing a mental health episode, challenging assertions about his conduct and circumstances before the incident.\n\nIn response to Mitchell's death, Aimbridge Hospitality, the company overseeing operations at the Hyatt Regency Milwaukee, suspended the Wisconsin security guards involved pending the outcome of their internal investigation, CBS News noted.\n\nA spokesperson for Aimbridge expressed condolences to Mitchell's family and underscored their commitment to supporting investigative efforts aimed at ensuring accountability for the events leading to Mitchell's death.\n\nMeanwhile, local authorities and the Milwaukee County District Attorney's Office continue to assess the incident, with no immediate timetable for potential criminal charges against those involved.\n\nThe death of a Wisconsin Black man has reignited debates about racial bias in policing and the disproportionate use of force against Black individuals, resonating deeply within the Milwaukee community and beyond.\n\nCalls for justice, transparency, and systemic reform have intensified, reflecting broader societal concerns over the treatment of marginalized communities by law enforcement and private security personnel.\n\nAs the investigation into Dvontaye Mitchell's death in a Wisconsin hotel unfolds, the community remains steadfast in its demand for accountability and justice.\n\nMitchell's family, alongside civil rights advocates and community leaders are committed to ensuring that his death is not overlooked or dismissed.\n\nREAD MORE:

In the video, Mr Mitchell grunts and pleads with the guards, repeatedly saying \"please\" and \"I'm sorry.\"\n\nOne of the guards can be heard instructing Mr Mitchell to \"stay down\" and \"stop fighting,\" while the others hold him down. The same guard addresses witnesses, stating, \"This is what happens when you go into the ladies' room.\"\n\nThe circumstances leading up to Mitchell's interaction with the security guards, the response time of police officers, and Mr Mitchell's activities at the hotel remain unclear.\n\nUpon their arrival, officers found Mr Mitchell unresponsive. Despite attempts at lifesaving measures, he was pronounced dead, as confirmed by Milwaukee Police to CNN on Tuesday, although Mr Mitchell was not named in their statement.\n\nAccording to Karen Domagalski of the Milwaukee County Medical Examiner's Office, the preliminary cause of Mr Mitchell's death is homicide, though the final determination is still pending.\n\n\"The cause and manner of death is pending toxicology and further investigation, Domagalski said. \"We do not have a timeline for when this case will be finalized.\"\n\nThe incident occurs at a time when the use of force, especially against people of colour, by police and others in positions of authority continues to face scrutiny, nearly four years after nationwide protests erupted following the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer.\n\nDeAsia Harmon, Mitchell's widow, shared with CNN affiliate WTMJ on Monday that whenever Mitchell's children watch television, they are reminded of how their father passed away.\n\n\"We couldn't even go into the grocery store with my daughter without her being afraid of the security standing at the door,\" Harmon said. \"She said, 'is all security bad or just the ones who murdered my dad.'\"\n\nThe media outlet reported that security guards involved in the incident have been suspended.\n\n\"We extend our heartfelt condolences to Dvontaye Mitchell's family, all those who knew and loved him, and the Milwaukee community in light of this tragedy,\" the spokesperson said. \"As the investigation continues, Hyatt is fully committed to supporting efforts to help ensure accountability for the circumstances that led to the death of Dvontaye Mitchell.\"\n\nAccording to Crump, Milwaukee Police are not considering the incident as criminal investigation because there isn't any evidence of \"blunt force.\"\n\n\"It is unacceptable that this case is not being considered a criminal investigation despite the fatal outcome, which the medical examiner considers a homicide,\" Crump said.\n\nPromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com\n\nMitchell's mother, Brenda Giles, said her eldest son was a jolly, outgoing, brother, uncle and father who loved

Police have said he entered the hotel, caused a disturbance and fought with the guards as they were escorting him out.\n\nThe medical examiner's office has said the preliminary cause of death was homicide, but the cause remains under investigation. No one has been criminally charged so far.\n\nThe district attorney's office said Wednesday that it and police investigators were awaiting full autopsy results and that the case was being reviewed as a homicide.\n\nFuneral services for Mitchell were scheduled for Thursday. The Rev. Al Sharpton is scheduled to deliver a eulogy. Sharpton is a longtime activist and leader who serves on the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights.\n\nIt is unclear why Mitchell was at the hotel or what happened before the guards pinned him down.\n\nDeAsia Harmon, Mitchell's widow, described what she saw on the surveillance videos as \"disgusting.\" Harmon said video showed a bleeding Mitchell being dragged outside the hotel.\n\n\"It makes me sick to my stomach,\" Harmon said during a news conference Wednesday. \"He ran for his life. He was trying to leave. He said 'I'll go,' and they didn't let him go.\"\n\nNoted civil rights attorney Ben Crump is part of the legal team representing Mitchell's family. Crump said Wednesday that they have a signed affidavit from a hotel employee who said a security guard was striking Mitchell with a baton and that Mitchell posed no threat when he was on the ground. The worker said a security guard ordered him and a bellman to help hold Mitchell down, Crump said.\n\nCrump also represented the family of George Floyd, who was slain in May 2020 by a white police officer in Minneapolis. Floyd's death spurred worldwide protests against racial violence and police brutality.\n\nMitchell's death comes as Milwaukee is preparing for Monday's start of the Republican National Convention and amid heightened security concerns around political protests.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

The eyewitness recorded videos show multiple security guards pinning him down as he calls for help. This incident took place at the Hyatt Regency in Milwaukee on June 30. It is not clear what provoked a strong security response towards Dvontaye Mitchell. The videos of Dvontaye Mitchell's assault are prompting comparisons to the 2020 killing of George Floyd, who died after a police officer pressed his knee to George Floyd's neck for over nine minutes even as he pleaded with them to stop.\n\nDvontaye Mitchell's mother told The Washington Post that he was suffering from mental health issues. She did not know why her son was at the hotel. Ben Crump, a civil rights lawyer who is representing Mitchell's family, told the media that a witness claimed that they saw one of the security men striking Dvontaye Mitchell's head with an object. Ben Crump has asked the hotel to release security footage of the incident so they can learn more about what transpired that day.\n\nSo far, no one has been charged with Dvontaye Mitchell's death even though the Milwaukee County Medical Examiner's Office said on July 1 that the preliminary cause of his death was ruled as homicide. A homicide is death at the hands of another 'regardless of intent'. The Milwaukee district attorney's office told The Washington Post on Tuesday that the matter was referred to their office and is \"currently pending further investigation.\"\n\nAs per police records, the law enforcement was called at 3.20 pm on June 30. They were informed of a person \"causing disturbance\". When the police arrived, Dvontaye Mitchell was unresponsive. Despite the emergency \"lifesaving measures\", he died.\n\nIn one of the videos that has surfaced online, a security guard addresses a person who was recording the video, \"This is what happens when you go into the ladies' room.\" Crump said that even if Dvontaye Mitchell was inside the ladies room, it did not warrant a death sentence. He also urged other eyewitnesses to come forward with what they saw.\n\nDvontaye Mitchell's younger brother Darrell Giles told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that the circumstances of the former's death reminded him of George Floyd.

Mitchell is a 43-year-old Milwaukee man seen begging for mercy and crying out, \"Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! Please!\" as four armed security guards at the Hyatt Regency Hotel held him down with their knees with his arm behind his back.\n\nHe could also be heard saying, \"I'm sorry!\" as his face was pushed down onto the pavement of the hotel entrance. Mitchell was accused of causing a disturbance inside the hotel. Tragically, the father of two died at the scene.\n\nOn Monday, his family, civil rights attorney Ben Crump, and community activists held a press conference near the site where he died. Some have drawn parallels between Mitchell's death and that of George Floyd Jr., an African American man who was murdered by a white police officer in Minneapolis in 2020.\n\nFloyd's arrest followed a store clerk's suspicion that he used a counterfeit $20 bill. During the arrest, Officer Derek Chauvin knelt on Floyd's neck for over nine minutes as Floyd, handcuffed and defenseless, repeatedly said, \"I can't breathe.\" Chauvin was later convicted of murder in Floyd's death but justice didn't come swiftly.\n\nThe deaths are tragically similar and follow a sickeningly familiar template. In the midst of dealing with unfathomable losses, families are forced to plead for justice even in the face of incontrovertible video evidence.\n\nI'm tired of seeing Black men die at the hands of police officers and security guards, but I'm even more tired of the long fight ahead to bring justice and closure to a family and a community. The hope was that the protests, marches and struggles that followed Floyd's death would change that.\n\nD'Vontaye Mitchell had a mental health crisis. He left the scene dead.\n\nHere is what we know about the Mitchell case: Police said he entered the Hyatt on Kilbourn Avenue downtown just before 4 p.m. on June 30. There was an altercation in the hotel, and Mitchell was subsequently escorted out. According to witnesses, Mitchell entered a women's bathroom.\n\nThe family has been unable to view video footage of what occurred inside the hotel. What the family and most of us have seen is a one-minute and 4-second video recorded by a bystander outside the hotel showing four security guards restraining Mitchell, who is face down just outside the entrance.\n\nWe hear Mitchell saying, \"Please!\" and apologizing.\n\nMitchell appears subdued, but the security guards yell at Michell to \"Stay down!\" and \"Stop Fighting!\" They keep their knees on Mitchell's upper back for the entirety of the video.\n\nThe guard who was yelling at Mitchell then screams at a woman recording the incident, \"This is what happens when you go into the lady's room.\"\n\nTwo women from the Hyatt staff approach the woman recording and one asked, \"Why would you want to record that?\" but neither attempted to stop the guards from their use of force on Mitchell.\n\nOn Monday, Crump said Mitchell was having a mental health crisis and that the \"excessive force\" used by the security guards led to the death of an \"unarmed man.\" It's hard to argue against what the video shows. A mental health episode by an unarmed Black man should not lead to his death.\n\nThe Milwaukee County Medical Examiner's office determined Mitchell's preliminary cause of death to be homicide. Incredibly, the Milwaukee Police Department said in a statement Monday that it is still probing Mitchell's death, but it is not a criminal investigation at this time.\n\nFamily members at the press conference rightfully questioned why the investigation was taking so long with the ample video evidence.\n\nCrump said if the circumstances were different, and it was Crump who had a white man down with his knee buried in his back, charges would already be filed. Crump said we have two justice systems, one for Black America and one for white America. He's right.\n\nWhat does justice look like? Not what's happening here.\n\nCrump and Milwaukee-based attorneys Will Sulton and B'Ivory Lamarr represent members of Mitchell's family, including his wife, DeAsia Harmon, and their 8-year-old daughter; his former girlfriend, Lueella Jackson, and their 6-year-old son Logan Jackson.\n\nCrump, a nationally recognized lawyer who led the Floyd family's legal team, has often said it's hard for Black families to have confidence in the justice system because the system operates differently when the victim is white and the perpetrator is Black.\n\nYears ago when Crump made a similar statement, he said a white woman questioned him on it. In response, he asked her to imagine if George Floyd had been the one to kill Derek Chauvin by kneeling on his neck for more than 9 minutes. Crump then asked the woman what would he be charged with and how much time would be be sentenced to? He also asked what kind of names would have been used to describe Floyd.\n\nThe woman then understood.\n\nAt the press conference, Mitchell's family and loved ones described him as a loving father and a \"big teddy bear.\" Mitchell's mother, Brenda Giles, expressed that she was in so much pain that she didn't know what to say. \"We need peace. I have been unable to sleep, and I can't shed another tear,\" she said. \"We have to get justice.\"\n\nWhat does justice look like?\n\nUnfortunately, we can't bring Mitchell back, but justice means preventing this from happening again. Justice means refraining from putting your body weight on a person who is face down and unable to move. It means the Hyatt releasing all their video from inside the hotel so the family and the public can see what transpired.\n\nWe've been political foes. We're uniting to build trust in Wisconsin elections.\n\nJustice looks like police and security guards having the training not to harm someone or take their life when they are no longer a threat. It also looks like the district attorney's office filing charges against the four men involved in subduing Mitchell and the Hyatt as well. Right now the employees involved have only been suspended. That's not enough.\n\nAnd with the Hyatt being located right across the street from the Baird Center, one of the three key venues for the Republican National Convention next week, justice looks like letting the thousands of people who come to this city know what happened to Mitchell.\n\nIf the Hyatt continues to refuse to release the video, protesters should continue to make their voices heard to shame the hotel into action. If you think this is extreme, watch the video again and tell me how you would feel if this was your loved one begging for help.", "source": {"uri": "jsonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

While parading the suspects, the state\u2019s Commissioner of Police, CP Waheed Ayilara, vowed to rid the state of all criminal elements in his quest to make Akwa Ibom safe for visitors, tourists and investors. The CP, who spoke through the Command\u2019s Public Relations Officer, ASP Timfon John, explained that the suspects were caught in the act and rounded up by operatives who swiftly responded to distress calls. \u201cThe Command received distress calls giving notification of a kidnap incident at Utang Street by Gibbs Street, Uyo. The Command\u2019s Anti-Robbery Squad (ARS) immediately swung into action and mobilised to the scene where four suspects namely; Abdulkarem Yusuf, Yusuf Waziri, Inbinabo Iboroma, and Abdulrahman Abbas, were arrested,\" he said. The state\u2019s police spokesman said preliminary investigations revealed that the suspects had earlier kidnapped one Abraham Ekpe at Ring Road 3, opposite Cemetery. He disclosed that the gang members were arrested at the verge of kidnapping one Richie who is a friend of Ekpe who had already fallen victim to the suspects. \u201cTheir plan was to take them to the Odukpani LGA in the neighbouring Cross River State. Further investigation also revealed that they had demanded a ransom of N5 million from their victim, but he could not pay, prompting them to also kidnap his friend. \"The victims were all rescued successfully and have been reunited with their families,\u201d he explained. According to him, one red Honda Accord car with registration number BJ 615 ABC; one handcuff, one dagger and other items were recovered from the suspects. He added that the suspects will be charged to court upon completion of investigation. The CP, however, reiterated the Command\u2019s unwavering commitment to making Akwa Ibom uninhabitable for criminals. He further admonished members of the public to report any suspicious characters around their neighbourhoods to the police.", "summary": "<img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Police.jpg\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto; margin-bottom: 5px;max-width: 100%;\" link_thumbnail=\"\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" srcset=\"https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Police.jpg 1200w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Police-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Police-1024x683.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" /><p>Akwa Ibom State Police Command has dismantled a four-man kidnap gang and arrested four suspects in military uniforms while setting two victims free from their abductors.

{"id": 231307836, "title": "Man City vs Premier League: 115 charges, new lawsuit and 35 allegations revealed", "text": "Manchester City's bid to sue the Premier League this week will have NO impact on the club\u2019s fight to overturn the 115 charges that continue to leave a strain on the reigning champions. There have been suggestions that City\u2019s case to prove that new Associated Party Transaction Rules that define how top-flight clubs negotiate sponsorship deals are illegal is being driven by a plot to also have the catalogue of serious fraud allegations made against them thrown out. But the legislation, which deems that any sponsorship agreement linked to club owners must be of fair market value, only came into force in December 2021 before being revised again last January. The most serious financial charges levelled against City by the Premier League in February 2023 are alleged to have taken place in the period between 2009 and 2018. Neither case will impact the other. City have claimed since they were charged by UEFA over Financial Fair Play breaches that the \u201cattempt to damage the club\u2019s reputation is clear.\u201d They beat a subsequent two-year Champions League ban after an appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. City insist they also have \u201cirrefutable evidence\u201d to prove that the 115 Premier League charges are spurious. Thirty-five of the allegations relate to non-cooperation with the investigation - an issue that cost the club a \u00a310million fine when a similar charge made by UEFA was upheld by CAS. City felt UEFA could not be trusted to keep confidential information private - and they may now have similar concerns with the Premier League after details from their 165-page legal argument about APT were made public. \u200cThere is a feeling inside the Etihad that this latest wrangle is being viewed as an attempt to avoid having to answer the allegations in front of an independent commission. City believe they have a strong legal argument that proves the APT regulations do not adhere to the law of the land. The fact that two weeks have been set aside for an independent arbitration panel to make a judgement on the matter suggests their case has some merit. City warned in February that they were prepared to take legal action - and it would seem they have had at least one sponsorship deal rejected by the Premier League given they are also seeking damages. Club chairman Khaldoon Al-Mubarek admitted during his annual address to City\u2019s supporters that it is frustrating to have the Premier League case hanging over Pep Guardiola \u2019s team after they had made history by winning a fourth successive title. Khaldoon said: \u201cI can feel for our fanbase, and everyone associated with the club, to have these charges constantly referenced. I think we as a club have to respect there is a process we have to go through - and we\u2019re going through it. \u201cIt\u2019s taken longer than what everyone hoped for, but it is what it is - and I have always repeated, let\u2019s be judged by the facts and not by claims and counter-claims.\u201d Join our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

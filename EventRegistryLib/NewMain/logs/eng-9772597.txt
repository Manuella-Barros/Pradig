The emergency recall, Daily Sun learnt, was initiated by Senate President, Godswill Akpabio in coordination with Speaker of the House of Representatives Tajudeen Abbas and aims to rectify inconsistencies between the versions of the budget passed separately by the Senate and the House.\n\nThe urgency of the situation cannot be overstated. The discrepancies, though described as minor, hold significant implications for the smooth operation of government functions. The discrepancies need to be harmonised to ensure a unified budget is presented, reflecting the legislative intent accurately and preventing any administrative or fiscal confusion. This session will focus on aligning the budget's details and ensuring that the allocations and provisions are consistent across both chambers.\n\nDespite the critical nature of the session, many lawmakers have expressed frustration at the timing. Having just begun their annual recess, several legislators had made personal and professional plans, including travel to their constituencies or international destinations. The recall has disrupted these plans, and there is a sentiment among some members that the session could have been postponed until the planned resumption in September. Nonetheless, the leadership deemed the matter too urgent to wait, underlining the importance of fiscal discipline and timely governance.\n\nThe 2024 budget, a cornerstone document for the nation's economic and social policies, requires meticulous attention to detail. The slight variations between the two chambers' approvals could lead to significant administrative delays or misinterpretations, impacting everything from infrastructure projects to social services. The emergency session is therefore not just a bureaucratic formality but a necessary step to maintain governmental integrity and public trust.\n\nIn addition to the budget harmonization, there are murmurs that the upcoming nationwide protest, scheduled for August 1, 2024, may also come up for discussion during the plenary. While not the primary agenda, the potential impact of the protest on national stability and public safety is a pressing concern. Lawmakers may explore ways to address the root causes of public discontent and consider measures to manage the situation peacefully.\n\nAn internal memo from the Senate Clerk confirmed the emergency session, scheduled for July 31, 2024. The memo, addressed to all senators, read: \"The President of the Senate, Senator Godswill Obot Akpabio, has directed that an emergency plenary sitting of the Senate be convened. Distinguished senators are requested to make all necessary arrangements to attend as issues of national importance will be discussed.\"\n\nThe memo also acknowledged the inconvenience caused by the abrupt recall but emphasized the importance of the session's agenda. The leadership's swift action underscores their commitment to ensuring that the nation's legislative processes are conducted with the utmost precision and accountability.\n\nAs lawmakers reconvene, the nation's eyes will be on the National Assembly, not only to see how they resolve the budgetary issues but also how they address the broader challenges facing the country.

Following your complaints, I approached the president and he has graciously approved the creation of a youth secretariat for the FCT.\"\n\nThe minister also said he had referred to the president the residents' complaint about a Public Complaints Commission appointment, which was held by an FCT youth, but was later taken to Kogi State.\n\nHe stated that the president had assured him that he would look into the matter and make amends.\n\nWike, who addressed the meeting after inspecting a 29-kilometre road construction in Paikon Kore in Kwali Area Council, also said approval had been given for the creation of one additional police station in each of the six area councils in order to improve security.\n\nHe said, \"Security is a critical priority in the renewed hope agenda. One police station each has been approved to be built in each area council.\"\n\nOn the issue of maginalisation, as alleged by the youth of Bwari Area Council, Wike said, \"Nobody likes injustice, that is what informed my policy of spreading amenities. When you are happy, allow your neighbour to be happy too, that is what brings peace.\"\n\nWike urged the youth of Bwari and AMAC not to join the planned nationwide protests, saying, \"An economy that was down for decades cannot be fixed in one year, give us time.\"\n\nMeanwhile, there was intense tension in Abuja yesterday, as fierce-looking soldiers took over some of the roads to forestall breakdown of law during the nationwide protest.\n\nA company of soldiers in armoured personnel vehicles fitted with guns paraded major roads of Bwari Area Council.\n\nThe story was the same at Abuja-Keffi Road, where a roadblock mounted by soldiers for a stop-and-search exercise, early in the morning by Mogadishu Barracks, before AYA Junction, caused a heavy traffic jam that extended to Karu and Nyanyan.\n\nAkpabio Summons Emergency Plenary as Senators, Barau, Kalu, Sani Urge Restraint\n\nAs part of the interventions to try to forestall the proposed protests, President of the Senate, Godswill Akpabio, summoned an emergency plenary of the upper chamber for Wednesday.\n\nThe notice of the sitting was contained in an internal memorandum from Senate Clerk, Mr. Chinedu Akubueze.\n\nThe nemo read, \"Dear Distinguished Senators, the President of the Senate, His Excellency, Senator Godswill Obot Akpabio, GCON, has directed that an emergency plenary sitting of the Senate be convened on Wednesday 31 at 12 noon.\n\n\"Distinguished Senators are requested to make all necessary arrangements to attend as issues of national importance will be discussed.\n\n\"We regret all inconveniences that this interruption of the recess will cause. Thanks for your usual understanding.\"\n\nThe Senate and House of Representatives had on July 23 commenced their recess, which will end on September 17.\n\nDeputy President of the Senate, Senator Jibrin Barau, appealed to organisers of the planned nationwide protest to reconsider their decision and shelve the idea so that the peace in the country would not be disrupted.\n\nBarau, who is the First Deputy Speaker of the ECOWAS Parliament, said Tinubu was making genuine efforts to address the country's challenges.\n\nIn a statement by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Ismail Mudashir, the deputy senate president urged promoters of the demonstrations to give the government more time to implement its programmes and policies as captured in the Renewed Hope Agenda.\n\nSimilarly, Chairman, Senate Committee on Privatisation, Orji Kalu, urged Nigerians to exercise restraint over the proposed nationwide protests.\n\nKalu stated, \"I stand with you, but with peace through conversations and dialogue without going the path of violence to resolve whatever issues we have.\n\n\"This is a great country, and we are not going to bring it down with any act of violence where discourse can win and bring all of us together.\"\n\nChairman of the Senate Committee on Finance, Senator Mohammed Musa, also appealed to his constituents to embrace peace and dialogue instead of participating in the planned national protest against hunger and high cost of living.\n\nMusa, in a statement circulated to his constituents on Sunday, said, \"Nigeria stands at a critical juncture in the light of the call for national protest.\" He urged the organisers and participants \"to embrace peace and dialogue as the paramount instruments for resolving our differences and addressing our grievances\".\n\nIn the statement titled, \"Appeal for Peace and Dialogue in the Face of National Protest,\" Musa expressed the belief that \"Constructive engagement with the government, rather than confrontation, is the most effective means of achieving our objectives and propelling our nation towards stability and prosperity\".\n\nHouse to Reconvene Tomorrow\n\nThe House of Representatives, too, was slated to reconvene on Wednesday over issues of national importance, particularly, the proposed protests.\n\nAccording to a statement by Chairman of House Committee on Media and Publicity, Hon. Akin Rotimi, the directive was issued by Speaker of the House, Hon. Tajudeen Abbas.\n\nRotimi said, \"Honourable members have been duly summoned from their respective constituencies to attend this crucial session. This directive was communicated through an internal memorandum issued by the Clerk of the House, Dr. Yahaya Danzaria, Esq., on Sunday.\n\n\"The House had commenced its annual recess on Tuesday, July 23, 2024. The annual recess provides Honourable Members with the opportunity to engage extensively with their constituencies, ensuring that the legislative process remains attuned to public input.\n\n\"This period also allows for in-depth engagements at the grassroots, facilitating a deeper understanding of the constituents' needs and priorities.\n\n\"It is, however, customary for the House to reconvene from recess to address pressing national issues. The forthcoming session will focus on critical matters requiring immediate legislative attention.\n\n\"Honourable Members are expected to make the necessary arrangements to ensure their presence.\n\n\"Additionally, the reconvening will facilitate a significant engagement with young Nigerians through a town hall meeting hosted by the Speaker of the House, Rt. Hon. Abbas Tajudeen, Ph.D., on Wednesday at the National Assembly.\n\n\"Organised in collaboration with YIAGA Africa and Konrad Adenauer Stiftung (KAS), the town hall will bring together youth leaders, students from tertiary institutions, young professionals, and representatives from various youth organisations and civil society groups.\n\n\"The 10th House of Representatives remains steadfast in its commitment to representing the interests of the Nigerian people and advancing the nation's development.\"\n\nAfenifere Not in Support of Planned Protest\n\nPan Yoruba socio-political organisation, Afenifere, said it did not support the planned protest.\n\nIn a statement issued in Akure yesterday by its national organising secretary, Abagun Omololu, Afenifere alleged that the planned protest had taken on a clear sinister dimension outside the tenets of constructive engagement.\n\nOmololu said the group recognised that Nigerians were experiencing economic challenges and hunger, but contended that many countries were also battling a global economic downturn,\n\nThe statement said, \"Afenifere acknowledges the realities of economic challenges and hunger in the land, while we also cannot deny that there is a global economic downturn ravaging most nations of the world, developed, developing or underdeveloped alike.\n\n\"We, therefore, call on the government at the federal and subnational levels to step up efforts to address these issues with all in their power. It is every citizen's right to protest as a way of headlining their grievances to the government.\"\n\nSani, Diri, Ekiti Govt Plead against Protest\n\nKaduna State Governor, Senator Uba Sani, his counterpart in Bayelsa State, Douye Diri, and the Ekiti State government pleaded against the proposed protest.\n\nAddressing stakeholders at a town hall meeting yesterday in Kaduna, Sani stated, \"in the last few weeks, some faceless groups have been perfecting plans to stage nationwide protests under the guise of demanding for good governance.\"\n\nHe claimed the organisers' strategies and tactics gave cause for worry, stressing, \"People involved in genuine struggle or agitation cannot operate like cultists - there is definitely something sinister about their plans.\"\n\nThe governor, however, admitted that Nigerians were going through economic difficulties.\n\n\"We are grappling with severe economic strains occasioned by years of economic mismanagement, corruption and lack of accountability,\" the governor said.\n\nDiri cautioned youths of Bayelsa State to be wary of failed politicians, who planned to use the protest to disturb the peace of the state.\n\nSpeaking during the 34th state security council meeting in Yenagoa, yesterday, Diri said security reports available to him indicated that politicians that lost the last governorship election in the state were plotting to cause mayhem.\n\nA statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr Daniel Alabrah, quoted the governor as appealing to the youths to avoid being used by such politicians, saying they do not mean well for the state.\n\nEkiti State Government and the police command in the state also appealed to the youth and other stakeholders to shelve the protest and embrace dialogue in the interest of peace.\n\nA stakeholders meeting organised by the Commissioner of Police, Adeniran Akinwale, in Ado-Ekiti, the state capital, ahead of the protest, was attended by many stakeholders, led by traditional rulers, state and local government officials, religious leaders, artisans, road transport workers, youths, students, among others.\n\nGovernor Biodun Oyebanji, who was represented at the meeting by Special Adviser to the governor on Security Matters, Brigadier General Ebenezer Ogundana, appealed to the youths to shun the protest and embrace peace in the interest of the state.\n\nOyebanji acknowledged the economic challenges in the country but explained that the federal and state governments were doing everything possible to address the situation.\n\nWhile calling on the stakeholders to give the government more time to implement its policies and programmes, Oyebanji expressed worry that the protest might be hijacked by criminal elements to unleash violence on the state.\n\nThe police commissioner said the meeting became necessary to engage the stakeholders and take feedback to the appropriate authorities for action.\n\nAkinwale maintained that embracing dialogue by the aggrieved youths and citizens would be in the interest of the state and the country, stating that violent protest would be detrimental to the society.\n\nStop Creating Panic, HURIWA Tells FG\n\nHuman Rights Writers Association of Nigeria (HURIWA) expressed concern over the creation of panic and tension by the federal government and the heads of security agencies in the country.\n\nHURIWA stated that the persistent dissemination of misinformation by government officials aimed at demonising the proposed peaceful demonstrations had contributed to the heightened state of fear, apprehension, and panic among citizens.\n\nIn a statement by its National Coordinator, Comrade Emmanuel Onwubiko, HURIWA said Nigerians expected that government officials ought to play the role of stabilisation as against being agents of misinformation, peddling of false information and unsubstantiated intelligence.\n\nHURIWA urged the federal government and its officials to provide good leadership in the face of the decision by some aggrieved Nigerians to stage peaceful protests against bad governance and unprecedented corruption and hunger in the country.\n\nEnugu CP Alleges Plan to Hijack Protest\n\nCommissioner of Police in Enugu State Command, Kanayo Uzuegbu, warned against acts of violence and breach of public peace by individuals or groups in the name of protest.\n\nUzuegbu said the warning followed intelligence revealing sinister plans by criminal elements to infiltrate and hijack the planned protest, and unleash mayhem on law-abiding citizens and property in the state.\n\nThe police commissioner stated that the intelligence showed that hoodlums, as experienced during the violent EndSARS protests, intended to attack fellow citizens, destroy public and private property, and perpetrate acts of looting.\n\nHe reiterated the collaborative commitment of the police and other security forces to deal decisively with such criminal elements.\n\nOPS Insists on Dialogue, Engagement\n\nThe Organised Private Sector of Nigeria (OPSN), including the Nigerian Association of Chambers of Commerce, Industry Mines and Agriculture (NACCIMA) and Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN), disclosed its stance on the planned nationwide protest, saying it prefers dialogue to confrontation.\n\nIn a statement jointly signed by the organisations, the OPS reiterated the need for dialogue and engagement between the government and concerned citizens.\n\nOther members of the OPS included the Nigeria Employers' Consultative Association (NECA), Nigeria Association of Small and Medium Enterprises (NASME), and Nigerian Association of Small-Scale Industrialists (NASSI).\n\nThe statement read, \"The Organised Private Sector of Nigeria (OPSN) has carefully considered the planned protest by certain citizens in response to current challenges affecting public welfare.\n\n\"As an apolitical umbrella body representing major business membership organisations in Nigeria, the OPSN prioritises the importance of dialogue and engagement between the government and concerned citizens.\n\n\"We firmly believe that open and constructive dialogue is the most effective tool for addressing the nation's challenges and encouraging the desired changes. We urge all parties to embrace this path of dialogue to achieve meaningful and lasting solutions for the benefit of our country.\"\n\nIgboho: Protest Sponsors Working to Disintegrate Nigeria\n\nLeader of Yoruba Nation Movement, Chief Sunday Adeyemi, otherwise known as Sunday Igboho, claimed that the planned protests by \"some unknown and faceless individuals\" was designed to disintegrate the country.\n\nIgboho, in a statement, said, \"Since President Bola Ahmed Tinubu's assumed office on May 29th, 2023, he has implemented revolutionary policies, which his predecessors lacked the political will to pursue.\n\n\"These bold steps have, unsurprisingly, unsettled those who believe it is their birth right to rule Nigeria. And in response, there have been attempts to undermine his administration, particularly on social media, with the aim of creating discord between the government and the people.\n\n\"Recently, we have become aware of notices from unknown individuals threatening '10 days of rage' beginning August 1st, 2024, under the slogan 'Tinubu Must Go!'.\n\n\"While the right to peaceful protest is enshrined in our constitution, it does not extend to calls for an unconstitutional regime change.\n\n\"It is worth noting that during President Buhari's eight-year tenure, there were no such protests for regime change from the South-west, even when our people faced oppression and atrocities by Fulani terrorists. Our protests were focused on protecting our communities, not on destabilising the country.\n\n\"The Yoruba Nation Movement and I firmly declare that we will not participate in any protest aimed at using the South-west as a battleground for political upheaval.\n\n\"We stand resolute in our belief that the Yoruba nation will not be a Launchpad for disintegrating Nigeria. We recognise that economic hardship is a global phenomenon, not unique to Nigeria.\n\n\"Since my release from the unjust detention orchestrated by former President Buhari and his then Attorney General of Federation, Abubakar Malami, I have travelled extensively across Europe, the Middle East, West Africa, and North America.\n\n\"Everywhere, people are facing challenges, and governments are implementing palliatives to alleviate these hardships. In Nigeria, PBAT's government has introduced measures to reduce food prices and increased the minimum wage from \u20a630,000 to \u20a670,000, demonstrating a commitment to improving the lives of the working populace.\n\n\"Let us be clear: the protest is politically motivated. We call on all Yoruba people and well-meaning Nigerians to reject this movement. The Yoruba nation unequivocally opposes any such protests.\n\n\"Like President Buhari, President Tinubu must be allowed to complete his term in office. The path to change lies in democratic processes -- through the ballot box or a referendum. Those who seek change must wait until the next elections in 2027.\"\n\nCSOs Defend Right to Peaceful Assembly\n\nCoalitions of over 40 civil society organisations (CSOs), yesterday, issued statements reaffirming the fundamental right of citizens to peaceful assembly in Nigeria.\n\nAn alliance of 19 CSOs, in a joint statement, emphasised the importance of protecting such cornerstone of democracy by defending the right to peaceful protest.\n\nThey urged the authorities to guarantee the safety and rights of protesters. They also called on the judiciary and National Human Rights Commission to ensure that any subsequent legal proceedings were fair, just, and respectful of human rights.\n\nThe 19 groups, in their statement, titled, \"The Right to Peaceful Protest: A Pillar of Democratic Governance as Constitutionally Guaranteed,\" said, \"In light of recent events and ongoing discussions surrounding the appropriateness of citizens expressing their dissatisfaction with government policies and actions, we, the undersigned civil society organisations, are compelled to reaffirm the fundamental right of citizens to peaceful protest as an essential pillar of democratic governance.\"\n\nSimilarly, a consortium of more than 36 CSOs endorsed the planned protests. They warned that attempts by the authorities to suppress demonstrations through intimidation, excessive use of force, or unjust legal actions would not only be counterproductive and unacceptable but would also resisted.\n\nThe groups stated that protesting was a legitimate form of expression enshrined in international human rights instruments, including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights, and Nigeria's 1999 Constitution (as amended), among others.\n\nA statement jointly signed by Global Rights, Civil Society Legislative Advocacy Centre (CISLAC), 21st Century Community Empowerment for Youth and Women Initiative, Rule of Law and Accountability Advocacy Centre (RULAAC), Yiaga Africa, and 32 others, said protest allowed citizens to publicly voice their concerns.\n\nThey argued that protest further enabled the people to challenge injustice and participate actively in the democratic process.\n\nThe groups said protests served as a vital mechanism for holding leaders accountable and ensuring that the government's actions reflected the will and needs of the people.\n\nShelve Protest, Delta Monarch Begs Youths\n\nThe Ovie of Idjerhe Kingdom in Delta State, His Majesty, King Monday Obukohwo Whiskey, Udurhie 1, appealed to Nigerian youths to suspend the protest.\n\nThe monarch, who acknowledged the difficult economic conditions being protested against by the youth, stated, however, that Nigeria was too fragile for such protest considering the precarious security situation in the country.\n\nThe revered royal father made the appeal, weekend, in a letter addressed to Nigerian youths titled, \"Nationwide Hunger Protest: My Appeal to Nigerian Youths.\"\n\nHe observed that it was the right of Nigerian youths to embark on a peaceful protest, as enshrined in the country's constitution, but expressed fears that such good intention could be hijacked by bad elements to cause unrest across the country.\n\nOhanaeze Youths: No Protest in South-east\n\nThe Youth Wing of Ohanaeze Ndigbo, the apex Igbo socio-cultural organisation, announced that it would not take part in the planned nationwide protest.\n\nAddressing newsmen after consultations with youths across the South-east, yesterday, president of the group, Chukwuma Okparaezeukwu, said the South-east had every reason to protest, ranging from the widespread economic hardship, massive youth unemployment and poor representation in governance.\n\nOkparaezeukwu, however, stated that rather than protest, the youth had decided to engage with the federal government and governors of the South-east on the peculiar challenges of the region, with a view to finding lasting solutions to them.\n\nOkparaezeukwu maintained that while the hunger protest was within the constitutional rights of the people and also justifiable, owing to the current state of affairs of the country, the protest could result in loss of lives and property of Igbo citizens that characterised the EndSARS protest of 2020.\n\nNYCN Demands Subsidies on Food, Others\n\nNational Youth Council of Nigeria (NYCN) called on the federal and state governments to provide subsidies on food commodities as part of efforts to ameliorate the economic hardship faced by Nigerians.\n\nThe national youth body stated that there was need for both the federal and state governments to swing into action to reduce prices of daily consumable goods, like bread, garri, beans, yam, rice, among others, to enable the downtrodden to feed.\n\nNYCN Vice President (North East), Bishop Kanatapwa, made the call while addressing a press conference yesterday in Abuja ahead of the August 1 nationwide protest.\n\nKanatapwa called on government to grant importers of consumable items tax holiday to help reduce prices of daily consumable goods.\n\nThe youth council admitted that Tinubu's initiatives to enhance the national economy and update obsolete systems had substantially raised the cost of living, creating hardships for many, particularly the youth.\n\nAPC Chairmen to Mobilise against Protest\n\nForum of All Progressives Congress (APC) chairmen in the 36 states of the federation vowed to mobilise against anti-government protests scheduled to commence August 1.\n\nThe chairmen said they would embark on solidarity rallies across all political wards, local governments and state capitals, including Abuja, to re-echo the laudable projects and the programmes of Tinubu.\n\nSecretary of the forum, Alphonsus Eba, while addressing a press conference yesterday in Abuja, said though things were tough today, their hope for a better tomorrow was assured through the Renewed Hope policies, programmes and projects being embarked on by the president.\n\nEba, who is Cross Rivers State APC chairman, said while protest was a constitutional right when done through the rule of law, security reports had, however, shown that it was counterproductive to embark on protest at this time, as there were sinister arrangements by some unpatriotic persons to hijack the protest.\n\nPlateau Youths Dissociate from Protest\n\nCoalition of Plateau Communities' Youth Leaders dissociated themselves from the protest, citing ambiguity in the circumstances and motives behind it.\n\nAddressing a press conference in Jos, the youths, led by Mr. Pololis Gyang, said, \"As responsible youth leaders of our respective communities, we are deeply committed to the welfare and well-being of our people.\n\n\"We pursue these objectives with a foundation of equity and reciprocity, aiming for the peace and development of our communities. We recognise the devastating impact of the current hardship, pain, and distress our people are enduring.\n\n\"We cannot feign ignorance or indifference to the motives behind the call for the nationwide protest. We acknowledge the widespread hunger, hardship, and uncertainty regarding the state of our economy.\n\n\"However, the suspicious manner in which the protest is being orchestrated raises significant concerns. We believe that the right to protest is fundamental and inalienable, particularly in seeking better living conditions for our people. Nonetheless, we remain unconvinced by the motives of the organisers.\"\n\nNYSC: We're Taking Necessary Steps to Protect Corps Members\n\nThe National Youth Service Corp (NYSC), yesterday, said it was taking necessary measures to guarantee the safety of all youth corps members ahead of the planned nationwide protest.\n\nThe NYSC position was necessitated by reports that the scheme had circulated memos to the effect that it would punish any corps member that took part in the protest and that it had also suspended the monthly biometrics clearance done by corps members as a result of the impending protest.\n\nDirector, Press and Public Relations (DPPR), Mr. Eddy Megwa, confirmed to THISDAY by telephone that the scheme had taken all the necessary measures to guarantee the lives and safety of corps members.\n\nMegwa stated, \"The life of one youth is worth more than the protest and we are doing everything necessary to guarantee the lives of our youths. You know these youths, we ask them not to travel at night and yet they still travel at night. If you have a younger one who is serving, would you ask the person to join the protest?\"\n\nActionAid Expresses Concern over Alignment against Bad Governance Protest\n\nActionAid Nigeria (AAN) expressed concern over the alignment of many governors, politicians, traditional leaders, public office holders, and some high-net-worth individuals with the government's stance against the planned protest.\n\nANN, in a statement, declared that it stood in solidarity with Nigerian youths as they planned a nationwide protest starting on Thursday, August 1.\n\nThe statement by Country Director of the nongovernmental organisation, Andrew Mamedu, said, \"We firmly support citizens' constitutional rights to peaceful assembly and protest.\n\n\"It is important to reiterate that every Nigerian has the inalienable right to voice their grievances and demand accountability from their government without fear of violence or retribution.\"\n\nAkpata Wants Peaceful Protest\n\nThe candidate of Labour Party (LP) in the forthcoming September 21 governorship poll in Edo State, Mr. Olumide Akpata, urged protesters to exercise their freedom of expression within the ambit of the law.\n\nIn a statement, Akpata called on all stakeholders - protesters, security agencies, government officials, and the general public - to approach the coming days with a sense of patriotism, responsibility, and unwavering commitment to the principles of democracy.\n\nHe said the country should use this moment as an opportunity to strengthen its democratic institutions to address pressing national issues, and move the country towards a more prosperous and equitable future.\n\nPolice Vow to Resist Violent Protest\n\nNigeria Police, yesterday, vowed to resist any form of violent protest in the country, while enumerating the severe negative effects that violent demonstrations can have on society.\n\nA statement by the Inspector General of Police, Kayode Egbetokun, highlighted several critical points that underscored the importance of maintaining peace and order during protests.\n\nSigned by force spokesperson, ACP Olumuyiwa Adejobi, the statement said, \"It is not only in Nigeria that there is hardship. It is a global meltdown. Is the government doing anything about it? Yes! This is what a responsive government will do.\"\n\nEgbetokun stressed that while the current economic challenges were not unique to Nigeria, the government was actively working to mitigate their effect and provide relief to the citizens.\n\nReflecting on the 2020 EndSARS protest, the IGP stated, \"Where police stations were burnt down, criminals took over. Arms looted were in the wrong hands, and armed robbers took over. Women could no longer walk freely once it is 7pm.\"\n\nHe warned that the destruction of police infrastructure led to a breakdown in law and order, leaving communities vulnerable to criminal activities.\n\nThe IGP said, \"There are enough lessons to learn from previous violent protests in Nigeria. I urge citizens to remember the chaos and suffering that followed such events. Serious dangers come with unchecked demonstrations.\"", "source": {"uri": "thisdaylive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "THISDAYLIVE"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

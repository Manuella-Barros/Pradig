The absence of a team name in that last sentence wasn't an oversight as the team, for sponsorship reasons, has had many different names this century. Any one of these names you may recognize at some stage over the years: Mega Leks, Mega Basket, Mega Bemax, Mega Soccerbet, Mega Mozzart, and now its current iteration of Mega MIS of Serbia and the Adriatic League.\n\nMega Basket have provided plenty of talent over the years to the NBA Draft, including Miami's Nikola Jovic, former Bulls selection Marko Simonovic, Goga Bitazde, Los Angeles Clippers center Ivica Zubac, former Hawk Timothe Luwawu-Cabarrot and of course Denver Nuggets MVP Nikola Jokic. Atlanta fans may also remember center Alpha Kaba who was selected with the 60th selection in 2017.\n\nOf the 15 Mega Basket prospects that have been drafted since 2007 (14 since 2014), only three of them have been taken in the first round of the draft, the highest being Bitazde at 18th overall in 2019. This, however, is likely to change dramatically on June 26th when 18-year-old point guard Nikola Topic is likely to hear his name called potentially very early in the 2024 NBA Draft.\n\n...That, however, is twisting the truth slightly.\n\nTopic was only on loan to Mega Basket from KK Crvena Zvezda -- known also as Red Star Belgrade -- to start the season, and he was posting big numbers before his loan was prematurely ended around Christmas and was called up to the Euroleague-competing Red Star.\n\nAt the time, Topic told ESPN, \"My dream for many years has been to play for Red Star. I grew up a fan of this club. It will mean everything for me to play in front of 20,000 Red Star fans. I couldn't say no to playing basketball in the EuroLeague.\n\n\"It's a huge risk, but I'm ready. I'm confident in myself 100%. My father, my agent Misko Raznatovic, and I understand that this move could affect my draft chances if I don't do well. But I'm ready to compete and fight.\"\n\nSadly, however, not long after this move, Topic suffered a left-knee injury and missed the next four months of action to showcase his talent within a Euroleague team, returning to play briefly in May and played just seven games for Red Star in total in an injury-shortened 23 games across all teams and all competitions. Topic re-injured this knee, and it was recently revealed that he has a partial ACL tear.\n\nBetween moving clubs and then his injury, Topic's season is basically split in two: his big numbers and starring role at Mega Basket and his lesser role at Red Star/returning from injury.\n\nAcross all competitions and teams, Topic averaged 14.4 points per game on 49.8% shooting from the field on 10.5 attempts, 30% from three on 3.7 attempts, 87.8% from the free throw line on 3.2 attempts, 5.5 assists, 3.2 rebounds, 0.9 steals, 2.3 turnovers and three personal fouls in 27 minutes of action in 23 games played, per RealGM.\n\nHere's how that differs to his stint at Mega Basket:\n\nInterestingly, the difference in usage between Topic with Mega Basket versus Red Star in the ABA was less than 4% (24.15% to 20.6%).\n\nFor the purpose of this scouting report, most of the footage we'll look at will feature Topic at Mega Basket. It is a great shame he wasn't able to showcase himself more with Red Star and get to go against the top talent in the Euroleague, but Topic's draft stock was, essentially, built on his work with Mega Basket, so that'll be mostly why we look at footage from his stint there.\n\nWith all of that, let's take a look at what Topic showed this season.\n\nTopic averaged 14 points per game on just under 50% shooting from the field and 30% from three-point range. To shoot just under 50% from the field despite shooting 30% from three on over 3.7 three-point attempts per game means that Topic was very efficient from inside the arc. Take away his three-point shooting, Topic shot 60% from the field, or simply put shot 60% from inside the arc.\n\nIt would be as good as place as any to begin when it comes to Topic's offense; he is excellent at getting to the rim and finishing at the rim.\n\nTopic has an excellent turn of speed about him, and he measures this pace excellently at his age.\n\nOn this out-of-bounds play, uses the screen and drives to his left -- demonstrating his comfort with dribbling with his off-hand -- and turbos inside, brings the ball up to avoid the dig, and finishes at the rim with his left hand:\n\nOn this possession, Topic finds a matchup he fancies, takes his time before driving and finishes with the reverse layup:\n\nTopic uses the screen to drive inside and again uses his left hand to finish the play:\n\nTopic is good at taking advantage of the defense not getting sorted quick enough on screens, as Topic gets on the move the defense is already sunk out front. Once inside, Topic evades the shot-blocker and goes to his left hand to finish the play:\n\nTopic is good at reading the road ahead of him before making his decisions. The screen here he sees is creates enough of a margin for Topic to drive into, and he evades the help defense again to score at the rim:\n\nTopic is very good at utilizing the space open to him, as he drives inside after the screen and does well to hang before finishing at the rim:\n\nWhat I really like about that play is that was the first possession in his first game with Red Star; no fear, no reservation surrounding his new teammates, just straight in.\n\nThis next clip cuts late to the play, but Topic receives a screen, whips out a beautiful handle and then bursts to the rim, taking the contact -- no call -- and finishing at the rim:\n\nTopic excels in attacking switches in pick-and-roll situations.\n\nOn the switch here, Topic sizes his man up before shifting gears after freeing up space for himself with the crossover and finishes at the rim, evading the block:\n\nOn another switch, Topic gets the step on his man and drives inside, evading the block and using the glass to finish at the rim:\n\nNot the greatest of help defense, admittedly, but alas...\n\nTopic is dangerous once he gets a head of steam, and in three-quarter/full court/transition situations, or coming off a screen getting downhill, Topic is a threat.\n\nJust before halfcourt, Topic turns the jets on after the screen and he beats the defense to the rim, finishing with his left hand:\n\nComing from his own half, Topic uses the high screen to accelerate inside, moves the defender with the drive and hangs to hit the runner at the rim:\n\nTopic begins this next possession off the ball in transition off of a miss, receives the ball, and turbos to the rim before anyone can catch him:\n\nOff of a reach from his defender in Topic's own half, the young Serbian jets away, gets into the paint and is able to get the shot up before it can be blocked and scores at the rim:\n\nOn a saved possession, Topic gathers the ball, and once he evades the first defender at midcourt, he takes off and whips out a beautiful step move to get between two defenders and then evades a third defender near the rim to score at the rim with the layup:\n\nTopic also helps bolster his scoring tally by getting to the free throw line over three times per contest, most of these coming from being fouled on drives/attempts at the rim.\n\nOn the drive, Topic gets into the crowd and draws the foul and free throws:\n\nOn the switch this time, Topic takes his time before driving inside and he draws the foul and free throws on the bump as he rises to the rim:\n\nHere, a nice spin move from Topic and draws the foul as he makes the upward motion, earning two free throws:\n\nIn an open court scenario, Topic gets inside the paint on the drive, draws another foul on his way up to the rim and gets to the line for two more free throws:\n\nThis next foul Topic draws is earned due to his team being in the bonus, but I enjoyed the savvy move to get it, as Topic wanders into the path of the opposition and takes the contact from behind:\n\nAn NBA-type move this, one we've seen Trae Young do often with the Atlanta Hawks.\n\nMoving onto Topic's three-point shooting, it's not the most efficient shot at the moment -- 30% on 3.7 attempts -- but let's take a look at some of these makes from Topic.\n\nTo start, Topic uses the space afforded by the screen to pull up into the three:\n\nOn the pick-and-roll switch, Topic sets up the opportunity and while the drive is expected. Topic pulls up for three:\n\nThis is a good example of Topic's driving prowess opening up avenues for him to shoot from distance.\n\nWhen he has a matchup he fancies, Topic isn't shy about pulling up from distance, connecting on this three:\n\nTopic initially sees a little more attention on the ball, and when he gets off the ball he promptly has it returned to him -- and he pulls up for three:\n\nThis time Topic gets off the ball and locates to the wing, and when he receives the ball, he rises to connect on the three:\n\nI think the one knock I'd have on Topic's offense is obviously the three-point shooting -- first and foremost -- but I'd love to see Topic develop a better touch on his floater/runner. I think it's the one aspect of his offense inside the arc that's missing:\n\nTopic is enjoyable to watch not just for his scoring ability but for his ability and willingness to spot and make passes/plays to his teammates, averaging 5.5 assists per game.\n\nTopic does a great job of creating opportunities off of his drives to find his teammates for opportunities.\n\nUsing the screen, Topic drives inside and whips a pass to the weakside corner with his left hand for the three-point attempt:\n\nComing off another screen, Topic gets inside and finds his teammate for an assist for three on the short pass:\n\nOn an out-of-bounds play, Topic gives-and-gets the ball back and immediately goes on the attack to drive, and he kicks out to the perimeter and the extra pass opens up the opportunity for three:\n\nAgain, another beautiful find from Topic on the drive to the perimeter where another opportunity is created:\n\nLet's look at a couple of Topic's playmaking in pick-and-roll scenarios very quickly.\n\nHere, Topic squeezes the bounce pass through in the pick-and-roll for the assist:\n\nTopic gets the pass over the top on this screen-and-roll for another assist:\n\nOn this play, Topic is doubled on the screen but is able to find his teammate over the top and he draws the foul and free throws:\n\nTopic is good at getting off the ball when doubled and he's able to find his teammates, this time for three:\n\nThis time, Topic is doubled and finds his teammate in the weakside corner:\n\nThis next section of Topic's assists/playmaking doesn't fall under any one category, and more so plays that are just fun to watch and demonstrate his passing potential and vision.\n\nAgainst the zone defense, Topic waits patiently for the opportunity to unfold in front of him, and he flings a beautiful left-handed pass for the assist:\n\nIn transition, Topic has his head up, scanning and surveying his options and he finds his teammate for a three-point attempt:\n\nOn this possession Topic shows how easy it is for him to find and spot passes, he's barely looking at the play but finds his teammate over the top:\n\nDefensively, it was a little frustrating to watch Topic because Mega Basket did anything they could to hide Topic and always ensured there was an additional body nearby should there be any issues for Topic defensively.\n\nHere's an example; no matter what in this situation there are defenders surrounding Topic, so that even if there's half a turn of Topic being beaten it immediately has to be bailed on as there's another body present:\n\nIn the corner here, when Topic's man gets the turn on him, there's immediately bodies present and the pass has to be made:\n\nAgain, Topic gets on the wrong side. but he has a teammate there to rotate and help make life difficult. But Topic himself was on the wrong side:\n\nTopic finds himself prone to fouls and committed over three per contest.\n\nOn the blow-by, Topic commits the foul:\n\nJust past midcourt, Topic bumps his man out front and commits another foul:\n\nRushing out to contest the three-point shot, Topic commits the foul on the shot, leading to three free throws:\n\nOn the rebound, Topic tries to reach in but commits a foul instead:\n\nAfter a shot goes up, Topic needlessly bumps into the man underneath the rim for the foul:\n\nAll of these types of fouls add up, and Topic has to be more disciplined and he has to be better on the defensive end. Playing within the zone hid his weaknesses, and playing man-to-man may be a recipe for disaster in the NBA.\n\nNikola Topic is an exciting young prospect, especially on the offensive end. At 18 years old (19 in August) he possesses a talent for not only getting inside the lane but also evading the defense and finishing at the rim with both hands -- demonstrating a level of comfort using his off hand, which at this stage isn't common. Topic has a great turn of pace, and he knows how to use it, shifting through the gears and lulling defenses with this change of pace. He excels getting to and finishing at the rim; he's very efficient inside the arc. And on occasions where he can't finish, Topic can get himself to the free throw line often, and he's an efficient pair of hands there too.\n\nIf there were any concerns of Topic's extremely efficient work inside the arc, it'd be that he's not quite got the floater/runner nailed down yet. And I'd like to see him take a few more jumpers off the dribble in the mid-range coming off of pick-and-roll, especially given defenses respect his ability to drive the ball. Another concern would be the quality of opponents Topic went against may allow him opportunities and driving lanes that NBA defenses will not. For this reason, it was a great shame that Topic's injuries prevented him from player more in the Euroleague to test himself against opposition of a much higher quality, as was his hope and desire when he was recalled to Red Star.\n\nTopic's three-point shot isn't quite there yet either, but he certainly wasn't shy in getting his attempts up and this should improve over time; certainly not the worst foundation to build on.\n\nWhen it comes to playmaking, Topic is an unselfish player who is constantly aware of his surroundings. He can not only spot a pass but pick it out too; he has this in his locker. Topic is at his best when he's on the move, driving the ball and kicking it out to the perimeter. In addition, he's good at getting off of doubles and is able to make passes off of screens/in pick-and-roll. His size at 6-foot-6 helps him make some passes over the top of defenses.\n\nHe just has a really good feel for the game and a high basketball IQ.\n\nDefensively, there are concerns to be had. I worry about Topic's defensive ability in a man-to-man defensive setup. Mega Basket's zone did very well to hide him but even if couldn't save Topic from being a very foul prone player -- he has to be more disciplined on defense and learn better defensive principles. I wouldn't exactly say Topic has defensive instincts, nor the wingspan (measured at 6 feet and 5 inches at the Draft Combine) to act on those instincts.\n\nBut the main concern right now is health; a partially torn ACL is a tough manner in which to enter the draft. But Topic is young and he will recover from this injury, and it may be beneficial for a team in a rebuilding phase to select Topic and allow him to take his time rehabbing and aim for another high selection for the more acclaimed 2025 NBA Draft.\n\nThat's my assessment of Nikola Topic, but what do other outlets think/report when it comes to Topic ahead of the 2024 NBA Draft?\n\nSam Vecenie mocks Topic 8th overall to the San Antonio Spurs, with this to add:\n\nIn 13 Adriatic League games for Mega Basket before his transfer to Crvena zvezda, Topi\u0107 averaged 18.6 points and 6.9 assists while shooting 52.4 percent from the field. He's a dynamic ball-screen distributor and consistently lives in the paint in the Adriatic League, which consists of the top teams from the six countries that once made up Yugoslavia. He can execute nearly every pass in the book once he gets a downhill advantage, and hits teammates with flair and creativity. Topi\u0107 also scores proficiently at the rim, using inventive touch to finish high off the glass and around rim protectors.\n\nHowever, Topi\u0107 has suffered two recent sprained knee injuries, causing him to miss most of the 2024 calendar year to this point. His range is wider than expected right now, with a chance he could slip down the board even farther than this.\n\nTopic is attending the June 4-7 pre-draft camp in Treviso, Italy, for prospects excused from the now-mandatory NBA Draft Combine because their overseas seasons had not finished. The medical report teams get from that setting will be vital in determining Topi\u0107's ultimate range. Teams are also trying to wrap their head around basing a lottery grade of him off a 13-game sample.\n\nVecenie brings up a decent point -- ultimately, it is a smaller sample size we're dealing with when it comes to Topic, and even smaller with Red Star.\n\nESPN's Jonathan Givony and Jeremy Woo both believe that Topic would be an ideal selection 12th overall to the Oklahoma City Thunder, fitting a particular role with the pick:\n\nGivony's pick that fills the biggest need: Nikola Topic | Red Star (Serbia) | PG | Age: 18.8\n\nWith a roster flush with talent at every position, it might make sense for the Thunder to consider drafting Topic, who was widely considered a top-5 prospect prior to suffering a knee injury. Oklahoma City can afford to redshirt Topic next season, extend Josh Giddey at a palatable number and then slide a healthy Topic (the two share plenty of similarities) into Giddey's place if they eventually need to move the Australian due to luxury tax concerns.\n\nWoo's pick that gets the best value: Topic\n\nNot only does Topic suit the Thunder's needs well, but he's a solid value for any team if he falls outside the top 10. Even if his partially torn ACL causes him to miss some or all of next season, drafting him now is a long-term value play. There were scouts who viewed him as a top-pick contender early in the season, and particularly if he does wind up sliding like this on draft night, Topic will be an interesting pro career to track in the years to come.\n\nPrior to the confirmation of the ACL injury, there were still concerns from NBA teams about Topic's health, and this may cause him to slide on draft night. In their May 31st mock, Woo projected Topic to be selected 10th overall:\n\nTeams are awaiting Topic's forthcoming medical information, and he will participate in his required portion of the pre-draft process next week in Treviso. He sustained multiple knee injuries this season, returning in April before injuring himself again a few weeks later, and his health status looks likely to impact his place in the lottery hierarchy.\n\nTeams drafting in the top 15 will receive his medicals, in accordance with the NBA's new collective bargaining rules. Utah is among the interested parties in Topic, with Dalton Knecht, Ron Holland and Ja'Kobe Walter among other prospects who are getting looks from the Jazz at No. 10. Topic's size, basketball IQ and playmaking skills make him an intriguing long-term player and a potential value pick should he end up in the back part of the lottery. -- Woo\n\nJonathan Wasserman of Bleacher Report mocks Topic at 15th overall, sliding from 11th in his previous mock as health continues to be a topic (pun intended) of contention among NBA teams:\n\nTeams were informed of Nikola Topi\u0107's torn ACL at the NBA's combine in Treviso, held for those who missed out on Chicago. The diagnosis obviously won't help teams that were previously on the fence.\n\nTeams are still waiting for U.S. doctors to examine Topi\u0107's knee. Some have speculated that he may need surgery. The question is whether that will impact how front offices value the 6'6\" point guard.\n\nAs long as they don't throw red flags at results that hint at long-term vulnerability, a lottery team may be willing to wait for a big playmaker who's had success creating for teammates and attacking in pro leagues overseas.\n\nThe Heat I think would be an ideal place for Topic not just for development, but Miami play a lot of zone defense, and it's a better system for Topic to hide defensively.\n\nElsewhere, Kevin O'Connor of The Ringer also projects Topic at eighth overall to San Antonio, with his assessment, more often not, lines up nicely with many of the things we've already looked at, and then a little more.\n\nSensational scorer in the paint with a deep bag of touch finishes at the rim using either hand from unusual angles.\n\nSlippery driver who uses subtle pace changes, head fakes, and clean footwork to get into the teeth of the defense. If he needs to put his shoulder into bigger opponents to draw contact, he can do that too.\n\nCompounds his at-rim scoring with tasty interior playmaking skills. He loves to absorb contact then make wraparound passes to cutters, or kickouts to shooters from behind the arc.\n\nQuick decision-maker as a playmaker. He often receives the ball then instantly makes a pass to an open man, or in pick-and-rolls he'll toss overhanded hook dimes using either hand to cutters.\n\nA solid bet to figure it out as a shooter considering his soft touch near the rim and his elite free throw percentage.\n\nMINUSES\n\nStiff jump shooter. Defenders often sag off him to give him space to launch when he's spotting up or isolating. He's reluctant to shoot unless he is open, in part due to his low release.\n\nA bit of an upright ball handler. Though he's shifty and changes pace, he's largely a downhill player who hasn't shown much of a midrange game with floaters or pull-ups.\n\nInconsistent defender with intensity that comes and goes. With a lean frame, he may never be more than average, even if his effort improves. But he must improve enough to not be a liability.\n\nAll of the above we've mostly discussed but O'Connor's defensive assessment may be a bit damning, suggesting that Topic may never be more than average, and I think there's a real fear of this. Is the rest enough to forgive those defensive shortcomings?\n\nThe Atlanta Hawks are poised to select first overall, and even in a trade down situation, it's likely Topic doesn't make sense for them. I like the Hawks going for a backup-type of point guard (something the Hawks will likely need if one of Trae Young or Dejounte Murray are being moved) with upside in a few years, but I think the timelines are probably a hair off.\n\nIn any case, whichever team that selects Nikola Topic in the first round is likely to get themselves a steal, given that he's likely to slide down the draft perhaps towards the fringes of the lottery itself.\n\nDefensively, there are concerns, but offensiely there is a lot to like when it comes to Nikola Topic.", "source": {"uri": "peachtreehoops.com",

They acquired the lottery selection via the Houston Rockets. The gifted first-round selection gives OKC a chance to add another young prospect to the youngest first seed in league history.\n\nThe Thunder have one of the best trios in the league with Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Chet Holmgren and Jalen Williams. For the foreseeable future, the draft will now be about filling out the rest of the depth chart around those three players.\n\nOne possibility is Serbia's Nikola Topic. He is a risky prospect who will likely miss next season recovering from a partially torn ACL. Once he returns, he will must be a primary ball-handler and work on his outside shot.\n\nTopic's strengths\n\nTopic started last season with the ABA's Mega MIS. He quickly established himself as one of the best international prospects. The 18-year-old put up monster numbers as a primary ball-handler. He averaged 18.4 points on 52.3% shooting, 7.1 assists and 3.6 rebounds. He shot 25.9% from 3 on 4.5 attempts. He suffered a knee injury in January that cost him four months. His return in April was shortlived as he suffered an ACL tear on the same knee just three games later.\n\nThe playmaking is special for Topic. He's one of the best passers in this year's class. He stands at 6-foot-6, which gives him elite size for a guard. He's a ball-dominant player who can create quality looks for his teammates. He is a creative passer and can locate his teammates with the tiniest windows. He's a pick-and-roll savant. He has great basketball instincts with an elite feel for the game.\n\nHe frequently attacked the basket and drove to the lane for a lot of his buckets. He's willing to absorb contact and be physical despite his skinny frame of 201 pounds. This should help him get to the free-throw line in the NBA. He uses his wingspan to overcome his lack of burst to get creative near the basket and convert layups.\n\nTopic defensively\n\nThe lack of athletic traits will hurt Topic. There's a risk those subpar qualities get worse with his torn ACL. Any speed or jump he had could've been zapped. Even when he was healthy, he was slow-footed. He also won't be a massive dunk threat despite being 6-foot-6.\n\nThis could cause Topic to get targeted on defense. He will struggle against quicker NBA guards and get beaten off the dribble. He can improve his technique and IQ, but his ceiling as a defensive player is minimal due to a lack of physical attributes that can be detrimental in the NBA.\n\nTopic's weaknesses\n\nThe partially torn ACL makes Topic one of the riskier lottery picks. He'll likely redshirt all of next season, which means it'll be one less year to have him on a cheap rookie deal. ACL tears are easier to return from than a decade ago, but there's still some uncertainty. Once he returns, how the knee reacts to playing in the NBA will be a major discussion point. There's just a lot of murkiness involved with the 18-year-old's health.\n\nThe shooting is also a huge question mark. He was a poor shooter this past season. The numbers speak for themselves as he's shot 24.7% from 3 the last three seasons. He shot 66.7% from the free-throw line with Mega, which indicates the shot is a problem. He will need to rework his jumper from scratch, which can be a multi-year process with no guarantees of success.\n\nDue to being a non-shooter, Topic will need to the ball to be a positive contributor. He doesn't have much room to produce as an off-ball threat. Opposing defenses will sag off him in half-court sets due to not being an outside threat. He must join an NBA team that will give him the keys to the franchise to reach his ceiling.\n\nTopic's potential Thunder fit\n\nOn the surface level, Topic would be a steal for the Thunder. If he falls to 12, this means OKC adds a top-five talent because of injury concerns. It can afford to be patient with Topic's rehab process and can afford a redshirt year. They've already done that before with Holmgren's first year.\n\nWith that said though, it'd be an odd fit despite it being a steal of a selection in a vacuum. Topic will need to be a high-usage player to be effective and it's difficult to see a path for that with Gilgeous-Alexander and Williams on the roster. Both are two of the best players in the league and giving up possessions to an 18-year-old long-term project is counterproductive.\n\nIf that's the case, the Thunder can see themselves in a similar situation they were in this past season with Giddey. OKC has this great passer who can be a good playmaker but is instead put in an awkward off-ball role where they try to be an outside threat to no avail. It'd be an effective usage of Topic, who is far away from being a consistent NBA player.\n\nInstead, the 18-year-old is better off with a rebuilding situation where he can be a starter once he returns from his ACL tear. He will need the ball in his hands to be an effective player and the touches aren't there in OKC.\n\nTopic highlights", "source": {"uri": "okcthunderwire.usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "OKC Thunder Wire"}, "authors": [{"uri": "clemente_almanza@okcthunderwire.usatoday.com", "name": "Clemente Almanza", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_cruciate_ligament_injury", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anterior cruciate ligament injury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_City_Thunder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma City Thunder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Williams", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chet_Holmgren", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chet Holmgren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_draft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA draft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KK_Mega_Basket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "KK Mega Basket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shai_Gilgeous-Alexander", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shai Gilgeous-Alexander"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_throw", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Free throw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth_chart", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Depth chart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Rockets", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Houston Rockets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball_positions", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball positions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dribbling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dribbling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Layup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pick_and_roll", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pick and roll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_draft_lottery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA draft lottery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playmaker", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Playmaker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redshirt_(college_sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Redshirt (college sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Giddey", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Josh Giddey"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Lotteries", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Lotteries", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://okcthunderwire.usatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/36/2024/06/1895743743.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9669404", "eventUri": "eng-9669404", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 198, "relevance": 1}

However, this achievement from the 18-year-old was only the start of her journey.\n\nThe Topic family excels in athletics: Angelina's mother, Biljana Topic, a three-time Olympian and Serbian triple jump record holder, narrowly missed a podium finish at the 2009 World Athletics Championships. Angelina's father, Dragutin Topic, a former European high jump champion and Serbian record holder, now coaches her, shaping her path in athletics.\n\n\"My father is my biggest inspiration and he's my best teacher in life, not just for sports - but also for everything I know, I learned from my parents and I'm really grateful for them,\" Topic told Olympics.com.\n\n\"My mum was also an Olympian and she was an amazing top athlete. I'm so happy that I have people who already went through this path. And I think I'm like one step above everyone else because I have so much experience in my mind from them.\"\n\nTopic, who competes in long-jump and also triple jump, first burst onto the scene back in 2022. Following her breakout season, Topic jumped to a silver medal with 1.97 metres at the Memorial Van Damme in Belgium and a bronze at the Meeting du Paris in June 2023.\n\nIn high jump, every centimetre counts, a pencil's width, a kernel of corn, or a ladybug. In May of this Olympic year, Topic claimed two Diamond League titles in Doha and Marrakech, reaching 1.98 meters for a new Serbian national record.\n\nHer 1.98-meter personal best already surpasses the Rio 2016 Olympic gold-winning jump of 1.97 meters. Topic placed 7th at the 2023 World Athletics Championships in Budapest and 5th at the 2024 indoor world championships in Glasgow. She continues to improve, nearing the podium each time.\n\nWith just a few more centimetres, she could break the two-meter threshold, posing a serious challenge for the Paris podium this summer. The current world lead is 2.04 meters by Tokyo 2020 Olympic bronze medalist Yaroslava Mahuchikh, with four others clearing over two metres this year, placing Topic sixth in the rankings.\n\nThe teenager's successes in 2024 have persisted, highlighted by a silver medal at the European Athletics Championships in Rome this week (9 June), where she leaped 1.97 metres to stand just behind podium leader Mahuchikh.\n\n\"The European Championships have a really special place in my heart,\" she continued. \"This is where I got my first senior medal at 17 in Munich two years ago. I'm really happy it's happened here again. I've had an amazing day. I'm really happy. Everything came to the right place in the right time.\"\n\nTopic has evolved significantly since Munich, evident in both her performance and demeanour. Despite her youth, she boasts valuable experience. \"I've been coming to these competitions for about four years now, which has given me a lot of experience,\" said the 18-year-old.\n\n\"Going through tough times at a young age has strengthened my mindset. I'm a different person now than I was two years ago in Munich.\" As she prepares for her Olympic debut, Topic is eager to embrace the moment, \"I'm going to enjoy every moment and soak in the atmosphere, which I know will be incredible. I'm looking forward to making it to the final and experiencing that Olympic stage.\"\n\nHer enthusiasm is infectious. \"I plan to take pictures with everyone I meet!\" she exclaimed.

It is not the ideal start to his NBA career, but Topic has the potential to be the top player in this class.\n\nThe 18-year-old averaged 14.5 points, 5.5 assists, 3.2 rebounds, and 0.9 steals in 27.8 minutes per game playing professionally in Europe. He shot 49.8 percent from the field, but just 30.6 percent on his threes over his 23 contests this season.\n\nTopic is arguably the best passer and playmaker in this class. He could form a dynamic pick-and-roll duo with any big, and Utah offers two starkly different options to choose from in Lauri Markkanen and Walker Kessler. Many believe his jumper will develop into a plus weapon. Topic could be an elite offensive creator and his size gives him defensive potential.\n\nThere are still questions about his overall game. Can Topic improve his jumper? Does he get fully locked in on defense? Taking a shot on his upside makes logical sense, especially for a team in a rebuild. The Jazz must be willing to wait a full year, but the payoff could be the best player in this draft.\n\nNikola Topic falls to 10th in ESPN's latest mock draft\n\nThe Jazz need a pass-first point guard capable of running their offense and creating open looks. Topic won't get the shot to blossom immediately, but he can still be impactful. This fit makes perfect sense, but nobody saw his stock fading. ESPN had him going tenth overall (subscription required), despite missing a full year in their mock draft released one week before draft night.\n\nThe Utah Jazz cannot pass up on the opportunity to add a marquee talent. Nikola Topic proved he can play professional basketball and will continue to improve. The Jazz need a lead ball-handler and shot creator of the present and future. This is the perfect match, assuming the 18-year-old point guard is still on the board when they select on June 26.", "source": {"uri": "thejnotes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The J-Notes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jazz", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jazz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Utah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Utah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danny_Ainge", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Danny Ainge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lauri_Markkanen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lauri Markkanen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Stevens", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brad Stevens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah_Jazz", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Utah Jazz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_Lake_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Salt Lake City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Salt Lake City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Steal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_draft_lottery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA draft lottery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_cruciate_ligament_injury", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anterior cruciate ligament injury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walker_Kessler", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Walker Kessler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pick_and_roll", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pick and roll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Fantasy", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Fantasy", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_3667,h_2062,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/GettyImages/mmsport/123/01j0taenasdsq29bcbqh.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9669404", "eventUri": "eng-9669404", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-26", "textStart": 3012, "textEnd": 3019}], "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

Because it was recently discovered Topic has a partially torn ACL. While that hasn't torpedoed his draft stock, it has caused some slippage. Before, you might find him listed among the top five picks. Now, mock-drafters aren't sure he'll land in the lottery.\n\nTopic's injury will likely delay his debut, but a team willing to wait for him could be handsomely\n\nrewarded. He is a 6-foot-6 playmaker with enough creativity and craft to elicit a comparison from The Ringer's Kevin O'Connor to none other than former Heat guard Goran Dragic. Topic isn't a super athlete or some ball-handling savant, yet he seemingly always gets where he wants.\n\nHe can score from all angles around the basket, consistently create out of pick-and-rolls and slip passes through the narrowest windows. His three-point shot isn't there yet, but his touch says it will be there at some point, especially if he winds up in a developmental program as high quality as the Heat's.\n\nIf Miami can live with the idea of not getting opening-night contributions from its first-round pick, Topic has plenty to offer this team over time.\n\nZach Buckley works as a contributing writer to Inside the Heat.

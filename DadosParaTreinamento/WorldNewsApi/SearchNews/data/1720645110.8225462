Gavin Murray was found guilty of attacking two women by groping their breasts during massage sessions at his clinic following a trial at Edinburgh Sheriff Court earlier this year. The 60-year-old escaped a jail term and was handed a community payback order and was placed on the sex offenders register for 12 months. Following extensive press coverage of the case two further women have come forward and reported Murray for sexually assaulting them as he treated them at his business premises in Dunbar, East Lothian. The former civil engineer was arrested and charged and he appeared back at the capital court on Thursday where he pleaded guilty to the two new sex attacks. Prosecutor Clare Green told the court the first victim contacted Murray for treatment to her neck and back after she had suffered an injury after falling off a horse in October 2022. Murray attended the young woman\u2019s home and after her father had left the room Murray had placed his hands down the front of her towel and \u201crubbed both her breast and nipples\u201d. The fiscal depute said: \u201cThe accused made reference to a piercing she had and said \u2018what do we have here?\u2019 \u201cThe woman felt uncomfortable and vulnerable and after the massage she returned to her room without telling her father.\u201d The second new victim made contact with Murray\u2019s massage business through an advert on Facebook and attended his clinic between January and December 2022. The court heard the therapist, from Dunbar, had also touched the woman inappropriately while he massaged her back and shoulders by sliding his hand onto her breasts. Ms Green said following the appointment Murray had then messaged the woman asking her if she wanted a follow up session but she ignored the request. The court was told following extensive press coverage reporting Murray had been found guilty of sexual assault the two women decided to report what had happened to them in March this year. Sheriff Ian Anderson officially added Murray\u2019s name to the sex offenders register and deferred sentence for social work reports and a restriction of liberty order assessment to next month. Murray was found guilty of sexually assaulting two women by touching their breasts following a two-day trial at the capital\u2019s sheriff court in March this year. Both women described to the court how the massage therapist had groped their breasts during treatment sessions at his clinic in November 2021 and June 2022. One victim told the court she felt \u201cviolated\u201d by the sex assault on her and was so distressed afterwards she suffered panic attacks and was forced to take time off work. The second woman said she had been left \u201cexposed\u201d during the massage session where Murray had \u201cstopped just short of touching my nipples\u201d. Murray was sentenced to 12 months on the sex offenders register and placed under the supervision of the social work department. Sheriff Anderson also imposed a conduct requirement where Murray is banned from massaging anyone apart from his wife and is not allowed to contact both victims.", "summary": "<p>Gavin Murray was found guilty of attacking two women during massage sessions earlier this year</p>", "url": "https://www.edinburghnews.scotsman.com/news/east-lothian-crime-massage-therapist-convicted-of-sexual-assault-pleads-guilty-to-further-charges-4658460", "image": "https://www.edinburghnews.scotsman.com/jpim-static/image/2024/06/08/16/27/Gavin%20Murray%20was%20found%20guilty%20of%20attacking%20two%20women%20during%20massage%20sessions%20earlier%20this%20year.jpg?width=1200&enable=upscale", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 16:49:24", "author": "Alexander Lawrie", "authors": ["Alexander Lawrie"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -1.0}

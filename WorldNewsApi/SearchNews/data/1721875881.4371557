{"id": 239765872, "title": "&#8216;Mr. &#038; Mrs. Smith&#8217; Season 2: Everything We Know So Far Including Official Pushback On A Certain Casting Rumor", "text": "Plot This is a tricky topic. After all, part of the beauty of the Mr. & Mrs. Smith series is the idea that John and Jane Smiths are everywhere, which does bring the end of John Wick 2 to mind. Even more importantly, Glover\u2019s John discovered that there were other Johns and Janes to socialize with when Wagner Moura showed up with Parker Posey in tow. Heck, the first moments of the show dared to unveil these two sexy assassins (Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd and Eiza Gonz\u00e1lez) enjoying some quiet porch time with a little squirrel buddy before they were (probably) wiped off the map: Also, Glover\u2019s John killed a wayward John on that super-high-risk mission in the jungle! So, the series already had a built-in mechanism to anthologize itself with new leading couples for follow-up seasons, but contradiction exists surrounding a recent report, and we gotta hash this out. The first season ended on a cliffhanger with Maya and John\u2019s Jane and John seemingly corned in a panic room with a single bullet and Parker Posey\u2019s Jane waiting outside to kill them after they\u2019d gone rogue. It didn\u2019t look good. Then the second-renewal announcement arrived, and Variety reported word from nameless \u201csources\u201d who \u201csay that Season 1 stars Donald Glover and Maya Erskine are not expected to return to star in Season 2.\u201d No response came from Amazon, Glover, or Erskine, and although it\u2019s tempting to simply take the report at face value, it sounds like a \u201cnot so fast\u201d exists. Showrunner Francesca Sloane did decide to talk about that report to Entertainment Weekly, and in the process, Sloane revealed that she and Donald found the report awfully funny, especially since they cannot respond, or they would \u201cruin\u201d the season cliffhanger: \u201cI was just talking to Donald last night about this and we were laughing, because one of the pieces of press said, \u2018according to our sources,\u2019 and we\u2019re like, \u2018Who are these sources?\u2019 We wrote a cliffhanger, we thought about it long and hard. It was one of the first things that we wrote. Why in the world \u2014 we haven\u2019t said anything \u2014 but why in the world would we ruin a cliffhanger based on a headline?\u201d Exactly. I\u2019d love to see Glover and Erskine again, but you know, I also wouldn\u2019t be mad at a prequel season with Skarsg\u00e5rd and Gonz\u00e1lez\u2019s story. Cast I can only gather that Prime Video/Amazon knows exactly what they are doing with the mixed signals. Maybe Donald and Maya will star, or simply make cameos, or perhaps the show could bring back Michaela Cole or Paul \u201cHot Neighbor\u201d Dano. Stay tuned for updates, which shall surely come.", "summary": "<figure class=\"post-thumbnail\">\n\t\t<img width=\"1024\" height=\"598\" src=\"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/c9d3bf69f76ad148ba1b156f8b3c9753.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=598&amp;crop=1\" class=\"attachment-article-featured size-article-featured\" alt=\"Mr and Mrs Smith\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" srcset=\"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/c9d3bf69f76ad148ba1b156f8b3c9753.jpg 1024w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/c9d3bf69f76ad148ba1b156f8b3c9753.jpg?resize=300,175 300w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/c9d3bf69f76ad148ba1b156f8b3c9753.jpg?resize=704,411 704w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/c9d3bf69f76ad148ba1b156f8b3c9753.jpg?resize=768,449 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) calc(100vw - 20px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 40px), (min-width: 1025px) 1024px, 1024px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"><span class=\"wp-media-credit\">Getty Image</span></figcaption>\t</figure>\n\tA report claimed that Donald Glover and Maya Erskine were dunzo, but Glover push", "url": "https://uproxx.com/tv/mr-mrs-smith-season-2-cast-release-info-glover-erskine-amazon/", "image": "https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/fdcb922b71c16f1723afebabe65a20ff.jpg?w=882", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-23 01:45:07", "author": "Kimberly Ricci", "authors": ["Kimberly Ricci"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.082}

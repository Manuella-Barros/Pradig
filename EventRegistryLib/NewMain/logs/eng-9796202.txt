I visited with [S] Caden [Sterns] this morning and just told him that right now we felt like it was in the best interest of our team.

And with free agent acquisition Brandon Jones working his way back from a hamstring injury, the idea that \"depth\" is the reason for the team cutting Caden Sterns feels like a bit of a stretch, right?\n\nWell, the Broncos have gotten some good looks at players like JL Skinner and Devon Key this offseason.

NFL Network's Tom Pelissero expected Sterns to garner interest on the open market.\n\nThe key for Sterns will be staying on the field, which was an issue in training camp.\n\nSterns is reuniting with former Broncos defensive coordinator Ejiro Evero, who held the same role in Denver in 2022 under former head coach Nathaniel Hackett. The 25-year-old safety recorded 21 total tackles, four pass deflections, and two interceptions that season.\n\nSterns suffered back-to-back season-ending injuries in 2022 and 2023.

Downing-USA TODAY Sports\n\nSome Denver Broncos fans may have been surprised over the team's decision to waive 2021 fifth-round pick Caden Sterns. Although Sterns has missed much of the past two seasons with injuries, fans may have questions about the depth at safety.\n\nAlong with the decision back in March to release veteran Justin Simmons, it's fair to ask how the safety room is going to look and why the Broncos wouldn't give Sterns a chance to prove himself after he was cleared to practice. But the Broncos seem to like the depth players they have at safety, so the thought was that it's better to give Sterns a chance to find another team before final roster decisions are made.\n\nThere was also a chance that a team could agree to trade for Sterns because he must go through the waiver process. While that's not a guarantee, teams lower in waiver priority might be interested. No trade manifested, so the Broncos officially waived him.\n\nAs far as the safety depth goes, the one who likely benefits the most is 2023 sixth-round pick JL Skinner. Considered to be a player in need of more development, Skinner fell down the draft board, when the Broncos tabbed him with the 183rd overall pick.\n\nAnd though Skinner was active for just two games, the second-year pro has caught the attention of his coaches during training camp.\n\n\"He's one of -- not just the only one, but he's one of a handful of these guys -- he's smart,\" head coach Sean Payton said following Monday's practice. \"He really came on in the second half of last season. He came on in the kicking game and we started seeing him on scout team offensively. So he's playing with confidence and he's one of the younger guys that will be pushing. He just has to keep progressing.\"\n\nWhat happens next on the Broncos beat? Don't miss out on any news and analysis! Take a second, sign up for our free newsletter, and get breaking Broncos news delivered to your inbox daily!\n\nVeteran safety and projected starter P.J. Locke had plenty to say about Skinner last week.\n\n\"You can just tell he is just so much more confident,\" Locke said of Skinner. \"He's trusting himself. It's his second year in 'VJ' [DC Vance Joseph]'s system, and that's normally when things start to click. You can just tell. The communication on his part, he's seeing things before they happen. So I'm excited for JL because he can play.\"\n\nWith Sterns departing, Skinner now has his chance to prove that he can provide quality depth. It will be interesting to see how he fares after playing just two games last season.\n\nOther safeties on the roster will get their chance to claim a spot. Omar Brown and Devon Key are among the players who could fill out the depth. Brown is an undrafted rookie and Key has spent most of his time with the Broncos on the practice squad, so both lack experience.\n\nBut if the Broncos have confidence in these players to fill out the depth chart, it's up to the players to demonstrate they are up to the task.

Evero has tried to bring in players who have played in his scheme. Sterns was drafted by Denver in the fifth round of the 2021 NFL draft, following a stellar career at the University of Texas. He enjoyed a solid rookie campaign, but has dealt with injuries over the past two years. He will come to Carolina with a fresh start, and hopes that he can provide depth after the loss of Sam Franklin.\n\nThe Panthers go to New England this week for a Thursday night pre-season matchup versus the New England Patriots.\n\nRelated: Carolina Panthers make multiple roster moves to address tight end and quarterback injuries", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "steven_corder@postandcourier.com", "name": "Steven Corder", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caden_Sterns", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Caden Sterns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Morgan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dan Morgan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Broncos", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denver Broncos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_back", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Defensive back"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ejiro_Evero", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ejiro Evero"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guard_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Guard (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolina_Panthers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carolina Panthers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_coordinator", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Defensive coordinator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Texas_at_Austin", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of Texas at Austin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Anomalies_and_Alternative_Science/Earth_Lights", "label": "dmoz/Science/Anomalies and Alternative Science/Earth Lights", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Recreation_and_Leisure_Studies", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Recreation and Leisure Studies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/custom/image/6903687a-a7dc-11e9-896c-0bef6d6c9301.jpg?resize=600%2C314", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9796202", "eventUri": "eng-9796202", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

Sterns didn't have to wait long to find a new team as the Carolina Panthers claimed him off waivers on Tuesday, giving him a chance to reunite with defensive coordinator Ejiro Evero.\n\nTwo days later, the Panthers have now waived Sterns with a failed physical designation. He will now go on waivers again.\n\nSterns suffered a torn patellar tendon in Week 1 last season and he started training camp on the physically unable to perform list this summer. He passed a physical with the Broncos on July 27 and returned to practice, but Denver eased him back into action.\n\nAfter being waived by the Broncos without an injury designation, Sterns has now been deemed unfit to pass a physical by Carolina. That's not the first time this has happened in the NFL -- different team doctors can have different views on the same players' health.\n\nSterns missed 28 games in Denver from 2022-2023 due to various injuries.

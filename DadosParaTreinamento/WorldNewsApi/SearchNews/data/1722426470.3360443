After two fights broke out last week at another state-run pool, the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation says a police detail before the Dennis F.

NBC10 Boston spoke with one woman who was planning to bring her son to the pool Friday. \"On Google, they said they were open,\" said Sarah, a Worcester resident. \"So unfortunately, we just got let down a little bit.\" The pool is out of service as the DCR works to secure a police detail after recent violence. For now, residents are upset. \"I've been coming here all my life, and it's been safe,\" said resident Deeann Laureyns. \"Now it's not safe. There's a lot going on.\" Laureyns worries about her grandkids' safety, especially after last Thursday, when Worcester police had to break up two separate fights at Bennett Field Pool. A 20-year-old woman was arrested after allegedly pulling out a gun and threatening people. Over the past several years, the DCR has operated under a policy that requires a law enforcement presence at certain agency pools to ensure safety. It's unclear when the Dennis F. Shine Memorial Swimming Pool could reopen.", "summary": "<p>Summer is here, but there&#8217;s one less option to stay cool in Worcester, Massachusetts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After two fights broke out last week at another state-run pool, the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation says a police detail before the Dennis F.

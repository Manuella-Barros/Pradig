{"id": 231440496, "title": "Giorgia Meloni could be EU kingmaker as Italy goes to polls", "text": "Italians cast their ballots on Saturday as Italy became the first key player to vote in the European parliamentary elections, which could lead to far-right leader, Giorgia Meloni, acting as kingmaker. Far-right parties are expected to make gains in the elections, as most countries, including EU heavyweights France and Germany, go to the polls on Sunday. Projected results are expected late on Sunday evening. While an increase in support for the far right is expected, with such parties expected to win a quarter of seats, the centrist mainstream is still forecast to emerge as the main force in the EU parliament. Meloni, who was elected on a platform largely focused on immigration, shared a social media video message on Saturday in which she said her priorities were to \u201cdefend Europe\u2019s borders against illegal immigration (and) protect the real economy and jobs\u201d. Italy, which will hold 76 of the 720 seats in the new parliament, could play a crucial role deciding the balance of power in the bloc. With polls suggesting Meloni\u2019s Brothers of Italy party may gain 27% of the vote \u2013 up from just 6.4% in the 2019 EU elections \u2013 Italy\u2019s prime minister could decide the political fate of the European Commission chief, Ursula von der Leyen, and whether she receives sufficient backing to secure a second term. The question of whether von der Leyen\u2019s European People\u2019s Party (EPP) will agree to work with the far right is likely to prove decisive after the vote: von der Leyen has suggested she is willing for the EPP to collaborate with far-right lawmakers, provided they are pro-EU and not what she describes as \u201cpuppets\u201d of Vladimir Putin. The EU Commission chief has explicitly ruled out working with the French far-right leader Marine Le Pen, whose National Rally (RN) party is also topping the polls in the EU race, or with Germany\u2019s AfD, over this issue. Hungary\u2019s ruling populist Fidesz party is opposed to aiding Kyiv, with the prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, widely regarded as the EU\u2019s most pro-Russian leader. But von der Leyen appears to be more relaxed about working with Meloni and some fellow members of the European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) group. \u201cI\u2019ve been working very well with Giorgia Meloni\u201d, who is \u201cclearly pro-European\u201d, she has said. Underlining the pivotal role Meloni may come to play in the bloc\u2019s arrangement of power, the Italian leader has been courted by Le Pen, who aims to form a rightwing supergroup in the parliament, but also the centre-right von der Leyen. Socialists, liberals and greens, who are concerned that Meloni could demand a dilution of EU climate measures in exchange for support for the EU Commission president, have threatened to oppose von der Leyen\u2019s reappointment if she makes any deals with the far right. Slovakia also went to the polls on Saturday, following an assassination attempt last month on its premier, Robert Fico. Fico\u2019s leftwing populist Smer-SD party, which opposes sending EU arms to Ukraine, appears to have drawn support after the incident.", "summary": "<p>Italian PM courted by far right and centre ground as European parliamentary elections begin</p><p>Italians cast their ballots on Saturday as Italy became the first key player to vote in the European parliamentary elections, which could lead to far-right leader, Giorgia Meloni, acting as kingmaker.</p><p>Far-right parties are expected to make gains in the elections, as most countries, including EU heavyweights France and Germany, go to the polls on Sunday.

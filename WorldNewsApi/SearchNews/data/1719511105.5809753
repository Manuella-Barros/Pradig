All the Trump talk of a hidden vote unseen in the polling was apparently true, whether he intended it to be or not. The next four years are going to fucking suck. All the progress we made the last eight years will be lost, and we\u2019ll be starting from zero. I ask one thing for now: please stop the talk about leaving the country. Conservatives suffered through eight years of Obama and never gave up. So why would you prove yourself weaker than those assholes? We are stronger than they are, because we have the moral high ground. We don\u2019t need to debase ourselves and support an asshole sexual predator. We don\u2019t have to resort to hate and voter suppression to win. Our core voters aren\u2019t dying off; they are growing. Arizona, Georgia, Texas are the future. The Rust Belt is \u2026 waning.", "summary": "<p>Twenty-two years ago, a frustrated and angry me sat down to a computer screen\u2014a Bondi blue iMac (remember <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMac_G3\" target=\"_blank\">those</a>?)\u2014and wrote my first blog post on Daily Kos.

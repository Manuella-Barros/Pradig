Carolina Yesenia Figueroa, a social media star from Hermosillo, Mexico, who goes by Yess online, decided to go to the emergency room after suffering from 'intense' cramps for two days straight. But the online sensation was completely shocked when doctors told her that not only was she expecting, she was actually in the midst of giving birth. Yess explained to NeedToKnow recently that she didn't experience any pregnancy symptoms or develop a baby bump, and that she has always had irregular periods - so she had no idea that she was gearing up to welcome a baby. But just 15 hours after arriving at the hospital, she gave birth to her beloved daughter Renata. 'I began feeling intense cramps, which isn't unusual for me since I've always been irregular,' she explained. 'When my period is about to come, I suffer a lot from cramps. The difference this time was that I had been experiencing cramps for two days and my period hadn't arrived. 'I started to worry. By the third day, the pain was intense. It was early morning, around 4am, I got up and told my parents, \"I can't take it anymore.\"' Yess said her mom and dad convinced her to go to the hospital, where doctors started doing tests. When she told them where her pain was, one of the medical professionals decided to give her an ultrasound scan - and they couldn't believe what they found. 'My belly wasn't big or anything, so when the doctor placed the device on me, she went silent and just stared,' she recalled. 'She said, \"Wait here, I'm going to get another doctor.\" Sure enough, two doctors came, and they did the same thing, just stared at the screen. 'Then they said, \"Let's get another doctor to be sure.\" I'm not lying when I say there were about eight doctors crowded in that small emergency room, some here, some there, all staring at the screen in complete silence.' Yess couldn't see what was on the screen herself; worried, she asked what was going on. That was when a medic told her: 'You're pregnant. And you're very pregnant, your baby is ready to come.' The influencer was stunned. She said: 'It's one thing for them to say, \"You're pregnant,\" you process it, you have nine months to get used to it. 'But for them to say, \"You're pregnant and your baby is ready to come,\" it was a huge shock.' But Yess said she calmed down when she heard her baby's heart beating for the first time. 'I was scared, honestly but hearing those strong heartbeats was what kept me calm,' she gushed. Yess was taken by ambulance to a local maternity unit, where she then gave birth to her daughter. The influencer had what is called a cryptic, or stealth, pregnancy, which occurs when the person doesn't have pregnancy symptoms or mistakes the symptoms for something else. Only about one in 2,500 pregnancies go unnoticed until delivery. Yess recently opened up about the shocking experience with her tens of thousands of TikTok followers in the hopes of helping others. 'I can definitely tell you that sharing this spontaneous story has been helpful for many women who are judged and criticized for supposedly wanting to hide their pregnancy,' she concluded. 'Cryptic pregnancy is real and no one talks about it.", "summary": "Yess Figueroa, from\u00a0Mexico, went to the ER after suffering from 'intense' cramps - and was shocked when doctors told her that not only was she expecting, she was in the midst of giving birth.", "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-13539667/influencer-hospital-stomach-pains-pregnant-labor-carolina-yesenia-figueroa.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490", "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/06/17/20/86233665-0-image-m-272_1718653184949.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-18 00:11:08", "author": "Editor,William McGee", "authors": ["Editor", "William McGee"], "language": "en", "source_country": "GB", "sentiment": -0.478}

In the first few weeks [of the Premier League] I was fourth or fifth, but now I've been top for quite a few weeks, and hopefully I can stay there.\n\n\"I know over the next two weeks the record [for nightly wins] is there to be broken, but whatever happens, I'm still going to the O2.\"\n\nLittler boasts an eight-point lead at the summit following wins in Belfast, Manchester, Liverpool and Aberdeen over the last six weeks.\n\nFour men are vying for the final two spots at London's O2 Arena on Thursday May 23 - Nathan Aspinall, defending champion Michael van Gerwen, Michael Smith and Rob Cross.\n\nGerywn Price and Peter Wright are no longer able to gatecrash the top four, with Price's elimination confirmed after he was forced to withdraw from Night 14 with a back problem.\n\nMeanwhile, Humphries is hoping to receive a special homecoming when the Premier League visits Leeds on Thursday.\n\n\"My mindset hasn't changed. I still want to go out there and win,\" said Humphries, who is set to debut a new walk-on song on Thursday.\n\n\"To win in Leeds would be right up there in terms of my best achievements, but I know I'm through, so I can go out there and play with some freedom.\n\n\"Leeds is a massive part of my life. I love coming to Elland Road to watch the team, and there are lots of the staff from Leeds coming to support me which is amazing.\n\n\"Parading the [World Championship] trophy at Elland Road was one of the greatest moments of my life. I got an amazing reception from the fans, and it's something that will stay with me forever.\n\n\"Hopefully it will be the same tomorrow, but it will test my personality - how can I take the emotion out of it and put in a good performance?\n\n\"For me, the driving factor will be my new walk-on song and the crowd reception. Once I get that I'll be fully focused on winning, because I want to experience that crowd reaction three times tomorrow night.\"\n\nJust two weeks of the regular season remain, with both of them to be held in Yorkshire, first in Leeds on Thursday May 9, then Sheffield on Thursday May 16.\n\nWright will play Littler in the quarter-finals for the next two weeks - they are guaranteed to be eighth and first respectively in the table come Night 16 - so he could also dent the teenager's hopes of finishing top.\n\nAspinall and Smith will lock horns in a clash that could have major implications in the race for the play-offs.\n\nSmith closed to within three points of Aspinall following a semi-final showing in Aberdeen, after the Stockport star succumbed to Littler at the quarter-final stage.\n\nHowever, Aspinall has won both meetings with Smith in this year's Premier League, including a 6-4 victory over the 2023 World Champion in Rotterdam's Night 12 final.\n\nAspinall also edged out Smith in a deciding-leg tie on Night Four, but the St Helens star heads to Leeds buoyed from ending his 11-month wait for a PDC title at Players Championship 9 on Monday.\n\n\"It's in my own hands now, I finally got my name back in that winner's circle again in Germany and I was over the moon, because it's been hard,\" said Smith.\n\n\"I'm only two points behind Michael [van Gerwen] and three behind Nathan [Aspinall], and I'm feeling good. There are some signs that my form is coming back.\n\n\"I've got Nathan this week, and then potentially Michael or Nathan next week, so it's in my own hands. If I can win my first match and make the final on both nights, it's down to them.\"\n\nWatch Premier League Darts on Sky Sports with Finals Night on Thursday May 23 without a contract through NOW.\n\nIt's one of the biggest sporting events in a generation.

and it would be Humphries that would finish top as he was won five nights to Littler's four.\n\nLittler and Humphries can both end on 36 points should Littler lose in the quarter-finals of the last two evenings - and Humphries secures a win in Leeds or Sheffield and finish runner-up in the other, Littler will finish in top spot on match wins.\n\nCurrently, Nathan Aspinall and Michael van Gerwen occupy the final two places in the top four, but Michael Smith and Rob Cross remain in with a chance to claim a spot.\n\nThe Asp takes on Smith in the quarter-finals of Night 15 in Leeds, so if Aspinall beats Bully Boy and then wins in the semi-finals, Smith would not be able to catch him.\n\nAt the same time, the quarter-final in Leeds gives Smith the chance to close the gap on the Asp.\n\nVan Gerwen holds an advantage over his Premier League rivals if players end on the same number of points as he holds four nightly wins - only Aspinall can replicate that, should he win the final two nights.\n\nCross is an outsider with him likely needing to win in Leeds and Sheffield to stand a chance of a play off place.\n\nNight 16 in Sheffield will be an intriguing spectacle as the matches for the finale are determined by league position as the play-off race concludes.", "source": {"uri": "thesun.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "connor_greaves@thesun.co.uk", "name": "Connor Greaves", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League_Darts", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Premier League Darts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Humphries", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Luke Humphries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leeds", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Leeds"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Leeds"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BDO_World_Darts_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "BDO World Darts Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darts", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Darts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheffield", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sheffield"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sheffield"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_Aspinall", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nathan Aspinall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Smith_(darts_player)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michael Smith (darts player)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yorkshire", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yorkshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Yorkshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_van_Gerwen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael van Gerwen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Cross_(darts_player)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rob Cross (darts player)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cue_Sports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cue Sports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Darts/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Darts/Organizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cue_Sports/Pool", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cue Sports/Pool", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cue_Sports/English_Billiards", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cue Sports/English Billiards", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Arsenal-news-2024-05-08T174231.096.jpg?strip=all&quality=100&w=1920&h=1080&crop=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9552481", "eventUri": "eng-9552481", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5137254901960784, "wgt": 201, "relevance": 1}

To play here will be an amazing thing for me to do.\n\n\"It meant a lot [to take the World Championship trophy on the pitch]. I think it's up there with one of the greatest moments in my life.\n\n\"When I won the World Championship, I was thinking about it the next day and I couldn't wait to do it.\n\n\"The amazing reception I got from the fans was something I didn't expect to be honest and it's something that will stay with me for the rest of my life.\"\n\nHumphries secured his place in the forthcoming Play-Offs after last week's visit to Aberdeen, and takes on Rob Cross in his opening tie on Thursday, as he targets a fourth nightly win of the 2024 Premier League season.\n\n\"There could have been a lot on the line and I thought the crowd might be the ones to get me into the Play-Offs, but I've qualified now which is great,\" Humphries added.\n\n\"I'm looking forward to it, I know I'm safe and I can go out there and play with some freedom.\n\n\"I want to get as many points as I can in the next two weeks but we're in a really hard sport, and as much as the pressure's not on me, I still want to go out and win.\n\n\"To win in Leeds would be right up there with my best darting achievements.\"\n\nHumphries will wear a specially-designed shirt in Leeds' white, blue and yellow colours on Thursday as he takes to the stage in front of 11,000 fans at the First Direct Arena.\n\n\"My shirt supplier is a Leeds fan and I let him have a tinker around on something a bit retro, from the 1980s,\" he revealed.\n\n\"I didn't want to go too much into looking like a football shirt, I wanted to have a vibe of Leeds and be a darts shirt as well.\"\n\nHumphries will be aiming to take glory in the Premier League's Play-Offs on May 23 at The O2 in London - and is then hoping he can cheer his football side to promotion in the Championship Play-Off final three days later at Wembley.\n\n\"I was hoping that only one of us were going to be in the Play-Offs but unfortunately both of us are,\" continued the World Champion.\n\n\"I'm hoping I can go on and win the Premier League and Leeds can go into the Premier League, but the Play-Offs are really tough - we've never got through them yet.\n\n\"If we can recapture the form of January-February time, I think we stand a good chance.\"\n\nThe

Only two nights of regular season action remain and time is running out in the battle to reach the playoffs.\n\nLuke Littler and Luke Humphries are already assured of their place at London's O2 Arena while Peter Wright and Gerwyn Price have been eliminated from the competition.\n\nNathan Aspinall, Michael Smith, Michael van Gerwen and Rob Cross are left to fight it out for the remaining two spots and Thursday night's action in Leeds could prove crucial in the race for the top four.\n\nVan Gerwen's playoff place is under serious pressure and MVG hasn't been the dominant Premier League force we have become accustomed to.\n\nHowever, the Dutchman averaged 108.33 in a 6-5 defeat to Rob Cross in Aberdeen last week and that suggests Mighty Mike is playing well enough to beat Price.\n\nThe Iceman withdrew from the trip to Scotland last week and there are clear concerns about the Welshman's fitness and form. It's been a miserable Premier League campaign for Price and Van Gerwen looks a strong bet to heap more misery on the Iceman.\n\nLittler Can Make Light Work Of Struggling Wright\n\nThe O2 awaits Littler, who sits at the top of the Premier League table and is a whopping 32 points clear of the eliminated Wright. The Nuke has won 14 of his last 16 league matches and the 17-year-old is developing into the most consistent performer in the competition.\n\nIt's a tough ask for any arrowsmith to keep tabs on the phenomenal talents of Littler and there doesn't appear much hope for Wright, who has lost five Premier League quarter-finals on the bounce.\n\nSnakebite is a two-time world champion, but there has been little sign of that form this year and the Scot could be heading for another heavy defeat in Leeds.\n\nMaximums Look Key For Red-Hot Humphries\n\nCross must beat Humphries to have any hope of making the playoffs, but pressure and tension can contribute to some bad darts being thrown.\n\nIn contrast, Cool Hand Luke can relax knowing that his place at the O2 Arena is secured and the Newbury arrowsmith cracked in four maximums when losing 6-5 to Voltage in Aberdeen last week.\n\nHumphries has hit 16 180's in his last five league matches and he looks good value to get at least four more against Wright in Leeds.\n\nSmith Set To Silence The Asp\n\nApsinall and Smith round off the Leeds quarter-finals and it could prove a pivotal match in the race for the top four. An Asp victory would almost certainly seal the Stockport arrowsmith's place at the O2 Arena, while at the same time it would end Smith's chances.\n\nHowever, Bully Boy took down a Players Championship event in Germany earlier this week and the St Helens man looks in good enough form to keep his finals night hopes alive.\n\ntalkSPORT BET welcome offer - Get \u00a315 in free bets*\n\nOdds correct at time of writing and subject to change\n\n18+ New customers only.

They give me tickets whenever I want to go to Elland Road, there's definitely no problem returning the favour.\"\n\nLeicester and Ipswich fans have taunted Leeds for wobbling in the race for automatic promotion.\n\nBut Humphries dismissed that, adding: \"I don't think they bottled it to be honest. It's just a really tough league.\n\n\"I can't remember the stats but 90 points would have got automatic promotion in some years.\n\nThe boys did really well and now they've got a second bite at the cherry.\n\n\"If they can perform how they did at the start of this year, they should be going back up.

Ipswich deserve it, they've done fantastic.\"\n\nRather like the Championship promotion race, the Premier League season has seen red-hot form in stages for Humphries, Michael van Gerwen and Luke Littler.\n\nHumphries has dipped recently but added: \"I'm not worried. When you are playing every week you will have patches of form which come and go. You won't be brilliant the whole time.\n\n\"Michael had his good patch at the start, I had mine in the middle and then Luke had his form at the back end. That's what can happen.\n\n\"Luke and I have done enough to get through and that's what is important. You've got to peak at the right time. If I was on form now and fell away for the O2, that wouldn't be good.\n\n\"I know if I can find my peak again I can be a force to go on and win the Premier League.\"", "source": {"uri": "thesun.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Sun"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leeds", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Leeds"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Leeds"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Humphries", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Luke Humphries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leeds_United_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Leeds United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Direct_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "First Direct Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_O2", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The O2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elland_Road", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Elland Road"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Cross_(darts_player)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rob Cross (darts player)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Predict_a_Riot", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "I Predict a Riot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmaker_(gambling)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bookmaker (gambling)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaiser_Chiefs", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kaiser Chiefs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BET", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "BET"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EFL_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "EFL Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_van_Gerwen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael van Gerwen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ipswich", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ipswich"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ipswich"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leicester", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Leicester"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Leicester"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southampton", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Southampton"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Southampton"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/ah-OFF-PLATFORM-luke-humphries.jpg?strip=all&quality=100&w=1920&h=1080&crop=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9552481", "eventUri": "eng-9552481", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-23", "textStart": 2052, "textEnd": 2058}], "sentiment": 0.388235294117647, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

It will be the first time Humphries, a lifelong United supporter, has played in Leeds.\n\nHumphries' most recent visit to the city saw him parade the World Championship trophy at Elland Road in January during United's win over Preston, where he received a huge reception. The world number one returned to Elland Road ahead of Thursday's event and admitted he is delighted to finally toe the oche in Leeds.\n\n\"It has felt like a long time coming, it has been 15 long weeks,\" said Humphries. \"It was the one night on the calendar I couldn't wait to play in. Leeds is a massive part of my life, I love coming to Elland Road to watch the team and it's an incredible city. To play here will be an amazing thing for me to do.\"\n\nRecalling his visit to Elland Road days after winning the world title, Humphries said: \"It meant a lot [to take the trophy on to the pitch]. I think it's up there with one of the greatest moments in my life.\n\n\"When I won the world title, I was thinking about it the next day and I couldn't wait to do it. The amazing reception I got from the fans was something I didn't expect, to be honest and it's something that will stay with me for the rest of my life.\"\n\nHumphries, who has already qualified for the Premier League play-offs, will face former world champion Rob Cross in his opening tie in front of 11,000 fans on Thursday, wearing a specially-designed shirt in United's white, blue and yellow colours.\n\n\"To win in Leeds would be right up there with my darting achievements,\" he insisted. \"My shirt supplier is a Leeds fan and I let him have a tinker around on something a bit retro, from the 1980s. I didn't want to go too much into looking like a football shirt, I wanted to have a vibe of Leeds and be a darts shirt as well.\"\n\nHumphries aims to take glory in the Premier League's play-offs on May 23 at The O2 in London and is dreaming of then cheering his football side to promotion in the Championship play-off final three days later at Wembley. \"I was hoping only one of us were going to be in the play-offs and unfortunately both of us are,\" he added.\n\n\"I'm hoping I can go on and win the Premier League and Leeds can go into the Premier League.

Minister [for Strategic Industries of Ukraine, Oleksandr Kamyshin], and all of you, thank you for being here. I know how difficult it is and dangerous it is for you to travel, especially these days when the attacks of Russia against Ukraine continue.\n\nRussia's forces are putting a lot of pressure on the Ukrainian lines in the Donbas, bringing destruction, escalating its attacks against railway infrastructure, energy grids. They are targeting mainly energy systems, dams and now also gas storages. All of that is critical to Ukrainian defence.\n\nCities like Kharkiv and Odesa - beautiful cities that I visited a few months ago - are constantly shelled [with] ballistic missiles and drones. Putin wants to bomb the inhabitants in order to [drive] them out. And, as you know, every day, civilians die or get injured in Ukraine.\n\nIt happens because Ukraine lacks air defence and artillery ammunition. We have to increase our capacities to deliver the military aid that we promised.\n\nThe decisions to support Ukraine, as much as the postponement of the implementation of these decisions, have consequences - now and tomorrow, for Ukraine and for us.\n\nThis should guide our strategic thinking. We should be strategic in thinking [about] what are the challenges that Ukraine is facing. It is a matter of responsibility for the Europeans.\n\nOur ability to deliver - more and quicker - missiles, artillery ammunition and [anti-]aircraft systems more massively and quickly to Ukraine is a matter of life and death for thousands of Ukrainian civilians and their military personnel.\n\nIt is [also] our security which is at stake.\n\nYes, the military aid passed by the US Congress is much needed. That is positive news, but we have to do our part. We have to do our part.\n\nI know that several initiatives by EU Member States are underway. The US military assistance will come - they have lost six months - but we have to do our part.\n\nThis war, with the groundbreaking role of 21 century technology like drones - drones destroying the most advanced tanks - is revolutionising the warfare. And we have learned a lot from the Ukrainians in this regard.\n\nI was in Ukraine last February and I visited one of the more than 200 Ukrainian drone producers. I saw how \"necessity powers innovation\". Drones and electronic warfare \"Made in Ukraine\" could become world leaders. They have been reacting because they have their needs there. So, yes, necessity powers innovation. Ukraine is a clear example of that.\n\nWe've gathered [at] this Forum, and we should leave this Forum with concrete proposals to support these Ukrainian producers and innovators.\n\nThe cooperation we want to inspire today must indeed go both ways. Europe's defence ecosystem has a lot to offer, but also, has a lot to learn from Ukraine.\n\nWe need to step up structurally our industrial defence capacities. This is key in a long war of attrition like this one.\n\nThis is why, when presenting recently the first European Defence Industrial Strategy, we proposed to start immediately working on the integration of Ukrainian defence companies into the European Union's defence industrial ecosystem.\n\nWe have to integrate the Ukrainian defence capacity, from the industrial point of view, with ours.\n\nIn concrete terms, this means particularly to promote joint procurement between European and Ukrainian defence industries.\n\nThere is a lot of capacity in Ukraine, [but] they need funding.\n\nThat is why this Forum gathers us today. It should serve to identify concrete opportunities for joint initiatives between Ukrainian and European companies, boosting Ukrainian industrial production, helping Ukraine to rearm, and funding it.\n\nWe do not start from zero. A lot of cooperation is already happening. Several European companies recently entered into [joint] ventures in Ukraine. Often to move repair and maintenance closer to the front, but also to produce artillery ammunition.\n\nYes, some things have been done already. We do not start from scratch, but we need to go further.\n\nWe [will] open a new EU Innovation Office in Kyiv later this year to facilitate matchmaking between Ukrainian start-ups and [European Union] defence companies.\n\nWe associated the European Defence Agency to this Hub in the field of autonomous systems for military logistics.\n\nBut I repeat: financing is key in all these efforts.\n\nWe just established a new Ukraine Assistance Fund - with an envelope of \u20ac5 billion within the European Peace Facility.\n\nAnd once EU Member States have agreed on using the revenues stemming from Russia's immobilised assets, these resources will be channelled towards Ukraine, to address their pressing military needs and directly to the Ukrainian defence industry.\n\nThis is my firm intention. This money has to be channelled to Ukraine in order to make the Ukrainians able to produce by themselves, in their territory, close to their needs - saving transportation costs and [avoiding] delays.\n\nWe have to be more creative in exploring new ways of delivering military assistance to Ukraine.\n\nDenmark has shown the example, starting the path of directly investing in the Ukrainian defence industry. This is the way to go. Purchasing equipment from Ukrainian companies or from European and Ukrainian joint ventures established in Ukraine, is an option that we will explore together with the Member States.\n\nYes, like nearly everything else in this war, innovation and audacity are essential to prevail. If the military equipment that Ukraine needs can be rapidly produced by the Ukrainian defence industry, I say let's buy from them. Let's help them produce at home. And let's provide the financial capacity to buy this production.\n\nThis is a common endeavour. Our industrial cooperation should be a core element of our cooperation. So, let's work together today. You are more than 140 firms, coming from 25 different states.\n\nEverybody here knows what is at stake. Let's not lose time, and get out of here with concrete proposals, concrete matching between one side and the other, the big alliance between the Europeans and Ukrainians.\n\nThe purpose is to make Ukraine able to resist the invasion by boosting their industrial capacity, using what they already have, increasing it by funding it and by buying their production. Technology on one side, and financial capabilities on the other side have to be together, in order to make Ukrainians able to have the military capacities to resist.\n\nIt is their existence [which is at stake], but it is also ours.", "source": {"uri": "eeas.europa.eu", "dataType": "news", "title": "Europa"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artillery", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artillery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammunition", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ammunition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oleksandr_Kamyshin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oleksandr Kamyshin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odesa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Odesa"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donbas", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donbas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kharkiv", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kharkiv"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kharkiv"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballistic_missile", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ballistic missile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-aircraft_warfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anti-aircraft warfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecosystem", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ecosystem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missile", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Missile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_state_of_the_European_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Member state of the European Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attrition_warfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Attrition warfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arms_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arms industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tank", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electronics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyiv", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kyiv"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Defence_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "European Defence Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_logistics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Military logistics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Foreign_and_Security_Policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Common Foreign and Security Policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Airship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Cracking", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Cracking", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 70}], "image": "https://www.eeas.europa.eu/themes/custom/eeas_website/img/eu-flag.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542326", "eventUri": "eng-9542326", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0980392156862745, "wgt": 195, "relevance": 1}

We save transportation costs, and we produce immediately right where the production is needed.\n\nThis is the third time this meeting takes place. It was first in Ukraine, second in the United States, [and] now here in Europe. And the result should be engaging and integrating the Ukrainian defence industry inside the ecosystem of the European defence capacities.\n\nWe have to produce more. We have to produce quicker. We have the funding of the European Peace Facility, and inside the European Peace Facility we have [the] Ukrainian [Assistance] Fund. So, let's see what they can do together, how they can integrate their capacities, how we can increase the capacities of the Ukrainian industry.\n\nQ. Taking into account that Russia is targeting the defence industry. How is it possible to protect those production sites and do you see any fears going around among European producers to go to Ukraine?\n\nWell, that is why we called them to come, I cannot tell you before the conference takes place. But there are 140 companies coming so they see an opportunity. Certainly, Ukraine is a country at war and Russia is targeting the industrial capacities. We have to provide capacities to defend and capacities to increase production. Here we are talking about the second part: who is going to produce more in Ukraine, linking the Ukrainian defence industry with the European defence industry. More than 140 firms are here, I suppose they came because they are interested in that.\n\nQ. What are the main challenges for you in terms of looking for funding for those projects?\n\nThe challenges are not for me. The challenges are for the industry themselves. We have industrial capacity in Europe, we have funding, we have opportunities to look for partners in Ukraine. And this is what the conference is about, and you will have to wait for the end, in order to know which are the deliveries.\n\nThe difficulties are clear. Ukraine is a country at war. It is not just producing in normal conditions. That is why the industry has to understand that, first, there is an opportunity; second, there is a risk; third, there is funding. Putting the three things together, to share technology. For example, you are very good at producing drones, maybe we have to learn from you. But we have capacities that could be implemented in Ukraine. We produce in Europe, but we should be able to produce in your territory - as I said - in order to save costs, to reduce delivery times and to be closer to your needs.

The goal is to weigh the capabilities of Ukrainian industry and European industry, to look at the possibilities of using European funding to produce more and faster. If possible, directly in Ukraine. It is important that this production is carried out in Ukraine, by Ukrainian companies, with European support. We will save on transportation and we will produce right where these products are needed,\" Borrell said.\n\nHe reminded that this is the third such event to discuss the development of the Ukrainian defence industry. The first forum was held in Ukraine and the second in the US. Borrell hopes that the forum in Brussels will result in an assessment of opportunities to finance Ukrainian defence production using the Peace Fund, which has a special fund to support Ukraine.\n\nPriority task for the development of the Ukrainian defence industry\n\nIn addition, the task for the representatives of 140 companies is not only to deploy industrial capabilities in Ukraine to increase defence production, but also to ensure their reliable protection. This is the primary task, after which it will be possible to talk about the second component of the process - who will produce more in Ukraine and how to strengthen the link between the Ukrainian defence industry and the European defence industry.\n\n\"Ukraine is a country at war, it does not produce in normal conditions. That is why industry representatives must understand that, firstly, these are new opportunities, secondly, there is a risk, and thirdly, there is funding. All three things come together to share technologies. For example, you have good drone production, and the EU should probably learn from you. But we have capabilities that can be deployed in Ukraine. We are already producing in Europe, but we need to be able to produce on your territory to reduce the cost (of transportation), reduce the delivery time and better respond to your needs,\" the EU official said.", "source": {"uri": "censor.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "\u0426\u0435\u043d\u0437\u043e\u0440.\u041d\u0415\u0422"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josep_Borrell", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Josep Borrell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arms_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arms industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union\u2013Ukraine_relations", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "European Union\u2013Ukraine relations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukrinform", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ukrinform"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Representative_of_the_Union_for_Foreign_Affairs_and_Security_Policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brussels", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brussels"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brussels"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Food_and_Related_Products", "label": "dmoz/Business/Food and Related Products", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Defense", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Defense", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Defense_Ministries", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Defense Ministries", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Industrial_Goods_and_Services/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Industrial Goods and Services/Associations", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Associations", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://images.cnscdn.com/e/7/7/7/e7777e2c6d4fc739ea02dd9c4ee2e2fb/630x331.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542326", "eventUri": "eng-9542326", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

Since then, he has been the family's main breadwinner.\n\nTo support Ukraine from across the border, he makes donations and buys Starlink satellite-internet kits in Europe for volunteers back in his homeland. Although he is guilt-stricken living abroad, he feels joining the army would not help the war effort.\n\n\"If the army could guarantee that my work would be aligned with my skills and knowledge, I would go back. I could help with drones and other technology. But getting a rifle and shooting would not be the most efficient way of utilising my skills,\" said the 35-year-old, who requested to withhold his last name.\n\nHe has lived abroad since 2015, long before Russia's war began. During that time, he also became a father; his daughter is now six.\n\nLast month, Ukraine decided to suspend consular services for military-age Ukrainian men in a bid to boost its struggling army. Those who left before and after the war began will be affected by the move.\n\nAccording to the new law, from May 18, men aged between 18 and 60 living abroad will not be able to access key services unless they update their data in their local conscription centres in Ukraine.\n\nFor most of these men, getting a new passport, marriage certificate or driver's licence would ultimately mean abandoning their adopted country for the foreseeable future, as those eligible for military service cannot leave wartime Ukraine.\n\nAnton*, 19, left Ukraine after the war began. He lives in Poland with his 41-year-old father and 18-year-old brother. If they stayed in Ukraine, all three would likely be sent to fight.\n\n\"I support individual battalions in Ukraine with donations every month - this is my duty,\" said Anton, who works as a waiter.\n\n\"But I don't want to fight, as I don't trust our government. They don't care about people. And they don't care if there's a war going on, they're corrupt and keep stealing the money that we pay for the army. Why go to war for a state who only wants to steal?\" he said bitterly.\n\nThe exceptions include men with disabilities, fathers of three or more children under the age of 18, and single fathers - conditions which do not apply to most of the tens of thousands of Ukrainian men who have been living abroad since the beginning of the war.\n\nAccording to Eurostat data, approximately 650,000 refugee men of conscription age have been living in the European Union, Switzerland, Norway, or Lichtenstein since the beginning of the invasion. It is unclear how many of them left Ukraine legally and how many paid bribes. This number does not include men who left before the war.\n\nA BBC investigation late last year reported that 20,000 men had dodged the draft by fleeing \"illegally\" into neighbouring countries.\n\nSince the law was announced, crowds of Ukrainian men have rushed to collect their documents at Ukrainian consulates across Poland before the deadline.\n\nThere were frantic scenes at a Warsaw consulate last month when consular staff said no papers would be handed out that day. Citing an unspecified system error, it was impossible to produce passports, they said.\n\nIn footage of the incident that has circulated online, a mother of a 16-year-old was filmed losing her temper.\n\n\"Give us the documents back and go to Ukraine to fight yourself,\" she is seen telling a female consulate employee, raising her voice in despair. \"I paid for the passport, give me my son's document or return the money.\"\n\nAs the fight against Russian forces rages on for a third year, tensions between the government in Kyiv and the Ukrainian diaspora have risen.\n\nIn a new bill on mobilisation, Ukraine had planned measures allowing men who had served for 36 months to return from the front. But the idea failed as Ukraine suffers manpower shortages, angering tired troops.\n\n\"How it looks like now: a man of conscription age went abroad, showed his state that he does not care about its survival, and then comes and wants to receive services from this state. It does not work this way. Our country is at war,\" Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine's foreign minister, wrote on X, promising the new rules will be \"fair\".\n\nWladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz, Poland's defence minister, welcomed Kyiv's move, suggesting some were suspicious of Ukrainian men in Poland.\n\n\"I know what raises questions and sometimes even frustration among Poles,\" Kosiniak-Kamysz said. \"This is a situation when they see young Ukrainians of military age in shopping malls or hotels, at a time when there is an urgent need for new recruits to join the Ukrainian army.\"\n\nWhile Ukraine's need to supply the army with new soldiers may be justified, Ukrainians living abroad say they were not consulted.\n\n\"The diaspora for years has felt disregarded and even treated with contempt by the Ukrainian authorities. All their efforts to support Ukraine in the war against Russia, [including] fundraisers, have gone almost unnoticed,\" said Olena Babakova, a Poland-based Ukrainian migration expert and lecturer at Vistula University.\n\n\"Now, the decision has been communicated chaotically and post factum. [It is] as if the Ukrainian government did it viciously on purpose to show the diaspora that their fate can turn, too.\"\n\nShe said that there are no mechanisms that would allow Poland and other European countries to return Ukrainian men avoiding conscription. Since they are legally considered refugees fleeing war, it is also unlikely that such a measure would be developed in future, she said.\n\nThe new rules for obtaining documents are unlikely to bring Ukrainian men home, but could make their lives in Europe more difficult. They may also widen the gap between those who stayed in Ukraine and those who left.\n\n\"Ukrainian society is tired and there is a growing expectation that different groups will share the burden of war,\" said Babakova. \"People search for justice. And Ukrainians abroad have become the object of this search to pay the price.\"\n\nSome in Kyiv also rejected the government's decision.\n\n\"These imbeciles are doing everything they can so that hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians will not return home,\" said Lyudmila, who lives in the Ukrainian capital. Her 24-year-old son, Andrii, is a university student in Germany who is now technically considered a draft dodger.\n\nShe withheld their last names fearing ostracism.\n\nAndrii is about to graduate and will be eligible for military service.\n\nIn 2016, when he had an obligatory medical evaluation at high school. he was considered \"fit for military service with limitations\".\n\nHe now has to undergo a new medical evaluation only in Ukraine, but his mother is afraid authorities would not allow him to return to Germany.\n\n\"They made sure my child is never coming back. We'll only see him in Europe,\" she said.", "source": {"uri": "aljazeera.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Al Jazeera Online"}, "authors": [{"uri": "agnieszka_pikulicka_wilczewska@aljazeera.com",

It is important that the production could be done in Ukraine by Ukrainian firms, supported by EU firms. We save transportation costs, and we produce immediately right where the production is needed,\" Borrell said.\n\nHe noted that this is the third such event for the development of the Ukrainian defense industry. The first such forum was held in Ukraine, the second meeting was held in the United States, and the third one is hosted by Brussels. The result of the Brussels forum should be engaging and integrating the Ukrainian defense industry inside the ecosystem of the European defense capacities.\n\n\"We have to produce more. We have to produce quicker. We have the funding of the European Peace Facility, and inside the European Peace Facility we have [the] Ukrainian [Assistance] Fund. So, let's see what they can do together, how they can integrate their capacities, how we can increase the capacities of the Ukrainian industry,\" Borrell said.\n\nHe added that representatives of the 140 companies that came to the forum are aware that Ukraine is at war and that Russian invaders are trying to attack the country's defense capabilities. Therefore, the task is not only the deployment of industrial capabilities in Ukraine to increase defense production, but also the provision of capabilities for their reliable protection. This is a priority task, and once it is fulfilled it will be possible to talk about the second component of the process - who exactly will produce more in Ukraine and how to strengthen the link between the Ukrainian and European defense industries.\n\n\"Ukraine is a country at war. It is not just producing in normal conditions. That is why the industry has to understand that, first, there is an opportunity; second, there is a risk; third, there is funding. Putting the three things together, to share technology. For example, you are very good at producing drones, maybe we have to learn from you. But we have capacities that could be implemented in Ukraine. We produce in Europe, but we should be able to produce in your territory - as I said - in order to save costs, to reduce delivery times and to be closer to your needs,\" Borrell said.\n\nThe EU-Ukraine Defense Industries Forum is taking place in Brussels on May 6. The event brought together more than 350 participants, including representatives of government organizations and European businesses. The main goal of the event is the further support and integration of the Ukrainian defense industry into the European defense industry to immediately meet Ukraine's needs in armaments and military equipment and increase the capabilities of European defense production.", "source": {"uri": "ukrinform.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Ukrinform-EN"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josep_Borrell", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Josep Borrell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brussels", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brussels"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brussels"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union\u2013Ukraine_relations", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "European Union\u2013Ukraine relations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Foreign_and_Security_Policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Common Foreign and Security Policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukrinform", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ukrinform"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Representative_of_the_Union_for_Foreign_Affairs_and_Security_Policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arms_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arms industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russian language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://www.ukrinform.net/img/img_none.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542326", "eventUri": "eng-9542326", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-06", "textStart": 2740, "textEnd": 2745}], "sentiment": 0.3647058823529412, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

He reiterated the idea he first floated in February of sending soldiers to Ukraine, saying: \"I'm not ruling anything out, because we are facing someone who is not ruling anything out.\" Macron's comments come amid reports of an upsurge in draft dodgers in Ukraine. They are frightened because their government has launched a crackdown on men avoiding the draft.\n\nThe phenomenon of Ukraine's draft dodgers has been the theme of the Western media for several months. In November last year it was reported that as many as 650,000 Ukrainians of military age have left the country since the war began. \"Some men paid up to $10,000 for a certificate confirming their unfitness for military service,\" explained the BBC, which said the huge numbers of draft dodgers \"is a serious problem for Ukraine.\"\n\nIf Ukrainians aren't willing to defend their country then why should France or any other NATO country?\n\nThe New York Times quoted Lieutenant Vladyslav Tonkoshtan, whose job it is to prevent Ukrainian men skipping the country. \"We cannot judge these people,\" said Tonkoshtan. \"But if all men leave, who will defend Ukraine?\"\n\nBut they are being judged. Mykhailo Podolyak, a senior advisor to Zelensky, declared at the start of this year: \"Everyone must determine for themselves the price they are willing to pay. To either live in a prison camp or in a free country.\"\n\nYou could understand why young Americans dodged the draft in the 1960s to avoid being sent to Vietnam, a war on the other side of the world in which their country wasn't threatened. But Ukraine has been invaded. Its survival is at stake.\n\nWhen Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, there were approximately 250,000 men and women in uniform, a figure that rapidly soared to 880,000 and now stands at an estimated 1 million. The average age of Ukraine's combat soldier is forty-three (in World War Two it was twenty-six) and so the focus of Zelensky's team now is on the younger generation.\n\nBut there appears to be a general reluctance \"to do their bit.\" One young Ukrainian, Artem, a twenty-eight-year-old from Kyiv, told Politico: \"I'm young and want to live my life, and to go there [the front] without knowing when I will return to my normal life is hard.\"\n\nWhen Macron first mooted the idea of sending soldiers to Ukraine in February, he was roundly condemned by his domestic opponents. Olivier Faure, secretary of the Socialist Party, accused the president of conveying a \"worrying lightness\" on a subject of such gravity; Marine Le Pen said Macron was \"playing the part of the warlord, but it's our children's lives he's talking about so carelessly.\"\n\nThis point cannot be avoided by Macron. Imagine the reaction in France, or any other NATO country, if their soldiers are sent to fight for a country whose own young men are too feckless to take up arms against their invader.\n\nThis may explain why in recent weeks Ukraine has started to address the issue of draft dodging. At the start of April, Zelensky finally signed a bill lowering the mobilization age from twenty-seven to twenty-five. He had prevaricated over the legislation for nearly a year because he was aware it was a contentious issue. The bill that he did sign into law had been subjected to nearly 4,500 amendments.\n\nAnother measure signed into law was the establishment of a digital database of men of military age, a move designed to enable the authorities to track those who have fled the country. The law requires all Ukrainian men of fighting age to present themselves at a draft office to update their papers, remotely or in person within sixty days. The law takes effect on May 18 and until that date Ukraine has suspended all consular services to military-age men. Additionally, twenty-seven new recruitment centers will be opened in cities across Ukraine, allowing volunteers to select the unit in which they serve.\n\nUkraine's foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba posted a message on Twitter/X saying: \"Our country is at war... Staying abroad does not relieve a citizen of his or her duties to the homeland.\"\n\nSome human rights groups in Ukraine have criticized the new measures. Oleksandr Pavlichenko, executive director of the Ukrainian Helsinki Human Rights Union, described the lowering of the mobilization age to twenty-five as a violation of individual rights. \"It's just an emotional step, not a legal one,\" he said. \"It will not bring the results.\"\n\nComments such as those undermine Macron's declarations that Europe is in mortal danger. If Ukrainians aren't willing to defend their country then why should France or any other NATO country send their soldiers? \"I think that many Poles are outraged when they see young Ukrainians in hotels and caf\u00e9s and then hear about how much we're doing to help Ukraine,\" said Polish defense minister W\u0142adys\u0142aw Kosiniak-Kamysz recently.\n\nThere are an estimated 200,000 Ukrainian men in Poland, and the government has said it will cooperate with Ukraine to return them. Lithuania has said it will also repatriate Ukrainians of fighting age.\n\nA recent biography of Zelensky revealed that the president prefers Charlie Chaplin to Winston Churchill.

The French president said that Russia cannot be allowed to win its war with Ukraine. He reiterated the idea he first floated in February of sending soldiers to Ukraine, saying: 'I'm not ruling anything out, because we are facing someone who is not ruling anything out.' Macron's comments come amid reports of an upsurge in draft dodgers in Ukraine. They are frightened because their government has launched a crackdown on men avoiding the draft.\n\nThe phenomenon of Ukraine's draft dodgers has been the theme of the Western media for several months. In November last year it was reported that as many as 650,000 Ukrainians of military age have left the country since the war began. 'Some men paid up to $10,000 (\u00a38,000) for a certificate confirming their unfitness for military service,' explained the BBC, which said the huge numbers of draft dodgers 'is a serious problem for Ukraine'.\n\nThe New York Times quoted Lt. Vladyslav Tonkoshtan, whose job it is to prevent Ukrainian men skipping the country. 'We cannot judge these people,' said Tonkoshtan. 'But if all men leave, who will defend Ukraine?'\n\nBut they are being judged. Mykhailo Podolyak, a senior adviser to Zelenskyy, declared at the start of this year: 'Everyone must determine for themselves the price they are willing to pay. To either live in a prison camp or in a free country.'\n\nOne could understand why young Americans dodged the draft in the 1960s to avoid being sent to Vietnam, a war on the other side of the world in which their country wasn't threatened. But Ukraine has been invaded. Its survival is at stake.\n\nWhen Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, there were approximately 250,000 men and women in uniform, a figure that rapidly soared to 880,000 and now stands at an estimated one million. The average age of Ukraine's combat soldier is 43 (in the Second World War it was 26) and so the focus of Zelensky's team now is on the younger generation.\n\nBut there appears to be a general reluctance 'to do their bit'. One young Ukrainian, Artem, a 28-year-old from Kiev, told Politico: 'I'm young and want to live my life, and to go there [the front] without knowing when I will return to my normal life is hard.'\n\nWhen Macron first mooted the idea of sending soldiers to Ukraine in February, he was roundly condemned by his domestic opponents. Olivier Faure, secretary of the Socialist party, accused the president of conveying a 'worrying lightness' on a subject of such gravity; Marine Le Pen said Macron was 'playing the part of the warlord, but it's our children's lives he's talking about so carelessly'.\n\nThis point cannot be avoided by Macron. Imagine the reaction in France, or any other Nato country, if their soldiers are sent to fight for a country whose own young men are too feckless to take up arms against their invader.\n\nThis may explain why in recent weeks Ukraine has started to address the issue of draft dodging. At the start of April, Zelensky finally signed a bill lowering the mobilisation age from 27 to 25. He had prevaricated over the legislation for nearly a year because he was aware it was a contentious issue. The bill that he did sign into law had been subjected to nearly 4,500 amendments.\n\nAnother measure signed into law was the establishment of a digital database of men of military age, a move designed to enable the authorities to track those who have fled the country. The law requires all Ukrainian men of fighting age to present themselves at a draft office to update their papers, remotely or in person within 60 days. The law takes effect on 18 May and until that date Ukraine has suspended all consular services to military age men. Additionally, 27 new recruitment centres will be opened in cities across Ukraine, allowing volunteers to select the unit in which they serve.\n\nUkraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba posted a message on Twitter saying: 'Our country is at war... Staying abroad does not relieve a citizen of his or her duties to the homeland.'\n\nSome human rights groups in Ukraine have criticised the new measures. Oleksandr Pavlichenko, executive director of the Ukrainian Helsinki Human Rights Union, described the lowering of the mobilisation age to 25 as a violation of individual rights. 'It's just an emotional step, not a legal one,' he said. 'It will not bring the results.'\n\nComments such as those undermine Macron's declarations that Europe is in mortal danger. If Ukrainians aren't willing to defend their country then why should France or any other Nato country send their soldiers? 'I think that many Poles are outraged when they see young Ukrainians in hotels and cafes and then hear about how much we're doing to help Ukraine,' said Polish Defence Minister W\u0142adys\u0142aw Kosiniak-Kamysz recently.\n\nThere are an estimated 200,000 Ukrainian men in Poland, and the government has said it will cooperate with Ukraine to return them. Lithuania has said it will also repatriate Ukrainians of fighting age.\n\nA recent biography of Zelensky revealed that the president prefers Charlie Chaplin to Winston Churchill.

While the urge to boost the fatigued Ukrainian military is understandable, the results of the new law might not have the impact the Ukrainian government hopes it will. While I understand the country's desperate needs right now, I don't think this policy will be effective in boosting our fortunes in the war.\n\nIn mid-April, the Ukrainian parliament passed a new mobilization bill stating that all men aged between 18 to 60 must provide their personal data to military recruitment centres, and there's some skepticism that the online portal will be up and running soon. At the end of April, Ukrainian consulates around the world temporarily stopped providing services to military-age male citizens. They are not accepting applications for passport renewal or new passports, nor are they assisting with getting other documents, such as marriage certificates. Consulates will resume service to these men after the mobilization law comes into effect on May 18, but only for those with military registration documents.\n\nAt the same time, government officials decided that men aged 18 to 60 have to pick up their new passports in person in Ukraine. The exceptions include men with disabilities, guardians of people with disabilities, or military personnel who are being treated abroad. Men who go to Ukraine to get their passports might not be allowed to leave. And after being examined by a military medical commission and receiving confirmation of health, the men will receive military training and be sent to the front. However, Ukrainians living abroad who don't renew their passports may not be able to travel and could face difficulties renewing temporary immigration permits in their new countries of residence.\n\nThese moves are being framed as an issue of justice, given the exhaustion that current soldiers are feeling as the war drags on. \"This is fair to the men who stayed in Ukraine,\" said Dmytro Kuleba, the country's Foreign Minister. But while the new rules may play well to a domestic audience, they will do little to boost military manpower. Ukrainians living abroad who are opposed to fighting are unlikely to be lured back, in particular those who were already in other countries before the war started and children who are coming of age abroad. Instead, many may choose to cut ties with Ukraine entirely.\n\nThe rules are causing serious worries for many Ukrainians living abroad who are upset about being denied government services. Some are pointing out that the Ukrainian constitution guarantees care and protection to citizens abroad.\n\nIn 2014, Anna Ryzhenko and her 18-year-old son Volodymyr fled their native Donetsk, and they now live in Kilwinning, Scotland. But Volodymyr's passport expires next summer, and Ms. Ryzhenko worries they will have to spend money to fly back to Ukraine, where they have nowhere to stay. \"Our home is in Donetsk, which is still occupied,\" she told me. \"How will an 18-year-old boy live in Ukraine? Where and how will he work, how will he rent an apartment?\"\n\nAfter the announcement of the consular restrictions, Poland and Lithuania initially expressed their willingness to help Ukraine bring the men home, perhaps by requiring men to show their passports before receiving public services. However, other countries, such as Estonia, have said they won't expel Ukrainians with expired passports.\n\nWithin Ukraine, opinions range on the issue. Some support the return of Ukrainian men through the restrictions, while others say Ukraine should open its borders and allow men who are avoiding the war to leave and support the country financially instead. In 2023 alone, Ukrainians abroad sent more than $15-billion in remittances to those in the country.\n\nThe Kremlin is watching the tensions growing within Ukraine and in the diaspora, and is likely rubbing its hands with glee. Russia has a much larger pool of recruits to draw from, but we should hope that in our current era, wars are decided by more than just the numbers of soldiers that can be pushed onto the battlefield. Winning the war against Vladimir Putin is essential for all democracies. More than just manpower, Ukraine needs more robust and consistent military and financial support from abroad to change the trajectory of the war.", "source": {"uri": "theglobeandmail.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Globe and Mail"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passport", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Passport"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consulate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Consulate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exile", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Exile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verkhovna_Rada", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Verkhovna Rada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Disability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armed_Forces_of_Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Armed Forces of Ukraine"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dmytro_Kuleba", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dmytro Kuleba"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_for_Foreign_Affairs_(Germany)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minister for Foreign Affairs (Germany)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donetsk", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donetsk"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Donetsk"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diaspora", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Diaspora"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consul_(representative)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Consul (representative)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Constitution of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow_Kremlin", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Moscow Kremlin"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithuania", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lithuania"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Lithuania"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remittance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Remittance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Poland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Poland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estonia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Estonia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Estonia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Dating", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Dating", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://www.theglobeandmail.com/resizer/v2/CDFZNY6UJJHCXLQ7XK2GVICBUI.jpg?auth=5618c027297502d37f913ca5714467afae6d89f86259ea1c1a91cbc87314db00&width=560&quality=80", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542326", "eventUri": "eng-9542326", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-18", "textStart": 1218, "textEnd": 1224}], "sentiment": -0.08235294117647063, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

Here's the text of his speech:\n\n\"Dear ladies and gentlemen, esteemed representatives, ambassadors, ministers, industry delegates. First and foremost, I want to express my gratitude to each and every one of you, to your countries -- to all who have stood with us for 803 days already. Without you, we would have never been able to endure for so long. Thank you.\n\nI am pleased to meet with you at this historic event -- the first Ukraine-EU Defense Industries Forum, which is also the third multinational international forum on defense industries co-organized by Ukraine.\n\nTwo months ago, the European Commission presented the first-ever European Defense Industrial Strategy. The strategy not only emphasizes that closer cooperation between Ukraine's defense industry and the EU will be part of the EU's security obligations to Ukraine, but also recognizes the Ukrainian industry as an important component of the pan-European industry. This recognition is extremely significant.\n\nThis means that Ukraine's future is linked to the European Union. By developing the Ukrainian defense industry, we strengthen our joint capabilities. Strengthening Ukraine's defense industry means strengthening the defense of the entire Europe.\n\nUkraine is fighting for its freedom and independence, resisting Russia's unprovoked aggression. This aggression is an attack not only on Ukraine but on the entire free world, founded on the principles of order, democracy, and human rights, especially in Europe. The EU and its member states, along with the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, Norway, and other allies, stand together with Ukraine against this brutal aggression.\n\nUkraine is immensely grateful for all the support provided by the EU and its member states. But over the past year, we have also significantly strengthened our own capabilities -- and we aim to continue developing them in cooperation with our allies.\n\nThe war against Russia, like other global conflicts, shows that no country can have sufficient defense-industrial potential to meet all its needs independently in such situations. Collective security is crucial for the ability of any free nation to defend its freedom and independence.\n\nNext month, Switzerland will host the Global Peace Summit, where the Ukrainian Peace Formula will be discussed. The main goal of this formula is to unite the global community to force Russia into peace and ensure a fair end to the war in Ukraine.\n\nThis initiative is of crucial importance not only for Ukrainians but for the whole world -- as a precedent. We are accustomed to perceiving peace as a given, as a constant, but the reality is different -- we see armed conflicts erupting around the world.\n\nWe must actively strive for a peaceful life. The Ukrainian Peace Formula aims to unite all countries against war, to create an effective mechanism to counter any acts of military aggression in the future.\n\nA strong and united defense industry is a vital element of this mechanism. Not only Russia but also other aggressor countries must understand that their actions will not go unpunished. That's why freedom must be armed better than tyranny.\n\nWe see ourselves as members of the European family. Starting the EU accession process, we consider our defense industry an integral part of the EU defense-industrial base, contributing to the collective security of EU member states.\n\nUkrainian defense industry has much to offer European partners. We are proud of our powerful industrial base with 500 companies employing 300,000 people, demonstrating remarkable resilience in the face of aggression.\n\nToday, representatives of 38 companies from Ukraine are present here. Including the CEO of Ukroboronprom, who oversees approximately 70 plants, representatives of private defense industry associations, and other companies from Ukraine.\n\nAddressing European defense industry companies, I urge you to engage more with Ukrainian companies. See what they produce, explain to them how it works in your countries, and find what you can do together.\n\nTo Ukrainian companies, I say, do not hesitate. Engage with your European colleagues. Show what you do in Ukraine. Find ways to do it together. I am convinced that such cooperation will strengthen both sides.\n\nThe Ukrainian defense industry is growing rapidly. Last year, arms and military equipment production tripled. This year, twice as many contracts have already been concluded compared to the previous year. But with your support, we can achieve even more.\n\nThe gap between the capabilities of our defense industry and the funds available for procurement amounts to $10 billion this year alone. We invite our partner countries to help bridge this gap by concluding direct contracts with Ukrainian companies. This support is crucial for both the Ukrainian Armed Forces and the Ukrainian economy.\n\nWe have named this initiative \"ZBROYARI: Manufacturing Freedom.\" It is a global fundraising project, and we call on all our partner countries to support the Ukrainian defense industry right now, not only through long-term partnership programs but also through urgent decisions, such as direct contracts for the production of more weapons.\n\nTwo weeks ago, Denmark became the first country to join the \"ZBROYARI: Manufacturing Freedom\" initiative. Denmark will procure weapons for the Ukrainian defense forces from Ukrainian manufacturers -- and we are immensely grateful to the Danish people for this support.", "source": {"uri": "odessa-journal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "odessa-journal.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arms_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arms industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_state_of_the_European_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Member state of the European Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Collective security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Independence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multinational_corporation", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Multinational corporation"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Commission", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "European Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brussels", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brussels"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brussels"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russian invasion of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Human rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Norway"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Norway"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economy of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manufacturing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enlargement_of_the_European_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Enlargement of the European Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armed_Forces_of_Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Armed Forces of Ukraine"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 74}], "image": "http://odessa-journal.com/storage/uploads/news/19716/19716.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542326", "eventUri": "eng-9542326", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-06", "textStart": 122, "textEnd": 129}], "sentiment": 0.2862745098039217, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

It is 9:20 a.m. and unrest floats around at number 185 Num\u00e0ncia Street, where around twenty people are waiting for the Ukrainian consulate to open.\n\nThe new military recruitment law, approved by Kyiv on April 11, has fallen like a blow on the nearly 300,000 Ukrainians residing in Spain, two thirds of them displaced by the war.\n\nIn a desperate attempt to add soldiers, Ukraine is tightening the screws on men of combat age, inside and outside the country. For those who live abroad, consular services will stop if they do not return to comply with military requirements. For practical purposes, it means that their passport will not be renewed nor will they be able to process any document.\n\n\"Like North Korea,\" Alex muses. 31 years old, he is from Kharkiv, one of the cities most martyred by Russian missiles, although he is quick to emphasize that he marched seven years ago, \"when there was no war and it was not even known that there would be war.\" In Spain, things are going reasonably well for him: he is dedicated to electronic music and organizing events, and among his projects is setting up an S.L.\n\nDreams that are in the air. The ticking is marked by your passport, which expires at the end of the year. He has gone to the consulate to try to renew it before the law comes into force on May 23, but they do not process applications until that date. And then, he says with a scathing smile, he already knows what they will tell him: he will have to return to Ukraine and appear at a recruitment office if he wants a new passport.\n\n\"They take away my freedom,\" he despairs. Father of two children, born in Spain, he is clear that he will not go to war. \"I don't understand why I have to die for Ukraine. It hasn't given me anything. Everything I have has been given to me by Spain. I don't have anyone there anymore, my family is away, we sold the house a long time ago. And besides, how can someone like me be useful on the front? \"I have never held a gun in my life, they will kill me for sure.\"\n\nAlex stresses that his opinion on the Russian invasion has not changed, and that he helps by sending money. \"Putin is a son of a bitch. But this war started for freedom. This is supposed to be about Ukraine's right to enter the EU, NATO. All these years talking about this, to end up doing like Russia, taking away the freedom of citizens. Is that why so many people are dying?\n\nLong demanded by the Ukrainian army, the law was also a requirement of NATO. Its secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, avoided openly applauding its approval, but said: \"I trust that Ukraine will make the necessary decisions to mobilize the necessary number of men, and we will do our part when it comes to material.\"\n\nUkraine has lowered the mandatory age to serve in the army from 27 to 25, a measure that President Volodymyr Zelensky, with declining popularity, has taken ten months to sign. His government is under strong pressure, with protests from soldiers' families because the new law does not include the return of soldiers who have been fighting for two years without rotation.\n\nIn this context, those who have fled and been able to escape are an easy target: \"Staying abroad does not exempt a citizen from his duties to the Homeland. That is why yesterday I ordered measures to restore a fair attitude towards all men of draft age in Ukraine and abroad,\" announced Foreign Minister Dmitro Kuleba.\n\nMore than 4.2 million Ukrainians live in the EU under temporary protection, according to Eurostat data as of February 2024. Of these, some 860,000 are adult men, despite the fact that one of the first martial measures was to prohibit men in military age left the country. If in the first months of the invasion only 7.7% of those arriving in the EU were men, today it is 33.5%.\n\nThe exhaustion of an endless war also hits the host countries. The doors are no longer open to refugees.\n\nPoland has been the one that has raised the tone the most. Defense Minister Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz has said his country is \"ready\" to help Ukraine bring its nationals residing in Poland back to support the war effort. \"Many Poles are shocked when they see Ukrainian men in hotels and cafes, and hear how much effort we have to make to help Ukraine,\" he launched.\n\nPolish businessmen do not see it the same way. In August 2023, the employers' association warned that Poland was \"losing the race for Ukrainians\" and that the labor market \"urgently needs immigrants\", given the data that some refugees were leaving for other, more hospitable countries.\n\nWith almost one million, Poland is one of the countries with the most Ukrainian refugees, surpassed only by Germany's 1.2. In relative terms of population, those who bear the most weight are Czechs, Lithuanians, Poles, Estonians and Latvians, in that order.\n\nKosiniak-Kamysz's words have raised the hackles of Ukrainians across Europe. Will they detain and deport those who are left without papers? Will more countries follow Poland?\n\nAsked about its plans regarding the Ukrainians, the Spanish Ministry of the Interior emphasizes that any legal change will be decided \"within the framework of the council of interior ministers\" of the EU. The Foreign Minister, for his part, declines to comment.\n\nAll these questions loom this rainy morning at the consulate. \"There is great insecurity,\" Sergiy shakes his head - \"Sergi\", he insists in impeccable Catalan -, a Ukrainian who has lived in Lleida for more than twenty years and is married to a Catalan woman. He has Spanish nationality and the law does not affect him, but he is worried about his family.\n\n\"When my brother-in-law's passport expires, what? He came out legally, he is sick and can't fight. He could return to Ukraine, go to a recruiting office and resubmit the medical file. But you never know who you will meet, in the offices they have to meet a certain number of recruits and they are desperate,\" explains Sergi.\n\nThe brother-in-law's passport is not the only dark cloud on the horizon. The Spanish Government has just extended until March 2025 the temporary protection that all Ukrainians can benefit from, even those who arrived before the war. It is the third and last possible extension. \"And then? Nobody says what will happen next,\" Sergi laments.\n\nThe uncertainty also distresses Viacheslav, 45, who smokes while his wife renews their youngest son's passport in Barcelona. They live in Tabuenca, an Aragonese town of 300 inhabitants, with their four children. Being the father of a large family, he explains in English, exempts him from going to war, but the laws change.\n\nThey have been living off savings for two years. In Tabuenca there is only work in the fields, something they have never done. Language is another barrier. He is an engineer and had a machinery import company, but with the war everything stopped. \"In the last year some factories have reopened and I have been able to work a little again, remotely. But it is little money.\"\n\n\"I am worried because I am in the middle, neither in Spain, nor in Ukraine. I feel like a gypsy. I don't know if we will return, but I only think about the boys. If they don't renew our passport, we will lose our TIE [the foreigner's identity card], we won't even be able to go to the hospital.\"\n\nThey have already had problems at the bank, because the expiration date on the card is March 2024, and they have had to take the printed page of the BOE announcing the extension to the office.\n\n\"I give you my Ukrainian passport,\" Anatoli, a plumber who has Spanish nationality, says in a telephone conversation. He believes that the new law is a farce \"to look good with Europe and the United States,\" which will only harm the poorest. \"In Ukraine, if you have money, you don't go to war. Everything works with corruption. By paying, you leave the country. By paying, they make you a medical report. And whoever pays, will have the passport,\" he assures.\n\nR. today lives in a refugee apartment in Bilbao managed by the Red Cross, along with two compatriots who do not speak Spanish and a Colombian. He is from Zaporizhzhia, another hit city. He left for Poland with the whole family at the beginning of the war, they returned to Ukraine and then returned to Spain alone. \"I was 16 years old, I didn't want to go to war, and when I turned 18 they wouldn't have let me go.\" His father and an uncle of his are at the front, and he barely hears from them every two or three months. He is always wondering if there will be another call. \"I have few plans: look for a job and wait for the war to end one day,\" he says by phone. He breathes: he has a passport until 2033.\n\nPaying is the only way that Oksana, 43, has found for her son, 24, to avoid war. She has been working for years in Barcelona cleaning tourist houses and apartments. Much of her salary goes to receipts from an academy in Ukraine where her son is supposed to be enrolled, as students are exempt from the service. Also to bribe the teachers every time there is an exam, so that they say that you have taken it and passed. \"I'm not proud, but I don't want my son to die,\" she admits. In her town there have already been several boys who have returned in a box.\n\nNow that the mandatory age to serve has been lowered to 25, she is wondering whether she should try to get her son out of the country. \"It costs about 10,000 euros, I don't have it but I could get it. But it scares me. In the end it depends on who you meet at the border. And if they catch you, you go straight to the front.\"\n\nBut there is another Ukraine. Alex\u00e1nder, 50 years old, works on the Camp Nou construction site. His passport expires in 2027 and he hopes the war will be over by then. If not, he is clear about what he will do: \"I will apply for a Russian passport and go to Russia.\" He is from Donbass and pro-Russian. \"What they tell you about the war is a lie,\" he maintains. \"Russia had been warning for ten years that Ukraine could not continue killing and stepping on Donbass.\"\n\n\"I know that if I set foot in Ukraine, they will catch me, give me a gun and take me to the front. But who am I going to fight against? Against Donbass? It is impossible\".", "source": {"uri": "usanews.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "USANews Press Release Network"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

It has helped keep peace and security around the world. The EU has 27 countries and 450 million people. It is the biggest market in the world. Many countries trade with the EU. It also takes part in to other countries development and peace keeping. Russian war against Ukraine is a big challenge for European Union. Now the EU is more united than before against Russian attack and is determined to restore peace. A stronger EU in security and defense will help for global peace and security. The European Union is setting out a plan for the security and defense for the next 5-10 years. It will be start working on it right away.\n\nOn13th March, European Union agreed to give an extra 5 billion euros (which is about $5.4 billion) to the European Peace Facility by the end of this year. This almost matches the 6.1 billion euros that Brussels promised since the start of 2022. The European Peace Facility didn't do much in 2023 because countries decided to help Ukraine on their own instead of working together. There was a problem with Hungary disagreeing with the decision but they changed their mind later. This back and forth has made people think about changing how the European Peace Facility works so it can help Ukraine better. Even though politics might slow down or stop these changes, people are talking a lot about defense in Europe because of upcoming elections. The European Commission just shared its plan to make Europe better at defense and some people think there should be a special person in charge of defense in the European Commission. The upcoming U.S. elections are also making people talk about this. Some people are worried that if Trump wins, the U.S. might stop helping Europe and Ukraine. This makes European countries think they need to work together more for security. The U.S. might not have enough money to keep giving weapons to Ukraine. So, some leaders like David Cameron from the UK and Kaja Kallas from Estonia, suggest giving old weapons to Ukraine and working together to make and send more ammunition. A company in the Czech Republic called Excalibur Army with support from the Czech government is now trying to change one of its factories into a place where they can make and send weapons and ammunition to Ukraine.\n\nSome people don't see the Ukraine war as a concern for the United States. But in Europe, they are getting ready for more fighting. They think there will be lots of shells fired, so they are planning to make more shells to keep up. Russia is making even more weapons, so they can keep shooting more than Ukraine. What Europe does to protect itself depends on what happens in Ukraine. Both sides are getting ready for more fighting, but they are also trying to get help to win. The outcome of the war will depend on how strong Russia is and how much help Ukraine gets from the West. Russia has a plan for the next few months. First, they will keep fighting everywhere in Ukraine, even though they can't win quickly. Second, they will try to get more weapons and resources, even from countries like Iran and North Korea. Third, they will try to make other countries stop supporting Ukraine, maybe by spreading false information and causing trouble elsewhere. If Russia succeeds, support for Ukraine might decrease, and Russia could win a big victory. But this war is not just about Ukraine; it affects the whole region and even the world. For Ukraine, things are tough. They don't have as many resources as Russia, so they need help from outside. They're also trying to improve their military, especially by using drones. They know they have to act fast to survive, but they are also preparing for the worst, building more defenses and securing their coast. While Ukraine might have an advantage at sea, Russia is still a threat. They are even talking about using nuclear weapons which could cause a lot of damage to everyone involved. So, while Ukraine fights for its survival, the whole world is watching closely.\n\nThis entire means there is a bigger chance the fighting might spread, especially in the Black Sea area. Even if Russia gets what it wants in Ukraine and Western countries stop helping Ukraine, things will still be worse for Russia. They will have more problems with their relationships with other countries, their money and their plans for the future. Russia's actions have worried its neighbors, even the ones who didn't take sides during the Cold War. Russia wants to stop these neighbors from teaming up against it, especially by joining NATO.\n\nRussia is in a tough spot now, so it might try to make NATO weaker, no matter what happens in Ukraine. One idea could be for Russia to attack a NATO country but not something that would cause a big problem for NATO's overall goals. If this happens, NATO would have to choose whether to fight back against Russia and risk a big war, or ignore the attack and make NATO look weak which could lead to more attacks in the future. For the Western countries, it is really important that both NATO and the EU stay strong and stick together. Coming elections, especially in the U.S. and Europe, could give Russia a chance to get more power and split these organizations up. Elections might also push Western leaders to take clearer stances on issues like Ukraine and defense. In Europe, there is a big debate about whether to spend more on defense or on other things like social programs. Either way, defense spending will probably go up which could help the weapons industry and create jobs, but many people will want their governments to focus on different areas. These debates and the chance of protests could give Russia more chances to spread its ideas through the media.", "source": {"uri": "pakistantoday.com.pk", "dataType": "news", "title": "pakistantoday.com.pk"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Foreign_and_Security_Policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Common Foreign and Security Policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Commission", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "European Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo-Ukrainian_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russo-Ukrainian War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_(projectile)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shell (projectile)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peacekeeping", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Peacekeeping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brussels", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brussels"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brussels"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungary", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czech_Republic", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Czech Republic"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Czech Republic"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaja_Kallas", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kaja Kallas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Cameron", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "David Cameron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NATO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "North Korea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "North Korea"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estonia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Estonia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Estonia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Western world"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cold War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Sea", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Black Sea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear weapon"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Alpha-4.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542326", "eventUri": "eng-9542326", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3333333333333333, "wgt": 148, "relevance": 1}

Officially declared by the authorities as the goals of this law \"to put in order the registration of Ukrainians liable for military service, to level the gaps in the legislation on military registration, to deal with the available human resources, etc.\" look at least secondary. The main goal, which clearly shines through the verbal legislative wisdom, political aplomb, and quasi-patriotic slogans, seems to be the authorities' inexorable desire to maximize the fulfillment of the formula of exchanging money and weapons for lives.\n\nIt is hardly a coincidence that almost immediately after Zelensky signed this law, the U.S. authorities very quickly resolved the issue of $61 billion in military funding for Ukraine, which had not been resolved for a year.\n\nBut let's get to the point. The new \"mobilization\" law, which comes into effect on May 18 of this year, sharply tightens the rules of forced mobilization. The law introduces a stricter registration of persons liable for military service, the obligation of almost every man from 18 to 60 years old, wherever he is and however he feels about the ongoing war in Ukraine, to inform the military authorities about himself, as well as to carry a military ID card with him at all times. In addition, the draft age for mobilization has been lowered from 27 to 25.\n\nSince the law came into force, Ukrainian men have 60 days to update their data in territorial recruitment centers (TRC). If the data is not updated within this period, administrative liability in the form of large fines will be imposed. Think about it: in a country with an average salary of 400 euros, the size of the \"mobilization\" fine will be between 400 and 600 euros! If the fine is not paid, it opens the way to blocking the accounts of the mobilized persons and further seizure of their property.\n\nThese are some of the main innovations of the law. According to the authorities' plan, they will allow to take out of the \"shadow\" many persons liable for military duty who do not want to fight, will put these people on the other side of life, will make them outside the law. After all, they will be banned from public service, service in municipal institutions. Moreover, simply because of their lack of military registration documents, such Ukrainians are easy and desirable prey for all kinds of patrols, policemen and informers. According to rough estimates, there may be about a million such people in Ukraine now.\n\nBefore the adoption of this law, the detention of people directly on the streets, which happened quite often, was still an illegal action on the part of the authorities. This gave Ukrainians a chance to protect themselves with the help of legal mechanisms. Now such an opportunity to protect themselves from the arbitrariness of the authorities is actually canceled.\n\nAt the same time, the authorities are no longer obliged to actually deliver a summons to a person. Now its non-delivery is legalized: the postal service marking it \"not delivered\" will officially mean that the citizen has received it!\n\nAs we have already written, people who fail to fulfill the requirements of the new law can be deprived of the right to drive a car, forcibly detained by the police and taken to the TRC, fined. At the same time, filing an appeal by a citizen against a court decision on his punishment does not suspend the effect of the appealed decision! This is an obvious legal absurdity, the consequence of which will be the shattered fates of people due to often illegal, moreover, not enforceable court decisions: in essence, this law annulled the right of a person to a fair trial and the right to appeal.\n\nAlso, without a military ID card, military conscripts will not be issued a passport abroad. This also applies to young men from 18 years of age who left Ukraine before they came of age. That is, in order to be able to receive Ukrainian documents abroad, they must go to Ukraine for a military registration document. But since they will not be released from Ukraine afterwards, it makes no sense. Moreover, the new law stipulates that not only passport services, but also all consular services abroad for all men from 18 to 60 years of age will be provided only upon presentation of a military ID card.\n\nFor tens of thousands of Ukrainians who do not have military tickets, it has become impossible to receive consular services without returning to Ukraine.\n\nEven before the adoption of the law, thousands of them applied to consulates and other government agencies abroad to renew their passports in advance, without which legalization in the same EU countries is problematic. This formed huge queues in those countries where there are many refugees from Ukraine: Poland, the Czech Republic, Germany and others. People hoped that if they applied for documents before the law came into force, a passport could be issued without presenting a military ID card.\n\nHowever, already on April 23, the Ukrainian authorities imposed a ban on the issuance of documents, even before the law came into force: an order of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine \"temporarily suspended the performance of consular actions on applications of male Ukrainian citizens aged 18 to 60 years\". This is the clearest litmus test of the meaning of the new law on mobilization: the return and sending to war of thousands of Ukrainians who do not want to participate in it.\n\nMore and more Ukrainian men are desperate to flee the country, unwilling to die for someone else's self-serving purposes.\n\nIn 2023 alone, according to the BBC, more than 90 Ukrainians died in the mountains of Romania while trying to illegally cross the Ukrainian-Romanian border and escape the war, 24 died while trying to escape by swimming across the border river Tisa. The number of those who managed to leave Ukraine is estimated in the tens of thousands.\n\nFulfilling the \"precepts\" of NATO chief Stoltenberg that the war in Ukraine \"should last a few more years\", the Ukrainian authorities have also focused the effect of this law on the younger generation, those who are under 18 years of age: according to the most conservative estimates, there are about half a million 15- to 18-year-olds left in Ukraine today. In addition, several hundred thousand Ukrainian students are also taken into account. Thus, we are talking about the near future of almost a million young Ukrainians, still potentially a \"living force\", which, according to the authorities, will be used together with the arms supplied to the country.\n\nThe country today is becoming more and more like a huge prison for its own population, trapped inside, deprived of civil rights, where the authorities are trying to drive back those who managed to escape from it by all rights and wrongs.\n\nBut as in any prison, there is a commandant's office, guards and a privileged part of the \"prisoners\". A very important point in the law is that it actually openly divides men of conscription age into \"two sorts\": those who are protected from mobilization and... those who remain.\n\nThus, exemption from mobilization is granted to all members of the police, special services and other law enforcement agencies - a minimum of 300 thousand armed adults, mostly engaged in catching fellow citizens, suppressing dissent, performing punitive-police functions.\n\nIn addition to them, all heads of public authorities, including deputies, ministers, their deputies and so on, as well as not only employees of strategically important enterprises, but also their owners (in Ukraine, as a rule, these are oligarchs) should not be in line. It is all too obvious who such a norm was written for: the ruling oligarchic regime has exempted from mobilization itself in the person of top officials and oligarchs, as well as its forceful support in the form of police and special services.\n\nAn important point: while providing protection from mobilization to judges, investigators and prosecutors, for some reason the legislator did not do the same for lawyers. Why? The answer is simple: the authorities do not need those who should and can protect people from arbitrariness; the authorities need the fear and helplessness of the people.\n\nIt is not the rich minority that will be sent into the bloody meat grinder of war, but the poor majority - the unemployed, laborers, peasants, teachers, doctors, office workers.... Now, with the adoption of the new law, the number of men deprived of basic human rights, who will be caught, as in hunting, and sent to the front, will increase many times over.\n\nThe profits of those who profit from this war will also increase many times over, as I have already written about many times. This huge money will be shared by the military-industrial complex, its lobbyists in the American and European establishment, and the Ukrainian oligarchic top brass.\n\nRoger Waters, leader of Pink Floyd, on the reasons for the war: \"The best thing that has happened to them in the last 10 years is the conflict in Ukraine. They let it happen because of the real business benefit. They make money from wars, among other things: they produce weapons, sell them and make a profit. It is not you and me or ordinary people who invest in the military industry, but only the bigwigs. And in wartime, their proceeds skyrocket.\"\n\nOrdinary Ukrainians will get only another round of new deaths and misfortune.", "source": {"uri": "defenddemocracy.press", "dataType": "news", "title":

But experience shows that the U.S. is capable of funding wars at a much greater scale and for much longer. The recent passage of $61 billion of aid is an encouraging sign that Kyiv's allies still have the will to support Ukraine's existential fight.\n\nThree years into the Russian-Ukrainian war, Europeans' early overconfidence in Ukraine's victory and anticipation of a successful Ukrainian counteroffensive, had been replaced with despondency. Now, according to a survey by the European Council on Foreign Relations, only 10% of Europeans believe the war will end in a Ukrainian victory, half as many as expect Russia to win. 31% of respondents believe that the EU should continue to support Ukraine until it returns its territories, while 41% think that Europe should push Ukraine to negotiate. The failure of the 2023 counteroffensive, Russia's new offensive, and internal conflicts within the EU and the U.S. that have prevented the regular supply of money and weapons to Ukraine are contributing to this growing frustration.\n\nDespite this, the majority of Americans support providing military aid to Ukraine, even if Donald Trump comes to power in America and the United States finally withdraws its support. Only a third of respondents believe Washington should reduce its support, while 20% think it should be increased.\n\nAt the same time, it cannot be said that supporting Ukraine would overstretch the American or European budgets. Over the two years of the war, European countries and organizations have provided Ukraine with 88.7 billion euros of military, humanitarian and financial aid, while the United States has provided $75 billion before the passage of the latest aid bill. Half of the 144 billion euros ($154 billion) the EU promised Ukraine has not been distributed. Therefore, experts monitoring aid to Ukraine, note that the EU could radically increase its support by simply accelerating its efforts without having to introduce any new aid packages.\n\nFor comparison, the U.S. spent the equivalent of $139 billion on the Gulf War, which lasted less than a year. The wars in Afghanistan and Korea each cost more than $400 billion. The wars in Iraq and Vietnam cost Americans more than a trillion dollars each, not counting the cost of rehabilitation and payments to veterans, which tends to double the cost of these wars even after fighting has ceased. The War on Terror was especially expensive, costing Washington over $8 trillion.\n\nAgainst this background, the meager spending on assistance to Ukraine looks ridiculous. The benefits of supporting Kyiv in the fight against Russia, which has long been Washington's main competitor and is the main destabilizer of the world order, obviously outweigh the benefits of investments in the fight against Vietnamese farmers and any terrorist groups.", "source": {"uri": "themoscowtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Moscow Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alexander_finiarel@themoscowtimes.com", "name": "Alexander Finiarel", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyiv", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kyiv"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo-Ukrainian_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russo-Ukrainian War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Council_on_Foreign_Relations", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "European Council on Foreign Relations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_in_Afghanistan_(2001\u20132021)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "War in Afghanistan (2001\u20132021)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_on_terror", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "War on terror"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gulf War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarian aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iraq War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Islamic terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Welfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Immigration", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Immigration", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 74}], "image": "https://static.themoscowtimes.com/image/og/db/84989__db2b39d8cc6a65fe0b026b06030921e8.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542326", "eventUri": "eng-9542326", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 127, "relevance": 1}

The singer, 34, who released The Tortured Poets Department on April 19, has had a string of British boyfriends, with her first being Harry Styles back in 2012. She then dated Matty Healy briefly in 2014 and again last summer, with her also later linked to Brit Tom Hiddleston. But it was her long-term relationship with Joe Alwyn that saw the hitmaker move from the States to England. In 2017, The Sun reported that Taylor was staying in North London and was dating Joe, the British actor. She is thought to have moved to the UK soon after splitting from Tom in September 2016. For all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US.

Nobody has a clue they've been walking past a music superstar - not even her new neighbours.\" Then, in January 2021, a source spilled to E! News that Taylor was \"back and forth between Nashville and England spending time with her family and with Joe's family. They take walks in the neighbourhood and go on hikes to get fresh air.\" And after The Tortured Poets Department was released back in April, it appeared that Taylor resided in Hampstead Heath with Joe before they split. In track five, So Long, London, she croons: \"I left all I knew, you left me at the house by the Heath.\" A while ago, it was revealed that Taylor had been looking for a \"house with a garden\", with the location heavily speculated to be Hampstead Heath in London. \"Taylor has been looking for a period house with a garden, and crucially looking at roads and addresses that will provide her with privacy, security and discretion,\u201d Rosy Khalastchy, head of Beauchamp Estates\u2019 St John\u2019s Wood office, told Homes & Property at the time. \"I'm just mad as hell 'cause I loved this place,\" she sings in the fifth song from the new album. She also croons: \"Oh, the tragedy / So long, London.\" The end of the song then fades out as Taylor sings: \"So (So) long (Long), London (London) / Stitches (Stitches) undone (Undone) / Two (Two) graves (Graves), one gun (Gun) / You'll (You'll) find (Find) someone.\" Taylor is bringing her Eras Tour to the capital later this month when she takes to the stage at London's Wembley Arena on June 21, 22, 23. She'll then be heading further afield throughout Europe, with her due back in the capital for a further five sold-out shows (August 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20). A version of this story was first published on April 19, 2024. How to buy Taylor Swift Eras Tour tickets Taylor Swift fans looking at resale tickets for the upcoming Eras Tour in the UK can purchase them from from a number of online retailers right now. Sites such as viagogo and Vivid Seats allow fans to buy resale tickets from other fans. However, it is important to note that many event promoters say tickets should not be resold after initial purchase and will not be valid for admittance to gigs. Fans attending live events with tickets acquired through resale websites are advised to double-check the ticket terms and conditions at the point of sale - such as Ticketmaster or Live Nation - to ensure a smooth live event experience. Tickets could be voided if they were found to be bought second-hand. As a result, fans are buying at their own risk.

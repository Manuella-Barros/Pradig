{"id": 231214780, "title": "Ontario man considers selling house before mortgage payments rise $2,000, even after interest rate cut", "text": "An Ontario man says he\u2019s still considering selling his house, despite this week\u2019s interest rate cut, with his mortgage payments set to leap over $2,000 next month. \u201cI'm happy to see, finally, a rate cut. I wish it came a lot faster,\u201d Gerry Best, a 66-year-old homeowner in Kitchener, Ont., said. On Wednesday, the Bank of Canada cut its overnight rate by 25 basis points \u2013 a move unseen since before the pandemic. At the same time, the central bank teased the possibility of further cuts to come, with many economists forecasting that Canada will see another two to three 25 basis point cuts by the end of 2024. But for Best, it won\u2019t be enough to move the needle before his mortgage renewal on July 17 \u2013 just one week before the next interest rate announcement. The Bank of Canada had previously raised rates 10 times beginning in March 2022 as part of an aggressive hiking campaign made necessary by surging inflation. \u201cPrior to the Bank of Canada raising the rates, I got caught up in the variable interest nightmare, where it kept on going up and up and up and up,\u201d Best said. To stay afloat, Best turned to a private lender and is now paying $3,660 per month. But come July, his payments are projected to swell to around $6,000 to $6,500. Gerry Best, a homeowner in Kitchener, Ont., says he's considering selling his house due to high mortgage payments. To get ahead of what\u2019s to come, Best is planning to put his house on the market by the end of the month and move west to Woodstock, Ont. Fabian Wills\u2019 mortgage renewal is also an hourglass trickling its last grains of sand. Soon, his time will come, and the 50-year-old homeowner feels like a first time buyer all over again. \u201cAlthough it\u2019s going in the right direction, I'm still a little concerned about what do I do \u2013 do I do longer term? Do I do a shorter term because it\u2019s going to still keep going down? Or is it going to change and go back up?\u201d he said Five years ago, the long-time Markham resident moved to Kleinberg in Vaughan, Ont. His daughters were returning home from university and the northbound move created more space for the family. In Kleinberg, Wills fell in love with the access to nature, the walking trails and the community. While Wednesday\u2019s announcement was a little sigh of relief, he\u2019s already looking ahead to the next one on July 24, before his mortgage payments are expected to increase $2,000 by the end of that month. Unwilling to uproot his family from their newly settled neighbourhood, they\u2019ll have to cut back on spending \u2013 placing a pause on hosting extended family birthdays, going on vacations, and eating out. \u201cHaving this potential barrier hanging over your head is daunting to say the least,\u201d he said. For Wills, and Canadians alike, the quarter point drop realistically isn\u2019t going to make a massive difference in the short term, Douglas Hoyes, a personal finance expert in Kitchener, said. \u201cWhat really matters is what happens next,\u201d he said. \u201cIs this the first of many cuts? That's what most people expect. If it is then yes, it will bring some relief to borrowers over the coming months.\u201d Historically looking at the rate cycles, Ron Butler, a Toronto-based mortgage broker, said there\u2019s never been a quarter per cent cut, and then a full stop for a year. \u201cThat's literally never happened in the history of rates,\u201d Butler said. Still, Hoyes suggests the safest route is to look at your own personal finances and make decisions based on what you can afford. \u201cWhat can you afford to pay? Don't go $1 over that. That way you don't have to worry about what happens in the future with interest rates.\u201d", "summary": "An Ontario man says he\u2019s still considering selling his house, despite this week\u2019s interest rate cut, with his mortgage payments set to leap over $2,000 next month.", "url": "https://toronto.ctvnews.ca/ontario-man-considers-selling-house-before-mortgage-payments-rise-2-000-even-after-interest-rate-cut-1.6917757", "image": "https://www.ctvnews.ca/content/dam/ctvnews/en/images/2024/6/7/mortgage-1-6917759-1717772814635.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 12:26:27", "author": "Hannah Alberga", "authors": ["Hannah Alberga"], "language": "en", "source_country": "CA", "sentiment": 0.05}

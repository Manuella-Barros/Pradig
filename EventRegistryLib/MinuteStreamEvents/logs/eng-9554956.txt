The lifeless body of the 12-year-old girl was found on a road, just 5 kilometers away from her mother's country house, in the Galician municipality of Teo.\n\nThe little girl's parents became the main suspects in the crime from the first minute. And after a long judicial process, the lawyer and the journalist were sentenced to 18 years in prison for the murder of her own daughter. Now, ten years after the event, the little girl's case has once again been on the agenda due to the premiere of the Netflix series that narrates the terrible crime, The Asunta Case.\n\nSince last April 26, many media outlets have begun to recall all the details of the case and try to shed some light on the unknowns that to this day still have no answers. The investigators of the case were able to collect numerous evidence against the ex-couple, but what was the definitive evidence that put them in the police's sights?\n\nOne of the pieces of evidence that caught the investigators' attention the most were the orange ropes that they found next to the girl's body and that were used to tie her. An identical rope was found in the home of Rosario Porto's parents, in the municipality of Teo. However, other evidence that was found was crucial to incriminate the lawyer.\n\nWhen Asunta's parents went to the police station to report the disappearance of their daughter Asunta, Rosario Porto claimed to have been alone the entire previous afternoon in Teo's house while Asunta was studying in Santiago's apartment.\n\nHowever, the accused's version took a radical turn when police officers found a recording from the security cameras of the Galuresa service station. In the video, Rosario Porto appears in her car accompanied by her daughter Asunta, who is sitting in the passenger seat.

The series is now the top non-English language series on Netflix in the U.S., as of May 9.\n\nReleased on April 26, the miniseries follows the case of a 12-year-old Chinese-born girl, Asunta Fong Yang, whose adoptive Spanish parents reported her missing in 2013.\n\nShortly after, her body was discovered on the side of a countryside road. Investigators soon directed their focus toward Asunta's parents as suspects.\n\nThough some aspects of the case may forever remain a mystery, here is what we know about what happened to Asunta in real life.\n\nWho were Asunta Fong Yang's adoptive parents?\n\nThe case at the heart of the six-episode miniseries involved Asunta Fong Yang, the adopted daughter of a couple from the city of Santiago de Compostela in northern Spain. Rosario Porto, her adoptive mother, was a lawyer from Santiago. Her husband, Alfonso Basterra, was a freelance journalist from the Basque country.\n\nTheir family was upper-middle class -- Porto's father had served as honorary consul for France and her mother was an art historian at the University of Santiago, according to The Guardian. During their trial, almost all of the witnesses described Porto and Basterra as model parents.\n\nAlthough adopting a child from China was still unusual in Spain at the time, would-be parents were facing a decreasing birth rate and strict adoption laws, making adopting children from overseas an attractive and relatively easy option. According to The Guardian, Spain ranked second in the world for foreign adoptions in 2004 -- the year after Porto and Basterra adopted Asunta.\n\nEarly in 2013, Porto and Basterra divorced. That June, Porto experienced an acute nervous breakdown that left her hospitalized. Both of her parents had passed away within the two years prior.\n\nPolice sources confirmed to Spanish newspaper El Correo de Gallego that after Asunta's death, the Civil Guard considered opening a parallel investigation into the deaths of Porto's parents. Her parents were old, but neither had serious illnesses when they passed, and they were cremated without autopsy.\n\nTheir deaths had left Porto with an inheritance valued at \u20ac1.2 million in real estate alone, according to El Correo de Gallego. La Voz de Galicia, a Spanish newspaper based in the region where Santiago is located, reported that Porto had compelled her contacts in the court system to expedite the process of cremating them as quickly as possible.\n\nWhat happened to Asunta Fong Yang?\n\nForensic scientists who tested Asunta's blood, urine and hair after her death found toxic amounts of the sedative drug lorazepam that suggested she had been ingesting it for around three months before her death, The Guardian reported.\n\nDuring the trial, prosecutors revealed that Basterra had obtained over 170 Orfidal (or lorazepam) pills over 10 weeks, and neither he nor Porto could explain why there were 27 pills' worth of lorazepam in Asunta's body on the day she died, The Guardian also reported. Orfidal pills are often taken to treat anxiety due to their calming effect.\n\nDuring the investigation, a witness testified that Asunta once told her music teachers, \"My mother is trying to kill me.\"\n\nAfter their arrests, Porto was recorded in the police holding cell saying to her ex-husband, \"Look what trouble your overheated imagination has got us into,\" according to The Guardian. The recordings, however, were declared inadmissible by a court.\n\nAnother aspect of the case that the Netflix series touches on involved Basterra's computer. La Voz de Galicia reported that it was not at his apartment when police initially inspected it, but Basterra said it had not been moved. When the computer was obtained, an agent testified that more 500,000 files \"had been deleted, including videos and images of a sexual nature,\" according to La Voz de Galicia.\n\nAt trial, the jury eventually found Porto and Basterra guilty of murdering Asunta. The jury accepted the reasoning that a friend of Asunta saw Basterra with her on the day of her death, and he may have hidden in the backseat of the car while Porto drove Asunta to their country house, The Gaurdian reported. There, the prosecutor theorized, they smothered her together and dumped her body on the side of the road.\n\nWhat happened to Rosario Porto and Alfonso Basterra?\n\nPorto was arrested at Asunta's funeral, according to The Guardian. A CCTV camera at a gas station near their apartment showed Porto driving down the road with a girl at a time when Porto had previously said Asunta was at home, the outlet reported.\n\nWhen told about the cameras, both Porto and Basterra changed their stories regarding when they last saw Asunta, The Guardian reported. Porto said the passenger in the car was her daughter and that they had briefly gone to the country house in Teo. Porto said Asunta wanted to leave, so Porto dropped her off near their apartment in Santiago.\n\nPorto and Basterra were each ultimately sentenced to 18 years in prison, since the case occurred before the passage of a Spanish law instituting life sentences for child-murderers. Both appealed to have their convictions overturned, according to The Guardian. Though Porto died by suicide in her prison cell in 2020, Basterra is still carrying out his sentence at Teixeiro.\n\nHas there been a documentary about Asunta Fong Yang's murder?\n\nYes. \"Lo que la verdad esconde: Caso Asunta (What the Truth Hides: The Asunta Case)\" came out in 2017 in Spain. The three-episode series is available to stream.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/True_crime",

The 12-year-old girl was murdered at the hands of her parents, Alfonso Basterra and Rosario Porto, on September 21, 2013 in the Galician municipality of Teo.\n\nThe journalist and the lawyer became the main suspects in the crime from the first moment. Although they never confessed to the facts, both were sentenced to 18 years in prison in 2016. Now, more than ten years after the crime, the case has once again generated a stir in almost all the media, which try to today shed some light on the numerous unknowns of the case that were never answered.\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, the Sonsoles \u00d3nega program exclusively interviewed Nuria, who was Rosario Porto's trusted prisoner. The former prisoner, who shared a cell with the lawyer for four months, Rosario Porto claimed, gave an image of a person mortified by the situation and very fond of her daughter. ''She did nothing but talk about her (...) Christmas and the designated days were very complicated for her, she would go to bed and just cry,'' she said.\n\nAsunta's mother always had a very close and kind relationship with the other prisoners. ''She went through very hard times, every time she went out to the yard she met other inmates who insulted and harassed her. \"That's not nice because she never pleaded guilty,\" she revealed. ''I can only speak wonders, we had a very good relationship, we talked about many topics such as travel, painting... My personal assessment is different, I cannot say that she was guilty because she did not act like that,'' she stated.\n\nFurthermore, Rosario Porto's trusted prisoner confessed that the lawyer always fought to discover the truth and for her daughter's murderer to be found. ''Public opinion condemned her from the beginning (...)

The fiction stars Candela Pe\u00f1a, Trist\u00e1n Ulloa, Mar\u00eda Le\u00f3n and Alicia Borrachero, among others, has become a mass phenomenon, occupying a place among the most viewed on the platform in countless countries: Spain, Argentina, the United States, etc.\n\nIn 2013, when the events occurred, the case shocked Spanish society. Rosario Porto and Alfonso Basterra, the girl's parents, reported her disappearance and, after a few hours of searching, the authorities found the girl's lifeless body. When they took their statements, the agents discovered certain inconsistencies in their stories, which is why they were detained.\n\nAfter a difficult phase of investigation, Asunta's parents were formally accused of murdering the girl. After two years in preventive detention, the perpetrators of the crime faced a trial that sentenced them to 18 years of deprivation of liberty.\n\nAlthough he has never acknowledged the facts and continues to declare himself \"innocent,\" Basterra continues behind bars serving the sentence imposed on him. Instead, Rosario Porto could not stand the pressure she felt and committed suicide (after two failed attempts) in her cell in November 2020.\n\nThe Netflix series has rescued the story of the crime and has provided information that had previously gone unnoticed by the general audience. For example, many people did not know that little Asunta had written a blog on the Internet a year before she was murdered.\n\nShortly after losing her grandfather, the young woman opened an online blog under the name 'Asnuca'. In this space, the girl intended to investigate different areas of Santiago de Compostela where there were supposedly the presence of spirits: the parks of La Alameda, Belv\u00eds and Bonaval.\n\n''We are writing this blog because other people have told us that they have seen strangers in the parks,'' the girl says in one of the entries, revealing that it was a collaborative task with Sophie Elizabeth Paton, her English teacher. On the main page (with a black background and white letters), the girl defined herself as \"chief ghost hunter\": ''We are ghost hunters and we are investigating these strange sightings.\"\n\nIn another publication, the girl tells a story that has shocked the curious: ''Once upon a time there was a happy family; a man, a woman and a son. One day the woman was murdered. The man had to retaliate against the person who killed his wife (Anna), but he also died, because, in trying to retaliate, the bad man killed John, his husband. His body is in the Alameda and so is his spirit. He waits for the spirit of his wife to come to him. Every day he sits on the benches.\"\n\nOn the Internet there are different theories about whether the girl was really talking about the death of her grandparents, who had died in 2011 and 2012. In the series you can see how Basterra brings up the subject to Porto (\"Have you seen what happened?\" posted on your blog?''), which has given rise to new interpretations.\n\nFollowers of the case have even suggested on social media that Asunta's parents could have ended the lives of her grandparents to collect the inheritance, a conspiracy theory that has not been proven in any way.", "source": {"uri": "usanews.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "USANews Press Release Network"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porto", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Porto"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Porto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Portugal"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosario,_Santa_Fe", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rosario, Santa Fe"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rosario, Santa Fe"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alicia_Borrachero", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alicia Borrachero"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candela_Pe\u00f1a", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Candela Pe\u00f1a"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trist\u00e1n_Ulloa", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trist\u00e1n Ulloa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar\u00eda_Le\u00f3n_(actress)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mar\u00eda Le\u00f3n (actress)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Blog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ghost"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liberty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Suicide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alameda,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alameda, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alameda, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Paton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elizabeth Paton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inheritance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inheritance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conspiracy theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santiago_de_Compostela", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Santiago de Compostela"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Santiago de Compostela"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 50}], "image": "https://www.usanews.net/images/haberler/2024/05/_3abf9.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554956", "eventUri": "eng-9554956", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2020-11-", "textStart": 1488, "textEnd": 1501}], "sentiment": -0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

In addition, the Antena 3 space exclusively revealed the letters that the journalist and the lawyer sent to each other from prison.\n\n''I want and hope that when you hear the news of my death you cry but with joy because I will have fulfilled a wish. Because I know that my life in freedom without it would be impossible to cope with. And since I couldn't help her when she needed me most, it's only right that I'm the one who runs next to her now,' Alfonso Basterra wrote.\n\nThe journalist revealed that he had direct contact with Alfonso Basterra at work. ''When I met him, we went in very badly,'' he said. ''But with daily contact our relationship improved so much that we became friends or at least I considered it that way. He seemed like a good kid and a good person to me. Then I met her at an awards ceremony. She had a normal relationship with them,' she said.\n\nTheir friendship became so deep that the journalist claimed that it was difficult for him to assimilate that Basterra was involved in the crime. ''He was introverted, not very talkative, he was not especially friendly and therefore it is difficult for me to believe that a man with those characteristics could commit such a crime (...) My personal opinion is that either this man lost his mind or he was very in love and wanted to protect her. I see him as an accessory, he has never acknowledged the crime despite the clues he left,' he revealed.\n\nRegarding the letters sent from prison, Fernando Ramos explained that they reflected his character very well: ''He was a man in love and frustrated. A strange thing was the relationship they had, that affection and that complicity, that's why I think there is something else strange here.'' The journalist confessed that he was a man with whom it was not easy to establish a relationship. ''In prison he has no relationship with other prisoners, it is something very rare,'' he declared.\n\nDuring Thursday afternoon, Ana Rosa Quintana's program also addressed the Asunta crime, revealing new information related to Alfonso Basterra's former cellmates. ''I arrived in prison in November 2021 and he was in charge of taking the press to the modules and the library (...) he had privileges. He was a cold man, quite selective and intelligent,' declared Manuel.

After taking statements from the parents of the deceased, the investigators realized that Basterra and Porto's speech presented different inconsistencies and ordered her immediate arrest.\n\nIt should be noted that Porto was arrested one day before Basterra. When they met in adjoining cells, those then suspected of the girl's murder had a conversation that has come to light in its entirety.\n\n''Your feverish imagination is going to cause us a lot of problems,'' the woman is heard saying in the recording before her ex-partner asked her for silence. ''And just because I had all the insects in my house... with a cushion doesn't mean I'm suffocating people with cushions (...) Look at what you've created,'' Porto continues on the track, blaming Basterra.\n\n''Of course not my life.

At that moment, you can hear how Porto alludes to some messages that the man had sent her: ''Yes, but I was so stupid that all the things that you sent me to...

Something that Jos\u00e9 Luis Guti\u00e9rrez Aranguren, who was Rosario Porto's lawyer until the day of his death, in 2020, was talking about this Monday.\n\nThe presenter began the interview by asking the lawyer about Rosario Porto's latest confessions. ''We all knew what ended up happening. She had had some previous suicide attempts. There were two interpretations, she wants to get attention or she wants to commit suicide. \"Nobody took her seriously,\" he declared.\n\n''What we all deduced after learning of the death is that Rosario, at a horrible time in her life, was transferred to an inhospitable and distant place. She only had her psychologist, her psychiatrist and me left. Her friends stopped being friends and her family disowned her. In those circumstances and with the dramatic loss of a daughter, a person in this world has no meaning,' she said.\n\nRegarding who was the author of the crime of the 12-year-old girl, Rosario Porto's lawyer assured that it was not his client. ''There is not a single piece of evidence, not a single indication that points towards her,'' he stressed. ''I am aware that there is a court and a jury that condemns her, a constitutional one and Strasbourg, despite everything, I say that it was an unjust and unjustified sentence,'' she asserted.\n\nAranguren saw many similarities with the case of Dolores V\u00e1zquez, the woman who was convicted by a popular jury for the murder of Roc\u00edo Wanninkhof in 1999. A crime that she never committed as was proven over the years. ''She was convicted in all instances and in the end a chance discovery gave the clue as to who the murderer had been,'' she explained.\n\nIn this sense, the lawyer assured that everything that was speculated during the trial was \"stupid.\" ''For example, ''the girl was in the way because she had a lover.'' She was divorced, the lover thing sounds very stale. If it had been the other way around, that terminology would not have been used. All indications were refuted and none were consolidated. It was said that the girl had been deposited at Teo's court around 10:00 p.m. and there were two men who said the girl was not there at that time,'' he said.\n\n''In the first police report it was said that it was a full moon night with perfect visibility, but when it was learned that there had been some people walking there it was no longer a full moon, it was no longer the time at which it was said to have happened and In addition, a montage was made in which the lights on the track were turned off and only overwhelming silence could be heard. That's when the suspicions towards her parents begin in the report because they left her there so they could find her quickly, and then that wasn't worth it,' she explained.", "source": {"uri": "usanews.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "USANews Press Release Network"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Municipality", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Municipality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosario,_Santa_Fe", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rosario, Santa Fe"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rosario, Santa Fe"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galicia_(Spain)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Galicia (Spain)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Galicia (Spain)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porto", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Porto"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Porto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Portugal"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Guti\u00e9rrez", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Luis Guti\u00e9rrez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Suicide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_monarchy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Constitutional monarchy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatrist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Psychiatrist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychologist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Psychologist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucas_V\u00e1zquez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lucas V\u00e1zquez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_moon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Full moon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strasbourg", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strasbourg"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Strasbourg"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.usanews.net/images/haberler/2024/05/_1a1f6.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554956", "eventUri": "eng-9554956", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2013-09-21", "textStart": 555, "textEnd": 573}], "sentiment": -0.4274509803921569, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

Basterra remains in prison.\n\nThe motive for Asunta's murder remains a mystery, despite the couple's troubled background. Netflix's The Asunta Case, starring Candela Pe\u00f1a and Trist\u00e1n Ulloa, dramatises these real-life events, exploring the depths of human complexity and the devastating betrayal of a child by those sworn to protect her.

After the premiere of the Netflix series on April 26, the murder of the 12-year-old girl at the hands of her parents, Alfonso Basterra and Rosario Porto, has generated a multitude of information and testimonies in different media.\n\nOn Wednesday afternoon, the Sonsoles \u00d3nega program continued addressing the Asunta Basterra Porto case with new testimony. And the Antena 3 program interviewed live Bego\u00f1a Rodr\u00edguez, the Civil Guard who arrested Rosario Porto in September 2013. Regarding the first time she saw the lawyer, the bailiff claimed that she saw an affected and upset woman.\n\nDespite that impression, investigators suspected her from the first moment. ''The colleagues who went to remove the body found it curious, at the very least, how the victim was positioned. The crime scene says a lot of things and we assumed it was someone close to the girl. And by mid-morning when we had more information, we no longer had any doubts from the police,' she declared.\n\nAfter collecting numerous incriminating evidence, investigators decided to detain Rosario Porto at the funeral home while they were watching over the girl. ''It's not that she didn't show surprise, she said we were wrong, but she didn't either... she had a pretty calm reaction,'' she stated.\n\nMoments later, the Civil Guard agent explained in the program everything she discovered about Rosario Porto's new dream. ''She was very excited and happy. And she talked about it a lot because it made her feel good to talk about something she liked,' she said. An attitude that had nothing to do with Alfonso Basterra. ''He solved her life,'' she commented.\n\nAnother of the details that caught the most attention in the investigation was Rosario Porto's laughter during the search of Teo's house. A disconcerting moment that was captured by numerous media outlets. ''That was many hours, we had just gone to get some sandwiches because that started in the morning and ended at 6 or 7 in the afternoon. It took many hours and at that moment it happened that someone told an anecdote about Rosario's father and all of us who were there smiled because it was funny.

After a difficult phase of investigation, the couple faced a trial and, after two years of preventive detention, in 2015, they were sentenced to 18 years in prison for having killed their daughter.\n\nA few years ago, Carmen, an inmate who was in A Lama prison (Pontevedra) with the Galician lawyer, spoke about her in a La Vanguardia podcast and expressed that she was a woman with two faces: ''For one On the one hand she was super good, super kind, affectionate... and on the other hand she had tremendous evil, she manipulated officials, she manipulated inmates... She tried to harm the inmates, always within her responsibility.''\n\nDuring her stay in the Pontevedra prison (one of the three in which she was), Porto denounced several prisoners for sexually harassing her and for giving her humiliating treatment. However, Carmen assured in the aforementioned podcast episode that it was Porto that had a \"tendency toward exhibitionism.\"\n\n''She has even hurt colleagues from other modules, accusing them of harassing her and that they were saying humiliating things to her when she herself was the one who was shaking her butt in front of them, undressing in front of the window on the bed, putting on a bra or even without a bra to change out of her pajamas when she knew that module 1 and 2 of that prison could see her through the window and then she complained about it. What she did seems truly barbaric to me,' said Carmen.\n\nAfter two failed attempts to take her own life, Porto committed suicide in November 2020. On the other hand, her ex-husband, Alfonso Basterra, is still serving the prison sentence imposed on him in 2015.\n\nThroughout these last few years, Asunta's parents have maintained their version of events and have defined themselves as ''innocent'' of the terrible crime that ended the life of the girl of Chinese origin. Porto died defending her 'truth' until the end.", "source": {"uri": "usanews.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "USANews Press Release Network"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porto", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Porto"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Porto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Portugal"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carmen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journalist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Journalist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pontevedra", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pontevedra"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pontevedra"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosario,_Santa_Fe", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rosario, Santa Fe"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rosario, Santa Fe"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basque_Country_(autonomous_community)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basque Country (autonomous community)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Basque Country (autonomous community)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Vanguardia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "La Vanguardia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preventive_detention", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Preventive detention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santiago_de_Compostela", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Santiago de Compostela"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Santiago de Compostela"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galicia_(Spain)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Galicia (Spain)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Galicia (Spain)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Suicide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 76}], "image": "https://www.usanews.net/images/haberler/2024/05/_f7d23.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554956", "eventUri": "eng-9554956", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2020-11-", "textStart": 2425, "textEnd": 2438}], "sentiment": -0.2235294117647059, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

Asunta Basterra Porto was murdered at the hands of her own adoptive parents, Alfonso Basterra and Rosario Porto, in September 2013 in the Galician municipality of Teo.\n\nThose who were husband and wife immediately became the main suspects of the crime thanks to the findings that investigators made in the lawyer's parents' house - where the crime was committed - and to the security recordings of key places that they dismantled. their first testimonies. After a long judicial process, both were sentenced to 18 years in prison for the murder.\n\nCurrently, Asunta's father is still serving his sentence in Teixeiro prison, in A Coru\u00f1a, without having yet had any prison permit. Now, thanks to content creator @unatalgorritos, what the prison routine of the father of the 12-year-old girl who was murdered in 2013 is like has come to light.\n\n''Since the trial and his subsequent conviction, Alfonso has been seen as an impenetrable man by those who have dealt with him. At no time has he confessed or shown regret, '' the tiktoker began saying in the video. ''It has also emerged that his behavior in prison has been conflictive. He has been caught smuggling contraband with other inmates. In fact, Alfonso was transferred two years ago to a harsher module and this happened when an official caught him dealing with other inmates inside the prison,' she said.\n\nThe content creator claimed that Basterra had also had conflicts with other inmates and bad behavior with prison guards. Regarding her daily routine, the influencer revealed the following: ''He gets up in the morning, tidies up the cell and makes the bed, has breakfast and goes straight to the library to surround himself with books. He does not have any relationship of trust with any inmate, partly because of the high opinion he has of himself and that he considers himself intellectually very superior to the rest of the inmates and officials.''\n\nAlfonso Basterra still has eight years left in prison, but in January 2024 he tried to request the third degree of prison. ''This would allow him to leave prison and enter a social reintegration center, where he would only have to go to sleep. But he did not achieve his goal because penitentiary institutions rejected his request, in part for not showing remorse for his behavior,' he detailed.", "source": {"uri": "usanews.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "USANews Press Release Network"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porto", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Porto"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Porto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Portugal"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Municipality", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Municipality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosario,_Santa_Fe", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rosario, Santa Fe"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rosario, Santa Fe"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galicia_(Spain)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Galicia (Spain)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Galicia (Spain)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_creation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Content creation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Coru\u00f1a", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "A Coru\u00f1a"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "A Coru\u00f1a"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contraband", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Contraband"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_celebrity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internet celebrity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smuggling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Smuggling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prison", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prison"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Library"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prisons", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prisons", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.usanews.net/images/haberler/2024/05/_1df0f.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554956", "eventUri": "eng-9554956", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2013-09-", "textStart": 487, "textEnd": 501}], "sentiment": -0.5529411764705883, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

A decade after the investigation, Netflix has released The Asunta Case, a series that was widely received by the public and critics, becoming the most watched in our country.\n\nThe series narrates the murder of Asunta Basterra Porto, a 12-year-old girl of Chinese origin. The crime shocked the Spaniards due to its harshness, and the little girl's adoptive parents were convicted of murder.\n\nThe two perpetrators of the crime, Rosario Porto and Alfonso Basterra, have been starred in fiction by two great performers such as Candela Pe\u00f1a and Trist\u00e1n Ulloa. As for the figure of the judge, Javier Guti\u00e9rrez has been in charge of giving life to Jos\u00e9 Antonio V\u00e1zquez Ta\u00edn, the person in charge of handling the case.\n\nAfter the premiere of the fiction, the judge conducted an interview for the television program 'Vamos a ver' on Telecinco, where he shared his opinion regarding the actor who plays him: \"Javier Guti\u00e9rrez is a great actor and a great person,\" reveals the judge, making it clear that he has \"nothing to reproach.\"\n\nDespite his good words, V\u00e1zquez Ta\u00edn has made it clear that he has only seen one episode and does not intend to see it again. For what is this? According to the judge, Justice can be affected by the public's conclusions.\n\n\"I am concerned that it will once again be questioned whether Justice in Spain is correct and whether the evidence is manipulated. I did not judge those people (Rosario Porto and Alfonso Basterra), I was in charge of the instruction. Nine juries tried them and they determined it (their involvement in the crime) unanimously. So, trying again to sow doubts... I am calm,\" the magistrate says.\n\nFinally, the judge's biggest criticism focuses on the focus on fiction: \"It makes me very sorry.

He was also convicted of the same crime by her ex-husband Alfonso Basterra.\n\nAlthough the case shocked Spanish society in 2013, expectation has increased considerably now with the premiere of the series about the murder on Netflix. This fiction, starring Candela Pe\u00f1a and Trist\u00e1n Ulloa, has caused a real social stir and has made many viewers wonder what really happened to the condemned.\n\nIn the conversation with the prisoner, the reporter from the Spanish Television program verified that Porto was not an aggressive woman in prison, nor did she cause any type of problem or altercation with the rest of the inmates.\n\nAccording to the journalist who spoke with the witness, Rosario cried all the time and defended being a victim of her own family, the press, her ex-husband, society's comments, etc. ''For her, he was innocent and did not kill her, he always repeated it and cried a lot,'' the woman explained.\n\n''She always told me that her goal in life was to find her daughter's murderers. That was her goal. She always asked me 'do you think I killed her? Because of the way she acts... she wouldn't kill a fly (...) I think she didn't do it and I maintain it and I will always maintain it,' Rosario's former partner has expressed, leaving without words to the interviewer.\n\nThe woman has also made it clear in the conversation with the La 1 magazine that Porto suffered 'harassment' in prison and that they said all kinds of atrocities to her. Furthermore, she has explained that she was present at the time she was transferred to the \u00c1vila prison. According to Mar\u00eda, this decision was made without notifying Porto, something that, for her, could have led to her suicide.\n\nMar\u00eda explained that the Galician woman warned her of her intention to end her life when she found out about the transfer, since she did not feel strong enough to withstand the media pressure, among other things.\n\nThe different collaborators of the program presented by Jaime Cantizano have given their opinion on the testimony of the woman who committed suicide on November 18, 2020 in her cell in the Brieva prison, \u00c1vila.\n\nWhile some have pointed out that Porto decided to end her life because she could not face everything she was going to find when she went out into the street (she was about to receive her first permits), others have started a debate about whether the woman He should have been in another type of psychiatric center to avoid this outcome.", "source": {"uri": "usanews.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "USANews Press Release Network"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Televisi\u00f3n_Espa\u00f1ola", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Televisi\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosario,_Santa_Fe", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rosario, Santa Fe"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rosario, Santa Fe"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galicia_(Spain)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Galicia (Spain)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Galicia (Spain)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porto", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Porto"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Porto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Portugal"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candela_Pe\u00f1a", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Candela Pe\u00f1a"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trist\u00e1n_Ulloa", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trist\u00e1n Ulloa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journalist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Journalist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_1_(Spanish_TV_channel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "La 1 (Spanish TV channel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaime_Cantizano", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jaime Cantizano"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Suicide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Province_of_\u00c1vila", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Province of \u00c1vila"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Province of \u00c1vila"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 50}], "image": "https://www.usanews.net/images/haberler/2024/05/_7fc68.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554956", "eventUri": "eng-9554956", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2020-11-18", "textStart": 2558, "textEnd": 2575}], "sentiment": -0.4901960784313726, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

Asunta was taken in by a wealthy family in Santiago de Compostela, consisting of Rosario Porto Ortega, the mother and inheritor of substantial wealth, a lawyer by profession, and Alfonso Basterra, the father, a journalist.\n\nBoth were sentenced to eighteen years in prison by the renowned judge Jos\u00e9 Antonio V\u00e1zquez Ta\u00edn, who deemed them responsible for the murder of the young girl, allegedly administering the drug Lorazepam to her over several months. Basterra remains incarcerated serving his sentence, while the lawyer chose to end her life on 18 November 2020, by hanging herself with a sheet inside Brieva prison, in \u00c1vila.\n\nWhat was Asunta's mother's fortune?\n\nPorto Ortega was the financial backbone of the family. Following in the footsteps of her father, Francisco, and her grandmother, Socorro, a university professor, she enjoyed a comfortable life and amassed a multi-million fortune, estimated at around three million euros (c.$3.23m), comprising cash in accounts and properties. This sum was diminished after funding her defense, yet remained substantial following her demise.\n\nAware of this, she prepared her will before the trial, wherein one of her childhood friends, Mar\u00eda Teresa Sampedro Portas, known as \"La Nena\" (The Baby), emerged as a significant beneficiary, remaining loyal to her even after her death.\n\nHow was Asunta's parents' inheritance distributed?\n\nSampedro, who was already a friend of Porto Ortega's, emerged as the most favored recipient of Rosario Porto's legacy. Asunta's mother sought to reward her in some manner for her unwavering support, especially when her entire social circle and family turned away from her following her conviction for the death of her daughter. Sampedro collected Asunta's ashes, visited her mother in Galician prisons, and ceased doing so only when her transfer to \u00c1vila coincided with the pandemic lockdown.\n\nShe also took care of the funeral expenses and burial in Santiago, at Boisaca, alongside her daughter. In her will, Rosario designated this woman and the lawyer Juan Guill\u00e1n, who initially assisted her upon her arrest, as heirs, along with the defense attorney who later handled the case, Jos\u00e9 Luis Guti\u00e9rrez Aranguren, a distant cousin, and two supportive inmates from her time in Galicia.\n\nThe lawyers waived their share, while the cousin and fellow inmates did accept their portions, which included Socorro Ortega's jewelry. Consequently, nearly all assets fell into Sampedro's hands: the paintings, sculptures, cash from the accounts (approximately half a million euros), and the real estate properties.\n\nThere were four properties: the famous villa in Teo, where the young girl allegedly died, the grandparents' apartment on General Pardi\u00f1as Street in Santiago, the larger one on Doctor Teixeiro Street shared by Asunta and her mother, and a beach residence in Vilanova de Arousa. By selling the first apartment, the heiress settled the corresponding estate taxes, and she recently put the other one up for rent. She enjoys the summer house with her family, but the Teo estate poses challenges as she has been unable to sell it, and although it was occupied for a time, it is now in poor condition.", "source":

Netflix consumption data indicates yes. After leading in its first week among non-English language series (and coming in second place among all television content only behind the My Stuffed Reindeer phenomenon), it repeats this position in the second. Let's hope for more crime series from the Netflix fiction department in Spain.\n\nThe series with Candela Pe\u00f1a and Trist\u00e1n Ulloa as Rosario Porto and Alfonso Basterra, the parents and murderers of Asunta, added 11.9 million views and a total of 64.7 million hours watched among the platform's subscribers. The data, therefore, refute the hypothesis that the miniseries had a high expectation due to the knowledge of the murder case but a brief journey: in its first weekend it had 5.4 million views with 29.4 million hours seen.\n\nThe audience also confirms an upward trend with respect to The Body on Fire, released in September 2023 and with a similar profile by adapting iconic cases from recent black chronicle. The series with \u00darsula Corber\u00f3 and Quim Guti\u00e9rrez added 6.7 million views with 43.9 million hours watched. Therefore, The Burning Body was seen by 10.8 million accounts in its first ten days while The Asunta Case has 17.3 million.\n\nIt also improves the data for Iron Hand, the platform's March bet with a stellar cast with Eduard Fern\u00e1ndez, Sergi L\u00f3pez, Enric Auquer, Jaime Lorente, Natalia de Molina and Chino Dar\u00edn. After ten days on the platform, it had accumulated 6.9 million views with 57.3 million hours watched.\n\nOf course, it is far from the data from Berlin, which after two weeks in the Netflix catalog already had 33.6 million views from 220.7 million hours watched. It cannot be overlooked that it was a spin-off of La casa de papel, one of the most popular and recognizable brands on the platform, and that it premiered on dates of high television consumption during the Christmas holidays.\n\nOn an international level, My Stuffed Reindeer continues its reign after four weeks: with 18.6 million new views, it has accumulated a total of 56.5 million views from 224.2 million hours watched.

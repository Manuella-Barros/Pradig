Douglas said the overhaul being done at the US manufacturer will act as a reset for leadership, adding that a new management team \"has to stay absolutely focused and get back to basics.\"", "source": {"uri": "bnnbloomberg.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "BNN"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riyadh_Air", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Riyadh Air"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Aircraft_Company", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Douglas Aircraft Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_L.P.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg L.P."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qatar_Airways", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Qatar Airways"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emirates_(airline)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Emirates (airline)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airline", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Airline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Air_Show", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paris Air Show"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_livery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aircraft livery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narrow-body_aircraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Narrow-body aircraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_Television", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg Television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_787_Dreamliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boeing 787 Dreamliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etihad_Airways", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Etihad Airways"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hajj", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hajj"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbus", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Airbus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aviation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Dhabi", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Abu Dhabi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Abu Dhabi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Aerospace", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Aerospace", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Multimedia", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Multimedia", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 97}], "image": "http://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/polopoly_fs/1.2069178!/fileimage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_620/tony-douglas-at-the-dubai-air-show-in-dubai-in-november.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542676", "eventUri": "eng-9542676", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 220, "relevance": 1}

The airline's executive noted that discussions are ongoing with both aircraft manufacturers. So far, Riyadh Air has only ordered the Boeing 787-9 for its scheduled start of operations in 2025. SIMPLEFLYING VIDEO OF THE DAY SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT\n\nRiyadh Air, the Saudi Arabian airline that is scheduled to start operations in 2025, is nearing an order for narrowbody from either Airbus or Boeing, with the airline's executive only saying that discussions were ongoing with both manufacturers.\n\nDone within the coming weeks\n\nAccording to Vincent Coste, the chief commercial officer (CCO) of Riyadh Air, the airline's order for narrowbody jets should be done within the next weeks, as reported by Reuters. However, Coste emphasized that the carrier was in no rush to announce the order, with the executive refusing to detail whether the airline would trust either Airbus or Boeing to produce its narrowbody aircraft.\n\nPhoto: Riyadh Air\n\nCoste, who has worked at Air France, Air France-KLM, Qatar Airways, Kenya Airways, and Gulf Air before landing his latest role at Riyadh Air in July 2022, according to his LinkedIn profile, the Saudi airline should start selling tickets in January ahead of its launch in June 2025.\n\nRelated How Tony Douglas Is Building Riyadh Air To Be A Better Airline Getting to grips with a brand-new airline is a dream come true for Riyadh Air's CEO. Boeing 787 fleet\n\nSo far, Riyadh Air has only ordered a batch of Boeing 787 aircraft. In March 2023, shortly after the Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fund (PIF), the country's sovereign wealth fund spearheaded by Mohammed bin Salman, announced the launch of the airline, Riyadh Air ordered 72 Boeing 787-9 aircraft, split between 39 firm orders and 33 options.\n\nOn the same day, SAUDIA, another Saudi Arabian airline, announced an order for up to 49 Boeing 787 aircraft, with the deal involving 39 firm orders and ten options for 787-9 and 787-10 aircraft. Eventually, Riyadh Air disclosed that its first Boeing 787 aircraft should arrive in 2025 ahead of its launch later in the year.\n\nPhoto: Riyadh Air\n\nHowever, the airline has already unveiled two liveries with two different Boeing 787-9 aircraft, namely an all-white livery with blue and lavender accents and a striking paintjob that covers the whole fuselage with a dark lavender color.\n\nRelated Riyadh Air Reveals Its Second Livery - Yes, It's White Today marks the beginning of the Dubai Airshow, where Riyadh Air is expected to unveil its second livery and place an order for more aircraft. Complicated delivery schedule\n\nWhichever way Riyadh Air's pendulum will swing, the delivery schedule could be complicated for the Saudi Arabian airline, considering that both Airbus and Boeing have sold out delivery slots for years to come due to the high demand for their single-aisle jets.\n\nWhile one option could be going for delivery slots held by aircraft lessor, the problem is compounded by the fact that both manufacturers are still struggling with supply chain issues, which weigh down their ability to hand over aircraft on time.\n\nPhoto: Skycolors | Shutterstock\n\nFor Boeing, the Alaska Airlines flight AS1282 incident in January has only made the issue worse, with the manufacturer voluntarily lowering its production volume to address the safety and quality issues at its assembly sites. Furthermore, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has said that until it was satisfied with the manufacturer's improvements in both aspects, it would be unable to raise production rates beyond the current approved monthly rate for the 737 MAX, namely 38 per month.\n\nRelated FAA: Boeing Must Not Increase 737 MAX Production Rate Until Quality Issues Are Fixed The FAA was adamant that Boeing would not produce more 737 MAX per month until it addressed the quality issues surrounding the 737 MAX program.", "source": {"uri": "simpleflying.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Simple Flying"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riyadh_Air", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Riyadh Air"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narrow-body_aircraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Narrow-body aircraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbus", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Airbus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_787_Dreamliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing 787 Dreamliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airline", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Airline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Investment_Fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Public Investment Fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammed_bin_Salman", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mohammed bin Salman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_France\u2013KLM", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Air France\u2013KLM"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_livery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aircraft livery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenya_Airways", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kenya Airways"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_Air", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gulf Air"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Aircraft_Company", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Douglas Aircraft Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_wealth_fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sovereign wealth fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_France", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Air France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qatar_Airways", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Qatar Airways"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dubai_Airshow", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dubai Airshow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_lease", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aircraft lease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_between_Airbus_and_Boeing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Competition between Airbus and Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuselage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fuselage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska_Airlines", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alaska Airlines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_737_MAX", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boeing 737 MAX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supply chain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Aviation_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Aviation Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Multimedia", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Multimedia", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://static1.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/riyadh-air-boeing-787-on-display-shutterstock_2426945367.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542676", "eventUri": "eng-9542676", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

FAA initially allowed jetliners to operate routes two hours away from an accommodating airport in 1985, increasing later to 180 minutes and sometimes 240 minutes. The Airbus A330 became the first aircraft to receive an ETOPS-240 approval, surpassing the previous maximum rating of 180, in February 2007. SIMPLEFLYING VIDEO OF THE DAY SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT\n\nAlthough ETOPS is an acronym for \"Extended-range Twin-engine Operations Performance Standards,\" it is also humorously known as \"engines turn or passengers swim.\" The acronym ETOPS was developed by ICAO and refers to an aircraft flying over oceans or remote patches of land whilst being \"a point further than one hour's flying time from an adequate airport at the approved one-engine inoperative cruise speed.\"\n\nWhy was ETOPS necessary? A brief dive into its origins\n\nWhen modern twin jets were developed, it necessitated changes to old rules, which were only applicable to aircraft that were not as advanced as their modern counterparts. The aircraft of years gone by were not as reliable or capable as the ones that currently take to the skies, so the civil aviation regulatory authorities had to come up with a new set of rules.\n\nPhoto: GCMap\n\nAccording to Airbus, the purpose of an ETOPS is:\n\n\" to provide very high levels of safety while facilitating the use of twinjets on routes which were previously restricted to three- and four-engined aircraft. ETOPS operations also permit more effective use of an airline's resources.\"\n\nIn the past, 4-engine piston aircraft often landed at airports with one of its engines not functioning properly. For aircraft with four engines, that didn't matter, as there were three more with which to complete the trip. However, twin-engine aircraft did not have such redundancy, and so were restricted from being able to operate direct paths.\n\nTwin jets had to remain within range of an adequate airport. However, the flights of a three or four-engine aircraft weren't subjected to this rule.\n\nBut technology moved on, and in 1985, The Federal Aviation Administration(FAA) changed the rules to allow jetliners to operate along paths two hours away from an accommodating airport. Three years later, the FAA approved flights along paths that were 180 minutes away from an accommodating airport. In modern times, the approved maximum has increased to 240 minutes, though not in all circumstances.\n\nRelated ETOPS: How The Boeing 737 & Airbus A321 Changed Hawaii Aviation The islands' development was changed significantly. The development of ETOPS Early ETOPS\n\nThe first twin-engine widebody aircraft was the Airbus A300. Since 1976, the aircraft had been flying under a 90-minute IACO rule across the Bay of Bengal, the North Atlantic, and the Indian Ocean. It has been reported that the then Boeing director of engineering, Dick Taylor, approached the director of FAA, J. Lynn Helms, to wonder if an exemption could be granted. J. Lynn Helms, then retorted:\n\n\"It'll be a cold day in hell before I let twins fly long haul, overwater routes. The requirement for three- or four-engine aircraft for oceanic flight will continue for quite some time, and I don't mean only a year or two.\"\n\nA year after the Boeing 767-200ER entered service, the FAA increased the ETOPS to 120 minutes at single-engine cruise speed.\n\nPhoto: Vladsinger via Wikimedia.\n\nThe first certification of 120-minute ETOPS was given to Trans World Airlines (TWA) in 1985. The certification came for their Boeing 767 aircraft which was to fly from Boston to Paris. Despite an aircraft having an ETOPS rating, the airlines that operated back then also needed special provisions. This meant special maintenance plans, special fuel quantities, special cabin, flight crew, dispatchers, among other things.\n\nThe introduction of ETOPS 180\n\nFAA's regulations of 1985 meant that an aircraft could be given an ETOPS 120 rating on its entry into service. However, an aircraft had to fly trouble-free for a year before it could be granted an ETOPS 180 rating. This changed with the introduction of the Boeing 777 in 1990, as the 777 became the first aircraft with an ETOPS rating of 180 right at its entry into service.\n\nBeyond ETOPS 180\n\nIn February 2007, the FAA decreed that an aircraft could have an ETOPS rating of more than 180 if the operators had a US-registered twin-engine airplane. The first aircraft to receive an ETOPS 240 rating was the Airbus A330.\n\nSource: GCMaps Some milestones of ETOPS certification 1985: The first ETOPS operations (90 minutes) began in February with a Boeing 767 operated by Trans World Airlines (TWA) and later in June by Singapore Airlines with an Airbus A310. 1986: The first transatlantic revenue service with A310-200 and A310-300 aircraft began. 1990: The Airbus A310-324 (PW4000) became the first FADEC engine-powered aircraft to receive FAA's ETOPS approval. 1990: The Boeing 777 became the first aircraft to get an ETOPS 180 rating. 1991: The Airbus A320 was the first fly-by-wire aircraft to be approved for ETOPS operations with 120 minutes diversion time 2009: the Airbus A330 became the first aircraft to receive ETOPS-240 approval, 2011: The Boeing 777 series received type-design approval from the FAA for operations up to 330 minutes. 2015: Boeing 747-8 Intercontinental became the first four-engine aircraft to receive the ETOPS 330 approval. Related What Are ETOPS Rules And Why Do They Matter? ETOPS determines how far any twin-engine aircraft can fly. ETOPS certification\n\nBoth the aircraft and the airline need to comply with certain standards for an ETOPS certification. The manufacturer of an aircraft must demonstrate that the crew can operate flights with one engine. The airframe must also be shown to be safe. The airline must demonstrate high standards of flight crew training and maintenance procedures. Therefore, aircraft dispatchers, pilots, and engineers must all be properly certified.", "source": {"uri": "simpleflying.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Simple Flying"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ETOPS", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "ETOPS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twinjet", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Twinjet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Aviation_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Aviation Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_airliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jet airliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Civil_Aviation_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International Civil Aviation Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_aviation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Civil aviation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbus_A330", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Airbus A330"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbus", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Airbus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aviation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbus_A321", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Airbus A321"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_certificate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Type certificate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans_World_Airlines", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trans World Airlines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_767", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boeing 767"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbus_A310", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Airbus A310"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbus_A300", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Airbus A300"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_of_Bengal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bay of Bengal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indian Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide-body_aircraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wide-body aircraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_737", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boeing 737"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atlantic Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaii", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hawaii"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hawaii"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pratt_&_Whitney_PW4000", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pratt & Whitney PW4000"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore_Airlines", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Singapore Airlines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Aeronautical", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Aeronautical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Aircraft", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Aircraft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Aviation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://static1.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/artboard-16_9-21.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542676", "eventUri": "eng-9542676", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2007-02-", "textStart": 559, "textEnd": 572, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 125, "relevance": 1}

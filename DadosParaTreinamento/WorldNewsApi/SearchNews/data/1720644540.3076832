{"id": 231222498, "title": "Election results: Coalition  cautiously optimistic with early tallies amid questions over number of Sinn F\u00e9in candidates", "text": "The three Coalition parties are cautiously welcoming the results of early tallies in the local and European elections, with questions being asked around whether Sinn F\u00e9in has run too many candidates nationwide. Sources in the Green Party believe it is polling ahead of expectations, while Fine Gael is cautiously optimistic that its result will be in line with recent opinion polls. It also looks set to be a good weekend for Independent candidates. Ballot boxes started to opened around the country from 9am with a flurry of tallies being finalised for the local and European elections and the mayoral vote in Limerick. There are 949 council seats and 14 European Parliament seats up for grabs. Fine Gael sources estimate that the party is averaging about 22 per cent nationwide based on tallies. Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s vote is expected to increase, with the party potentially on course to recover from losing half of its council seats in 2019. Anecdotally, however, many of the Sinn F\u00e9in candidates added to ballot papers, who may be first-time candidates or relative unknowns, appear to be struggling. Labour sources say the national picture for them is still \u201cunclear\u201d but there is optimism about early indications in areas such as Drogheda and Cork. With more than 60 per cent of boxes tallied in Dublin\u2019s North Inner City, Fine Gael\u2019s Ray McAdams looked set to top the poll. Independent anti-immigrant candidate Malachy Steenson could be in with a chance of winning a seat based on early tallies. Fine Gael expects to gain a seat in Swords, with 22-year-old first timer Luke Corkery on track to achieve a quota on first count. In Castlecomer, Co Kilkenny, tallies show strong support for Fianna F\u00e1il and Fine Gael. [ Live: Follow results from around the country as they come in ] With 84 per cent of boxes tallied in Dublin\u2019s South West Inner City, Green Party councillor Michael Pidgeon was leading the pack with 19 per cent of first preference votes. The Green Party is also optimistic that Caroline Conroy in Ballymun-Finglas could win a seat despite internal figures being pessimistic about her chances here in the lead-up to the elections. Fianna F\u00e1il is also polling well in Ballymun-Finglas with Keith Connolly and Briege McOscar both firmly in the mix. In the Edenderry, with 20 per cent of the boxes been tallied, Fianna F\u00e1il has been polling strongly with Eddie Fitzpatrick on 18.6 per cent and his party colleague Claire Murray on 15.3 per cent. Early indications from Ballinamore, Co Leitrim suggest a strong vote for Fine Gael and Sinn F\u00e9in. In Meath, with 50 boxes opened out of 234, Fine Gael was on 24 per cent and Fianna F\u00e1il was on 22 per cent, with Sinn F\u00e9in (15 per cent), Social Democrats (5 per cent), Aont\u00fa (6 per cent), Green Party (1 per cent) and Independent/others (27 per cent). Independent councillors Joe Bonner in Ashbourne and Noel French in Trim look likely to top the poll in their areas. Tallies from the Birr local electoral area for Offaly County Council show Fine Gael\u2019s John Clendennen with 21 per cent of first preference votes. In Monaghan, with almost half of the boxes counted, tallies had Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s Cathy Bennett leading on 15.19 per cent, followed by Fianna F\u00e1il\u2019s Raymond Aughey (11.16 per cent) and Independent S\u00e9amus Treanor (11.13 per cent). It was a brighter picture, too, for Sinn F\u00e9in in Dublin\u2019s North Inner City, where, with 44 per cent of boxes opened, Janice Boylan was taking 15.5 per cent of first preference votes. In the Connemara North area of Galway County Council, tallies suggest that Independent councillor Tom Welby will top the poll. Another Independent, M\u00e1nus \u00d3 Conaire, and S\u00e9amus Walsh of Independant Ireland are also polling strongly. In Kerry, with all boxes opened in Castleisland, Jackie Healy-Rae, son of Kerry TD Michael Michael Healy-Rae, is polling very well. Tallies show he has secured 2,892 votes, or 30.2 per cent, meaning he should be elected on the first count with a surplus. In the EU elections, early tallies were running broadly in line with recent polls. In Ireland South, initial tallies from Co Clare were showing Billy Kelleher of Fianna F\u00e1il and Se\u00e1n Kelly of Fine Gael performing strongly. Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s Kathleen Funchion and Fianna F\u00e1il\u2019s Cynthia N\u00ed Mhurch\u00fa were said to be polling well in Carlow. In Dublin, Barry Andrews of Fianna F\u00e1il is attracting many first preferences. Labour stalwart Kevin Humphreys told RT\u00c9 Radio 1 that early tallies show Mr Andrews and Fine Gael\u2019s Regina Doherty are in with a shot of taking a seat. A number of boxes from Dublin City Council areas also suggest support for Independent Clare Daly. In Midlands-North-West, early tallies show Fianna F\u00e1il\u2019s Barry Cowen polling well in his home county of Offaly. Ex-RTE Midlands correspondent Ciaran Mullooly, who is running for Independent Ireland, looks to have strong support, as does Fine Gael\u2019s Nina Carberry, a former jockey, and her party colleague Maria Walsh. Independent Luke \u2018Ming\u2019 Flanagan, who is hoping to hold on to his seat, is also doing well. Meanwhile, tallies for the position of Limerick City Mayor show Independent candidate John Moran leading in both the city and county areas followed closely by Helen O\u2019Donnell, also Independent.

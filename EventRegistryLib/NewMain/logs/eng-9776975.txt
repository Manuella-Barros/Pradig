The stake would make him the single largest investor in the purveyor of Birkin handbags and colorful silk scarves founded in 1837. The company has since expanded into one of the biggest players in the global luxury industry and made the family Europe's wealthiest. The clan, which counts more than a 100 members, has a net worth of about $155 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\n\nThe decision by an appeals court in Geneva on July 12 found no evidence that financial adviser Eric Freymond mismanaged Puech's fortune or that the reclusive fifth-generation Herm\u00e8s heir was duped over a period spanning more than two decades during which time at least some of the stock was sold.\n\n\"The 'gigantic fraud' to which he was victim was undetectable to common mortals,\" the court document read, adding that the allegations lacked clarity and were insufficiently backed up.\n\nA lawyer for Puech, Gregoire Mangeat, declined to comment, while Freymond's lawyers, Yannis Sakkas and Stephane Grodecki, said their client was satisfied with the outcome that included \"harsh words\" against the plaintiff. The case was first reported by online magazine Gotham City.\n\nLasting Enigma\n\nThe court decision is part of the fallout of an attempt by luxury tycoon Bernard Arnault, founder of LVMH, to gain control of Herm\u00e8s more than a decade ago. He failed, but Puech became a family outcast over his alleged role in the way Arnault stealthily amassed a stake in the company.\n\nThe fate of Puech's roughly 5.7% stake remains a lasting enigma from the showdown, which ended in 2014 when Arnault started unwinding his 23% holding and Puech quit the Herm\u00e8s supervisory board.\n\nIn a sign the stake is still a preoccupation, on an earnings call Thursday an analyst quizzed Herm\u00e8s Executive Chairman Axel Dumas about whether Puech owns the shares. \"We don't have a way to see and control them,\" Dumas replied.\n\nThe Swiss decision leaves the question of the shares' whereabouts unanswered. It does, however, offer a peek into Puech's current circumstances.\n\nLast year, the resident of Orsieres in the Swiss canton of Valais, described in public documents as a French national with an education in the arts, sought to cancel his inheritance contract with his Isocrates Foundation after reportedly starting administrative procedures to adopt his middle-aged gardener to whom he would bequeath some of his fortune. The decision left the charity in limbo and it has since postponed new grants.\n\nIn the Swiss case, Puech alleged his wealth almost entirely came from his shares in Herm\u00e8s and that he no longer owns any of them, but didn't realize it because Freymond received all his bank statements. The court document describes a 24-year period during which Puech relied on Freymond to manage his fortune.\n\nStarting in 1998, Puech began transferring to Swiss banks Herm\u00e8s shares that would eventually number 6 million. From that year, he gave Freymond a series of signed mandates to oversee his accounts. Beginning in 2001, shares were sold, bought and transferred through one of the banks.\n\nCrucially, a profit of \u20ac53.7 million was recorded on share sales over a nearly two-year period through October 2010, the same month Arnault revealed to the Herm\u00e8s family that he had amassed a stake in the company. Puech had no \"objections\" to the entry of the outside investor into the Herm\u00e8s shareholding and even considered him an \"ally,\" according to evidence described in the court document. His family, however, mounted a strategy that ultimately succeeded in keeping Arnault at bay.\n\nEquity Swaps\n\nPuech canceled Freymond's mandates in October 2022, set out to take stock of his wealth and organize his succession, according to the Swiss ruling. A year later he filed three cases against Freymond, the first alleging the wealth manager withheld information, and wouldn't and couldn't return the Herm\u00e8s shares. The others related to management of his foundation, loans and other investments.\n\nThe court ruling concluded that Puech willingly turned over management of his affairs to Freymond, including by signing numerous blank documents and giving access to his bank accounts. Puech never said he was duped or didn't understand what he was signing, only that he left choices on growing his wealth to Freymond. He could have revoked their agreement at any time, the court said.\n\n\"It's not clear who prevented the plaintiff from taking an interest in how his assets were evolving,\" the court found. Puech's \"blind trust\" in Freymond is not an indication of the wealth manager's dishonesty.\n\n-With assistance from Hugo Miller, Angelina Rascouet and Gaspard Sebag.", "source": {"uri":

Now, a Swiss court has thrown out Puech's claims that his wealth advisor allegedly mismanaged his Herm\u00e8s shares, valued at approximately $13 billion, leaving him with nothing, Bloomberg reported.\n\nMore from Robb Report\n\nAccording to Puech's lawyers, the heir owned about 6 million shares, making him the largest investor in Herm\u00e8s International SCA history -- though he know longer holds the assets. In the case, the fifth-generation heir accused his financial manager, Eric Freymond, of \"gigantic fraud\" over the two decades in which all of his shares were sold.\n\nThe court ultimately ruled against Puech's allegations, noting that he had \"blind trust\" in Freymond and could have revoked his agreement at any time in the 24-month period. In addition, it found that Puech willingly allowed Freymond to manage his money, including giving the advisor access to his bank accounts. \"It's not clear who prevented the plaintiff from taking an interest in how his assets were evolving,\" the court found.\n\nPuech canceled his mandates with Freymond in October 2022 and, a year later, filed three different lawsuits against his former wealth manager, according to Bloomberg. The first case alleged that Freymond withheld information and wouldn't return his Herm\u00e8s shares. The other two had to with overseeing Puech's charity, loans, and other investments.\n\nOne of Europe's wealthiest families, the Herm\u00e8s clan has a combined net worth of roughly $155 billion, per the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.

The heir ultimately left the Herm\u00e8s supervisory board in 2014, taking his about 5.7 percent stake with him.\n\n\"He resigned because he has felt for several years beleaguered by members of his family, who have attacked him on several fronts, not only regarding LVMH,\" a spokesperson for Puech told AFP at the time.\n\nSince the ruling concluded on July 12, the whereabouts of Puech's missing stocks are still unclear -- but we bet a certain gardener is waiting for them to turn up.", "source": {"uri": "finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

This shocking development was first reported by Swiss investigative news outlet Gotham City.\n\nHowever, a Swiss court dismissed Puech's allegations earlier this month, describing the alleged fraud as \"undetectable to common mortals,\" according to Bloomberg. The Tribune de Gen\u00e8ve added that while the stock was deposited in a Geneva bank in 2012, the shares' current whereabouts are unclear.\n\nNicolas Puech\n\nGeneva's Public Prosecutor's Office had previously declined to investigate Puech's claims. The court's decision on July 24 supported the prosecutors' choice.

This revelation came to light following a legal battle with a former financial advisor, whom Puech accused of misappropriating the vast wealth.\n\nAccording to Puech's lawyers, he owned about 6 million shares, making him the largest investor in Herm\u00e8s International SCA history -- though he no longer holds the assets. The fifth-generation heir accused his financial manager, Eric Freymond, of \"gigantic fraud\" over the two decades in which all of his shares were sold.\n\nPuech, 81, had previously made headlines with his generous pledge to bequeath half of his fortune to his gardener. The Swiss courts have now dismissed Puech's claims against his advisor, citing a lack of evidence to support allegations of theft or mismanagement.\n\nIn the ruling, the court noted that he had \"blind trust\" in Freymond and while he could have revoked his agreement at any time in the 24-month period, he did not do so. It also noted that Puech willingly, and of his own agency, allowed Freymond to manage his money, including giving the advisor access to his bank accounts. \"It's not clear who prevented the plaintiff from taking an interest in how his assets were evolving,\" the court found.\n\nPuech had resigned from the Herm\u00e8s supervisory board in 2014, taking his 5.7 percent stake with him. \"He resigned because he has felt for several years beleaguered by members of his family, who have attacked him on several fronts, not only regarding LVMH,\" a spokesperson for Puech told AFP at the time.\n\nThe Herm\u00e8s brand, synonymous with luxury and exclusivity, has been a family-controlled entity since its inception in 1837. The Puech family, along with other heirs, collectively hold a significant portion of the company's wealth.\n\nThe case has captured the public's imagination, with its dramatic twists and turns reminiscent of a plot from a high-stakes drama series. Journalists and the media have followed the developments closely, noting the familial tensions and the complex web of relationships that define the Herm\u00e8s dynasty. Nicolas's decision to leave a substantial part of his wealth to his gardener, whom he considered akin to a son, and the subsequent fallout, has added layers of intrigue to the narrative.\n\nAs the legal proceedings unfolded, it became apparent that the heart of the matter was not just about the missing billions but also about trust, loyalty, and the dynamics of power within one of Europe's wealthiest families. The court's ruling has left more questions than answers, with the whereabouts of the $13 billion fortune still a mystery.\n\nThe Herm\u00e8s family, with a combined net worth of approximately $155 billion, remains a formidable force in the luxury fashion industry. Despite the personal setbacks and the enigmatic disappearance of Nicolas Puech's fortune, the brand continues to thrive, catering to a clientele that includes celebrities and influential figures across the globe.\n\nThe case is not unique in the context of wealth management and the importance of oversight, especially when complicated by internal family disputes.", "source": {"uri": "lavocedinewyork.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "La Voce di New York"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolas_Puech", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nicolas Puech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herm\u00e8s", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Herm\u00e8s"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_adviser", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Financial adviser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_business", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Family business"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synonym", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Synonym"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LVMH", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "LVMH"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_trust", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Blind trust"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervisory_board", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supervisory board"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theft", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Theft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaintiff", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Plaintiff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Setback_(architecture)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Setback (architecture)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wealth_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wealth management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fashion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_worth", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Net worth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agence_France-Presse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Agence France-Presse"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Whistleblowing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Whistleblowing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://lavocedinewyork.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/hermes.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9776975", "eventUri": "eng-9776975", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 213, "relevance": 1}

The luxury brand is favored by everyone from Melania Trump to Taylor Swift.\n\nThe wider Hermes family of about 100 heirs has a combined net worth of about $155 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Nicolas's brother, Bertrand Puech, was one of the wealthiest people in the world. The pair had a sometimes difficult relationship, in part because of tussles for control of the family shares.\n\nJournalist Sylvain Besson from the French media group Tamedia has been documenting the case since December and believes the many twists and turns in the case are worthy of a Netflix drama.\n\nSpeaking to the Lemanblue TV channel, she said that Puech, now based in Valais in Switzerland, is at odds with some of his family.\n\nPuech fired his Geneva financial manager, Eric Freymond, two years ago.\n\nAccording to Besson, Freymond had advised Peuch against his plan to leave about $6.5 billion to his Moroccan gardener, whom he considered as a son. The gardener's wife, from Spain, was often introduced as his daughter.\n\nIn another dramatic move, Peuch severed his relationship with an education charity that was due to receive the bulk of his fortune after his death.\n\nThat left the charity with a budget crisis and it had to cancel some programs.\n\nThat still leaves a huge mystery at the center of the case -- where is Peuch's $13 billion fortune?\n\nThe court case hasn't answered that question, except to absolve Freymond of any wrongdoing.\n\nThe appeal court seemed very unimpressed by Peuch's argument, noting that the \"enormous fraud\" that Peuch had alleged was \"undetectable to common mortals.\"\n\nNewsweek sought email comment on Tuesday from Puech's lawyer Gregoire Mangeat and from Freymond's lawyer, Yannis Sakkas.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, which has also been covering the case, the appeal court decision \"is part of the fallout of an attempt by luxury tycoon Bernard Arnault, founder of LVMH, to gain control of Herm\u00e8s more than a decade ago.\"\n\n\"He failed, but Puech became a family outcast over his alleged role in the way Arnault stealthily amassed a stake in the company.\"\n\nIt also noted that \"the fate of Puech's roughly 5.7% stake remains a lasting enigma from the showdown, which ended in 2014 when Arnault started unwinding his 23% holding and Puech quit the Herm\u00e8s supervisory board.\"", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sean_o_driscoll@newsweek.com", "name": "Sean O'Driscoll", "type": "author",

In November 2023, it said it would no longer accept new funding requests.\n\nRead the original article on Business Insider", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.nl", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider Nederland"}, "authors": [{"uri": "geoff_weiss@businessinsider.nl", "name": "Geoff Weiss", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolas_Puech", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nicolas Puech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herm\u00e8s", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Herm\u00e8s"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_L.P.", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg L.P."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thierry_Herm\u00e8s", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thierry Herm\u00e8s"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneva", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Geneva"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Geneva"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribune_de_Gen\u00e8ve", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tribune de Gen\u00e8ve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Public company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inheritance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inheritance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Saddle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Status_symbol", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Status symbol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Insider", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Business Insider"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonprofit_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nonprofit organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Journalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://i.insider.com/66a947d1fb6d32635ee51167?format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9776975", "eventUri": "eng-9776975", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-24", "textStart": 1157, "textEnd": 1164}], "sentiment": -0.08235294117647063, "wgt": 206, "relevance": 1}

The Swiss newspaper Tribune de Gen\u00e8ve reported that the Geneva court rejected Puech's claim against his former financial advisor, Eric Freymond. An appeals court ruled that Puech had failed to present any evidence of wrongdoing.\n\nPuech, once one of the largest stakeholders in Herm\u00e8s fired his financial manager, Freymond, two years ago. Freymond had advised against Puech's plan to leave approximately $6.5 billion to his Moroccan gardener, whom he considered as a son. The gardener's wife, from Spain, was often introduced as his daughter.\n\nIn another dramatic twist, Puech severed ties with an education charity that was set to receive the bulk of his fortune after his death, leaving the charity in a budget crisis.\n\nThe central mystery remains: Where is Puech's $13 billion fortune? The court case has yet to answer that question, but it has cleared Freymond of any wrongdoing.\n\nThe wider Herm\u00e8s family, comprising about 100 heirs, boasts a combined net worth of approximately $155 billion.

That's because the running of his accounts had been handed to Freymond, with the wealth manager receiving all of Puech's bank statements.\n\nHowever, an appeals court in Geneva threw out this claim, Bloomberg reports, saying there was no evidence Freymond had hoodwinked his reclusive client over the two decades they worked together.\n\nThe court added Puech signed numerous blank documents over to Freymond and willingly gave him control of his accounts, per Bloomberg.\n\nBut it seems the battle isn't over yet. Gr\u00e9goire Mangeat and Fanny Margairaz, Puech's newly-appointed lawyers, told Fortune they were \"in the process of studying the criminal file in detail\".\n\nThey added they had nothing further to comment at this stage.\n\nIn a damning rebuttal to the case, Bloomberg reported the court found the \"'gigantic fraud' to which [Puech] was victim was undetectable to common mortals.\"\n\nStephane Grodecki, who represented Freymond, told Fortune: \"My client is shocked by the accusation of his former client.\"\n\nGrodecki added his client \"never handled\" the historicHerm\u00e8s stock and continued: \"My client will now examine all his legal possibility to defend his honor\".\n\nThey told media outlets they were satisfied with the outcome which included \"harsh words\" for the plaintiff.\n\nFurther discord relating to Puech's fortune is the philanthropic foundation he set up in 2011.\n\nPuech -- who is a resident of the Alpine Swiss retreat of Valais -- launched the Isocrates Foundation to support public interest journalism and media organizations.\n\nBut late last year the foundation said it had \"learned of its founder's wish to cancel the contract of inheritance binding him to the foundation.\"\n\nIt said the foundation was legally bound to Puech through a \"contract of inheritance\" signed in September 2011.\n\n\"From a legal point of view, a unilateral cancellation of the contract of inheritance seems void and unfounded,\" the foundation added in December 2023. \"The foundation has therefore opposed the cancellation of the contract, while leaving the door open for discussions with its founder.\"\n\nThe statement said it does not wish to \"judge or comment\" on Puech's plan to adopt his employee, and \"continues to favor dialogue with its founder.\"", "source": {"uri": "fortune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fortune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "eleanor_pringle@fortune.com", "name": "Eleanor Pringle", "type": "author", "isAgency":

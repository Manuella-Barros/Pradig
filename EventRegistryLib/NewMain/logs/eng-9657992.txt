He's a leader now, I think he's turning into a leader. I think our link-up play is good at times and I think it's improving as well, and can keep getting better. So he's an exciting talent and I enjoy playing with him.\"\n\nFoden's performance against Serbia was criticised by former England striker Ian Wright and ex-Spain midfielder Cesc Fabregas.\n\nWright said: \"I don't think Phil Foden played well, he didn't get into it. People talk about Foden and his positions. I can understand that because of how good he is as a footballer, but he didn't get into the game.\n\n\"We can't always blame the system. He needs to make it happen for himself and demand the ball.\"\n\nFabregas said: \"You cannot tell me that players like Trent [Alexander-Arnold], like Foden, like Bellingham, like Rice, they don't have the quality to hold the ball anywhere in the pitch.\n\n\"It's about do you want it enough to make a difference and hold the ball for your team? Do you want to make things happen? Do you enjoy getting the ball under pressure?\n\n\"We started to see Foden hitting the ball without looking 40 yards. You'll never see Xavi, Iniesta, the top, top players in the last 15, 20, years, do that. You need to take this responsibility to grow. I think players like Foden, they need to step up.\"\n\nSouthgate praised Foden's defensive capabilities after the Serbia game and the player pointed out that the first game of each major tournament provides a test as players try to build momentum.\n\n\"I think the first game of a major tournament is always the most difficult,\" said Foden. \"I think it's important to get off to a win and, yeah, we did that. It was difficult at times. Obviously, we had to defend at times and dig deep.\n\n\"But I think that shows a different side to us and if we're going to win something, I think that we have to do that.\"\n\nOther than defending himself, Foden also received the backing of one of his England team-mates, Manchester United midfielder Kobbie Mainoo.\n\n\"On the ball, his first touch is crazy,\" said Mainoo. \"It's so technical and I think everyone sees that in the Premier League and in internationals as well.\"", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jude_Bellingham", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jude Bellingham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Foden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Phil Foden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Wright", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ian Wright"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cesc_F\u00e0bregas", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cesc F\u00e0bregas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_European_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA European Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foden_Trucks", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Foden Trucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Denmark national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobbie_Mainoo", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kobbie Mainoo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declan_Rice", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Declan Rice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andr\u00e9s_Iniesta", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andr\u00e9s Iniesta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xavi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Xavi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trent_Alexander-Arnold", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trent Alexander-Arnold"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Jorkyball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Jorkyball", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paddleball/Pickleball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paddleball/Pickleball", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/r6zEUeCXoIJJ9wNAwrKwjQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD03NTM7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_telegraph_818/3675f53a67f07a344cfc508212479b69", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9657992", "eventUri": "eng-9657992", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3803921568627451, "wgt": 213, "relevance": 1}

In 35 England appearances, 24 of which have been starts, Foden has scored just four goals and provided eight assists.\n\nThe counter-argument is that so long as the team functions well, creates chances and scores goals, it does not matter which player receives the adulation. Foden is yet to find his niche in an England shirt though, and these are some of the reasons a prodigiously talented footballer finds himself slightly marginalised.\n\nThe Manchester City effect\n\nWhy might Foden look better for Man City than for England? To a certain extent the question answers itself. At City, Foden is surrounded by world-class players in a winning machine who have been training together for years. They are also organised by probably the best coach of his generation in Pep Guardiola. City enjoy a degree of dominance and control that will always prove beyond England, or almost any international team.\n\nIt is simply not possible for a national side to have every player thriving in their club role, and it is not advisable for a manager to aspire towards this. Squad dynamics and team balance are different. At City, Foden plays behind a striker in Erling Haaland who drives defences back. With England, Foden plays behind a striker in Harry Kane who drops short to receive the ball (though as Jamie Carragher wrote on these pages, he played more like Haaland against Serbia). Foden also has Jude Bellingham to contend with at England level. Last season, an opportunity arose in a more central position because of an injury to Kevin De Bruyne.\n\nIn Southgate's defence, Foden has played more games for City in a wide role than as one of Guardiola's two No 8s. With the exception of the occasional switch to a 4-2-3-1, City do not operate with a No 10. They typically attack with a front five, with two wingers either side of a centre-forward and two players in half-spaces in between. Foden can play in all five lanes.\n\nEngland's right-side bias vs Serbia\n\nAfter England's next two group games, we should be able to surmise whether their right-sided bias was a Serbia-specific tactic or a feature of the team.\n\nEngland's most dangerous attacks against Serbia during an encouraging first 30 minutes came down their right flank, with Bukayo Saka crossing for Bellingham to create the game's only goal. Perhaps it should not be a surprise that England leaned right. Their best ball-playing defender is the right-sided John Stones and their best midfield passer is the right-sided Trent Alexander-Arnold. Though his passes featured a couple of switches of play to the left, Alexander-Arnold operated in very right-back-like positions, dropping outside of Serbia's shape.\n\nDeclan Rice, at the base of England's midfield, is also more comfortable spreading play to the right with the inside of his stronger foot. His more searching, longer-range passing against Serbia was to the right flank. England are without the natural width of specialist left-back Luke Shaw.\n\nSerbia's left wing-back Filip Kostic is also an offensive player, so perhaps Southgate and his staff had a plan to target that side. The result was that Foden was less involved. Is this a problem? Some very successful teams have had a strong attacking bias to one flank or the other, and things could flip around against different opponents.\n\nFoden was not 'stuck out on the left'\n\nLooking at Foden's touch map against Serbia, it is easy to conclude that he was constrained by Southgate's system and boxed-in by starting wide left. Foden enjoyed very few touches, almost none in fact, in the central attacking midfield position just outside the penalty box. Fans think of this as the No 10 position. In coaching speak, it is called Zone 14.\n\nHowever, the plan was more nuanced. The early stages of a match are always the most revealing of a coaching team's intentions, and Southgate clearly did not want Foden pinned to the touchline.\n\nWithin the first minute of the match, Foden moved into a more central position with Bellingham to his left on the outside. Midfield rotations were a feature of England's first half.\n\nIn the next minute, Foden drifted all the way over to the right to play in close proximity to Bellingham, Alexander-Arnold and Saka. Foden was not tasked with holding his width, he was granted the freedom to drift. England are less focused on positional play than City. If anything, Foden may have seen more of the ball had he stayed wider.\n\nNor was Bellingham always blocking Foden's path. In this attack, Bellingham has dropped outside Serbia's defensive block with Foden moving into the sea of red shirts.\n\nDespite playing on his weaker left foot, Kieran Trippier was pushed on by Southgate, allowing Foden to move into central areas like in this 12th-minute move.\n\nThere were plenty of other examples to choose from. If Foden has grounds for complaint, it is that the ball did not arrive at his feet in these dangerous positions.\n\nAs BBC Sport pundit Cesc Fabregas said post-match though, Foden also has to take some responsibility for his England performances and start to demand the ball. Especially if Southgate is allowing him freedom to move.\n\n\"When they started to get pressed a little bit more, we started to see Foden hitting the ball without looking 40 yards. Trent, this is not like them,\" Fabregas said. \"And I think players like Foden, they need to step up. This is the time for them to go into a big tournament with their country behind them.\"\n\nThe technical difficulty of Foden playing left\n\nLike many left-footed players in the modern game, if Foden was given the choice he would prefer to operate on the right half of the pitch.\n\nFoden's biggest strength, and the skill that separates him from so many English footballers, is his ability to receive on the half-turn and control the ball with his back foot.\n\nWhen Foden is on the right side of the pitch, his back foot is generally his weaker right. Another way of putting it is that his weaker foot is closer to the opposition's goal. This means he can control and shift the ball to his stronger foot, shooting or dribbling away from pressure.\n\nThe opposite tends to be true when Foden is on the left: his stronger left foot becomes his back foot and the one closest to the goal. Foden is well capable of course, but it is difficult to control the ball with your back foot and then play forward with the same foot especially with a goal-side defender.\n\nThis chance, created by Bellingham, demonstrates the difficulty. Foden has to try to control the ball with his left foot before executing a complete spin and finish, Dennis Bergkamp-style, but the ball runs under his foot. Not impossible, but a lower-percentage option.\n\nWere he on the right side of the penalty area, a touch on his right foot before curling a shot with his left would have been an easier skill. Foden's shot map in the Premier League last season shows almost no shots in the zone this chance occurred. Foden's shots came from centre or centre-right.\n\nIn this example, Foden has controlled the ball with his stronger left foot again, with Bellingham showing for the ball inside with his arm outstretched.\n\nFoden ends up knocking the ball backwards with his right foot. Were the situation mirrored on the other side of the pitch, it is a good bet that Foden would have controlled the ball with his right and punched a pass to Bellingham with his left.", "source":

There was also debate about Phil Foden's performance.\n\nThe Manchester City star, who won Premier League player of the season, began the match out on the left and struggled to get a foothold on the game. Foden had played as the central attacking midfielder for many of his Man City games this season, but goalscorer Jude Bellingham was given the nod there.\n\nArsenal ace Bukayo Saka assisted Bellingham's header inside 13 minutes and had a fruitful first half before being squeezed out of the game after the break. He was replaced by Jarrod Bowen on 76 minutes while Foden stayed on for the full 90 minutes.\n\nSpeaking on punditry duty for the BBC, 2008 and 2012 Euros winner Cesc Fabregas urged Foden to take the initiative to get into the game more, while other analysts noted Saka's drop in potency once he was closed down in the second half.\n\nThere is debate over how to fit Foden into the England team with some arguing that Saka is actually a more effective presence for the Three Lions. Our football.london writers have their say on who should start versus Denmark on Thursday.\n\nREAD MORE: Jude Bellingham sends Arsenal star Declan Rice one-word message after England Euro 2024 win\n\nREAD MORE: Arsenal star slammed ahead of possible transfer as Gary Neville spots concerning moment\n\nIsaac Johnson\n\nI don't particularly like to pit two England players who are clearly brimming with quality against each other, but Fabregas is correct to highlight Foden's responsibility. He drew comparisons with how Bellingham took the game by the scruff of the net in contrast.\n\nI'd argue it's harder for a wide player to make as much impact as a central player, but the Spaniard's main point is right - the very best international stars impose themselves on a game. I can't envisage Kylian Mbappe being that patient.\n\nGareth Southgate should allow Foden to drift inside and dovetail with Bellingham, like he did with Julian Alvarez at City during the start of this season, while Saka does the business on the right. The Arsenal star has been more effective for England in recent years but does have the ability to get lost as the game drifts on.\n\nBoth Foden and Saka should still make the starting XI, perhaps still on opposite wings, and there is no whiff of either deserving to be dropped. But while Foden probably has the bigger capacity to do better, Saka seems to be able to make his mark on an England game more successfully.\n\nJack Flintham\n\nWe saw Saka at his most and least effective in 90 minutes against Serbia on Sunday night. When allowed to pick the ball up on the right flank and run at his defender, the Arsenal man is staggeringly good.\n\nHowever, what Southgate should have spotted earlier was that Serbia had found him out in the second 45 minutes and he was largely ineffective. At that point, England should have been bold and switched Foden to the right flank where he is more comfortable and brought Anthony Gordon onto the pitch.\n\nIf I was the England boss, I would have perhaps started Foden on the right wing with Saka on the bench. It may be controversial but the City man looked unstoppable in front of goal when Pep Guardiola utilised him in that position this past season.\n\nUnfortunately, the depth of England's squad means some talented players will miss out on a start. However, what a player Saka is to come off the bench if it is not working out for Foden.\n\nKieran Horn\n\nOf England's four attackers that started the Euro 2024 clash against Serbia, Phil Foden was by far the least involved. At Manchester City this season, Foden has thrived in a central role but unfortunately for him there are a few players better-suited for the role and one of those is his England teammate Jude Bellingham.\n\nGiven the campaign he has just had, it is very difficult to justify leaving Foden out of the starting XI, however he is so ineffective on the left. Thankfully for Foden, Bellingham is extremely versatile and more than capable of filling in alongside Declan Rice.\n\nWhile England would lose out on Trent Alexander-Arnold's vision from midfield, the Liverpool man rarely got to show his best qualities. Saka holding the width is vital for the Three Lions and that position has to be his for the remainder of the tournament with Foden shifting inside to fill the gap left by Bellingham.\n\nThat then leaves a spot out wide vacant and Anthony Gordon is perfectly capable of filling the role with Eberechi Eze also an option although he is, like Foden, better used in a central position. It is quite the dilemma for Gareth Southgate though the best solution is keeping both in his team and altering his midfield behind the front three.\n\nTom Coley\n\nWho should start on the right for England out of Saka and Foden? Why, Cole Palmer of course!\n\n(Only slightly) joking aside, they can co-exist, they just haven't The lack of a true left-back hasn't made the process any easier for Southgate as Foden simply has less support, but that still doesn't mean it's over for them playing together.\n\nSaka tends to play wider than Foden on the right anyway, so the City man can certainly come centrally even from the left to try and link with Bellingham, but it just doesn't offer him the freedom to do what he does for Manchester City. How Southgate moves forward will be interesting, though.\n\nThere is an argument to give Gordon a go against Denmark in a game that still matters - England will hope that there is nothing riding on the Slovenia match, and we have seen how dead some of the dead rubbers can be, making it hard to judge players.\n\nThere's just too much quality with Foden though. These players are still new together and operating under the pressure of a first game is not easy. Give them another shot at things and see how it goes.\n\nAmie Wilson\n\nThe fact that Gareth Southgate has so much quality in his England squad is a puzzle that he will be happy to have to fit, but it doesn't make it any easier.\n\nSaka showed what he can do in the first 45 minutes against Serbia in the opening games, providing an assist for Jude Bellingham's only goal of the match. But he faded in the second half as Serbia took more control and marked him out of the game.\n\nAfter being a key player for Manchester City this season much excitement was around Phil Foden and what he could do in the competition. But he failed to deliver in a wider position against Serbia.\n\nA player of Foden's quality can't be dropped from the side, but he needs to be either moved inside or given the freedom to drift into more central areas from the left. For me, I would be tempted to play him alongside Bellingham instead of Alexander-Arnold.\n\nSaka would occupy the defence on the right, while it could be a straight shootout between Anthony Gordon and Eberechi Eze for the spot on the left.\n\nOliver Jones\n\nIs England the only nation in the world that complains when their players are too good to fit into one starting XI together? Well, it's what we do best, I suppose.\n\nPhil Foden was poor on Sunday night, I'll just come out and say it. It's something that's gone relatively unnoticed for his country due to how good he is at club level but it's rearing its head now. Unless people want Gareth Southgate to play with two No. 10s which we can all agree we don't want, then there needs to be some kind of solution.\n\nJude Bellingham has proven that moving him back into the central midfield alongside Declan Rice would be a mistake given how efficient he was in the top-third of the pitch meaning his role as the No.10 should be safe. Bringing Foden off the left is a good move, but where does he go?\n\nPeople might not like to hear it but maybe other people deserve a chance. Anthony Gordon and Eberechi Eze could've given far more to England than Foden last weekend, and Saka showed his elite levels in the first half of the Serbia win. Yes, Foden has masses of quality but if he's not going to get his act together and take responsibility for a player of his talents, Southgate needs to make the tough decisions.\n\nComparing talents is easy when you're watching it for hundreds of miles away on a television and holding England back by not playing our best XI players each game isn't what I'm advocating for. It's just that sometimes the best players to play aren't your 'best' players in terms of raw talent - don't sacrifice the system trying to force someone in who may not benefit the gameplan.",

A player of this class, level and talent at times doesn't even need to be told by the coach what he needs to do.\n\n\"Phil needs to want it more than the rest and it showed that Jude Bellingham is a little bit above him in this regard.\n\n\"Foden needs to get that personality back and do what he does at Manchester City.\"\n\nEx-England defender Rio Ferdinand added:\n\n\"Jude Bellingham has come into this team and his body language has said to everyone 'give me the ball or I will go nuts', you will be told 'give me the ball now' - that is his attitude.\n\n\"Phil Foden has seen that and his personality is not like that, and he is allowing someone else to come in and be the dominant figure in this team.\"\n\nIn response, former Manchester City and England defender Micah Richards said the team need to play more to his strengths.\n\n\"The first 20 minutes he got into some really good positions. We need to find the way to get best out of him.\n\n\"We know with Man City it is choreographed with Pep and the system, and the movements.\n\n\"It makes me sad when I see a player of this quality in and out of games.\"\n\nSpeaking on BBC Radio 5 Live on Monday, Richards added: \"You talk about positioning and as footballers you have to be able to adapt, you should be able to make an impact on the pitch wherever you play.\n\n\"But when you have an extreme talent like Phil Foden, his best work has been in the middle of the pitch.\n\n\"Sometimes when he is on the left-hand side, you put him in a position where he needs to dribble past his opponent - that's not his game.\n\n\"The best part of Phil Foden's game is when he receives the ball on the half-turn in tight situations and playing one-twos around people, find a little bit of space and shooting or creating something.\"\n\nGraham, London: Foden is at fault for his own success because he can play on the left side, that's where Southgate plays him, but at club level Foden plays on the right. He and Walker have a complete understanding, which is ignored at the international level.\n\nMark, Stockport: Thinking of Phil Foden, I wonder how many of Pep Guardiola's players have outstanding performances for their national teams?\n\nAnon: Foden is amazing, but it's looking more and more like he is team dependent. With Bellingham it looks like you could drop him into any team.\n\nBBC Radio 5 Live pundit and former Manchester City player Nedum Onuoha on whether Foden can have the same impact for England as he does for his club:\n\nHe absolutely can. The key difference between himself and Bellingham is that Bellingham is more physically imposing.\n\nSome of the things he does, Phil Foden can't do. But in the same way, with those little bits of skill, Bellingham can't do what Foden does. Foden's strength is in the final third, driving with the ball, looking for a pass or with his finishes.\n\nBellingham can be effective in many ways, whether it is a last-ditch tackle, winning a header, competing and pushing past people or using a bit of guile.\n\nEveryone understands that was not Phil's best performance yesterday. The left is not his best position. But there are times when you don't have the best game or have the same influence.\n\nSometimes that is down to personal things, sometimes it is the way the game flows. I am not panicking about it. There is a way for him to have a bigger impact on the game. But it is less visible at times because Phil's impact is always going to be in the final third.\n\nA comparison between him and Bellingham slightly misses the point. They are both supremely talented, but Foden is not going to be making a massive tackle on the edge of your own box, then bursting past people on a 40-yard run.\n\nJude Bellingham is one of the most complete players England has ever seen for his age, so you will see his influence on the game in far more areas.\n\nOne of the key factors is we are comparing between league football and tournament play. Manchester City are first or second in possession stats. You have longer to influence the game because your team has the ball for longer.\n\nYou can be more patient and you have more moments within a game. Spain beat Croatia at the weekend with less possession. Some of their forward players might have been frustrated because they have more possession at club level.\n\nThere are little things to clean up but the way he can play for Manchester City is very different to the way he can play for England because it is a different style of football, not just due to Gareth Southgate but the way international football is played.\n\nBBC Sport's chief football writer Phil McNulty\n\nI think the role on the left does not suit him. He was magnificent in the central role for Manchester City but Jude Bellingham, perfectly understandably, is the focal point of this England team so Foden has to spend much of his time in a wider position.\n\nIt will take a change of formation to sort that but I also agree with Cesc Fabregas that it is also up to Foden himself to make things happen - and I am certain he can. He is too good not to.\n\nSouthgate wants to utilise Foden, but against Serbia he once again struggled to make an impact in an area where there have been impressive reports about Anthony Gordon, a potential rival for his position, filtering out of England's training base.\n\nFoden's left-flank partnership with Kieran Trippier did not look a natural fit and it is something Southgate must consider before England face Denmark on Thursday.\n\nThere was no lack of endeavour, but Foden was never the constant threat he poses for City at club level. It was a low-key, peripheral performance.\n\nNo-one would ever question the talent of the English footballer of the year but accommodating him effectively is a conundrum for Southgate.", "source":

Despite a strong start by England, the team lost their first-half momentum, allowing Serbia to amp up the pressure, and the favourites struggled to create many opportunities.\n\nSouthgate made a bold call to use Trent Alexander-Arnold in the midfield, but it was his use of Foden on the left flank that received flak from Richards. The Premier League Player of the Season came under fire for his ineffective performance against Serbia, but Richards laid the blame squarely on Southgate for failing to get the best out of City's talisman.\n\nREAD MORE: Phil Foden's seven word message is perfect reply to Cesc Fabregas 'step up' criticism\n\nREAD MORE: Bruno Guimaraes signs, Kevin De Bruyne decision, Grealish call - Man City's dream XI next season\n\n\"Phillip Foden. Phillip f-ing Foden. I'm not going to swear because he doesn't deserve it. What can you do? I told you it doesn't work,\" complained Richards on the Rest is Football podcast. \"It works for Man City if he plays on the right or the left or the number 10 because of the rotation.\n\n\"You know how Pep sets up his sides. There's going to be movement, rotation, De Bruyne, Bernardo Silva, Grealish, Doku, whatever it may be alongside Haaland up front. I just think with England there's not enough of that and he's left, at times, isolated.\n\n\"Me and Cesc [Fabregas] had a really good debate afterwards. He said I was protecting {Foden], I wasn't protecting Foden but it's frustrating. I did feel for him. With Foden, it's so disheartening to see a player of that quality being played out of position.\"\n\nMany England supporters on social media shared Richards' sentiment, with one commenting: \"Not liking Foden on that left, he's not right, not liking Trent in midfield. A bit of shoe horning to get the individual players into the team rather than players that play in that position for their clubs week in week out.\"\n\nAnother voiced: \"The way Foden looked tonight, and with the lack of stretching from the left, I think Southgate is gonna wish he'd brought Rashford.\" Meanwhile, a third chimed in: \"At some point Southgate has to realise Foden ain't a left winger and give up with it. Shadow of the player he was for City.\"\n\nDespite scoring 27 goals and providing 12 assists in 54 appearances for Man City this season, Foden has often appeared less impactful when playing for England. Richards suggested that Gareth Southgate could move Jude Bellingham into a deeper midfield role to maximise Foden's potential for the Three Lions.\n\n\"Cesc was right, on the ball, he was moving into the number 10 role but he still had to press on the left and when he got the ball, it was almost like he was a little bit lethargic,\" Richards continued. \"We're talking about a player of Phil Foden's ability, he's best at receiving the ball on the half-turn.\n\n\"So he has to play number 10, put [Jude] Bellingham further back alongside [Declan] Rice and play Foden in the 10. I said against Iceland, he didn't have the best of games in the 10 but other players have had other chances to play in their favoured positions and if we persist with it, he can have an impact with this squad.\"\n\nGary Lineker concurred that Foden was not quite right on the left side, but pointed out that a position on the right might be off the cards due to Bukayo Saka's strong performances. \"I sympathise with you in some ways,\" Lineker told Richards.\n\n\"I think, with English players, we sometimes see it differently but I don't think it suits him on the left.

Were England good in their opener or is the criticism fair?\n\nPhil Foden is a problem for Gareth Southgate. A problem in that he does not want to play where the manager picks him.\n\nA problem in that his reluctance to do so weakens the one area of the team that should be strongest. And a problem in that he is so good, a solution should be found beyond dropping him, even if his performance against Serbia warranted such.\n\nThe Premier League Player of the Year played, at times, as if dishonoured by being the last pick on the playground. Certainly, when Southgate came to picking the players for Foden's preferred positions - No.10 and right wing - he was not chosen for either.\n\nHe duly played as if with a weight on his shoulders and all too rarely the ball at his feet. When he did have it, he was safe. When he didn't, he was a liability, drifting from the area he was meant to populate.\n\nStuart Pearce was in Gelsenkirchen watching England's scratchy 1-0 win, and he knows how a left flank should work. He had seen enough after 29 minutes and called for Foden to be substituted. Come half-time, it was the talk of the press box, too. A heat map showed Foden had come infield for involvement, but the magic in his boots had gone cold.\n\nPhil Foden has struggled to produce his best form while playing in an England shirt\n\nThe Man City star produced an underwhelming performance in their Euro 2024 opener\n\nPodcast All episodes LISTEN: It's All Kicking Off at the Euros.

Play on Apple Spotify\n\nIt would be fine if, from the right, he was cutting inside and onto his left foot. But from the left he is unsure, a square peg searching for his square hole but instead running into Jude Bellingham, the team-mate with a pocketful of pegs for all scenarios. Is the playground big enough for the both of them? England's most gifted pair are yet to make a partnership.\n\nRead More England fans leap to Phil Foden's defence after spotting the moment Man City star was IGNORED\n\nIt was a surprise, then, when Foden played the full 90 minutes, despite no improvement in the second half. Pearce wanted Eberechi Eze brought on, but Anthony Gordon would have been more suitable, given England had lost their attacking initiative. Gordon can run back over just as hard as he does forward.\n\nSo, what to do now? There is an argument, and this was put forward by Cesc Fabregas, that the onus is on the player. While friends of Foden in the BBC studio sought to offer explanation in defence of him, Fabregas cut through that resistance in a way the 24-year-old had failed to do on the pitch.\n\n'It's about if you want the ball enough to make the difference,' he said. 'Do you enjoy getting the ball under pressure? In the second half when they start to get pressed a little bit more, we start to see Foden hitting the ball 40 yards without looking. You will never see Xavi or Andres Iniesta do that. You need to take responsibility. I think players like Foden need to step up.'\n\nThree Lions boss Gareth Southgate must find a solution to the struggles surrounding Foden\n\nFabregas is right, of course, but maybe Foden is not that type of player. He does not have the peacocking self-certainty of Bellingham. Foden is more of a home bird, evidenced by him performing far better for Manchester City then he has ever done for England. His wings are clipped when taken from the comfort of the nest he knows.\n\nTo that end, it is on Southgate to solve the issue. The most obvious fix is to drop Bellingham back into midfield, where the Trent Alexander-Arnold experiment surely reached expiry on Sunday night. That would allow Foden to play as a No.10 and feel the love of such responsibility. At least then it would get Gordon into a team that, already, is crying out for more players in their natural positions.\n\nFoden may prefer to shift even further across field and onto the right of the front three. But that is where Bukayo Saka did what he did not against Serbia, attacking his full-back with pace and purpose. Saka has always looked a better fit in an England jersey. His 11 goals beat Foden's four and, at Qatar 2022, Saka had almost double the number of shots per game and touches in the penalty area.\n\nIn the 18 months since the World Cup, Foden has scored just once in 13 internationals, all the while scoring for fun with City. It doesn't seem much fun for him with England. In truth, it never really has done.\n\nFoden recently won the Premier League with Man City and won the Player of the Year award\n\nDuring the last European Championship, he was taken out of the team after the opening two games and appeared for only 25 minutes more before missing the final through injury. He was, it is said, furious at how his tournament played out.\n\nIt would be a brave move were Southgate to demote him to the bench again, but the England boss does talk about 'finishers' instead of 'substitutes'. As one former player suggested to Mail Sport, why not have Foden as the replacement for Bellingham when the Real Madrid star runs out of steam, as he did against Serbia?\n\nThat is one possible solution, but the one Southgate is perhaps most inclined to favour is by doing nothing, leaving Foden on the left in the hope everything will be all right. The problem with that, is that the problem remains.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Foden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Phil Foden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foden_Trucks", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Foden Trucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuart_Pearce", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stuart Pearce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jude_Bellingham", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jude Bellingham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cesc_F\u00e0bregas", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cesc F\u00e0bregas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gelsenkirchen", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gelsenkirchen"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gelsenkirchen"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bukayo_Saka", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bukayo Saka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eberechi_Eze", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eberechi Eze"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FA_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FA Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pep_Guardiola", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pep Guardiola"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_assistant_referee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Video assistant referee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andr\u00e9s_Iniesta", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andr\u00e9s Iniesta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xavi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Xavi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_European_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA European Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_area", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Penalty area"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trent_Alexander-Arnold", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trent Alexander-Arnold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qatar", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Drama", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Drama", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill_or_Bust", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill or Bust", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/06/17/20/86227201-0-image-m-11_1718651727027.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9657992", "eventUri": "eng-9657992", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 206, "relevance": 1}

I think our link-up play is good at times and I think it's improving as well, and can keep getting better. So he's an exciting talent and I enjoy playing with him.\"\n\nWhile some chalked up Sunday's performance as just a bad game for Foden, it drew criticism from some pundits.\n\n\"I don't think Phil Foden played well, he didn't get into it,\" former England striker Ian Wright said on the BBC match broadcast. \"People talk about Foden and his positions. I can understand that because of how good he is as a footballer, but he didn't get into the game.\n\n\"We can't always blame the system. He needs to make it happen for himself and demand the ball,\" Wright said.\n\nFormer Spain midfielder Cesc Fabregas said players with Foden's talent have the quality to hold the ball anywhere on the pitch.\n\n\"It's about do you want it enough to make a difference and hold the ball for your team? Do you want to make things happen? Do you enjoy getting the ball under pressure?\" he said. \"I think players like Foden, they need to step up.\"\n\nFoden, who City manager Pep Guardiola has described as the \"most talented player\" he has ever seen, struggled during his European Championship debut three years ago as well, and was taken out of the team after England's opening two games.\n\nThe 24-year-old's performance at the 2022 World Cup was a far different story. His first appearance was as a 71st-minute substitute against Iran. He then scored in England's 3-0 win over Wales, and then assisted goals by Harry Kane and Bukayo Saka in their 3-0 win over Senegal in the round of 16.\n\n\"I think the first game of a major tournament is always the most difficult,\" Foden said of the Serbia win that England nearly blew with a nervy second half. \"Obviously, we had to defend at times and dig deep.\n\n\"But I think that

In 34 England appearances, 24 of which have been starts, Foden has scored just four goals and provided eight assists.\n\nThe counter-argument is that so long as the team functions well, creates chances and scores goals, it does not matter which player receives the adulation. Foden is yet to find his niche in an England shirt though, and these are some of the reasons a prodigiously talented footballer finds himself slightly marginalised.\n\nWhy might Foden look better for Man City than for England? To a certain extent the question answers itself. At City, Foden is surrounded by world-class players in a winning machine who have been training together for years. They are also organised by probably the best coach of his generation in Pep Guardiola. City enjoy a degree of dominance and control that will always prove beyond England, or almost any international team.\n\nIt is simply not possible for a national side to have every player thriving in their club role, and it is not advisable for a manager to aspire towards this. Squad dynamics and team balance are different. At City, Foden plays behind a striker in Erling Haaland who drives defences back. With England, Foden plays behind a striker in Harry Kane who drops short to receive the ball (though as Jamie Carragher wrote on these pages, he played more like Haaland against Serbia). Foden also has Jude Bellingham to contend with at England level. Last season, an opportunity arose in a more central position because of an injury to Kevin De Bruyne.\n\nIn Southgate's defence, Foden has played more games for City in a wide role than as one of Guardiola's two No 8s. With the exception of the occasional switch to a 4-2-3-1, City do not operate with a No 10. They typically attack with a front five, with two wingers either side of a centre-forward and two players in half-spaces inbetween. Foden can play in all five lanes.\n\nAfter England's next two group games, we should be able to surmise whether their right-sided bias was a Serbia-specific tactic or a feature of the team.\n\nEngland's most dangerous attacks against Serbia during an encouraging first 30 minutes came down their right flank, with Bukayo Saka crossing for Bellingham to create the game's only goal. Perhaps it should not be a surprise that England leaned right. Their best ball-playing defender is the right-sided John Stones and their best midfielder passer is the right-sided Trent Alexander-Arnold. Though his passes featured a couple of switches of play to the left, Alexander-Arnold operated in very right-back-like positions, dropping outside of Serbia's shape.\n\nDeclan Rice, at the base of England's midfield, is also more comfortable spreading play to the right with the inside of his stronger foot. His more searching, longer-range passing against Serbia was to the right flank. England are without the natural width of specialist left-back Luke Shaw.\n\nSerbia's left-wing back Filip Kostic is also an offensive player, so perhaps Southgate and his staff had a plan to target that side. The result was that Foden was less involved. Is this a problem? Some very successful teams have had a strong attacking bias to one flank or the other, and things could flip around against different opponents.\n\nLooking at Foden's touch map against Serbia, it is easy to conclude that he was constrained by Southgate's system and boxed-in by starting wide left. Foden enjoyed very few touches, almost none in fact, in the central attacking midfield position just outside the penalty box. Fans think of this as the No 10 position. In a coaching-speak, it is called Zone 14.\n\nHowever, the plan was more nuanced. The early stages of a match are always the most revealing of a coaching team's intentions, and Southgate clearly did not want Foden pinned to the touchline.\n\nWithin the first minute of the match, Foden moved into a more central position with Bellingham to his left on the outside. Midfield rotations were a feature of England's first half.\n\nIn the next minute, Foden drifted all the way over to the right to play in close proximity to Bellingham, Alexander-Arnold and Saka. Foden was not tasked with holding his width, he was granted the freedom to drift. England are less focused on positional play than City. If anything, Foden may have seen more of the ball had he stayed wider.\n\nNor was Bellingham always blocking Foden's path. In this attack, Bellingham has dropped outside Serbia's defensive block with Foden moving into the sea of red shirts.\n\nDespite playing on his weaker left foot, Kieran Trippier was pushed on by Southgate, allowing Foden to move into central areas like in this 12th-minute move.\n\nThere were plenty of other examples to choose from. If Foden has grounds for complaint, it is that the ball did not arrive at his feet in these dangerous positions.\n\nAs BBC Sport pundit Cesc Fabregas said post-match though, Foden also has to take some responsibility for his England performances and start to demand the ball. Especially if Southgate is allowing him freedom to move.\n\n\"When they started to get pressed a little bit more, we started to see Foden hitting the ball without looking 40 yards. Trent, this is not like them,\" Fabregas said. \"And I think players like Foden, they need to step up. This is the time for them to go into a big tournament with their country behind them.\"\n\nLike many left-footed players in the modern game, if Foden was given the choice he would prefer to operate on the right-half of the pitch.\n\nFoden's biggest strength, and the skill that separates him from so many English footballers, is his ability to receive on the half-turn and control the ball with his back foot.\n\nWhen Foden is on the right side of the pitch, his back foot is generally his weaker right. Another way of putting it is that his weaker foot is closer to the opposition's goal. This means he can control and shift the ball to his stronger foot, shooting or dribbling away from pressure.\n\nThe opposite tends to be true when Foden is on the left: his stronger left foot becomes his back foot and the one closest to the goal. Foden is well capable of course, but it is difficult to control the ball with your back foot and then play forward with the same foot especially with a goal-side defender.\n\nThis chance, created by Bellingham, demonstrates the difficulty. Foden has to try and control the ball with his left foot before executing a complete spin and finish, Dennis Bergkamp-style, but the ball runs under his foot. Not impossible, but a lower percentage option.\n\nWere he on the right side of the penalty area, a touch on his right foot before curling a shot with his left would have been an easier skill. Foden's shot map in the Premier League last season shows almost no shots in the zone this chance occurred. Foden's shots came from centre or centre-right.\n\nIn this example, Foden has controlled the ball with his stronger left foot again, with Bellingham showing for the ball inside with his arm outstretched.\n\nFoden ends up knocking the ball backwards with his right foot. Were the situation mirrored on the other side of the pitch, it is a good bet that Foden would have controlled the ball with his right and punched a pass to Bellingham with his left.", "source":

There's going to be movement, rotation, De Bruyne, Bernardo Silva, Grealish, Doku, whatever it may be alongside Haaland up front. I just think with England there's not enough of that and he's left, at times, isolated.\n\nRead More Cesc Fabregas urges Phil Foden to 'step up' his England performances after Serbia showing\n\n'Me and Cesc [Fabregas] had a really good debate afterwards. He said I was protecting [Foden], I wasn't protecting Foden but it's frustrating. I did feel for him. With Foden, it's so disheartening to see a player of that quality being played out of position.\n\n'Cesc was right, on the ball, he was moving into the No10 role but he still had to press on the left and when he got the ball, it was almost like he was a little bit lethargic. We're talking about a player of Phil Foden's ability, he's best at receiving the ball on the half-turn.\n\n'So he has to play No10, put [Jude] Bellingham further back alongside [Declan] Rice and play Foden in the 10. I said against Iceland, he didn't have the best of games in the 10 but other players have had other chances to play in their favoured positions and if we persist with it, he can have an impact with this squad.'\n\nRichards' take is one that is likely to spark plenty of debate given that Bellingham was widely seen as England's best player against Serbia.\n\nSouthgate is still trying to figure out how to get the best out of Foden when playing in the same side as Bellingham\n\nRichards wants Bellingham to drop into a deeper midfield role alongside Declan Rice to accommodate Foden\n\nThe Real Madrid midfielder was at the heart of the action in the first half, with his goal capping off a fine display.\n\nRichards is convinced Foden and Bellingham can play together in a midfield three, but Southgate has been reluctant to try the pair of them together alongside Declan Rice.\n\nRead More Superman Jude Bellingham was so good he overshadowed a team who didn't excel, writes OLIVER HOLT\n\nEngland have previously had issues with fitting all of their world-class midfielders into the same side, most notably when Sven-Goran Eriksson had Steven Gerrard, Frank Lampard and Paul Scholes at his disposal at Euro 2004.\n\nThe Swede opted to play all three, but Scholes was shifted over to the left flank, and he retired from international football after the tournament following an underwhelming campaign.\n\nReflecting on Southgate's current dilemma, Gary Lineker admitted he had some sympathy for Foden, but hinted that he does expect more from the City star no matter what position he is playing in.\n\nHe also pondered whether Southgate could look to tweak things against Denmark by bringing in a more natural left winger such as Newcastle's Anthony Gordon.\n\nGary Lineker has some sympathy for Foden but wants to see more from him\n\nHe believes Anthony Gordon could be pushing for a start on the left wing\n\n'Phil Foden, I think, was caught between a rock and a hard place in the sense that he starts in that position, he's been told that he can come inside, but coming inside from a wide position is different to starting in the centre and being able to go either way,' Lineker said.\n\n'At the same time, you think, \"Come on Phil, you've got that much talent, you can work things out\", but if you're uncomfortable...\n\n'It'll be interesting to see how Gareth manages that situation on the left-hand side because you've got an obvious player that can play on the left-hand side in Gordon.'", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news",

Foden acknowledges Bellingham's immense talent and leadership capabilities. Despite recent criticisms, Foden remains resolute, drawing on his Premier League success and aiming for improved performances in upcoming matches.\n\nAfter a shaky start to England's European Championship campaign that had critics questioning his starting spot, Phil Foden insists his partnership with Jude Bellingham will only flourish.\n\nFoden was a headliner this past Premier League season, pouring in 27 goals for Manchester City across all competitions to win Premier League Footballer of the Year honours. But lining up on the left of a front three in England's 1-0 win over Serbia, with Jude Bellingham occupying the central No. 10 position in which Foden has thrived with City, he drifted out of the game.\n\n\"Jude's obviously an exceptional talent,\" Foden said in a Football Association video. \"He's a leader now, I think he's turning into a leader. I think our link-up play is good at times and I think it's improving as well, and can keep getting better. So he's an exciting talent and I enjoy playing with him.\" While some chalked up Sunday's performance as just a bad game for Foden, it drew criticism from some pundits.\n\n\"I don't think Phil Foden played well, he didn't get into it,\" former England striker Ian Wright said on the BBC match broadcast. \"People talk about Foden and his positions. I can understand that because of how good he is as a footballer, but he didn't get into the game. \"We can't always blame the system. He needs to make it happen for himself and demand the ball,\" Wright said.\n\nFormer Spain midfielder Cesc Fabregas said players with Foden's talent have the quality to hold the ball anywhere on the pitch. \"It's about do you want it enough to make a difference and hold the ball for your team? Do you want to make things happen? Do you enjoy getting the ball under pressure?\" he said. \"I think players like Foden, they need to step up.\"\n\nFoden, who City manager Pep Guardiola has described as the \"most talented player\" he has ever seen, struggled during his European Championship debut three years ago as well, and was taken out of the team after England's opening two games. The 24-year-old's performance at the 2022 World Cup was a far different story. His first appearance was as a 71st-minute substitute against Iran. He then scored in England's 3-0 win over Wales, and then assisted goals by Harry Kane and Bukayo Saka in their 3-0 win over Senegal in the round of 16.\n\n\"I think the first game of a major tournament is always the most difficult,\" Foden said of the Serbia win that England nearly blew with a nervy second half. \"Obviously, we had to defend at times and dig deep. \"But I think that shows a different side to us and if we're going to win something, I think that we have to do that.\"\n\nEngland, who sit atop Group C, face Denmark on Thursday in Frankfurt and close out the group stage against Slovenia on June 25.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news",

The Three Lions started strongly but faded after the first half, inviting pressure from Serbia, and struggled to create chances to extend their lead.\n\nSouthgate opted to experiment with Trent Alexander-Arnold in midfield but it was the England manager's use of Foden that incensed Richards. The Premier League Player of the Season faced criticism for his ineffective display and Richards has pinned the blame on Southgate for not playing to the Manchester City star's strengths.\n\n\"Phillip Foden. Phillip f'ing Foden. I'm not going to swear because he doesn't deserve it. What can you do? I told you it doesn't work,\" Richards argued on the Rest is Football podcast. \"It works for Man City if he plays on the right or the left or the number 10 because of the rotation.\n\n\"You know how Pep sets up his sides. There's going to be movement, rotation, De Bruyne, Bernardo Silva, Grealish, Doku, whatever it may be alongside Haaland up front. I just think with England there's not enough of that and he's left, at times, isolated.\n\n\"Me and Cesc [Fabregas] had a really good debate afterwards. He said I was protecting {Foden], I wasn't protecting Foden but it's frustrating. I did feel for him.\"\n\nHe added: \"With Foden, it's so disheartening to see a player of that quality being played out of position.\"\n\nHAVE YOUR SAY! Where is Phil Foden's best position and should he start England's next game? Tell us in the comments section below\n\nPlenty of England fans on social media agreed with Richards' opinion, with one writing: \"Not liking Foden on that left, he's not right, not liking Trent in midfield. A bit of shoe horning to get the individual players into the team rather than players that play in that position for their clubs week in week out.\"\n\nAnother said: \"The way Foden looked tonight, and with the lack of stretching from the left, I think Southgate is gonna wish he'd brought Rashford.\" While a third added: \"At some point Southgate has to realise Foden ain't a left winger and give up with it. Shadow of the player he was for City.\"\n\nFoden scored 27 goals and provided 12 assists in 54 games for Man City this season but has often not looked the same influential player for England. Richards proposed that Southgate Jude Bellingham into a deeper midfield role to allow the Three Lions to get the best out of Foden.\n\n\"Cesc was right, on the ball, he was moving into the number 10 role but he still had to press on the left and when he got the ball, it was almost like he was a little bit lethargic,\" Richards continued. \"We're talking about a player of Phil Foden's ability, he's best at receiving the ball on the half-turn.\n\nThis article contains affiliate links, we will receive a commission on any sales we generate from it.

I said against Iceland, he didn't have the best of games in the 10 but other players have had other chances to play in their favoured positions and if we persist with it, he can have an impact with this squad.\"\n\nGary Lineker agreed that Foden was not an ideal fit on the left flank. However, the ex-England striker suggested that the Man City man is unlikely to earn on a spot on the opposite wing, leaving him to rely on Southgate moving Bellingham alongside Rice to accommodate Foden.\n\n\"I sympathise with you in some ways,\" Lineker told Richards. \"I think, with English players, we sometimes see it differently but I don't think it suits him on the left. He's better on the right but Saka plays on the right and Saka was great. He's consistent, he stays in that position, he likes that position.\n\n\"Phil Foden, I think, was caught between a rock and a hard place in the sense that he starts in that position, he's been told that he can come inside, but coming inside from a wide position is different to starting in the centre and being able to go either way. At the same time, you think, 'Come on Phil, you've got that much talent, you can work things out', but if you're uncomfortable...\"\n\nProviding a possible solution, Lineker added: \"It'll be interesting to see how Gareth manages that situation on the left-hand side because you've got an obvious player that can play on the left-hand side in Gordon.\"\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

It's a topic for debate after England's win over Serbia at Euro 2024\n\nWhile England have enjoyed unparalleled success under Gareth Southgate, one of the few question marks over the manager has been his inability to get the most out of his attacking talent. This was once again brought into sharp focus as England toiled for large periods of the game in their 1-0 victory over Serbia in their opening game at Euro 2024.\n\nWhile Jude Bellingham once again excelled, Phil Foden was on the periphery as he struggled to positively influence the game. Coming on the back of his best-ever season with Manchester City, in which he scored 27 goals and registered 12 assists in all competitions, there were high hopes that he would carry his club form onto the international stage.\n\nBut after another subdued display, pundits and fans have questioned whether he is doing enough in an England shirt. Should he drop to the bench for Thursday's game against Denmark? Here are the pros and cons of what could be a major call for Southgate.\n\nFoden may have become an influential figure at Man City and is clearly beloved by boss Pep Guardiola, but he has struggled to find his feet in the England team. Since making his international debut against Iceland on September 5 2020, the attacking midfielder has scored just four goals in 34 games - two of which came in a 4-0 win over Iceland in November 2020.\n\nIt is not just his goal return that has people questioning his inclusion in England's starting XI. Against Serbia he had 64 touches but only one in the opposition penalty area and was never the constant threat that he poses at club level.\n\nHe also struggled to form a partnership with Kieran Tripper, instead preferring to move into a more central position and often vacating the space out wide. This becomes even more of an issue when Anthony Gordon, who enjoyed an impressive season with Newcastle, is used to playing on the left of a front three and prefers to use his pace down the flank.\n\nFoden would likely prefer to play in the middle or on the left, but he is unlikely to start ahead of Jude Bellingham or Bukayo Saka - two players who excel on the international stage and are favourites of Southgate.\n\nEven though he was playing out of position, Foden's performance drew criticism from former Spain and Barcelona midfielder Cesc Fabregas. Working for the BBC as a pundit, he said: \"When England played the best football is when Serbia allowed them to have the ball, but in the second half when they started to get pressed a little bit more we started to see Foden hitting the ball 40 yards without looking - it's not like them.\n\n\"You'd never see Xavi or Andres Iniesta - the top, top, top players of the last 15 or 20 years - do that. No, you need to take the responsibility. I did think that the second half was a bit underwhelming and I think that players like Foden need to step up. It's the time for players like them to grow in a big tournament with a country behind them and take responsibility.\"\n\nThere is a reason that Guardiola trusts Foden and that is because of the high levels he has maintained over recent seasons for his club. The 24-year-old was instrumental in City winning the treble two seasons ago and last year expertly filled the sizeable void left by Kevin De Bruyne when he was sidelined through injury.\n\nA wonderful technician with excellent close control, an eye for goal and the ability to unlock defences with a clever pass, Foden is one of the first names on the City teamsheet. He has also demonstrated his ability to play in a number of positions, whether in a more central role behind a striker, as a traditional midfielder or even on the right of a three-man attack.\n\nHowever, he is rarely deployed on the left of a three for City and has been asked by Southgate to play in an unfamiliar position. Foden is clearly at his best when he can interlink play and is given licence to find pockets of space, often moving inside to create an overlap for flying full-backs.\n\nAgainst Serbia, Trippier was deployed as a make-shift left-back, a role that he has fulfilled on numerous occasions. But the naturally right-footed defender rarely made his way past the halfway line and did not offer much width. That forced Foden to stay wide and had a huge effect on his performance.\n\nIt also led to ex-players defending his display, including former Manchester City defender Michah Richards. Talking on BBC Sport, he said: \"The big talking point for me tonight was Phil Foden. We need to find a way to get the best out of him.\n\n\"He wasn't involved. At Manchester City we know it's choreographed with the system and the movements and all those sorts of things. But it makes me sad when I see a player of this quality just in and out of games.\"\n\nThere is no doubt that Foden's skill set should be utilised at the business end of the pitch and it would be interesting to see how he would perform in a more central role.\n\nThis really is a difficult decision and we're glad it's one for Southgate. There are merits to both sides of the debate and it is easy to understand why many supporters would like to see Gordon or Eberechi Eze given the opportunity to shine.\n\nHowever, Foden has emerged as a genuinely world-class talent in recent years and there is no reason why he cannot be as influential for England as he is for Man City. Southgate will undoubtedly have meticulously gone through the Serbia game and highlighted ways the team can improve, one of the most obvious being getting the most out of Foden.\n\nWith three points already secured and progress to the knockout stages assured if we defeat Denmark, it seems only right that Foden is handed another chance to prove his worth and show why he can be a difference-maker in the business end of the tournament.", "source": {"uri": "fourfourtwo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "fourfourtwo.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "adrian_back@fourfourtwo.com", "name": "Adrian Back",

Southgate faces selection headache for clash with Denmark", "body": "Premier League player of the year was moved to the left wing to accommodate Real Madrid ace in game against Serbia\n\nGareth Southgate must solve his Phil Foden conundrum as the England playmaker struggles to reproduce his brilliant Manchester City form at international level.\n\nWhile England can book their place in the last 16 of Euro 2024 by beating Denmark in Frankfurt on Thursday, Foden\u2019s latest underwhelming display for his country has sparked a debate about Southgate\u2019s use of such a sublime talent.\n\nFoden laboured to make any impact on England\u2019s nervy 1-0 win against Serbia in their Group C opener in Gelsenkirchen.\n\nThe 24-year-old was voted the Premier League\u2019s player of the year after his key role in City\u2019s fourth successive title triumph with 19 goals and eight assists.\n\nBut in stark contrast to his excellence in a City shirt, Foden has never looked comfortable with England\u2019s Three Lions on his chest.\n\nHe struggled during England\u2019s run to the Euro 2020 final, making subdued starts in the first two games and playing for only a further 25 minutes before missing the final defeat against Italy because of injury.\n\nSouthgate\u2019s decision to play Jude Bellingham as England\u2019s No 10 and use Bukayo Saka on the right flank shunted Foden out to the left wing against Serbia.\n\nNot for the first time, Foden seemed lost on that side of the three attacking midfield spots behind England striker Harry Kane.\n\nAt City, Pep Guardiola is completely comfortable with using Foden as the No 10, while he also operates on the right wing at times.\n\nGuardiola has allowed Foden to dictate the champions\u2019 tempo and he has thrived more than ever this season after taking on an influential role in the absence of the injured Kevin De Bruyne.\n\nBut against Serbia there were few signs of the skill, deft passing and clinical finishing that makes the \u2018Stockport Iniesta\u2019 \u2013 named after former Barcelona and Spain legend Andres Iniesta \u2013 such a favourite of City fans.\n\nFormer City defender Micah Richards questioned whether Southgate is deploying Foden in the correct role.\n\n\u201cWhen you have an extreme talent like Phil Foden, his best work has been in the middle of the pitch,\u201d Richards said. \u201cSometimes when he is on the left-hand side, you put him in a position where he needs to dribble past his opponent, that\u2019s not his game.\u201d\n\nOne solution would be to switch Bellingham back into central midfield alongside Declan Rice in place of Trent Alexander-Arnold, whose move from right-back was hardly a resounding success in the Serbia game.\n\nThat would give Foden a chance to take centre stage as the No 10, with either Chelsea\u2019s Cole Palmer or Newcastle United\u2019s Anthony Gordon featuring on the left.\n\nRio Ferdinand, the ex-Manchester United and England centre-back, is concerned Bellingham \u2013 fresh from a superb first season with Real Madrid \u2013 might be demanding the ball too often, therefore diminishing Foden\u2019s chances of impacting the game.\n\n\u201cJude Bellingham has come into this team and his body language has said to everyone, \u2018give me the ball or I will go nuts\u2019,\u201d Ferdinand told the BBC. \u201cPhil Foden has seen that and his personality is not like that, and he is allowing someone else to come in and be the dominant figure in this team.\u201d\n\nFoden has only four goals in 35 games for England and former Spain midfielder Cesc Fabregas urged him to take responsibility for his international malaise.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about if you want the ball enough to make the difference. Do you enjoy getting the ball under pressure?\u201d Fabregas said. \u201cIn the second half when they started to get pressed a little bit more, we started to see Foden hitting the ball 40 yards without looking.\n\n\u201cYou will never see Xavi or Andres Iniesta do that.

I loved Scholes as a player and looked up to him when I was young.\n\nHis achievements with Manchester United were amazing and he was part of one of the greatest teams in history.\n\nBut Foden has already reached the final of a major tournament with England, with some nice moments along the way at Euro 2020, and he had a decent World Cup.\n\nScholes would probably admit it is a slightly better record than his.\n\nIn turn, Foden would himself accept there is another step for him to take.\n\nThat might be winning something with England.\n\nOr if we don't win something, I still think he can show us more.\n\nEURO 2024 FREE BETS AND OFFERS\n\nThe most difficult thing for Foden is that when he is at Man City, they play a positional game.\n\nThey are all so well drilled, they understand so well what their position requires and where everyone else is, that Foden could do it with his eyes shut.\n\nComing away with England, it's a different style of play with different team-mates.\n\nIt is inevitable that two players who want to get on the ball so much, like Foden and Jude Bellingham, will get in each other's way sometimes.\n\nI've heard people say that maybe Jude was doing too much against \u00adSerbia -- which potentially had an effect on Foden.\n\nIt's not as mad as it might sound.\n\nBellingham dropped deep like a No\u200a6 at times, he was a No\u200a8 at other moments, sometimes further forward as a No\u200a10, and, for his goal, heading it in like a No\u200a9!\n\nBut I believe the opposite is true -- that Bellingham's ability to excel in all those roles should actually help Foden and England.\n\nWhy I love Bellingham, and why I think the whole country loves Bellingham, is the way he takes hold of games.\n\nHe probably sensed that's what was needed. If he comes low, that leaves space in the No\u200a10 position for Foden.\n\nThey didn't combine against Serbia as much as you would like. But you could see that they were looking for each other.\n\nThat's what happens when two players with a really high understanding of the game play together.\n\nWhen Bellingham gets the ball, even if he is only lending it to Foden to get it back, or vice versa, they want to combine and make something happen.\n\nWe have to get them between the lines and receiving on the half turn, playing forward.\n\nAs I said before the tournament, I believe they can play in the same team, as two No\u200a10s, with Declan Rice as the only holding player -- especially in the group games.\n\nGareth Southgate almost certainly won't do that and Foden will probably start on the left wing again against Denmark.\n\nGoing back to Scholes, he was never a left winger, his only position was in the middle, but he could not or did not play there for England because of Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard.\n\nFoden CAN play on the left. But \u00adcircumstances at Euro 2024 are making it harder.\n\nIn order for him to cause the opposition full-back problems, he needs a left back behind him who is going to overlap.\n\nBut Kieran Trippier is right-footed. He's not going to take on a player on the outside like Josko Gvardiol does for City, for instance.\n\nThe opposition know that and it changes how they press. Foden is marked all the time, especially against a back five like Serbia had.\n\nEven if the wing-back or full-back doesn't follow him, he's going into another centre-back.\n\nThe set-up has worked for Gareth Southgate before but it functions so much better with a left-footed left-back.\n\nLuke Shaw scored in the Euro 2020 final by getting round the outside. It gives you a different dimension in attack.\n\nEven if our left-back doesn't go around the outside, the opposing full-back is thinking about it and can end up over-covering by a foot or two feet. And that creates a crucial extra bit of space for Foden.\n\nIt will make such a difference if Shaw returns to fitness and is able to play.\n\nBut we don't know if and when that will be, so Foden and England will have to get on with it.\n\nAnd he will know himself that he wasn't at his best against Serbia.\n\nGiving the ball away will have annoyed him.\n\nHe's used to completing probably 90 to 95 per cent of his passes in every game, including those decisive passes.\n\nHe is good at dribbling and combining but he can also make that final ball, or the one before the final ball.\n\nThe weight and timing of the pass is usually perfect.\n\nBut Foden was not the only one to be below par, especially in the second half.\n\nEngland ended up defending with a midfield five and even when we won the ball back, Serbia still had three men back there.\n\nIn those circumstances it probably would have been better to put Anthony Gordon or Eberechi Eze on as left winger.\n\nFoden is not the\u200a\u200abiggest or strongest. He's not your typical winger, who is going to take someone on down the line, which is what we probably needed.\n\nThe Denmark game today should be a bit different.\n\nDenmark will go into a block at some points of the game, but they will try to play out from the back and be more expansive.\n\nThat will suit Foden and England.\n\nIn the last two seasons, especially the one just gone, you've seen him step up in big moments for City and take responsibility. I am convinced he is trying to do that for England, too.\n\nFoden and Scholes are different types of player from different eras.\n\nFoden has plenty of time to make his mark in this \u00adtournament.\n\nAnd at only 24, he could go on to become a true England legend.\n\nHe is a generational talent so it would be a shame if he didn't.", "source": {"uri": "thesun.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Sun"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jude_Bellingham", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jude Bellingham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Scholes", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paul Scholes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Foden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Phil Foden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declan_Rice", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Declan Rice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Lampard", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Frank Lampard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Shaw", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Luke Shaw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Gerrard", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Steven Gerrard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jo\u0161ko_Gvardiol", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jo\u0161ko Gvardiol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eberechi_Eze", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eberechi Eze"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kieran_Trippier", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kieran Trippier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dribbling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dribbling"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Left-Handed_Products", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Left-Handed Products", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/Europe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/Europe", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill_or_Bust", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill or Bust", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/ah-OFF-PLATFORM-wilshere-columnist-foden.jpg?strip=all&quality=100&w=1920&h=1080&crop=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9657992", "eventUri": "eng-9657992", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.419607843137255, "wgt": 199, "relevance": 1}

I think our link-up play is good at times and I think it's improving as well, and can keep getting better. So he's an exciting talent and I enjoy playing with him.\"\n\nWhile some chalked up Sunday's performance as just a bad game for Foden, it drew criticism from some pundits.\n\n\"I don't think Phil Foden played well, he didn't get into it,\" former England striker Ian Wright said on the BBC match broadcast. \"People talk about Foden and his positions. I can understand that because of how good he is as a footballer, but he didn't get into the game.\n\n\"We can't always blame the system. He needs to make it happen for himself and demand the ball,\" Wright said.\n\nFormer Spain midfielder Cesc Fabregas said players with Foden's talent have the quality to hold the ball anywhere on the pitch.\n\n\"It's about do you want it enough to make a difference and hold the ball for your team? Do you want to make things happen? Do you enjoy getting the ball under pressure?\" he said. \"I think players like Foden, they need to step up.\"\n\nFoden, who City manager Pep Guardiola has described as the \"most talented player\" he has ever seen, struggled during his European Championship debut three years ago as well, and was taken out of the team after England's opening two games.\n\nThe 24-year-old's performance at the 2022 World Cup was a far different story. His first appearance was as a 71st-minute substitute against Iran. He then scored in England's 3-0 win over Wales, and then assisted goals by Harry Kane and Bukayo Saka in their 3-0 win over Senegal in the round of 16.\n\n\"I think the first game of a major tournament is always the most difficult,\" Foden said of the Serbia win that England nearly blew with a nervy second half. \"Obviously, we had to defend at times and dig deep.\n\n\"But I think that shows a different side to us and if we're going to win something, I think that we have to do that.\"\n\nEngland, who sit atop Group C, face Denmark on Thursday in Frankfurt and close out the group

Twenty years since Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson nudged Paul Scholes to the left flank to make space for Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard in the middle, conditions are ripe for furious arguments about another creative talent being wasted in a team lacking balance, all because narrative has it that England's coach is shoving square pegs in round holes again.\n\nPhil Foden, then: what's going on there? Why does he look so Scholesy? Two theories have been posited since his muted display during England's win against Serbia: one, that he is being constrained by Gareth Southgate's functionality; the other, that Foden's struggle to impose himself in an England shirt has nothing to do with the system and is down to a player who needs to be more Jude.\n\n\"A player of this class doesn't need to be told by the coach what he needs to do,\" the former Spain midfielder Cesc F\u00e0bregas said during the post-match coverage on the BBC. \"He needs to want it more than the rest.\"\n\nF\u00e0bregas went on to say that Jude Bellingham, England's match\u2011winner against Serbia, is a little above Foden when it comes to personality and game awareness. But the critics will still come for Southgate. Why stick Foden on the left? Pep Guardiola would never do that - apart from when he started Foden there in 10 Premier League games during the 2023-24 season.\n\nThe best players adapt. It isn't where you start that matters, Southgate says, it's where you end up with the ball. Contrary to received wisdom, Scholes did not mind his wide role. Although he eventually became a deep-lying orchestrator, he was often playing on the left for Manchester United in the period before Euro 2004.\n\nIf the Scholes comparison does not quite fit, however, perhaps attention should shift to Bobby Robson's experience with John Barnes, who was never able to reproduce his outstanding Liverpool form for England. It was the greatest enigma of Robson's coaching career and, in Southgate's case, the concern has to be that Foden will be remembered like Barnes: incredible for his club, a conundrum for his country.\n\nThere is time to find the fix. Foden was the best attacking player in England this past season, scoring 27 goals in all competitions, and his talent is outrageous. Not for nothing is he nicknamed the Stockport Iniesta, with his low centre of gravity, close control and sudden bursts of pace.\n\nBut it is yet to happen with England. Foden has four goals in 35 caps and few standout performances. Given licence to roam inside against Serbia, he started well and got on the ball, but conviction was lacking. Afterwards Southgate, perhaps aware of the potential talking points, praised Foden for using his technical ability to keep the ball during a difficult second half for England.\n\nIt seemed like slim pickings. From a creative perspective, there were times in the first half when Foden got in Harry Kane's way, moving into the striker's space, crowding him out, negating him on Serbia's behalf. Passes were misplaced. Over on the right, Bukayo Saka produced the incision for Bellingham's goal. Foden did not make any chances. Kane likes to drop deep, turn and play those beautiful through balls. Foden is not going to be running beyond the striker, though. He'll be scheming in the pockets.\n\nPart of it may be systemic. England were lopsided, everything slanted towards the right. It was not easy for Foden to play in front of the right-footed Kieran Trippier. The angles were limited. When Foden cut inside, taking defenders with him, it needed Luke Shaw to overlap from left-back.\n\nShaw's impending return will hopefully make a difference. Yet in the current setup, there is an argument that England would be better served by having a more conventional presence on the left wing. They have still not fully replaced the goals and directness of Marcus Rashford and Raheem Sterling.\n\nFoden is a more intricate, more layered talent. He is a product of City's academy and has spent his club career under Guardiola. With City, the moves are synchronised and specific. England are inevitably more improvisational. Saka can just be a winger and play as he does for Arsenal.\n\nFoden is different. He likes quick combinations and interchanges. There is an idea of him as the new Gazza, a free spirit, but is it really true? City are the ultimate structure team. Does Foden boss games from the middle? Or would he flit in and out? He played as a No 10 against Iceland and disappointed on and off the ball. He has not done enough to make Southgate push Bellingham deeper.\n\nSaka, meanwhile, is more decisive for England than Foden, who is said to have a yearning to play on the right. It is an understandable wish given that Foden is drawn to his left foot. Think of his best goals for City - the strikes against Real Madrid, Manchester United and West Ham. Each time, he makes use of an overlapping run from a teammate, cuts in from the right and wallops a left-footed shot into the top-right corner.\n\nSouthgate's England, though, are not Guardiola's City. Foden can seem out of place. Whether that is Southgate's fault is questionable. At some point Foden is going to have to find a way to fit in.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Foden played off the left that night and didn't influence the game in the way he did on so many occasions for City in a stunning club campaign.\n\nBut England boss Gareth Southgate was effusive in his praise of the 24-year-old in the build up to today's clash and it never felt like Foden would be jettisoned. And while his place might still provoke some debate among pundits and non-City supporting England fans the case for his conclusion is pretty clear cut. We get the view of our City writers plus bring you the verdict of Southgate and team-mate Kyle Walker.\n\nALSO READ: Foden's seven word message is perfect reply to 'step up' criticism\n\nALSO READ: Foden and De Bruyne Euro 2024 criticism shows what Man City get right\n\nJoe Bray, Manchester Evening News\n\nTo question Foden's mentality after the season he has just had is not fair. 'Stepping up' is exactly how Foden won all his individual awards this season. One game for a misfiring England side against a very good defence doesn't undo that.\n\nThe England camp headed out to defend their performance, Jude Bellingham pointedly noting that the instant reaction to any Three Lions game is negativity. Southgate said maybe they needed to suffer.\n\nFoden took to Instagram and simply wrote: \"Job done. Onto the next one.\" Because that is what England did - they did exactly what they needed to, they are already well-placed to reach the knockout stages, and they are already looking forward. Six more dull 1-0 wins and England will be European champions.\n\nFoden will get his time to 'step up' over the next month. And the Serbia performance will be long forgotten (as should some of the overreactions since the full time whistle).\n\nTyrone Marshall, Manchester Evening News\n\nFoden struggled to get into the game during the dull victory against Serbia and immediately he has become a talking point.\n\nCesc Fabregas said Foden needed to be more like Bellingham, adding he \"needs to get that personality back and do what he does at Manchester City.\" Rio Ferdinand said Foden was allowing someone else to be the dominant figure in the team.\n\nThere is certainly an argument that the style is so well set at City and so well rehearsed that it isn't always easy to step into a new team and deliver that. It also means criticising the player is missing the point.\n\nFoden is one of the best players in the world because he can play in several positions in that City team and contribute wherever he is. He has dazzled on the right, came of age in a central position this season and drifted in from the left when he's had to combine with De Bruyne. A couple of years ago he could do it as a false nine as well.\n\nHe is an adaptable and tactically smart player, clever enough to interpret a complicated system at club level wherever they might be playing.\n\nThat suggests the issue isn't with them and is why the Foden criticism in this country, in particular, is misguided. That is true of the suggestion he is struggling to play with Bellingham when he has combined with De Bruyne often enough for City.\n\nGareth Southgate\n\n\"Without Phil's contribution without the ball -- and I know that's not the sexy bit -- I don't think we win against Serbia. Phil did an incredible job for the team. Others grabbed the attention, but the way he worked for the team - he defended spaces with real intelligence.\n\n\"He has set an incredibly high bar at Manchester City, where he knows exactly where every player is going to be every time he picks the ball up. With us, we're always having to adapt to different team-mates.\"\n\nKyle Walker\n\n\"I don't think one game defines a player. It's a season or a tournament that defines a player. Especially with Phil coming off the back of the season he had, I don't think one 90 minutes should be scrutinised as much as I'm being told it is.\n\n\"Phil is a great character. I wouldn't say he's had a difficult path to get here as he's won a lot of trophies at Manchester City, but he's had to be patient.

Twenty years since Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson nudged Paul Scholes to the left flank to make space for Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard in the middle, conditions are ripe for furious arguments about another creative talent being wasted in a team lacking balance, all because narrative has it that England's coach is shoving square pegs in round holes again.\n\nPhil Foden, then: what's going on there? Why does he look so Scholesy? Two theories have been posited since his muted display during England's win against Serbia: one, that he is being constrained by Gareth Southgate's functionality; the other, that Foden's struggle to impose himself in an England shirt has nothing to do with the system and is down to a player who needs to be more Jude.\n\nRelated: Have England ever really had an all-rounder like the brilliant Bellingham? | Barney Ronay\n\n\"A player of this class doesn't need to be told by the coach what he needs to do,\" the former Spain midfielder Cesc F\u00e0bregas said during the post-match coverage on the BBC. \"He needs to want it more than the rest.\"\n\nF\u00e0bregas went on to say that Jude Bellingham, England's match\u2011winner against Serbia, is a little above Foden when it comes to personality and game awareness. But the critics will still come for Southgate. Why stick Foden on the left? Pep Guardiola would never do that - apart from when he started Foden there in 10 Premier League games during the 2023-24 season.\n\nThe best players adapt. It isn't where you start that matters, Southgate says, it's where you end up with the ball. Contrary to received wisdom, Scholes did not mind his wide role. Although he eventually became a deep-lying orchestrator, he was often playing on the left for Manchester United in the period before Euro 2004.\n\nIf the Scholes comparison does not quite fit, however, perhaps attention should shift to Bobby Robson's experience with John Barnes, who was never able to reproduce his outstanding Liverpool form for England. It was the greatest enigma of Robson's coaching career and, in Southgate's case, the concern has to be that Foden will be remembered like Barnes: incredible for his club, a conundrum for his country.\n\nThere is time to find the fix. Foden was the best attacking player in England this past season, scoring 27 goals in all competitions, and his talent is outrageous. Not for nothing is he nicknamed the Stockport Iniesta, with his low centre of gravity, close control and sudden bursts of pace.\n\nBut it is yet to happen with England. Foden has four goals in 35 caps and few standout performances. Given licence to roam inside against Serbia, he started well and got on the ball, but conviction was lacking. Afterwards Southgate, perhaps aware of the potential talking points, praised Foden for using his technical ability to keep the ball during a difficult second half for England.\n\nIt seemed like slim pickings. From a creative perspective, there were times in the first half when Foden got in Harry Kane's way, moving into the striker's space, crowding him out, negating him on Serbia's behalf. Passes were misplaced. Over on the right, Bukayo Saka produced the incision for Bellingham's goal. Foden did not make any chances. Kane likes to drop deep, turn and play those beautiful through balls. Foden is not going to be running beyond the striker, though. He'll be scheming in the pockets.\n\nPart of it may be systemic. England were lopsided, everything slanted towards the right. It was not easy for Foden to play in front of the right-footed Kieran Trippier. The angles were limited. When Foden cut inside, taking defenders with him, it needed Luke Shaw to overlap from left-back.\n\nShaw's impending return will hopefully make a difference. Yet in the current setup, there is an argument that England would be better served by having a more conventional presence on the left wing. They have still not fully replaced the goals and directness of Marcus Rashford and Raheem Sterling.\n\nFoden is a more intricate, more layered talent. He is a product of City's academy and has spent his club career under Guardiola. With City, the moves are synchronised and specific. England are inevitably more improvisational. Saka can just be a winger and play as he does for Arsenal.\n\nFoden is different. He likes quick combinations and interchanges. There is an idea of him as the new Gazza, a free spirit, but is it really true? City are the ultimate structure team. Does Foden boss games from the middle? Or would he flit in and out? He played as a No 10 against Iceland and disappointed on and off the ball. He has not done enough to make Southgate push Bellingham deeper.\n\nSaka, meanwhile, is more decisive for England than Foden, who is said to have a yearning to play on the right. It is an understandable wish given that Foden is drawn to his left foot. Think of his best goals for City - the strikes against Real Madrid, Manchester United and West Ham. Each time, he makes use of an overlapping run from a teammate, cuts in from the right and wallops a left-footed shot into the top-right corner.\n\nSouthgate's England, though, are not Guardiola's City. Foden can seem out of place. Whether that is Southgate's fault is questionable. At some point Foden is going to have to find a way to fit in.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

However, when he steps up to the international stage his skills seem to falter.\n\nGareth Southgate appears set on using Foden as a left winger, a position he rarely plays for his club and meaning his main attributes often get pushed aside. He received fierce criticism for his role against Serbia on Sunday night and will need to quickly impress if he is to sway England fans.\n\nBut, there is still time for the England boss to awaken the best in the six-time Premier League champion and may need to make some changes to do so.\n\nHere are three ways that Southgate can get the best out of Foden.\n\nIf Southgate believes Foden is the key to unlocking England's success, then he could choose to build the team around the Manchester City star - placing him in his favoured position.\n\nIt's clear that Foden shines in the 'number 10' role for his club, but for his national team he is deployed out wide. Southgate may have created an issue in allowing his players to drift freely around the pitch, as it prohibits Jude Bellingham and Foden from having their own space.\n\nIf he wishes to play both Bellingham and Foden, then he may need to place the latter in the 10, and opt for the Madrid star slightly deeper in the 8. He risks creating a new Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard situation if he does not give each player their own role - squashing England's chances.\n\nBalance and crowding looks to be a rife issue for England, and Southgate will have to navigate this if he is to see any success in Germany.\n\nEngland need to have strength on the left side, that is a fact. And if Southgate insists on playing Foden there, he may have to give the star a lesser role and command that he stays on the touchline.\n\nA player of Foden's standard should not be given this fate, but if he is deployed on the left in a fixed position, then there will always be a player on the flank to make a difference.\n\nHe has done this before for City and could benefit greatly from utilising a player like Luke Shaw - who could play the role of an attacking overlapping left-back once fully fit.\n\nSouthgate has remained clear on his decision to allow players to roam, insisting that it is more important where Foden finishes than where he starts. But, while England's left-back situation remains unchanged while Shaw recovers, Foden may have to take one from the team and work the left flank.\n\nA key attribute that differentiates Foden to others in the team like Bellingham and Bukayo Saka is confidence. Jude Bellingham's presence on the pitch commands respect - he knows the kind of player he is and he works hard to make sure everyone sees that.\n\nFoden, on the other hand, lacks that assertiveness. He certainly has the ability to call the shots and make up his own mind, and cannot rely on others in the team to carry him along.\n\nCesc Fabregas framed it perfectly after England's opener against Serbia - commenting that Foden simply needs to \"want it more than the rest\" and cannot be afraid to take risks.\n\nToo much dominance on the pitch could be a recipe for disaster, but if Foden is to shine for England, he needs to take a step up and prove that he is capable.", "source": {"uri": "90min.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "90min.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Foden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Phil Foden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jude_Bellingham", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jude Bellingham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Lampard", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Frank Lampard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Shaw", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Luke Shaw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Gerrard", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Steven Gerrard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Germany national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bukayo_Saka", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bukayo Saka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cesc_F\u00e0bregas", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cesc F\u00e0bregas"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Squash", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Squash", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Squash/Clubs", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Squash/Clubs", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Left-Handed_Products", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Left-Handed Products", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Squash/Youth_and_High_School", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Squash/Youth and High School", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/how_do_england_get_the_best_out_of_phil_foden___________________-69717c984ab64f48f66b19f82f9e0547.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9657992", "eventUri": "eng-9657992", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.419607843137255, "wgt": 195, "relevance": 1}

Pundits including Cesc Fabregas challenged Foden to 'step up' like Bellingham has if he wants to be considered a top player for England, sparking debate over his best position and whether the England set-up is actually suited to him.\n\nManager Gareth Southgate defended Foden, and the Manchester City man has now given his verdict on the game, and his own performance in collaboration with Bellingham. Speaking to England's in-house media in Germany, Foden defended the overall performance and insisted the three points were the most important thing.\n\nALSO READ: Man City already handed crucial title advantage over Arsenal and Liverpool\n\nALSO READ: Man City supporters get commitment from Premier League over TV games\n\n\"The first game in a major tournament is always the most difficult.

But I think it shows a different side to us and if we're going to win something, I think that we have to do that.\"\n\nReflecting on himself, and also teammate Bellingham, Foden said: \"Jude's an exceptional talent. He carries himself really well. He's a leader now. Our link-up play is good at times and it's improving. It can keep getting better. He's an exciting talent and I hope I can keep playing with him.\"\n\nSouthgate had been forced to defend Foden and captain Harry Kane after both have received questions from the media over how much they provided against Serbia.\n\n\"Second half I think [Kane] did an incredible job holding the ball up,\" the manager said. \"The number of fouls that he won, he got his body across well. There's not space in that front line for everybody to be on the ball at every moment.\n\n\"First half, Bukayo [Saka] was prominent, Jude was prominent, Trent [Alexander-Arnold] and Phil had moments so Harry didn't get as much of the ball. But in the second half I thought his performance was absolutely crucial to the win.\"\n\n\"Not every player is going to star in every game,\" he said when asked if it was necessary for Foden, Kane and Bellingham to all perform at the same time. \"What's important is different people pop up with the moments like Jude did.

However, that did not come to fruition.\n\nEngland used that early goal as an opportunity to retreat back into their shell, going on to produce an incredibly cagey performance. They were stagnant in attack, and while Serbia were not exactly the most dangerous of opponents on the night, they were a couple of nervy moments en route to securing a nervy one-goal victory.\n\nREAD HERE: Kevin Doyle Says Jarring Harry Kane Stat Raises Doubts About England's EURO Hopes\n\nWhile many in English football had deemed England as the favourites to win Euro 2024, this was not a performance that boded well for their prospects over the remainder of the tournament. Indeed, it was well short of the standards that have already been set by Germany and Spain.\n\nVery few English players stood out on the night, with the possible exceptions of Jude Bellingham and Marc Guehi. Their various attacking stars did not perform in the manner that would have been expected, with Phil Foden especially blunt in the final third.\n\nComing off the back of a fantastic season with Manchester City, it was expected that Foden would play a starring role at the Euros. However, the way he failed to impact last night's game will be of massive concern to England fans.\n\nThe 24-year old has had a fairly underwhelming international career up to this point, often looking like the odd man out in Gareth Southgate's squad. Some of that could be down to the way in which he is being used, although his individual performances have also been poor at times.\n\nSpeaking on the BBC after the Serbia game, Micah Richards jumped to the defence of Phil Foden after his lack of impact in the game. However, Cesc Fabregas was quick to call out the excuses dished out by his fellow pundits.\n\nRichards: It makes me sad when I see a player of his quality in and out of games. We need to find a way (to get him involved).\n\nFabregas: Yeah but Micah, I totally agree, but the same way you see Jude [Bellingham] imposing himself, wanting the ball, getting face to face with an opponent, [Foden] owes us this class. He needs to do this as well.\n\nRichards: I totally agree with you, but Jude in the centre of the park can do that.\n\nFabregas: With the ball, Phil is playing in midfield?\n\nRichards: Yeah but off the ball he's in a wide position. It's very difficult when Jude has the freedom of the pitch and Phil is having to to go from pressing out wide to coming in field, the ball isn't coming, he's playing with [Kieran] Trippier who is right footed. He needs [Luke] Shaw to play so he can get those overlaps. It's sad to see, because this season he has been immense.\n\nWe watch him at Man City every other week.

He suggested that England needs to figure out how to utilise Foden's performance, especially after the Premier League Player of the Season from last year had a disappointing game.\n\n\"The big talking point for me tonight was Phil Foden. I think the first 20 minutes he got into some really good positions. We need to find a way to get the best out of him. He wasn't involved.\n\n\"At Manchester City, we obviously know it's choreographed with the system and the movements and all those sorts of things. But it makes me sad when I see a player of this quality just in and out of games,\" said Richards on BBC's post-game show.\n\nFoden has been absolutely class in his time as a Manchester City player. He scored 19 goals and provided eight assists during the recent Premier League season but has never stepped up in an England shirt. He has scored only four goals with the national team.\n\n\"I love that you try to defend him, seriously, I get your point totally. But a player of this class, of this level, of this talent, for me sometimes, he doesn't even need to be told by the coach what he needs to do. He needs to want it more than the rest and for me today, it showed that Jude is a little bit above him in this regard,\" said Fabregas.\n\nBukayo Saka had a solid first half as the Arsenal forward provided the assist for the Jude Bellingham goal marking his 27th assist in 24 games in a Three Lions shirt. The panel went on to discuss the performance of Trent Alexander-Arnold, whose inclusion in the starting XI was questioned as he filled in a midfielder role rather than the right-back role he has been seen at in the past.\n\n\"He (Trent) had a moment where he was superb and maybe a few things came a little too easy with the ball [like when a heavy touch allowed a Serbia chance] but overall he reacted well and showed good personality.

The Real Madrid star proved once more the increasing importance he will yield in Germany this summer.\n\nBut despite the three points secured, plenty of criticism was levied towards Southgate and the players for the overall performance, which failed to convince in its cohesion and creative intent.\n\nOne of the loudest critiques was of Foden. The Manchester City winger cut a peripheral figure for much of the match, while his tendency to drift inside seemed to conflict with Bellingham's movements.\n\nThe overall result was a disjointed tension between Bellingham, Foden and Harry Kane leading the line. And former Manchester United striker Saha has waded into the conversation regarding the duo's apparent disharmony.\n\n\"Foden can play in the middle with more freedom, but they'll struggle to get both Foden and Jude Bellingham in the right position to provide the creativity for Harry Kane,\" Saha told Paddy Power. \"England need Foden in the best condition but the balance in the team during the tournament is the priority.\"\n\nDespite the sub-par performance from the Premier League champion, Foden looks set to retain his place in Southgate's starting XI, along with Trent Alexander-Arnold in midfield.\n\nOn the criticism levied towards Foden as well as Southgate for ostensible restrictive tactics, Saha said that the pressure at the start of a major tournament can often lead to such appraisals, though patience should be heeded.\n\n\"The criticism of England and Phil Foden is normal, especially at the start of the group stage,\" he added. \"They will find things they can change and will improve physically. They'll change as they go further in the competition and none of the favourites have done well or performed.\n\n\"The first two games are never great and tactically you can find out that some players aren't in the best positions, and this is where we'll see if Gareth Southgate can respond correctly.\n\n\"Foden is a talented player and we've seen that at Manchester City but the balance in midfield has been a struggle for Southgate and England. Sometimes there's a lack of creativity with England and that's where the manager gets criticised.\n\n\"His tactics should still give an advantage to the talented players.\" He added: \"Let's not jump on the manager after one game, the main thing is to get through and get the win.\"\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

Jude Bellingham got the goal and was slightly ahead of his teammates, but there was no standout and England ground their way to a much-needed Euro 2024 opening win.\n\nBut England always need a scapegoat, even in victory. Step forward Phil Foden.\n\nThe Manchester City and Premier League Player of the Year started on the left, as he most often does for City, and looked sharp in possession in the first half.\n\nALSO READ: Bruno Guimaraes signs, Kevin De Bruyne decision, Grealish call - Man City's dream XI next season\n\nALSO READ: How Jack Grealish helped teenager told he 'wasn't disabled enough' to play football\n\nEngland were more fluent down the right, creating the only goal when Kyle Walker freed Bukayo Saka to cross (via a deflection) for Bellingham. The left-side was locked down, yet Foden kept his shape and mostly kept the ball. When he drifts inside for City, those opportunities weren't there for England on Sunday night - Bellingham was at No.10 and Harry Kane was dropping deep to try and get into the contest.\n\nCompare that to City, where Erling Haaland mostly stays up top, stretching the defence, with Kevin De Bruyne marauding around the midfield. Fans, pundits and critics all want Foden to do what he does for City, yet this is a different system completely. How many times did Jordan Pickford launch a goal kick long, only for a Serbia defender to head it back.\n\nThat is not a tactic that suits Foden - he needs the ball played in front of him.\n\nIn truth, Foden was lucky to remain on the pitch in a turgid second half. By the end of the game, it was clear he wasn't going to be effective in attack, and England's ball-retention was worsening as the minutes ticked by. They'd have been better saving his legs and trying something else. It was a game crying out for Jack Grealish to come on and just keep the ball, but that is another debate.\n\nCut to the BBC Studio post-match, and the refreshingly honest Cesc Fabregas chose Foden as the subject of his main criticism. \"It's all about the mentality,\" the former Barcelona, Arsenal and Spain midfielder said. \"You cannot tell me that players like Trent [Alexander-Arnold], like Foden, like Bellingham, like [Declan] Rice, they don't have the quality to hold the ball anywhere in the pitch.\n\n\"It's about do you want it enough to make a difference and hold the ball for your team? Do you want to make things happen? Do you enjoy to get the ball under pressure?\n\n\"You'll never see Xavi, Iniesta, the top, top players in the last 15, 20, years, do that. You need to take this responsibility to grow. I think that the second half was a little bit underwhelming. I would say that is the right word. And I think players like Foden, they need to step up. This is the time for them to go into big tournament with their country behind them.\"\n\nOn the basis of one disappointing game, the comments are harsh but fair. But to question Foden's mentality after the season he has just had is not fair. 'Stepping up' is exactly how Foden won all his individual awards this season. One game for a misfiring England side against a very good defence doesn't undo that.\n\nThe England camp headed out to defend their performance, Bellingham pointedly noting that the instant reaction to any Three Lions game is negativity. Southgate said maybe they needed to suffer.\n\nFoden took to Instagram and simply wrote: \"Job done. Onto the next one.\" Because that is what England did - they did exactly what they needed to, they are already well-placed to reach the knockout stages, and they are already looking forward. Six more dull 1-0 wins and England will be European champions.\n\nFoden will get his time to 'step up' over the next month. And the Serbia performance will be long forgotten (as should some of the overreactions since the full time whistle).", "source": {"uri": "manchestereveningnews.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title":

And Chelsea icon Fabregas pointed to the underutilisation of Cole Palmer, who didn't get a run-out in Gelsenkirchen despite being named Premier League Young Player of the Season just last month.\n\nOf the five substitution opportunities available to Southgate, only three were used as Conor Gallagher came on for Trent Alexander-Arnold, followed by Jarrod Bowen for Bukayo Saka and Kobbie Mainoo stepping in for Jude Bellingham, who netted the game's only goal.\n\n\"If you send the message in putting in a defensive midfielder or an extra defender to cover the result, you will as a player feel it,\" said Fabregas during his appearance on the BBC's match coverage (via the Mirror). \"Mentally you start going back, dropping more. But instead if you put an offensive player, Palmer let's say, up the pitch and controlling the ball in the final third, I think the players get so much more comfortable.\"\n\nThe match reflected as much as England welcomed an onslaught of Serb pressure during the game's final quarter. The losers mustered four of their six attempts at goal across the final 20 minutes, while England managed just a single shot in that time.\n\nFabregas also singled out Phil Foden for criticism after what was perceived as a lack of impact on the game: \"It's about do you want it enough to make a difference and hold the ball for your team? Do you want to make things happen? Do you enjoy to get the ball under pressure?\"\n\nREAD MORE: England player ratings against Serbia as Jude Bellingham and Marc Guehi shine at Euro 2024\n\nREAD MORE: Gary Lineker explains why Tottenham legend Harry Kane 'won't be worried' amid England concerns\n\n\"They allowed them to have the ball when they were deep once in the second half, straight away, when they started to get pressed a little bit more, we started to see Foden hitting the ball without looking 40 yards.\"\n\nDrawing comparisons with his former Barcelona colleagues, Fabregas urged Foden to shoulder more responsibility: \"You'll never see Xavi, [Andres] Iniesta, the top, top players in the last 15, 20, years, do that,\" he said. \"You need to take this responsibility to grow.\"\n\nFabregas concluded by expressing his disappointment with the second-half performance and called on young talents like Foden to rise to the occasion: \"I think that the second half was a little bit underwhelming. I would say that is the right word. And I think players like Foden, they need to step up. This is the time for them to go into big tournaments with their country behind them.\"\n\nSouthgate and his team have a crucial three days to iron out any issues before their pivotal Group C match against Denmark on Thursday.

'Job done', as Phil Foden put it on Instagram. Another few of those results and England will be European champions.\n\nThere is undoubtedly room for improvement, and criticism among fans and pundits focussed on Foden's contribution - or lack of - against Serbia. It's been a long, tiresome five days of chatter about Foden, yet it seems the one opinion that matters is fully in support of him.\n\nALSO READ: Forgotten Man City signing gives Pep Guardiola pre-season boost after Euro 2024 shock\n\nALSO READ: Man City face looming \u00a3100m transfer deadline\n\nA widely-reported leaked England team suggests Southgate will stick with the same starting XI against Denmark on Thursday, keeping Foden on the left wing with freedom to drift inside. Key to Foden's impact will be Harry Kane staying further up front, and a better working relationship with Jude Bellingham.\n\nFoden himself insists that link-up with Bellingham is getting better every day, and Southgate believes Kane will be better as the tournament progresses. On Foden, Southgate highlighted what Manchester City fans will have been shouting into the void for the last week.\n\n\"Phil did an exceptional job for us on Sunday. Other players grabbed the attention, but the way he worked for the team, defended the spaces, real intelligence in how he played,\" the England boss said.\n\n\"Towards the end of the game he retained the ball for us in really crucial moments. He had a half chance in the first couple of minutes where a slightly better touch and a shot away on goal we could be talking about something very different.\n\n\"He linked the game well in that opening period with the others. There was a lot going on in the game, a lot tactically to solve. And we were happy with what Phil did.\"\n\nFoden did his role for the team against Serbia, and can add his natural flair against Denmark if given the chance - and if the general set-up is more attacking.\n\n\"I don't think one game defines a player,\" added Foden's City captain Kyle Walker. \"It's a season or a tournament that defines a player. Especially with Phil coming off the back of the season he had, I don't think one 90 minutes should be scrutinised as much as I'm being told it is.\n\n\"Phil is a great character. I wouldn't say he's had a difficult path to get here as he's won a lot of trophies at Manchester City, but he's had to be patient. This is just another little thing he has to overcome when there is so much pressure on him now after such a great season. Big players have to rise up on big occasions.\"\n\nIf he does what City fans know he is capable of, it will be someone else getting the unnecessary criticism on Thursday evening.

The Real Madrid star proved once more the increasing importance he will yield in Germany this summer.\n\nBut despite the three points secured, plenty of criticism was levied towards Southgate and the players for the overall performance, which failed to convince in its cohesion and creative intent.\n\nOne of the loudest critiques was of Foden. The Manchester City winger cut a peripheral figure for much of the match, while his tendency to drift inside seemed to conflict with Bellingham's movements.\n\nThe overall result was a disjointed tension between Bellingham, Foden and Harry Kane leading the line. And former Manchester United striker Saha has waded into the conversation regarding the duo's apparent disharmony.\n\n\"Foden can play in the middle with more freedom, but they'll struggle to get both Foden and Jude Bellingham in the right position to provide the creativity for Harry Kane,\" Saha told Paddy Power. \"England need Foden in the best condition but the balance in the team during the tournament is the priority.\"\n\nDespite the sub-par performance from the Premier League champion, Foden looks set to retain his place in Southgate's starting XI, along with Trent Alexander-Arnold in midfield.\n\nOn the criticism levied towards Foden as well as Southgate for ostensible restrictive tactics, Saha said that the pressure at the start of a major tournament can often lead to such appraisals, though patience should be heeded.\n\n\"The criticism of England and Phil Foden is normal, especially at the start of the group stage,\" he added. \"They will find things they can change and will improve physically. They'll change as they go further in the competition and none of the favourites have done well or performed.\n\n\"The first two games are never great and tactically you can find out that some players aren't in the best positions, and this is where we'll see if Gareth Southgate can respond correctly.\n\n\"Foden is a talented player and we've seen that at Manchester City but the balance in midfield has been a struggle for Southgate and England. Sometimes there's a lack of creativity with England and that's where the manager gets criticised.\n\n\"His tactics should still give an advantage to the talented players.\" He added: \"Let's not jump on the manager after one game, the main thing is to get through and get the win.\"\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

Richards' comments came after Foden cut a frustrating figure in the Three Lions' 1-0 win over Serbia in their 2024 UEFA EURO opener.\n\nMost expected the 2023-24 Premier League Player of the Season to set the stage alight when England kicked off their EURO 2024 journey with a clash against Group C opponents Serbia on Sunday night (June 16). Unfortunately, the evening turned out to be one of the most disappointing in Foden's young career.\n\nOperating on the left flank, the 24-year-old found himself crowded out time and time again. As a result, he spent the game on the fringes, looking on helplessly as his teammates made inroads into the Serbian box. Also, with goalscorer Jude Bellingham operating down the middle and Bukayo Saka holding down the right flank, Foden did not have the license to leave his post on the left.\n\nOver the course of the game, Foden only created one chance, had just one touch inside the box, and failed to dispatch even a single shot.\n\nSpeaking on BBC One after England's win, Richards said it was sad to see Foden suffer. He also urged Southgate to figure out a way to utilize him better.\n\nThe ex-Aston Villa defender said:\n\n\"It makes me sad when I see a player of Phil Foden's quality in and out of games. At Manchester City, it is all coordinated with Pep Guardiola and the system that they play, we need to find ways to get him involved.\n\n\"When he is coming from a wide position it is difficult for him, he goes from pressing out wide to coming back inside and he needs a full back to go and overlap so he can get those combinations going.\"\n\nWhile Foden has firmly established himself as one of the best players in club soccer, he has yet to become irreplaceable for England.

The staff went through a session on the mindset of the opposition and \"what motivations they might have\".\n\nThat is something Southgate now insists on for every game, as \"it's an important part of psychologically preparing our team\" for the \"narrative\" of any occasion, but it is more distinctive for this one.\n\nDenmark are fired up. Their squad are constantly talking about the penalty that was given for England's 2-1 victory in the Euro 2020 semi-final at Wembley, and want to right that \"injustice\". The scorer Harry Kane is of course still there, but the player who was criticised for apparently diving isn't. Raheem Sterling is one of three of England's front six from that game who won't be playing in Frankfurt, as Southgate attempts to get a new chemistry right.\n\nIt still seemed elusive, on the evidence of the 1-0 win over Serbia. The manager said his staff \"have challenged everybody to take that next step\" in terms of performance in this game.\n\nIt unintentionally echoes the words of Cesc Fabregas on a player who is almost Sterling's direct replacement in the starting XI. Phil Foden has become the focus of much of the debate after a fairly dour opening team performance.\n\nThat is because he didn't stand out in the way he has for Manchester City, where he won the football writers' player of the year last season. Fabregas said Foden needed \"to take this responsibility to grow\", to \"step up\".\n\nToday at the Euros: Day 7 - Thursday 20th June\n\nWhile Southgate has received criticism for not putting the playmaker where he can excel, there is a growing feeling within the game that the player is now overly accustomed to the highly-defined structure of Pep Guardiola's City.\n\nIt is almost the contradiction of a star who looks so free in his play. Foden has been cast as a street footballer but he is actually the ultimate product of the modern academy system, having been at City since he was a child.\n\nSouthgate isn't going to be able to replicate that kind of structure with England, especially not within a week, so there have been arguments that Foden may have to be sacrificed. The idea of building the attack around him has vanished in the wake of Jude Bellingham's rise, to the point that Foden felt he had to stress how they could play together.\n\nSouthgate, however, isn't heeding those calls. Foden is virtually certain to start against Denmark, with the team expected to be much the same as against Serbia, other than perhaps Conor Gallagher coming into central midfield for Trent Alexander-Arnold due to his energy.\n\nSouthgate even went out of his way to praise the role Foden played.\n\n\"The first thing to say would be that I thought Phil did an exceptional job for us on Sunday. Other players grabbed the attention, but the way he worked for the team, defended the spaces, real intelligence in how he played. Towards the end of the game, he retained the ball for us in really crucial moments.\n\n\"There was a lot going on in the game, a lot tactically to solve. And we were happy with what Phil did.\"\n\nSouthgate even addressed some of the wider debate around Foden, and whether he is a player who needs to be \"unlocked\".\n\nIt was actually the subject of another meeting before the game. The staff wanted to help a relatively young squad deal with the amount of scrutiny they get, even after a win. Debates that rise like that around Foden are part of it.\n\n\"There's going to be a narrative on a player, or a couple of players, after every England game. This is a different world to the one you experience at clubs.\n\n\"The players as a collective recognise that now after the last couple of days. We talked with them about it.\n\n\"I have to make sure I can guide them through that, let them understand it and recognise it's the reality of our world but that we shouldn't be thrown off track by it. We're in a good position, we know we want to play better.\"\n\nKyle Walker defended his City team-mate.\n\n\"I don't think one game defines a player. It's a season or a tournament that defines a player. Especially with Phil coming off the back of the season he had, I don't think one 90 minutes should be scrutinised as much as I'm being told it is. Phil is a great character, he's had ... I wouldn't say a difficult path to get here as he's won a lot of trophies at Manchester City, but he's had to be patient. This is just another little thing he has to overcome when there is so much pressure on him now after such a great season, that big players have to rise up in big occasions.\"\n\nIt is hard to disagree. Foden and Bellingham will develop a better understanding as they play together more.\n\nThe absence of Luke Shaw, however, does mean it might remain staccato for some time. The Manchester United full-back has become one of England's most important players, as the only left-footed defender in the squad.\n\nSouthgate said England are unlikely to see Shaw until the end of next week, which would mean the knockout stages.\n\nWhat that knockout stage looks like remains to be seen, of course. One victory is almost certain to put a team through to the next round as at least one of the best third-placed sides. England have that victory, 1-0 against Serbia. Denmark don't, after a tough 1-1 draw against Slovenia.\n\nTheir need is greater, as is their emotional edge given how that Euro 2020 semi-final went. England still want to make sure they top the group, though, which victory would all but confirm.\n\nDenmark's highly technical midfield will also offer a valuable test, especially with Christian Eriksen on his own emotional high after offering one of the stories of the tournament.\n\nHaving suffered cardiac arrest in his last European Championship match, against Iceland in 2021, he scored against Slovenia.\n\nThis is the level England's midfield have to rise to. It is why Gallagher may come in for Alexander-Arnold.\n\nEngland need to rectify a performance in Frankfurt tonight. Denmark want to rectify something else.", "source": {"uri": "independent.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "Irish Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Foden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Phil Foden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cesc_F\u00e0bregas", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cesc F\u00e0bregas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Kane", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Harry Kane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raheem_Sterling", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Raheem Sterling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wembley_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wembley Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conor_Gallagher", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conor Gallagher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playmaker", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Playmaker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pep_Guardiola", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pep Guardiola"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankfurt", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Frankfurt"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Frankfurt"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trent_Alexander-Arnold", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trent Alexander-Arnold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Eriksen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christian Eriksen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Walker", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Walker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Shaw", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luke Shaw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_European_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA European Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovenia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iceland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iceland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iceland"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Print_and_Play", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Print and Play", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.independent.ie/extra/assets/img/dummy-social.gif", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9657992", "eventUri": "eng-9657992", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-20", "textStart": 1616, "textEnd": 1625}], "sentiment": -0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

'Is Phil Foden going to continue to play on the left hand side?\n\n'I don't think having a right footed left back in Trippier helps Foden, because every time you're getting the ball, you are receiving it on the inside. Those are the things I'd be looking at.\n\n'The two talking points are who plays alongside Rice and who plays on that left side. Saka on the right in the first half was unplayable, he tied the two left sided players inside out, in the second half he didn't really have a kick because they came out and did much better.\n\n'I would play Bellingham alongside Rice and Foden as the 10, which is where he wants to play.\n\n' I don't think that would be a problem at all, you're playing Bellingham with Rice so you free up that left side for someone who can run in behind, whether that would be Eze or Gordon. That's what I would have done and that's what I'd do against Denmark.'\n\nStressing the importance of England getting the best out of Foden, Shearer added: 'He wants to have the freedom and I think England have given him that, even after five minutes into the game he was on the right, he has got the freedom to move and go wherever he wants but when Bellingham is playing in a 10 role then it's difficult for him to go over there and go into a crowded space.\n\n'When you're playing against a packed defence, like England were against Serbia then it's really important to keep your width, with Saka one side and Foden the other, almost getting the chalk on their boots from the touchlines.\n\n'That's how you make it difficult for the opposition, but of course Foden doesn't want to do that, Saka doesn't mind but that's not Foden's game, he wants to roam and he wants to come inside.\n\n'I'd feel better if he was in the 10 role and I don't think that would crowd it up, Bellingham would sit alongside Rice and he would then have the freedom to go forward if he wanted to do that.'\n\nMORE : Frank Lampard urges Gareth Southgate to make one change to England line-up vs Denmark\n\nMORE : Gary Lineker slammed for 'disrespectful' joke about Scotland manager Steve Clarke", "source": {"uri": "metro.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Metro"}, "authors": [{"uri": "james_goldman@metro.co.uk", "name": "James Goldman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Foden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Phil Foden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bukayo_Saka", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bukayo Saka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declan_Rice", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Declan Rice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Shearer", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Alan Shearer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Lions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Three Lions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_Footballers'_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Professional Footballers' Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kieran_Trippier", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kieran Trippier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eberechi_Eze", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eberechi Eze"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Lampard", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Frank Lampard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Lineker", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gary Lineker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Clarke", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steve Clarke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Drama", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Drama", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Clans_and_Guilds", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Clans and Guilds", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Left-Handed_Products", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Left-Handed Products", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill_or_Bust", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill or Bust", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-2149872838_432679.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=15px%2C20px%2C502px%2C263px&resize=1200%2C630", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9657992", "eventUri": "eng-9657992", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3960784313725489, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

Will Southgate retain belief that Foden's brilliance at club level will naturally translate into Euro 2024, or does he go for a smoother fit on the left flank? Would a change to Foden's role be an early admission of defeat?\n\nHe also staked a lot on choosing Alexander-Arnold in midfield with Arsenal's Rice, but that may yet be a horses for courses pick depending on the style and standard of opposition.\n\nSouthgate has a track record of not changing teams early in major tournaments so the smart money is on him retaining an unchanged side - but if and when he does, there will be firm focus on Foden and Alexander-Arnold to further back up the manager's faith, or there may be changes ahead.\n\nEngland's manager would be courageous to change it. He will also be showing the courage of his convictions to keep it as it was. It is the balancing act of an England manager.\n\nSouthgate certainly gave a glowing reference to trusted old lieutenant Kieran Trippier, whose role at left-back on the side that failed to function against Serbia was highlighted alongside Foden's display in front of him.\n\n\"Ask anyone who plays in front of Kieran,\" said Southgate. \"They will tell you the way he communicates and talks them through the game is an enormous help.\"\n\nHow Southgate solves the Foden conundrum will fundamentally shape England's campaign in Germany. It may leave him with the hardest choice of all as Euro 2024 moves on: whether to keep faith with Foden or look elsewhere within his squad.\n\nBellingham's role as the focal point and driving force of England's team has resulted in Foden being pushed into a wider role. When he moved into more central areas, he still failed to have any impact in the 1-0 victory against the Serbs.\n\nSouthgate will not be making any adjustments to the role of Bellingham, who received lavish praise from Denmark coach Kasper Hjulmand.\n\n\"You see how good he is at 20. I think he will be very, very good when he is 23,\" Hjulmand said.\n\n\"You see the way he carries himself, how he plays, and you are looking at a great player.\"\n\nFoden is convinced he can make it work with Bellingham and improve as Euro 2024 progresses. Now he must hope his manager feels the same, with Newcastle United's impressive Anthony Gordon pushing his claims and looking a more natural fit with his pace and smooth, direct approach down the left.\n\nFor Foden to make his case more compelling, he has to impose himself on proceedings in a manner he has done all too rarely for England - and do it against Denmark on Thursday.\n\nIan Wright and Cesc Fabregas both believe the initiative lies with Foden.\n\n\"Do you want it enough to make a difference and hold the ball for your team? Do you want to make things happen? Do you enjoy getting the ball under pressure?\" said Fabregas.\n\n\"You need to take this responsibility to grow. I think players like Foden, they need to step up.\"\n\nFoden hardly seems the type to be intimidated or shrink in the the presence of a colleague, but there is no doubt the player seen at Manchester City has not presented himself too often for England.\n\nTime is short at major tournaments. Margins for error can be very small.\n\nDenmark did not entirely convince with constant denials that they still feel a major sense of injustice about the manner of their defeat by England in the Euro 2020 semi-final at Wembley - when Harry Kane scoring the deciding goal in a 2-1 win from a rebound following a highly contentious penalty awarded for a challenge on Raheem Sterling.\n\nUnder their excellent coach Hjulmand, they present stubborn and dangerous opposition - making it even more important Southgate gets the key choices right.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType":

Were England good in their opener or is the criticism fair?\n\nEngland fans have been left stunned after spotting the moment where Phil Foden was ignored by his team-mates during one crucial moment of the match in Sunday's opening Euro 2024 victory over Serbia.\n\nThe Three Lions got their European Championship campaign off to a winning start courtesy of Jude Bellingham's brilliant header, but a nervous second half display has raised concerns over their ability to go deep into the competition.\n\nOpening games of a new tournament are always a cautious affair as players gel in a competitive fixture for the first time in months and put weeks of practice into action. England's outing in Gelsenkirchen was no different.\n\nGareth Southgate is blessed with a plethora of world class talent in his squad but faces the problem of trying to fit such superstars into his system, with Foden one player who was played out of his favoured central role against Serbia.\n\nThe Man City star - who was named the Premier League's player of the season - was deployed on the left-wing and struggled to impact the game as much as was expected, but eagle-eyed fans have jumped to his defence after spotting one moment in the game.\n\nEngland fans have been left stunned after spotting the moment where Phil Foden was ignored by his team-mates against Serbia\n\nFoden endured a difficult outing against Serbia as he struggled to showcase his attacking threat\n\nEngland were searching for a second goal in the 68th minute that would have calmed fears of any Serbia comeback when Foden found himself in acres of space on the edge of the box.\n\nThe 24-year-old was isolated as team-mates rushed into the box and desperately called for the ball to cut-back to him as Bellingham dribbled near the corner flag.\n\nFoden continued to call for a pass and was left frustrated as a cross was eventually floated into the box that was easily claimed by the goalkeeper, with supporters left annoyed that he was denied a shooting chance.\n\n27 goals in all competitions for Man City this season has seen Foden become one of the English top-flight's most clinical finishers, with the Stockport-born forward often scoring from cutback chances on the edge of the box or just inside it.\n\nFoden (bottom of screen) screamed for the ball to be played into him by Jude Bellingham (top of screen)\n\nNow fans want to England stars put more focus on playing to Foden's strengths as the Three Lions look to deliver on their pre-tournament status as favourites.\n\nOne supporter vented their frustration on X after watching the passage of play, stating: 'This is why I can't get behind the idea that Foden was 'terrible' last night. He made himself available so many times in pockets but the players behind him (Rice and Bellingham) didn't have the quality/ability to find him like Rodri and KDB can do.'\n\nAnother similarly added: 'At Man City, Foden gets the ball. That's the difference. He picked up some lovely positions last night when inside, I don't disagree he was poor, but you can't do a lot without the ball.'\n\nMeanwhile, one comment praised Bellingham's man-of-the-match performance but was critical of England's decision-making, adding: 'Jude was our best player by a mile but I'd love a little more vision from him, especially in moments like this where he's dragged out wide and there's space to exploit in the middle In general, I need better decision making from the whole squad.'", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Foden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Phil Foden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jude_Bellingham", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jude Bellingham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Lions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Three Lions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_European_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA European Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gelsenkirchen", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gelsenkirchen"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gelsenkirchen"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dribbling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dribbling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foden_Trucks", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Foden Trucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodri_(footballer,_born_1996)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rodri (footballer, born 1996)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Player_of_the_match", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Player of the match"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declan_Rice", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Declan Rice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goalkeeper_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Goalkeeper (association football)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan Pages", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Gyms", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Gyms", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Left-Handed_Products", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Left-Handed Products", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/06/17/17/86227201-0-image-a-9_1718640498547.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9657992", "eventUri": "eng-9657992", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

Their squad are constantly talking about the penalty that was given for England's 2-1 victory in the Euro 2020 semi-final at Wembley, and want to right that \"injustice\". The scorer Harry Kane is of course still there, but the player who was criticised for apparently diving isn't. Raheem Sterling is one of three of England's front six from that game who won't be playing in Frankfurt, as Southgate attempts to get a new chemistry right.\n\nIt still seemed elusive, on the evidence of the 1-0 win over Serbia. The manager said his staff \"have challenged everybody to take that next step\" in terms of performance in this game.\n\nIt unintentionally echoes the words of Cesc Fabregas on a player who is almost Sterling's direct replacement in the starting XI. Phil Foden has become the focus of much of the debate after a fairly dour opening team performance.\n\nThat is because he didn't stand out in the way he has for Manchester City, where he won the football writers' player of the year last season. Fabregas said Foden needed \"to take this responsibility to grow\", to \"step up\".\n\nWhile Southgate has received criticism for not putting the playmaker where he can excel, there is a growing feeling within the game that the player is now overly accustomed to the highly-defined structure of Pep Guardiola's City.\n\nIt is almost the contradiction of a star who looks so free in his play. Foden has been cast as a street footballer but he is actually the ultimate product of the modern academy system, having been at City since he was a child.\n\nSouthgate isn't going to be able to replicate that kind of structure with England, especially not within a week, so there have been arguments that Foden may have to be sacrificed. The idea of building the attack around him has vanished in the wake of Jude Bellingham's rise, to the point that Foden felt he had to stress how they could play together.\n\nSouthgate, however, isn't heeding those calls. Foden is virtually certain to start against Denmark, with the team expected to be much the same as against Serbia, other than perhaps Conor Gallagher coming into central midfield for Trent Alexander-Arnold due to his energy.\n\nSouthgate even went out of his way to praise the role Foden played.\n\n\"The first thing to say would be that I thought Phil did an exceptional job for us on Sunday. Other players grabbed the attention, but the way he worked for the team, defended the spaces, real intelligence in how he played. Towards the end of the game, he retained the ball for us in really crucial moments.\n\n\"There was a lot going on in the game, a lot tactically to solve. And we were happy with what Phil did.\"\n\nSouthgate even addressed some of the wider debate around Foden, and whether he is a player who needs to be \"unlocked\".\n\nIt was actually the subject of another meeting before the game. The staff wanted to help a relatively young squad deal with the amount of scrutiny they get, even after a win. Debates that rise like that around Foden are part of it.\n\n\"There's going to be a narrative on a player, or a couple of players, after every England game. This is a different world to the one you experience at clubs.\n\n\"The players as a collective recognise that now after the last couple of days. We talked with them about it.\n\n\"I have to make sure I can guide them through that, let them understand it and recognise it's the reality of our world but that we shouldn't be thrown off track by it. We're in a good position, we know we want to play better.\"\n\nKyle Walker defended his City team-mate.\n\n\"I don't think one game defines a player. It's a season or a tournament that defines a player. Especially with Phil coming off the back of the season he had, I don't think one 90 minutes should be scrutinised as much as I'm being told it is. Phil is a great character, he's had ... I wouldn't say a difficult path to get here as he's won a lot of trophies at Manchester City, but he's had to be patient. This is just another little thing he has to overcome when there is so much pressure on him now after such a great season, that big players have to rise up in big occasions.\"\n\nIt is hard to disagree. Foden and Bellingham will develop a better understanding as they play together more.\n\nThe absence of Luke Shaw, however, does mean it might remain staccato for some time. The Manchester United full-back has become one of England's most important players, as the only left-footed defender in the squad.\n\nSouthgate said England are unlikely to see Shaw until the end of next week, which would mean the knockout stages.\n\nWhat that knockout stage looks like remains to be seen, of course. One victory is almost certain to put a team through to the next round as at least one of the best third-placed sides. England have that victory, 1-0 against Serbia. Denmark don't, after a tough 1-1 draw against Slovenia.\n\nTheir need is greater, as is their emotional edge given how that Euro 2020 semi-final went. England still want to make sure they top the group, though, which victory would all but confirm.\n\nDenmark's highly technical midfield will also offer a valuable test, especially with Christian Eriksen on his own emotional high after offering one of the stories of the tournament.\n\nHaving suffered cardiac arrest in his last European Championship match, against Iceland in 2021, he scored against Slovenia.\n\nThis is the level England's midfield have to rise to. It is why Gallagher may come in for Alexander-Arnold.\n\nEngland need to rectify a performance in Frankfurt tonight. Denmark want to rectify something else.", "source": {"uri": "independent.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "Irish Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Foden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Phil Foden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cesc_F\u00e0bregas", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cesc F\u00e0bregas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Kane", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Harry Kane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playmaker", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Playmaker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raheem_Sterling", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Raheem Sterling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wembley_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wembley Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conor_Gallagher", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conor Gallagher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jude_Bellingham", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jude Bellingham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pep_Guardiola", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pep Guardiola"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankfurt", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Frankfurt"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Frankfurt"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trent_Alexander-Arnold", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trent Alexander-Arnold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Eriksen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christian Eriksen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Walker", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Walker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Shaw", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luke Shaw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_European_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA European Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovenia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iceland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iceland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iceland"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Print_and_Play", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Print and Play", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.independent.ie/extra/assets/img/dummy-social.gif", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9657992", "eventUri": "eng-9657992", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

Alexander-Arnold? Gallagher? Our writers' picks", "body": "England got their Euro 2024 campaign off to a winning start against Serbia on Sunday with a 1-0 victory.\n\nThough Gareth Southgate's side looked comfortable in the first half, they were holding on for the three points towards the end of the match.\n\nMuch has been made of Jude Bellingham's brilliance -- and it was his goal that sealed victory -- but what of Phil Foden's performance? Or Trent Alexander-Arnold in midfield? Harry Kane barely had a touch, but the captain's place should be assured up front as England face Denmark in their second group game on Thursday.\n\nWith that in mind, our writers picked their starting XIs for the match against Denmark in Frankfurt.\n\nOK, it's the same attacking quartet that didn't exactly gel against Serbia. But drop Foden? Not for me -- not yet, anyway.\n\nCesc Fabregas offered the best analysis after England's opening game when he said that Foden needed to puff out his chest and realise, as Bellingham seemed to, that big players are supposed to impose themselves on these tournaments.\n\nThe worrying part for Southgate is that it is not the first time Foden has failed to replicate his Manchester City form in England's colours. One more bad performance and, yes, it becomes difficult to keep him in the team. This is a big test for Southgate -- can he find the words to put Foden at ease? Can he relax him, inspire him?\n\nI understand the counter-arguments -- and share some of the concerns about Alexander-Arnold in midfield and Kieran Trippier and Foden on the left-hand side -- but, at risk of causing great annoyance, I would stick with the same team.\n\nStarting line-ups tend to evolve across a tournament, but this is the best setup until Luke Shaw is fully fit and until there is a compelling alternative for that midfield berth or for the left wing.\n\nAlexander-Arnold's lack of experience in midfield is a concern but so is Mainoo's and Adam Wharton's lack of experience full stop. If this tournament was happening in 2025 rather than 2024, I'm sure I would see it differently.\n\nI've found it interesting that people have been accusing Southgate of the classic England manager mistake of trying to shoehorn too many players into the team at the expense of functionality. It's the opposite of what he's been accused of in the past.\n\nThis team needs to function better than it did against Serbia. If it doesn't, make changes -- but there's no need yet.\n\nFabregas was right: it is on Foden to impose himself on the game no matter where on the pitch he is selected. But this has been an issue for years with England -- players not being selected in their favoured roles and duly underperforming.\n\nThat's on Southgate, too; he lacks the top-level tactical nous to get the best from England's most talented generation in, well, a generation. There are mitigating circumstances, such as Trippier not being a natural left-back behind Foden, and that's one of the reasons I'd start Anthony Gordon in front of a team-mate who knows his game inside out.\n\nSerbia worked out that England's best route to goal was down the right, so pushed England to their left and the second half was really poor. Let them do that but see what Gordon can do instead.\n\nBellingham has to stay as the most advanced midfielder where he was so effective against Serbia, which means Foden is on the bench for now. Like Jack Grealish and, to an extent, Raheem Sterling before him, Manchester City forwards just don't seem to do it for England. Cheers, Pep.\n\nThe Alexander-Arnold experiment is fascinating but he was suspect defensively the other night, which better teams would have exploited. It's a toss-up between Gallager and Mainoo -- I'll go with Mainoo for now.\n\nRun it back. Honestly, no performance is as over-analysed as England in their opening game at a major tournament. This is not to say Sunday night's display was perfect, or even particularly good for the most part.\n\nThe two biggest issues against Serbia were the two biggest issues when the squad was announced: the lack of left-sided width and the need for more composure and press resistance in midfield to reliably play out from the back.\n\nYou might be able to fix the second of those, but it involves playing one of two youngsters who had not played a minute of top-flight football as recently as November. The Alexander-Arnold experiment deserves another go, for now.\n\nTrippier's limitations down the left were masked in the past as Sterling tended to stay wider than Foden does. Not taking a recognised alternative to Shaw -- who only made 15 appearances last season -- feels like a mistake but it is too late to correct it now.\n\nSo let's take another look at this setup, double the sample size to two whole games, then see if some of its problems still need solving.\n\nThough England slightly faded after a quick start against Serbia, Southgate's side completed 10 times the number of passes as their opponents before Bellingham's opener and could have added more with Kyle Walker and Kane's second-half header.\n\nI wanted Lewis Dunk in the starting XI to deal with Aleksandar Mitrovic, but Marc Guehi was superb alongside John Stones. Alexander-Arnold may not be the answer in midfield in knockout games but he did enough to warrant another start to break down a stubborn Denmark defence, with the outstanding Rice and Bellingham alongside him.\n\nThere will be the usual furore around Foden's performance but Trippier is not a natural left-back and needs protection -- and you simply can't move Bellingham. Foden should benefit from the emergence of Shaw as his fitness progresses.\n\nYou grow into a tournament and there is still plenty more to come from Southgate's side.\n\nOne change. Denmark are the calibre of team England should be facing in the knockout stages, which is why Gallagher replacing Alexander-Arnold makes the most sense.\n\nGallagher is more functional and less expansive, but as his substitute's display demonstrated against Serbia, he brings balance to a midfield three that has two other standout performers. Gallagher is a midfield scurrier, making third-man runs and picking up second balls. He is defensively disciplined and feeds simple passes into the more expansive forward players.\n\nFoden needs to nurse Shaw to full fitness -- the left-back will provide natural width as England build in a back three, enabling Foden to stay inside the pitch and in the half-spaces. Hopefully, he will be back in contention to face Slovenia next week.\n\nEngland do not have a balanced side if Southgate goes with the same team. Until Shaw is match fit, Southgate cannot do much about the left-back position but he can do something about two key areas of the pitch.\n\nSouthgate is in danger of trying to fit in the best individuals rather than the individuals who are best for the team.\n\nFoden is a top player but not on the left flank. A duo of Anthony Gordon and Bukayo Saka will stretch the pitch, making it harder for Denmark to frustrate England as Serbia did.\n\nFears over Alexander-Arnold's defensive lapses came to bear as he lost possession at key areas of the pitch versus Serbia. A more solid partner for Rice in midfield is required and Mainoo has already shown he can handle the big occasion.\n\nI'm not giving up on this idea. Bellingham as a No 8, alongside the more defensive-minded Rice, isn't going to happen as Southgate clearly sees the Real Madrid man in a freer role.\n\nBut his driving presence from the heart of the team would give England an added dimension to their play and get Foden into the areas where he thrives. Where is the evidence that Bellingham in a deeper role would weaken the side defensively?\n\nI'd love to get Palmer in the team but, on the evidence of the first game, we need a player who will provide width on the left, hence Gordon. Trippier put in a good performance but can't help being a right-footed left-back, which means he will never provide much attacking threat on that flank.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType":

This led to some suggesting that he should be moved into a more central position where he could dictate play.\n\nHowever, former England Under-21 manager Stuart Pearce believes that the number 10 role should continue to be filled by Jude Bellingham after yet another outstanding display for his country.\n\nPearce, speaking to BoyleSports who offer the latest Euro 2024 betting, said: \"Jude Bellingham has to remain in number 10 over Phil Foden despite the latter's disappointing Serbia performance.\n\n\"The argument for Bellingham over Foden comes from scoring goals in that central position, not that Foden doesn't, but Bellingham is also more adept at dropping deeper over the course of a game if he needs to knot things together.\n\n\"Foden prefers to play higher up the pitch and also stay higher up the pitch, whereas Bellingham has a physical presence which helps arriving in the box to join Harry Kane.\n\n\"If Bellingham was put on the left-hand side and Foden was the number 10, a lot of people would raise eyebrows and say that it doesn't look a good fit, but it is a brilliant problem to have for Gareth Southgate.\"\n\nPearce also believes that Southgate may attempt to change the system as the tournament progresses in order to get the best out of both Bellingham and Foden.\n\n\"Foden has played centrally a lot this season but he is more used to playing out wide. We've got two outstanding young talents in European football that any nation going to the Euros would be absolutely delighted to have in their squad,\" he added.\n\n\"So you're just going to have to work out a system that fits them, sometimes when you go to a tournament as I found out, things just fit into place.

While it is fair to say Foden did not have his best match against Serbia we have to remember his outstanding performances for Manchester City last season.\n\nWhile Foden may not be at his best when asked to play from the left in a rigid system, it is worth noting that he played a different role to Bukayo Saka played on the right wing.\n\nWhile Sake stayed wide and looked to isolate defenders 1v1 on the wing, we saw Foden drift around the pitch in and out of pockets of space and not stay wide.\n\nPart of the issues Foden had in the match was down to the fact that he was trying to come inside and occupy the same spaces that Bellingham was taking up in central spaces.\n\nFoden wanted to receive in these areas, but having another player, like Bellingham, also spaced centrally meant that it was too crowded.\n\nAt Real Madrid, Bellingham often rotates outside to fill space on the left side of the attack as Vinicius Junior comes inside, but he typically stayed central in the final third against Serbia.\n\nSo, how do England and Southgate solve these issues to get the best out of Foden?\n\nWe believe adjusting the shape to have Bellingham starting from a deeper position, as the number 8 beside Declan Rice, and Foden then playing centrally as the 10 would be more effective in terms of finding the combinations and the angles to play through in the central areas.\n\nThis would also allow Southgate to use a more direct winger on the left side to stretch the pitch and create space centrally for their best players.\n\nIf Foden does play on the left side against Denmark then he will have to stay slightly wider, at the very least in the channels, in order to find the space to play.\n\nWhile England came into the tournament with fans and pundits alike praising their attacking options, there was real concern about the squad from a defensive perspective.\n\nWhile long-term Southgate favourite Harry Maguire was left out of the final squad there was a question mark as to who would start as the left-sided central defender in their back four?\n\nIn the end, Southgate decided to go with Crystal Palace star Marc Guehi, and the 23-year-old defender barely put a foot wrong.\n\nIn possession, he was safe and secure but also displayed the ability to progress the ball through the lines.\n\nDefensively he was solid as he dealt with the threat of the dangerous Serbian forwards.\n\nJuventus ace Dusan Vlahovic, in particular, looked to play on Guehi's side of the pitch.\n\nBut we saw the defender play effectively whether he was defending tight or in space as he stopped Vlahovic from receiving the ball in dangerous positions.\n\nAnd this was key in helping earn a clean sheet.\n\nKeeping the partnership of John Stones and Guehi at the centre of the defence might be one of the keys for England if they are to be successful in this tournament.\n\nOf course, different opponents will require different remedies.\n\nDespite only coming out of their opening group stage game against Slovenia with one point, Denmark will still be difficult opposition for England.\n\nTheir strikers, Wind and Hojlund, are both over 6ft with pace and power and the ability to run in behind the defensive line.\n\nThey have experience and technical quality throughout their squad and they will have studied the Serbia match to understand the threat England pose.\n\nThe key for England will be in finding ways to apply pressure to the Danish build-up.\n\nThe likes of Foden, Saka and Bellingham will have to be ready to join Kane in pressing high against the three-man Danish backline to prevent them from building their attack.\n\nAt the end of the day, England are the only side in Group C to come through the opening round of fixtures with three points and they have put themselves in the driving seat to secure qualification.\n\nBeating Denmark will see England through to the knockout stages, where the margins grow even finer.", "source": {"uri": "the-sun.com",

In the first half Saka was, and in the second half, Rice was. Overall I thought Rice was the MOTM, with Bellingham a close-ish second.\n\nDon't get me wrong, Bellingham was really good and at times was indeed unplayable, but he was also guilty of trying to play hero-ball on occasions, trying to beat two or three men when better options were available. I'm a huge fan, but with the quality of attacking talent around him, he really doesn't need to do it all by himself. If he makes that minor adjustment then I believe he can truly dominate this tournament.\n\nI get that although nominally the left sided attacker, Foden had more of a wandering brief. But you know what? It would have been nice if occasionally he thought about wandering out to the left wing (i.e. his actual starting position) and running at the full back from there. There was a huge gap in our attacking pay on the wide left throughout the game.\n\nShaw would have helped enormously in that regard, and I really hope he is capable of playing a part in this tournament. Trippier is a solid fill-in but our left side lacks something right now.\n\nI always thought this game would be tight, Serbia are no mugs and their strengths up front matched our weaknesses at the back worryingly. Stones looked a little bit off it last night, so credit to Guehi who played well and justified his selection.\n\nHowever main credit must go to Rice who shielded them magnificently. Quite simply - no Rice, no clean sheet last night\n\nTrent made some errors but was mainly OK. However he faded out of the game, as did the clearly not fully fit Saka. He won't get the credit but Southgate replaced them with exactly the right players in Gallagher and Bowen, we needed the injection of energy they both provided when they came on. If anything they maybe should have been on 5 to 10 minutes sooner than they were\n\nI think Southgate needs to make sure Mainoo and Wharton both get some game time in the next two group games as I think our midfield will have a more solid look with one of them alongside Rice in the later stages.\n\nOverall, it wasn't perfect but we're off and running with a win. Some tweaks are needed to our attacking play, but you can see the potential to grow is there.\n\nRob, Bristol Gooner (Please don't take the Rice/Saka praise as Arsenal bias, it really, really isn't)\n\nREAD: England Clamour Rankings: Anthony Gordon offers Trent and Foden solution\n\n...The only surprise in the game was how awful Serbia were in the final third. Bellingham was exceptional? They say in the country of the blind, the one eyed man is king. Jude was supposed to feed Kane or Saka or Foden, did none of such. England's play ended 70% of the time the ball got Jude in the 2nd half, either he was fouled (So Trent could waste it - no words on Trent), or crowded out, or dispossessed or...\n\nI saw somewhere that he is the best English player ever. Is Micheal Owen and Paul Scholes is France 98' jokes to you guys? Man scored a header from a cross. How about the guy who actually crossed the ball? No mention? Or Guehi's shockingly good performance?\n\nWe can all accept that England lost control of the midfield totally after 30 minutes. Unless I am missing something, isn't Jude one of the midfielders?\n\nI am not a fan of Foden, but he needed help as he is no magician, Bruno feeds his wingers as does Kdb, Odegaard, MacAllister, etc in quality positions, breaking lines and isolating them with full backs.. That is Elite football. Foden unfortunately was starved, as was Kane.. because the suppose creators were Rice, Jude and Trent*,\n\nRice is not that guy in Arsenal.. that's is where Jorginho, Partey and Odegaard comes in. Jude is not that guy in Real, they have Kroos, Modric, Cammavinga and to lesser extent Valverde and Ceballos for that. England has Wharton, Palmer and Eze..they did not play.\n\nJude will always run into the box and score goals, use his enormous energy to press and keep things tidy in midfield, same as Rice.. this are their best roles as shown by their stellar seasons at club level. They need help creatively. Trent is Southgate's choice for that, but he is insufficient. I think Wharton should play. I think Rice, Jude will fare better and Foden will come in more...\n\n...or maybe I just do not rate England, never have, never will.\n\nKufre, Port Harcourt, Nigeria\n\nFoden is a brilliant Man City player, average England player\n\nAnother England game, another anonymous showing from Phil Foden.\n\nNow, before I continue, if your conclusion from reading this is that I don't rate Foden, you're wrong. He's one helluva player and rightly won POTY. However, bar the odd flash, he's never done much in an England shirt; why is that?\n\nThis is just a theory, but he's only ever played his club football under one manager: Pep. Whilst Guardiola is inarguably one of best of all time, he's also incredibly prescriptive. He's the very definition of a \"systems\" manager.\n\nInternational football, with the comparative lack of time on the training pitch can never, and will never, be like that.\n\nSo the question is \"is Foden too Pepped?\". Is he struggling to play his best football because he's not got 427 different instructions for when he's standing on any given square metre of grass?\n\nLewis, Busby Way\n\nMORE ON ENGLAND FROM F365:\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Jude Bellingham's England (just) beat Serbia: 16 Conclusions on an unnecessarily nervy opener\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Gareth Southgate is 'poor man's Moyes' and Harry Kane is pointless...\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Jude Bellingham is Ali, Superman and Jesus Christ (and he has a fit dad)\n\nSouthgate and his substitution blindness\n\nI'm know this has been said repeatedly for the past 8 or so years, but Southgate really needs to let someone else do the subs. There is a lot right about his management but his tactical changes are one-note and the note's terrible.\n\nHe only brings on creative players when England are losing. How much pressure does it put on a player if they only ever get on the pitch with 10 minutes to save England? He'll do it to Cole Palmer this tournament. He did it to Grealish last tournament.\n\nLast night it was obvious to all that, as Serbia pushed forward for a goal, space opened up behind them. It was obvious that we needed more options in attack in the last 20 minutes. Foden was having a poor game and Kane was tiring. It was baffling that they both played the 90. Kane to Watkins was an easy switch. Foden to either Eze or Gordon was an easy switch.\n\nIf Southgate can't work that out mid-game then, frankly, he should start pre-planning his substitutions. Even a Klopp-esque 'change Foden for Gordon on 65 mins every game regardless of scoreline' model would be better than the 'if England are winning, don't bring on any attacking players' one. It cost us against Croatia. It cost us against Italy. It will cost us again this tournament.\n\nIf you want to play Kane for the full-90 every game on the basis of defending corners, that's stupid but fine. But then you really, really (really!) need to bring on fresh attacking legs all around him.\n\nWe shouldn't need to 'talk about Foden' as he should have been taken off after 65 minutes. There's nothing wrong with him having a poor game sometimes. We took 6 wingers and 3 forwards to the tournament, we should play some of them!\n\nJonathan (AFC)\n\nIn other hands...\n\nI can't be the only person who watched the dirge that was the second half of the England game and thought to themselves,\n\n\"Imagine these lads under the stewardship of Ancelotti, or Pep, or Klopp! Can you imagine Heavy Metal Football with a front line consisting of Foden, Kane, Saka and Bellingham?\"\n\nTrent is an issue\n\nDo we have any other player who is \"world class\" but we don't know their best position?\n\nTrent can't play in defence, due to defensive lapses. He's now CDM, and it's the same there. Is Southgate forced to play him?\n\nBTW, I didn't realise Bellingham is only 20. And also, he's not even 21. Thanks BBC.\n\nSimon S, Cheshire\n\nHow England should play v Denmark\n\nGood to see England win their first game. On to the next. I've heard Denmark will play four in midfield so I'd quite like to see 3-5-2\n\nwhere Walker drops alongside Stones and Guehi.\n\nAllowing Wharton to play centrally with Rice, TAA in a position he knows way better, the starman in front, if Shaw is not yet match ready then Gomez over Trip' then Foden up top with Kane.\n\nResting Saka for more important games.\n\nTaking off Jude when he's knackered for Mainoo looks like a decent idea too. Or even Eberichi Eze.\n\nPeter (expecting Italy to beat Spain) Andalucia\n\nStop with the negging\n\nHeld off as long as I could I'm very aware of my own neggieness but was amazed at how quickly the neggies got their negs in.\n\nIt wasn't a great watch, not even the first 35 minutes IMO but win your first game is the mantra of a serious team.\n\nThis feels like a new team, that has barely played as a unit and one that is missing a key component in Shaw. The movements of the players feels like we are trying to be much more fluid these days and I think if it clicks it could be really effective. Right now it looks a bit messy but we have 3 points in the bag hopefully we can get more used to the system and bed Shaw in and get him close to match fit for the knockouts.\n\nNot entirely sure why Serbia sat off us like that but it was just what we needed after Iceland. Once they got off their arses though, the formation really stifled us. You could see they wanted to pin our full backs back and after the first 35 they did just that.\n\nSaka was good and could have had the left back any which way he wanted but we stopped getting the ball to him in positions where he could turn his man. For all my negging on Trippier I thought he was okay. But the amount of times Foden was ahead of him in space and he just turned back was infuriating.\n\nThe Kane bashing is a bit unnecessary. He was basically wrestling with their centreback the entire game, had one chance and very nearly scored. Walker had a great chance but he should have backed himself and twatted it. I can see Trent pushing on in centre mid but he needs to be further up the park, not receiving the ball facing his own goal under pressure.\n\nBellingham was obviously immense, hope he stays fit - thought he was nursing his hamsting at one point but he seemed to come through. When he did go off, I thought Foden stepped it up a bit. Gallagher ran around alot and I quite enjoyed it. I actually thought he broke the Serbs rhythm and Bowen was effective. Looking at the squad we've got lots of like for like replacements which could work in our favour\n\nHow good was Fabregas? BBC made ITV look like one big cliche.\n\nTom, Could watch Bellingham all day...\n\n...I had a lovely weekend with a lady friend in Virginia Beach under ideal beach weather, where we saw Dave Matthews Band play in a partially covered outdoor venue with a large lawn seating area. (Great show btw, though my companion and others complained that too few classics were on the set list.) I caught bits of a few matches in the bars and restaurants we passed through and checked Scores365 throughout for scores, but I missed most of the weekend's action.\n\nI did manage to get home about a half-hour into England's match, which I promptly restarted from the beginning. 40 minutes in, I suspected it would end 0-1, and because England supporters never saw a win they can't despise, the press and the Mailbox would be all doom for a few days, especially after Serbia and England supporters' ugly mutual disrespect. Thus far, this seems to be the case, though Spain and Germany provide ample reason for gloom.\n\nWhat I saw was a fantastic ball met by an even better finish - it was as committed a header as I've ever seen - that proved the difference in a match between two squads capable of stretching the other to the breaking point. England didn't [quite] break, and Serbia did.\n\nOf course, it's reasonable to hope for a solid 2-0 or 3-1, but this is the Euros, and points are the priority. Consider that Denmark (21) is closer to Serbia (33) in the FIFA World Rankings than it is to England (4). Given Denmark's opening draw to Slovenia (57), a mere draw with Denmark would give England a commanding position in Group C. Y'all should chill.\n\nNot that Southgate had a good game. I thought he got the starting line-up close to right, but if TAA was following his instructions today, you have to question those instructions. And I very much agree with Dan McG LFC that it would have made sense to get Anthony Gordon on the pitch, if only in the latter stages. Even played on the right, he can stretch defenses like Saka, but he does it better than Foden on the right. Southgate's post-match assessment that all of his forwards were excellent ignored Harry Kane, who did himself few favors, in an almost pointed way.\n\nChris C, Toon Army DC\n\nThis is why nobody supports ye\n\nLooked at the mailbox this morning to see so many people complaining. I had to recheck the result - as I had thought. England won.\n\nBefore Southgate, England had won 0 out of 9 opening matches at Euros. Southgate has won 2 from 2.\n\nYet here are the England fans - being the first ones in to say \"see i told ye all so after the first game - this is why we didn't win the tournament: Southgate/insert player\"\n\nThis is* why very few support ye and are all delighted when ye get knocked out. Doesn't matter how likeable the Manager, staff and players are, the supporters and media are thee absolute pits. Constantly on the teams back from day dot.\n\n*this, and many many years of enslavement and oppression of people all over the world. who knew that history in certain areas wouldn't look so kindly on the English.\n\njohnnybruff", "source": {"uri": "football365.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Football News -"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Gu\u00e9hi",

But it was far from a vintage performance as England ceded control in the second half and allowed Serbia to grow into the game, grinding out a slim victory thanks to a solid defensive and goalkeeping display.\n\nThere was plenty of scrutiny post-match as viewers sought to identify the Three Lions' shortcomings, with Foden's performance - drifting in from the left flank - receiving much criticism. The Manchester City star and Premier League Player of the Season was anonymous for large parts of the game and failed to have any kind of impact without an overlapping left-back and occupying the same space as Harry Kane and Bellingham.\n\nREAD MORE: Man United boss Erik ten Hag slams Gareth Southgate 'vision' after England Euro display\n\nREAD MORE: Phil Foden's seven word message is perfect reply to Cesc Fabregas 'step up' criticism\n\nIt gave way to critics calling for him to be dropped against Denmark on Thursday, while others blamed Southgate for not utilising him in a central-attacking midfield position. However, City manager and tactical genius Guardiola provided another alternative on how to utilise Foden back in 2023.\n\nHaving yet to deploy Foden there in his career, Guardiola claimed the midfielder has the potential to flourish in a deeper role. That is despite the 24-year-old scoring 27 goals last season and largely being seen as an attacker, either through the middle or on the wings.\n\n\"When Phil plays as a right-winger, he can do it,\" said Guardiola. \"In the beginning when he played as a left-winger, he played well. In the middle he can play right, left, in the pockets - no problem.\n\n\"What I would like in the end is that he plays as a holding midfielder, or one of two holding midfielders. For that, he needs to understand the game as a whole, in everything, not just 'me'.\n\n\"But at the same time, he has this instinct, natural, like the big talents, in the final third. I'm not going to stop him. I'm not going to step in and say, 'Don't do that!' Because he's unique.\"\n\nDiscussing the prospect of Foden moving further back in midfield, Guardiola added: \"Sometimes it is the step one has to gain as a football player, playing in that position which carries some duties for the team.\"\n\nThe Spaniard's words at the time caused a stir due to Foden's guile, final ball and eye for goal being more suited to an attacking role. Yet similarly technical players such as Bernardo Silva, Xavi Hernandez, Santi Cazorla, Andres Iniesta and even Luka Modric have flourished by dropping deeper in the past, becoming integral to build-up play in the second phase of the attack.\n\nIt is important to note that Guardiola was likely offering his thoughts in terms of Foden later on in his career, when his pace declines and he has gained enough tactical knowledge to successfully play deeper. And Foden himself even revealed early on in the season that his favourite position is in the No.10 role, currently occupied by star man Bellingham for England.\n\nBut a player with his passing ability and press resistance playing alongside Declan Rice in the double pivot may kill two birds with one stone for Southgate - not having to drop one of his most talented players while solving the midfield problem.\n\nSouthgate experimented by playing Trent Alexander-Arnold, who primarily figures at right-back for Liverpool, in the middle against Serbia. His interception was crucial in the build-up to the goal - but he clearly lacked the legs and spatial awareness under pressure to become England's very own Toni Kroos, as his advocates had hypothesised.\n\nFoden's midfield experience could make him just that - though Kobbie Mainoo, Adam Wharton and Conor Gallagher remain ahead of him in the current pecking order for that role. Meanwhile, other more natural options for Southgate on the left wing include Anthony Gordon and Eberechi Eze.\n\nSpain's 2010 World Cup-winning midfielder Cesc Fabregas argued that getting the best out of Foden is not down to the manager but the player's desire and mentality himself during his punditry for the BBC. Whether Southgate decides to drop him, play him in a different position, or the Stockport man finally decides to rise up to the occasion at international level, England's Foden dilemma must be solved if they are to win this tournament.", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News UK"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Three Lions boss is supposed to have had a problem with most flair players -- but the opposite is the case.\n\nSouthgate has shown great faith in Foden, backing him despite the incident which saw him sent home in disgrace from Reykjavik after his England debut for a \u00adCovid-bubble breach with Mason Greenwood and two Icelandic models.\n\nIt is now time for Foden to repay that faith.\n\nFootballer of the Year or not, he needs a big performance against Denmark on Thursday or Slovenia next Tuesday if Southgate isn't going to look at starting more authentic left-wingers.\n\nThe England boss has selected four in-form widemen, all tournament rookies, but all of whom might stake a claim.\n\nAnthony Gordon and Eberechi Eze are both obvious candidates on the left.\n\nCole Palmer and \u00adJarrod Bowen -- who was excellent when he came on as sub against Serbia -- could also be in the running.\n\nTournaments tend to take on lives of their own and squad players can emerge to become heroes in a way that even a tarot-card reader might struggle to predict.", "source": {"uri": "the-sun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The US Sun"}, "authors": [],

Play on Apple Spotify\n\n'I don't think having a right footed left back in (Kieran) Trippier helps Foden, because every time you're getting the ball, you are receiving it on the inside. Those are the things I'd be looking at.\n\n'The two talking points are who plays alongside (Declan) Rice and who plays on that left side. (Bukayo) Saka on the right in the first half was unplayable, he tied the two left sided players inside out, in the second half he didn't really have a kick because they came out and did much better.\n\n'I would play (Jude) Bellingham alongside Rice and Foden as the 10, which is where he wants to play. I don't think that would be a problem at all, you're playing Bellingham with Rice so you free up that left side for someone who can run in behind, whether that would be (Eberechi) Eze or (Anthony) Gordon. That's what I would have done and that's what I'd do against Denmark.'\n\nAlexander-Arnold and Foden were both quiet during England's laboured victory on Sunday.\n\nSouthgate has decided to use the Liverpool vice-captain in midfield, despite playing right-back at Anfield during his career.\n\nFoden enjoyed the best season of his career playing in the No 10 position for Premier League champions Manchester City this season.\n\nShearer believes that Foden has to play in the No 10 role if England are to get the best out of him.\n\nHe said: 'When you're playing against a packed defence, like England were against Serbia then it's really important to keep your width, with Saka one side and Foden the other, almost getting the chalk on their boots from the touchlines.\n\nBellingham could be pushed back into Alexander-Arnold's position for the clash with Denmark\n\nShearer believes Eberechi Eze could play on the left if Foden moves to a central role\n\nGareth Southgate has some tough decisions to make after a laboured victory over Serbia\n\n'That's how you make it difficult for the opposition, but of course Foden doesn't want to do that, Saka doesn't mind but that's not Foden's game, he wants to roam and he wants to come inside, I'd feel better if he was in the 10 role and I don't think that would crowd it up, Bellingham would sit alongside Rice and he would then have the freedom to go forward if he wanted to do that.'\n\nEngland will seal a place in the knockout phase if they are to beat Denmark on Thursday.\n\nIt is a rematch from Euro 2020 where England beat Denmark 2-1 to reach the final of that competition, which they ultimately lost to Italy after a penalty shootout.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"},

doubters against Denmark", "body": "Gareth Southgate is ready to throw his support behind Trent Alexander-Arnold and Phil Foden and give them another chance to silence their doubters.\n\nEngland face Denmark in Frankfurt on Thursday night as Group C leaders after beating Serbia in their opening match.\n\nAlexander-Arnold and Foden started against Serbia and Southgate, the England manager, is expected to name the same team against Denmark after left-back Luke Shaw missed team training on Wednesday.\n\nSouthgate's strategy in the last two major tournaments has been to make as few changes as possible between the first and second games, before shuffling his pack more in the third group game if progress to the knockout stage is assured.\n\nQuestions have been raised over whether or not Alexander-Arnold and Foden should start for England, but Southgate wants another look at the pair.\n\nAlexander-Arnold is being used as a central midfield partner to Declan Rice, while Foden has played in an advanced role off the left with Jude Bellingham in the No 10 position.\n\nPundits Ian Wright and Cesc Fabregas have called for Foden to show more, which means the Manchester City star will be under pressure to shine against Denmark.\n\nWayne Rooney has led the questions over whether or not Alexander-Arnold, who is naturally a right-back, is suited to playing in midfield for England.\n\nConor Gallagher replaced Alexander-Arnold as a substitute against Serbia and appears to be next in line to partner Rice, but the Liverpool man is expecting to start again in Frankfurt as part of an unchanged line-up.\n\nFoden played the full game against Serbia and, despite the criticism of his performance from outside the camp, Southgate praised the midfielder's defensive display in the second half.\n\nIt will also not have escaped Southgate's notice that Foden covered a greater distance than any other England player against Serbia, clocking up 13.2 kilometres.\n\nShaw's continued absence should mean another start for Kieran Trippier as a makeshift left-back in what should be his 50th appearance for England", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news",

One game against Serbia - and one match of tournament football is often a time when premature conclusions about England are drawn - with no Foden shots, and an underwhelming performance, flagged them up. And yet there are answers; some ignored, some inconvenient, some merely recognition of realities.\n\nEngland could build a team around Foden. But they cannot simultaneously build one around Jude Bellingham and Harry Kane and Bukayo Saka and Declan Rice. In any case, the Real Madrid team is not built around Bellingham, but built with him. The Manchester City team is not built around Foden; sometimes his position shifts according to whether Kevin De Bruyne is fit, or according to whether Guardiola wants the security of an extra central midfielder, such as Mateo Kovacic, or the width of a specialist winger, like Jack Grealish or Jeremy Doku.\n\nSouthgate fielded Foden on the left against Serbia. It is not the position he has occupied most frequently for City this season - he has made more appearances in a central role and some off the right - but nor is it unfamiliar. He scored twice against Brighton in April when the nominal left winger.\n\nFoden's preference for playing as a 10 is well known. It is not always granted, however. His 27-goal season for City, his Footballer-of-the-Year campaign came when he was shunted around the side; because of injuries, because of tactics, because Guardiola is reluctant to use both Foden and De Bruyne in the middle against elite opponents. It was not necessary to put him in his favourite spot.\n\nBut, with four goals in 35 international caps - in contrast, his last 35 City appearances have produced 22 goals - it is undeniable that Foden is yet to exert the same impact in an England shirt; not regularly, anyway. If there are certain similarities with Bellingham's record - four in 30 caps - the younger man had the goal and the starring role against Serbia. Prodigies have similarities and differences: each seen as a midfielder upon his emergence, now they have gravitated towards the final third. Maybe it is a recognition that if players have the ability to score goals in considerable quantities, it can be a false economy to deploy them elsewhere.\n\nThat they are the respective players of the year in Spain and England can lend itself to lazy assertions that England should be favourites to win Euro 2024; but if many of the discussions around England often have a simplistic element, football is about more than simply selecting 11 very good players. If the Golden Generation taught England nothing else, that is a lesson they should have learned. None of which necessarily makes Foden and Bellingham the Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard of the 2020s: too good to be omitted, but incompatible.\n\nThat, as a No 10, Bellingham is likelier to drift left than right means he and Foden run the risk of crowding each other, of popping up in the same pockets. Southgate's explanation of the situation is nuanced, ill-suited to the more extreme statements that populate the opening paragraph and which can dominate the debate. \"It's about where they end up with the ball, about them having the freedom to go where they want with the ball - in the areas where they can do the most damage and be at their most productive,\" he said earlier this week. There is some freedom to interchange, a recognition that Bellingham sometimes defends on the left wing for Real. It is less about where players start, more where they finish in a move.\n\nAll of which requires chemistry. Bellingham missed England's two friendlies earlier this month and their two games in November. He and Foden have only started five times together since the end of the World Cup: one each in September and October, two in March and then Serbia. It is understandable if they are not completely on the same wavelength yet.\n\nJust as it is if England are a little lopsided. Saka offers genuine width on the right. Foden does not on the left. For City, there were times when he used to be a touchline-hugging winger, primed to run in defences - as James Milner can testify from outings at right-back for Liverpool, sprinting against a man 14 years his junior - but now, whatever his starting berth, he ends up further infield, giving him more chance to shoot from the edge of the box. As a pseudo left winger, Foden may now need an attacking left-back to overlap outside him. It meant the reinvented Josko Gvardiol could suit him for City; it means Luke Shaw's absence for England comes at a further cost.\n\nThe nature of international management, as Southgate realises, entails trying to find ways to get talents into the team and to coexist and complement players who sometimes want similar roles. For Foden, like Trent Alexander-Arnold, one game did not reveal a magic formula. But nor did it prove an idea should be jettisoned already.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jude_Bellingham", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jude Bellingham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Foden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Phil Foden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_De_Bruyne", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kevin De Bruyne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pep_Guardiola", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pep Guardiola"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bukayo_Saka", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bukayo Saka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Grealish", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jack Grealish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Kane", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Harry Kane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declan_Rice", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Declan Rice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cap_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cap (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jo\u0161ko_Gvardiol", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jo\u0161ko Gvardiol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Milner", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "James Milner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Lampard", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Frank Lampard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Shaw", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luke Shaw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Gerrard", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steven Gerrard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhibition_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Exhibition game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trent_Alexander-Arnold", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trent Alexander-Arnold"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Fun", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Fun", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Left-Handed_Products", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Left-Handed Products", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Squash/Youth_and_High_School", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Squash/Youth and High School", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/00701af141875c2211761c6d181e41d4", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9657992", "eventUri": "eng-9657992", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

He's demanding it, controlling it, We need Phil Foden to show that personality now and show people how good of a player he is.'\n\nBellingham was acclaimed as the man of the match for his brilliance against Serbia, scoring a crashing header from a Bukayo Saka cross.\n\nThat was the only goal of the game and Bellingham was widely praised for his ability to dictate the tempo.\n\nFerdinand felt that Foden needs to be more assertive when demanding the ball.\n\nHe said: 'I think he's demanding it and shouting after. When someone is on the ball, you've got to be telling them then. When the ball is released and passed he's frustrated and it shows.\n\nRio Ferdinand believes Foden must be more assertive and demand the ball more forcefully\n\nPlayers are prioritising passing to Bellingham, Harry Kane, and Bukayo Saka, Ferdinand said\n\n'You've got to be shouting before the ball comes and if it doesn't, go and tell people directly: \"Give me the ball.\"\n\n'Play to your best players in those positions. The team sometimes need to talk about that.\n\n'Teams identify who is your best player and talk about it in the changing rooms and in the games - \"get the ball to him\".\n\n'He is that at Man City but he isn't that at England right now.

He linked the game well in that opening period with the others.\n\n\"There was a lot going on in the game, a lot tactically to solve, and we were happy with what Phil did.\"\n\nOn Shaw's recovery from his hamstring injury, Southgate said: \"Luke is progressing as we thought he would. There was a moment last week where we thought he could be a couple of days ahead of schedule, but more realistically we are looking to the back end of this week and early next.

Is Phil Foden going to continue to play on the left hand side?\n\n\"I would play Bellingham alongside Rice and Foden as the [number] 10, which is where he wants to play.\n\n\"I don't think that would be a problem at all, you're playing Bellingham with Rice so you free up that left side for someone who can run in behind, whether that would be [Eberechi] Eze or [Anthony] Gordon. That's what I would have done and that's what I'd do against Denmark.\"\n\nBellingham's first-half header separated the teams in Gelsenkirchen in a nervy opening win for England that nonetheless sees them already on course for the knockout rounds.\n\nAny dramatic changes appear unlikely against Denmark, but Shearer is certain that Southgate can unlock more of Foden's ability by tweaking his position.\n\nThe former Newcastle centre forward explained: \"He wants to have the freedom and I think England have given him that, even after five minutes into the game he was on the right, he has got the freedom to move and go wherever he wants but when Bellingham is playing in a 10 role then it's difficult for him to go over there and go into a crowded space.\n\n\"When you're playing against a packed defence, like England were against Serbia then it's really important to keep your width, with Saka one side and Foden the other, almost getting the chalk on their boots from the touchlines.\n\n\"That's how you make it difficult for the opposition, but of course Foden doesn't want to do that, Saka doesn't mind but that's not Foden's game, he wants to roam and he wants to come inside, I'd feel better if he was in the 10 role and I don't think that would crowd it up, Bellingham would sit alongside Rice and he would then have the freedom to go forward if he wanted to do

He has been used to playing in a different position for City this season, and it showed, but that is Jude Bellingham's position and you can't take Jude out of there.\"\n\nReflecting on Rooney's malleability, Brown recalled: \"I'll give you a good example: Wayne Rooney, absolutely fantastic, wants the ball all the time, but when he was playing with Cristiano Ronaldo, when he was in his mood and you knew he was the guy, Wayne would start dropping back a little and start to assist him.\n\n\"Sometimes players have to be intelligent enough to do that. We know what a special player Foden can be, but Jude is special too, those are the two players that can produce in big games.\n\n\"Jude demands the ball and he just wants to get things going. Phil's got to go 'Okay, Jude's doing that bit now, so can I find the positions I have been finding all season for Manchester City?'\n\n\"Find that space off the back line, just those four or five yards where he can get his first touches that will cement that panic in the defenders.\"\n\nWatch and listen to Euro Thrash onYouTube, Apple Podcasts and Spotify with regular new episodes throughout Euro 2024", "source": {"uri": "manchestereveningnews.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Manchester Evening News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "aaron_flanagan@manchestereveningnews.co.uk", "name": "Aaron Flanagan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League_Player_of_the_Season", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Premier League Player of the Season"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wes_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wes Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayne_Rooney", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wayne Rooney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Foden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Phil Foden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jude_Bellingham", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jude Bellingham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cristiano_Ronaldo", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cristiano Ronaldo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denmark national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micah_Richards", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Micah Richards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Trafford", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Old Trafford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_Ferdinand", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rio Ferdinand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Print_and_Play", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Print and Play", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 74}], "image": "https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/article29382355.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/4_GettyImages-2157586830.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9657992", "eventUri": "eng-9657992", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

So, in opening their campaign with a 1-0 victory over Serbia at the Euros, it should have been a job well done for England. But it was the nature of their display after taking the lead that invited fresh criticism for Gareth Southgate and his team selection that night.\n\nSouthgate's side was riddled with injuries entering their Sunday match with the Serbians. Without a tested midfield partner for Declan Rice or a left-footed understudy for Luke Shaw, Southgate's line-up would be something of an experiment. And so it was. Liverpool's Trent Alexander-Arnold started over Kobbie Mainoo, Conor Gallagher, and Adam Wharton in central midfield, while Kieran Trippier filled in for the injured Shaw at left-back.\n\nOn paper, Both of these options are fine alternatives. There's no doubting Trent's ability to pick out a clean pass or Trippier's experience and know-how at the international level.\n\nThe problem is that neither of them played in their natural positions.\n\nFor all Alexander-Arnold's technique and passing range, he has only started six previous games as a midfielder - and those included games against Andorra, Malta, and North Macedonia - and his rawness looked worrying at times. The problem with using Tripper as a left-sided player only brought out another issue with the selection: the Phil Foden dilemma.\n\nFoden won the Premier League's Player of the Year award last season off the back of his most productive season yet for Manchester City. But by playing on the left of a three-man attack behind Harry Kane, England isn't getting the best out of him. His natural inclination to cut inside often leaves Kieran Tripper stranded on the left side of the pitch - a position he doesn't want to occupy as it is.\n\nIn addition, Foden must battle Jude Bellingham for his preferred #10 position. It leads to Foden occupying similar spaces, leading to overcrowding in the middle. The conflict also sees him shuffled uncomfortably out wide to accommodate his headline-creating colleague and leaving Foden fairly anonymous.\n\nTo succeed at this tournament, Southgate needs to get the best out of his best players. It means opting to play both Bellingham and Foden where they can impact the game from the start. Until he signed for Real Madrid and played as an auxiliary striker, Bellingham started games deeper as a number 8. To get the best out of Foden, it may mean recalling Bellingham to his slightly deeper role. It would allow both of these huge talents to shine on the international stage.\n\nIf he doesn't then it won't be long before the fans turn on Foden and start to clamor for a viable left-sided attacking option more suited to the position - either Crystal Palace's Eberechi Eze or Newcastle's Anthony Gordon.\n\nHere's a line-up that the entire fanbase would love Southgate to use. England could play bravely, dominant, and to their undeniable attacking strengths.\n\nJordan Pickford would start between the goals. He would be assisted by a backline of Kyle Walker, John Stones, Marc Guehi, and a hopefully-fit Shaw. Declan Rice would join Jude Bellingham and Phil Foden in the midfield. Bukayo Saka, Kane, and Anthony Gordon would form a potent three-man line.\n\nIt leaves plenty of room for the squad's most talented members to stamp their own game on the opposition. The lineup could also offer a natural balance to provide attacking options absent against Serbia.\n\nTournament football doesn't offer much time for rehearsals. If England is to get the best out of their talented squad, the time to do it is now.", "source": {"uri": "worldsoccertalk.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "World Soccer Talk"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kieran_Trippier", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kieran Trippier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Foden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Phil Foden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Shaw", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Luke Shaw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trent_Alexander-Arnold", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Trent Alexander-Arnold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobbie_Mainoo", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kobbie Mainoo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conor_Gallagher", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conor Gallagher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jude_Bellingham", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jude Bellingham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declan_Rice", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Declan Rice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Kane", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Harry Kane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League_Player_of_the_Season", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Premier League Player of the Season"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malta", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Malta"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Malta"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andorra", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andorra"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Andorra"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Gu\u00e9hi", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marc Gu\u00e9hi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Gordon_(footballer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Gordon (footballer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bukayo_Saka", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bukayo Saka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Pickford", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Pickford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eberechi_Eze", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eberechi Eze"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Walker", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Walker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Stones", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John Stones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_Palace_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Crystal Palace F.C."}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Left-Handed_Products", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Left-Handed Products", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill_or_Bust", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill or Bust", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://worldsoccertalk.com/api/request-image/?proxy=https://ds-images.bolavip.com/news/image?src=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.worldsoccertalk.com%2Fjpg%2Ffull%2FWST_20240619_WST_512500_England-Euros.jpg[ampersand]width=1200[ampersand]height=740", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9657992", "eventUri": "eng-9657992", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

In the first half he seemed to be moving around the pitch more freely and only in the second half did he \"stick\" to the left. Without being too negative and looking at the bigger picture, do you think that is again down to Gareth Southgate? Go a goal up and in the second half stick to the position and defend - the \"have what we hold\" mentality? Only the first game, but surely this is more proof that, under Gareth, England will never win because of his natural defensive mindset.\n\nPhil answered: It's a familiar argument this one, Christian, and England did seem to lose their way in the second half, allowing Serbia to apply pressure leading to one or two worrying moments. It was actually a bit frustrating to see.\n\nAs for Foden, I think Southgate's argument is that it is not so much about what his starting position is in the game but where he finishes - in other words he can roam inside to more dangerous positions if the situation allows. He is not told to stay on the left flank and not move. Why would Southgate do that?\n\nI agree with those who say Foden also needs to be more assertive with England. Jude Bellingham is an increasingly dominant figure through sheer force of personality and superb ability - and I believe Foden can be exactly the same. He is too good not to. He just hasn't shown it yet.\n\nAs for Southgate, let's see how things pan out. It was the first game of a major tournament.

But it was far from a vintage performance as England ceded control in the second half and allowed Serbia to grow into the game, grinding out a slim victory thanks to a solid defensive and goalkeeping display.\n\nThere was plenty of scrutiny post-match as viewers sought to identify the Three Lions' shortcomings, with Foden's performance - drifting in from the left flank - receiving much criticism. The Manchester City star and Premier League Player of the Year was anonymous for large parts of the game and failed to have any kind of impact without an overlapping left-back and occupying the same space as Harry Kane and Bellingham.\n\nREAD MORE: Man United boss Erik ten Hag slams Gareth Southgate 'vision' after England Euro display\n\nREAD MORE: Phil Foden's seven word message is perfect reply to Cesc Fabregas 'step up' criticism\n\nIt gave way to critics calling for him to be dropped against Denmark on Thursday, while others blamed Southgate for not utilising him in a central-attacking midfield position. However, City manager and tactical genius Guardiola provided another alternative on how to utilise Foden back in 2023.\n\nHaving yet to deploy Foden there in his career, Guardiola claimed the midfielder has the potential to flourish in a deeper role. That is despite the 24-year-old scoring 27 goals last season and largely being seen as an attacker, either through the middle or on the wings.\n\n\"When Phil plays as a right-winger, he can do it,\" said Guardiola. \"In the beginning when he played as a left-winger, he played well. In the middle he can play right, left, in the pockets - no problem.\n\n\"What I would like in the end is that he plays as a holding midfielder, or one of two holding midfielders. For that, he needs to understand the game as a whole, in everything, not just 'me'.\n\n\"But at the same time, he has this instinct, natural, like the big talents, in the final third. I'm not going to stop him. I'm not going to step in and say, 'Don't do that!' Because he's unique.\"\n\nDiscussing the prospect of Foden moving further back in midfield, Guardiola added: \"Sometimes it is the step one has to gain as a football player, playing in that position which carries some duties for the team.\"\n\nThe Spaniard's words at the time caused a stir due to Foden's guile, final ball and eye for goal being more suited to an attacking role. Yet similarly technical players such as Bernardo Silva, Xavi Hernandez, Santi Cazorla, Andres Iniesta and even Luka Modric have flourished by dropping deeper in the past, becoming integral to build-up play in the second phase of the attack.\n\nIt is important to note that Guardiola was likely offering his thoughts in terms of Foden later on in his career, when his pace declines and he has gained enough tactical knowledge to successfully play deeper. And Foden himself even revealed early on in the season that his favourite position is in the No.10 role, currently occupied by star man Bellingham for England.\n\nBut a player with his passing ability and press resistance playing alongside Declan Rice in the double pivot may kill two birds with one stone for Southgate - not having to drop one of his most talented players while solving the midfield problem.\n\nSouthgate experimented by playing Trent Alexander-Arnold, who primarily figures at right-back for Liverpool, in the middle against Serbia. His interception was crucial in the build-up to the goal - but he clearly lacked the legs and spatial awareness under pressure to become England's very own Toni Kroos, as his advocates had hypothesised.\n\nFoden's midfield experience could make him just that - though Kobbie Mainoo, Adam Wharton and Conor Gallagher remain ahead of him in the current pecking order for that role. Meanwhile, other more natural options for Southgate on the left wing include Anthony Gordon and Eberechi Eze.\n\nSpain's 2010 World Cup-winning midfielder Cesc Fabregas argued that getting the best out of Foden is not down to the manager but the player's desire and mentality himself during his punditry for the BBC. Whether Southgate decides to drop him, play him in a different position, or the Stockport man finally decides to rise up to the occasion at international level, England's Foden dilemma must be solved if they are to win this tournament.", "source": {"uri": "manchestereveningnews.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Manchester Evening News"}, "authors": [{"uri":

While it is fair to say Foden did not have his best match against Serbia we have to remember his outstanding performances for Manchester City last season.\n\nWhile Foden may not be at his best when asked to play from the left in a rigid system, it is worth noting that he played a different role to Bukayo Saka played on the right wing.\n\nWhile Sake stayed wide and looked to isolate defenders 1v1 on the wing, we saw Foden drift around the pitch in and out of pockets of space and not stay wide.\n\nPart of the issues Foden had in the match was down to the fact that he was trying to come inside and occupy the same spaces that Bellingham was taking up in central spaces.\n\nFoden wanted to receive in these areas, but having another player, like Bellingham, also spaced centrally meant that it was too crowded.\n\nAt Real Madrid, Bellingham often rotates outside to fill space on the left side of the attack as Vinicius Junior comes inside, but he typically stayed central in the final third against Serbia.\n\nSo, how do England and Southgate solve these issues to get the best out of Foden?\n\nWe believe adjusting the shape to have Bellingham starting from a deeper position, as the number 8 beside Declan Rice, and Foden then playing centrally as the 10 would be more effective in terms of finding the combinations and the angles to play through in the central areas.\n\nThis would also allow Southgate to use a more direct winger on the left side to stretch the pitch and create space centrally for their best players.\n\nIf Foden does play on the left side against Denmark then he will have to stay slightly wider, at the very least in the channels, in order to find the space to play.\n\nWhile England came into the tournament with fans and pundits alike praising their attacking options, there was real concern about the squad from a defensive perspective.\n\nWhile long-term Southgate favourite Harry Maguire was left out of the final squad there was a question mark as to who would start as the left-sided central defender in their back four?\n\nIn the end, Southgate decided to go with Crystal Palace star Marc Guehi, and the 23-year-old defender barely put a foot wrong.\n\nIn possession, he was safe and secure but also displayed the ability to progress the ball through the lines.\n\nDefensively he was solid as he dealt with the threat of the dangerous Serbian forwards.\n\nJuventus ace Dusan Vlahovic, in particular, looked to play on Guehi's side of the pitch.\n\nBut we saw the defender play effectively whether he was defending tight or in space as he stopped Vlahovic from receiving the ball in dangerous positions.\n\nAnd this was key in helping earn a clean sheet.\n\nKeeping the partnership of John Stones and Guehi at the centre of the defence might be one of the keys for England if they are to be successful in this tournament.\n\nOf course, different opponents will require different remedies.\n\nDespite only coming out of their opening group stage game against Slovenia with one point, Denmark will still be difficult opposition for England.\n\nTheir strikers, Wind and Hojlund, are both over 6ft with pace and power and the ability to run in behind the defensive line.\n\nThey have experience and technical quality throughout their squad and they will have studied the Serbia match to understand the threat England pose.\n\nThe key for England will be in finding ways to apply pressure to the Danish build-up.\n\nThe likes of Foden, Saka and Bellingham will have to be ready to join Kane in pressing high against the three-man Danish backline to prevent them from building their attack.\n\nAt the end of the day, England are the only side in Group C to come through the opening round of fixtures with three points and they have put themselves in the driving seat to secure qualification.\n\nBeating Denmark will see England through to the knockout stages, where the margins grow even finer.", "source": {"uri": "thesun.co.uk",

The 24-year-old netted 19 goals and registered eight assists, which helped Manchester City lift their fourth consecutive Premier League title. The Blues became the first team to achieve the feat.\n\nAfter enjoying a purple patch with the Premier League champions, the spotlight fell on Foden, with fans expecting the youngster to deliver for the Three Lions as well.\n\nDuring the tournament opener against Serbia, England clinched a 1-0 victory but Foden didn't deliver just like he did for the Premier League champions.\n\nAhead of their clash against Denmark, Southgate praised Foden for his performance against Serbia.\n\n\"I thought Phil did an incredible job for the team on Sunday. You know, sometimes the bits with the ball are obvious and they catch the eye, but the amount of ground he covered, the angles of pressing, the filling in for people who were further forward,\" Southgate said, as quoted from Sky Sports.\n\n\"I thought without Phil's contribution without the ball - and I know that's not the sexy bit and everybody wants to see him on the ball - I don't think we win the game. So then later in the game, when we needed somebody to retain the ball and take the pressure, I thought he did that really well for us,\" he added.\n\nSouthgate went on to point out the difference for Foden when he plays for Manchester City and England. The English manager pointed out familiarity and adaptation as the two factors that lead to different performances for both teams.\n\n\"I think Phil has obviously set an incredibly high bar at Manchester City, where he knows exactly where every player is going to be every time he picks the ball up. With us, we're always having to adapt to different team-mates, different runs they make and there is an adaptation with that,\" Southgate remarked.

The Three Lions are top of the pool after their opening match but struggled to keep control after Jude Bellingham's early opener.\n\nFabregas, 37, was a guest during the BBC's coverage of the clash and passed judgement over Southgate's tactics. Namely, the Spaniard focused on the midfield and was surprised to see Palmer - who was named Premier League Young Player of the Season last term - fail to even make his way off the bench.\n\n\"If you send the message in putting in a defensive midfielder or an extra defender to cover the result, you will as a player feel it,\" said the guest pundit. \"Mentally you start going back, dropping more. But instead if you put an offensive player, Palmer let's say, up the pitch and controlling the ball in the final third, I think the players get so much more comfortable.\"\n\nSouthgate used only three of his five permitted substitutes on Sunday, with Conor Gallagher the first to join the fray as a replacement for Trent Alexander-Arnold in the 69th minute. Jarrod Bowen and Kobbie Mainoo then came on for Bukayo Saka and Bellingham, respectively.\n\nFabregas interpreted those changes as too defensively minded, and it showed in the game's momentum. England had five shots at goal in all against Serbia, but only one of those came in the final 20 minutes, while four of the opposition's six attempts materialised in that same span.\n\nFabregas also picked out Manchester City marvel Phil Foden for not doing enough on the night, adding: \"It's about do you want it enough to make a difference and hold the ball for your team? Do you want to make things happen? Do you enjoy to get the ball under pressure?\n\n\"They allowed them to have the ball when they were deep once in the second half, straight away, when they started to get pressed a little bit more, we started to see Foden hitting the ball without looking 40 yards.\"\n\nHe then compared the Premier League Player of the Season with past Barcelona team-mates, calling on Foden to do more for his country. \"You'll never see Xavi, [Andres] Iniesta, the top, top players in the last 15, 20, years, do that,\" Fabregas continued. \"You need to take this responsibility to grow.\n\n\"I think that the second half was a little bit underwhelming. I would say that is the right word. And I think players like Foden, they need to step up. This is the time for them to go into big tournaments with their country behind them.\"\n\nSouthgate & Co have three days to address any shortcomings before a crunch Group C clash against Denmark on Thursday. The Danes gave England some reprieve by drawing against lower-ranked Slovenia in their opening game, but defeat for the Three Lions could blow the group wide open.\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

I think he will make one or two changes,\" Shearer told the Rest is Football podcast.\n\n\"He might look at the Trent Alexander-Arnold situation. He might put Bellingham back alongside Rice and play Foden in the 10 and maybe put Anthony Gordon out wide [left].\"\n\nWayne Rooney\n\nSimilarly, former England captain Wayne Rooney believes Gordon is the 'right person' to start on the left-hand side of England's front three.\n\n\"I think since his move from Everton to Newcastle, obviously, I did a similar thing in moving to Manchester United, he got a bit of stick from the Evertonians. But he's settled down really well at Newcastle,\" Rooney told Channel 4\n\n\"He's brought great creativity, he's fearless with the ball and works hard. He brings a great balance to the team so, for me, he's the right person to start off that left.\"\n\nTheo Walcott\n\nTheo Walcott knows all too well about the demands of representing England as a winger in a major tournament and played alongside Gordon at Everton.\n\nAs such, the former Arsenal star has called for Gordon to come into the side as a direct replacement for Foden.\n\n\"I like Anthony Gordon. I've seen him up and personal,\" Walcott told Metro.\n\n\"I like the fact that he likes to go on the outside, not that standard, sort of inverted winger. He likes to challenge defenders, keep them guessing and I feel like you're going to need something different, and that's why he's there.\n\n\"He's there to provide something different for that squad. So, if I was going to change things, I'll probably put him in. I think there's a lot of debate about Phil Foden at this moment in time, who's best to play in those positions.\n\n\"Obviously, Bellingham for me is a stand out player which then means you lose a lot of Foden's qualities, so I would probably like to see Anthony Gordon if I'm being brutally honest. He's so exciting, he's fresh and he's fearless and I think you need that at international level.\"\n\nJamie O'Hara\n\nFormer Tottenham midfielder Jamie O'Hara agrees with Walcott and feels Foden 'has to be better' in an England shirt, regardless of what position he plays in.\n\n\"For me, you've got to start Anthony Gordon at left wing over Phil Foden,\" he told Grosvenor Sport.\n\n\"Gordon has had a great season for Newcastle - he works hard, he's direct and he makes things happen. He's good enough for this level and I would drop Phil Foden for him - as mad as that sounds.\n\n\"I think that in an England shirt Foden has to be better, whether he plays in his best position or out of position, he's a top player and he's good enough to make things happen no matter where he is on a football pitch.\n\n\"I do feel for him, you're asking him to play in an unnatural position on the opposite side to where he has played all season, but there were moments in the game where he was giving the ball away from simple passes and just wasn't making anything happen.\n\n\"You have to drop a player sometimes for the balance of the team, you're not going to drop Jude Bellingham from the 10 or Bukayo Saka from the right and he won't have Declan Rice sitting on his own, so he needs to be dropped and used as that impact sub off the bench like Marcus Rashford was at the World Cup, Foden needs to become that impact player and Gordon needs to start instead.\"\n\nAndy Cole\n\nHowever, Newcastle United legend Andy Cole does not feel Gordon deserves to start this evening and feels Chelsea's Cole Palmer would be a better alternative for Foden.\n\n\"No, not really,\" Cole told Betfred when asked if he feels Gordon should start against Denmark.\n\n\"I feel like everyone has been pushing for Gordon, before the end of the season, to go to the Euros, but when you look at England and what they have, you could have the same argument for Cole Palmer.\n\n\"When you end up with the goals that he's got, you could turn around and say that you've got to find a space for him, but then you could end up in an endless cycle of saying that England needs to find a place for Anthony Gordon, Cole Palmer, Bukayo Saka and Phil Foden. The list is endless.\n\n\"Everybody has got their own opinion about who they think should and shouldn't play, it's like the talk about Jack Grealish and Marcus Rashford not making the squad and what a mistake that is. It's all a matter of opinion.\n\n\"For example, look at how the media and people were talking about Saka the other day - everyone was saying that he was the one who deserved to miss out on the squad, then fast forward to Sunday night and with the way that he played, I think he's made a few people swallow their words as he proved to everyone, and himself, that he's worthy.\"", "source": {"uri":

Instead, a little over an hour later, Raheem Sterling scores the game's winning goal and goes on to be the campaign's star.\n\nTo call the miss a sliding doors moment would perhaps be to offer it undue providence for what came next, but it is true that from that point Foden's tournament never really caught alight.\n\nHe started the next group game, the soggy 0-0 with Scotland, then lost his place through a complicated set of circumstances; a suspension risk, Mason Mount's Covid isolation and Bukayo Saka's breakthrough. Eventually, his tournament was ended by a training-ground injury that ruled him out even of a place on the bench for the final.\n\nAnd so it is understandable that already, after one peripheral outing against Serbia, there are fears that for English football's player of the year, this European Championship might spiral the same way; a shirt lost to, maybe, Anthony Gordon, an international career still selling itself short.\n\nTo ease those fears slightly, it is worth remembering that Foden's second major tournament, the World Cup in Qatar, followed the reverse trajectory: starting out of the side, finishing in it after excellent shows against Wales and Senegal along the way. Fair enough, he would not have made anyone's team of the tournament, but he made an impact. An even better player now, one quiet night in Gelsenkirchen is hardly grounds for a firm verdict that he cannot do the same at these Euros, at the very least.\n\nThe frustration is that that is not really enough for the best player in a country with designs on winning the thing; the nagging worry that, 35 caps (and only four goals) into his England career, it does not feel like the Foden of Manchester City is exactly on the cusp of being unlocked.\n\nAnd really, it is difficult to put your finger on exactly why. The most common theory has seen the old spoilsport Gareth Southgate accused of inhibiting a free spirit. But he has repeatedly stressed the licence Foden has to roam (arguably more than at City) and it was obvious in the opening half-hour against Serbia, when the 24-year-old popped up on all corners of the pitch.\n\nCesc Fabregas, in his largely excellent BBC analysis, wondered whether Foden might be a bit more Jude Bellingham (yes, and I'll just be a bit more Brad Pitt, I hear you cry) in visibly imposing himself on matches. But the City man is a different type of player, a different physique, a different personality.\n\nIn the search for something concrete, others have found comfort in the familiar idea that England's left wing is cursed ground. But Foden regularly excels there for City, scoring six goals in his six most recent starts in the position during the Premier League run-in.\n\nMore to the point, where else can he nominally play in this team, with Bellingham central and Saka so consistent in his output on the right?\n\nTrue, it might not be Foden's very best position, but international football is littered with players adjusting, doing jobs, and doing them well. Half of England's outfield starters against Serbia -- Kieran Trippier, Trent Alexander-Arnold, Declan Rice, Bellingham and Foden -- were not playing in their most familiar club role of the season just gone. Maybe that is a problem in itself, but it is the reality of building a team when passports dictate the talent pool and managers cannot buy custom fits.\n\nThe best players are adaptable and the paradox is that Foden is probably the most versatile of the lot, having had to take work wherever he could get it when trying to break into Pep Guardiola's plans in his teens. Even now, though an almost certain City starter, he is used in positional rotation, a horse for every course, ridden in different ways.\n\nThere is enough time left in this tournament, against Denmark on Thursday night and beyond, to believe Foden and Southgate, too, can find a formula that works, too.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"},

The Manchester City star arrived at Euro 2024 off the back of an impressive term where he was named Premier League player of the season.\n\nBBC pundit Micah Richards believes that the decision to start Foden on the left was the reason for a difficult night. Ex-Arsenal, Chelsea and Barcelona midfielder Fabregas was less sympathetic of the 24-year-old however.\n\nFabregas said: \"I love that you try to defend him, seriously, I get your point totally. But a player of this class, of this level, of this talent, for me sometimes, he doesn't even need to be told by the coach what he needs to do. He needs to want it more than the rest and for me today, it showed that Jude is a little bit above him in this regard.\"\n\nFormer England under-21 boss Pearce is in full agreement with Fabregas' take. The 62-year-old notes that Bellingham has taken ownership in a central attacking position, so Foden will need to work to have an impact around him.\n\nPearce told Footy Accumulators: \"I would tend to agree with Cesc Fabregas on Phil Foden needing to take responsibility. \"Players have to take responsibility for their own performance. They're not told not to get turned, not to take people on, all of those types of things.\n\n\"You're responsible for your own performance in many ways, unless there's something really, really special that the manager wants you to do. But I don't know too many managers that ask players to do stuff that is detrimental to the players that they've just picked.

Foden dazzled around defenders and enjoyed a prolific season in front of the goal. The 24-year-old netted 19 goals and registered eight assists, which helped Manchester City lift their fourth consecutive Premier League title. The Blues became the first team to achieve the feat.\n\nAfter enjoying a purple patch with the Premier League champions, the spotlight fell on Foden, with fans expecting the youngster to deliver for the Three Lions as well.

Southgate went on to point out the difference for Foden when he plays for Manchester City and England. The English manager pointed out familiarity and adaptation as the two factors that lead to different performances for both teams.\n\n\"I think Phil has obviously set an incredibly high bar at Manchester City, where he knows exactly where every player is going to be every time he picks the ball up.

You can check out at any time. More info\n\nCesc Fabregas and Rio Ferdinand believe Jude Bellingham's personality is making him the driving force in England's team - making Phil Foden take a backseat.\n\nReal Madrid superstar Bellingham stole the show against Serbia on Sunday night, scoring the only goal of the game as England started their European Championships campaign with a victory. Bellingham ghosted into the six-yard box to head home Bukayo Saka's right wing cross and looked a cut above the rest in Gelsenkirchen.\n\nAt 20, the former Birmingham City starlet is the youngest player in Gareth Southgate's starting XI, but he is already the Three Lions' leading light. Bellingham's brilliance in the number 10 role has seen Foden shunted out wide and the Manchester City ace, who was crowned PFA Player of the Year for his excellent showings this season, struggled to make a telling contribution against Serbia.\n\nFormer City and England defender Micah Richards was left frustrated by Foden's position in the aftermath but fellow pundits Fabregas and Ferdinand analysed the situation differently.\n\nREAD: How England ace Jude Bellingham twice saved Birmingham City from financial peril\n\nREAD: Why Jude Bellingham covered his face after scoring England winner\n\nFabregas said: \"I get your point totally, but a player of this class, of this level, of this talent, sometimes doesn't even need to be told by the coach. He needs to want it more than the rest and for me, today, it showed that Jude is a little bit above him in this regard.

Phil Foden put in an under-fire performance against Serbia and Shearer believes he should move from the left-winger to the middle. Shearer thinks Trent Alexander-Arnold should drop out of the team, with Jude Bellingham moving into a more defensive position alongside Declan Rice.\n\nAlthough England's Euro 2024 campaign got off to a flying start against Serbia with a 1-0 victory, thus putting them at the top of Group C heading into the second round of fixtures, there were some issues that Gareth Southgate needs to sort ahead of their inevitably harder clash against Kasper Hjulmand's Denmark.\n\nFor instance: how to get the best out of Phil Foden? Former Arsenal and Chelsea man Cesc Fabregas recently insisted that it is down to the Stockport-born ace to grab a game of such magnitude by the horns, but the Three Lions chief could deploy him centrally to cater to his best attributes.\n\nSouthgate and Co have the chance to all-but confirm their progression to the knockout rounds with a win over the Danes - but the Premier League's all-time top goalscorer, Alan Shearer, wants to see a duo of tweaks to the side that clashed with Serbia.\n\nShearer Calls For Foden and Bellingham Change Thinks Man City man is deprived of best position Close\n\nSpeaking on BBC's coverage of the tournament alongside Fabregas, Frank Lampard and Gary Lineker, the former Newcastle United and Blackburn Rovers hitman suggested that Southgate could change the positions of two of the nation's star men, Foden and Jude Bellingham.\n\n\"I would go back to the team that I thought may have started in terms of playing [Anthony] Gordon on the left-hand side and I perhaps would have played [Jude] Bellingham alongside [Declan] Rice and then had [Phil] Foden in the 10 role. Keep Rice very much in that six position, yeah. Absolutely, that's what I would have done.\n\nTalking about Foden's struggles in England's curtain raiser, Shearer explained how having a right-footed Kieran Trippier at left-back may have limited what the Manchester City man was capable of on Sunday.\n\n\"Trippier is a really, really good full-back. But having a right-footed player at left-back, when he's receiving the ball, he's receiving the ball facing the goalkeeper rather than facing out to the left-hand side. So I don't think that actually helped Foden in that position either.\"\n\nThere's no doubting that Foden produced a worrying display against Serbia, but stationing him in the space behind Harry Kane, thus pushing Bellingham further back, would then rid the Los Blancos star of his favoured position. Running into the box to cause chaos and shoot on sight is Bellingham's bread and butter and that would be restricted with his compatriot moving infield.\n\nGIVEMESPORT Key Statistic : Foden enjoyed his best-ever domestic return in 2023/24, notching 27 goals and 12 assists in 53 games across all competitions for Manchester City.\n\nShearer's England XI to Face Denmark Alexander-Arnold drops out\n\nAs expected, no changes have been made to England's back four because of a) the lack of options and b) how well they performed as a unit in Gelsenkirchen, while the ever-reliable Jordan Pickford keeps his spot between the sticks. For Shearer, though, moving Foden infield would be the way to go against Denmark.\n\nTaking over from Bellingham's role behind the leading talisman, Harry Kane, the Real Madrid ace would be forced to revert to a deeper role alongside Declan Rice, hence why Trent Alexander-Arnold is excluded from the starting XI. As alluded to, the latter would take on the majority of the defensive duties, allowing the former to be the difference maker in the final third, which was shown in abundance in England's opener.\n\nRelated Gareth Southgate Must Drop 2 Players and Name This England XI for Denmark Game\n\nA couple of players were not at their dazzling best during England's Euro 2024 curtain raiser.\n\nAble to provide England with an injection of pace on the left flank, Gordon's introduction could give Southgate and his men another outlet given that Marcus Rashford and Raheem Sterling - two experienced, darting run-making wingers - are not part of the squad. Arsenal's Bukayo Saka and Bayern Munich frontman Kane would keep their places, too.", "source": {"uri": "givemesport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GiveMeSport"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Despite the team picking up a much-needed win, experts were not impressed with England's performance. While Harry Kane and Co. had a good start in the first 20 minutes of the game, the team failed to create a hole in Serbia's defense in the following minutes. Phil Foden, who started as the team's No. 10 over Jude Bellingham, looked lackluster in the unfamiliar role as the player failed to make an impact for his national team.\n\nFormer English star Jamie Carragher touched down on the team's display following the game as he claimed Gareth Southgate needs to stop experimenting in such a major tournament. The pundit claimed, \"There has been a lot of talk about Bellingham being deeper to allow Foden to play as the 10. England's opening goal shows why it has to be Bellingham in that role. After an encouraging start that turned into a satisfactory rather than an excellent win for England. They ran out of steam as the game progressed.\"\n\nThere were a lot of expectations on Phil Foden heading into the game. The Manchester City star had a phenomenal season for his club, with the player bagging the PWA Player of the Year award. However, his performance in the opening game against Serbia was nowhere close to the standards fans expect from him.\n\nJamie O'Hara rips into Phil Foden and Trent Alexander-Arnold\n\nFormer Tottenham star Jamie O'Hara was less than pleased with England's performance against Serbia in their Euro opener. The player-turned-manager seemed displeased with Gareth Southgate's selection as he felt the Three Lions were nowhere close to how fans expected them to perform. O'Hara also questioned Southgate's decision to deploy Trent Alexander-Arnold in the midfield while slamming Phil Foden to deliver for his country.\n\nDuring a watch along with TalkSport, O'Hara stated, \"Phil Foden should be off the pitch. I'm sorry I love him. He has been unbelievable this season. But he's ineffective in an England shirt. Trent, I think that's the last game we'll see him play in midfield. I just don't think he's good enough in the midfield. He's not comfortable there, he's gonna give the ball away. I mean he made just one change, I mean come on.\"\n\nIt will be interesting to see if Gareth Southgate changes his approach after the recent criticism.

Alexander-Arnold will be tasked with partnering Rice at the base of midfield.\n\nBellingham should operate as England's number 10, flanked by Foden and Bukayo Saka, which will leave many supporters concerned by the lack of natural width on the left flank.

He came into that middle position too early and too often.\n\n'Kieran Trippier is the one who would give England the width on the left. Trippier is a good England defender, very tough but he is not naturally left footed like Luke Shaw or Ben Chilwell getting forward. We're limited down that side a bit.\n\n'Foden played the entire game, I probably would have taken him off earlier. He has had a long season, but he hasn't played for England the same way he has played for Man City. Sometimes we have seen glimpses of it and I am sure it will come and hopefully in this competition.\n\n'While everyone is talking about Bellingham and rightly so, we have other attacking talent who have been there and done it at club level. It is pretty formidable , that foursome [Bellingham, Bukayo Saka, Foden, Harry Kane].\n\n'It is a problem for other teams but we have got to make it a problem for them and give them the ball in key areas for them to work their magic.'\n\nWhile Bellingham was England's star man on the night, Marc Guehi also shone at the heart of defence alongside John Stones.\n\nFilling the void left by Harry Maguire who was not included in the final squad, the Crystal Palace defender turned in a composed performance - particularly in the first half where he completed every pass attempted and won every duel and tackle he was involved in against formidable centre forward opposition in Aleksandr Mitrovic and Dusan Vlahovic.\n\n'He won headers against some very experienced players. I was really pleased with his performance' Butcher said of the 23-year-old defender.\n\n;He knocked the ball around very well, to the point where you couldn't take which one was his strongest foot. His pace is also a big asset. But I loved the way he threaded the balls through to the midfield, into Bellingham, into Kane. The confidence to do that is great.'\n\nMORE : Didier Deschamps confirms the reason he made U-turn on Arsenal star William Saliba\n\nMORE : France superstar Kylian Mbappe could miss rest of Euro 2024 after being taken to hospital with broken nose", "source": {"uri": "metro.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Metro"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tony_mogan@metro.co.uk", "name": "Tony Mogan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Butcher", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Terry Butcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Foden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Phil Foden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jude_Bellingham", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jude Bellingham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assist (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kieran_Trippier", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kieran Trippier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Header_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Header (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cap_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cap (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Shaw", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Luke Shaw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Chilwell", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ben Chilwell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Gu\u00e9hi", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marc Gu\u00e9hi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Saliba", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "William Saliba"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bukayo_Saka", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bukayo Saka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Kane", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Harry Kane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Didier_Deschamps", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Didier Deschamps"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Maguire", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Harry Maguire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Stones", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John Stones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "France national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arsenal F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_Palace_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Crystal Palace F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kylian_Mbapp\u00e9", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kylian Mbapp\u00e9"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Drama", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Drama", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Jorkyball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Jorkyball", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill_or_Bust", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill or Bust", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-2157925896.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0px%2C96px%2C1022px%2C538px&resize=1200%2C630", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9657992", "eventUri": "eng-9657992", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

There was talk of whether Foden would even start for England with Anthony Gordon an option to bring in - but Southgate was vehement that the Three Lions would \"not have won\" their opening game of Euro 2024 without the No.11's off-ball work.\n\nIn the opening exchanges against Denmark, however, Foden was clearly hugging the touchline in a way he hadn't at the tournament so far - before coming narrower than before. This was noted by BBC commentator Guy Mowbray and echoed by co-commentator Alan Shearer, who noted his \"free role\" in England's team.\n\nSouthgate went for the same line-up that started against Serbia, opting for the attacking XI that included Trent Alexander-Arnold, Phil Foden and Jude Bellingham in the midfield five behind Harry Kane - though hinted pre-match that his substitutes would play a key role later on against the Danes.\n\n\"We had lots of elements of our game that were good, some that could be better, now it's about doing it for 90 minutes,\" Southgate told ITV before kick-off. \"We're gonna need fresh legs at some point for sure.

Ferdinand likened Foden's situation to that of Man Utd flop Juan Sebastian Veron, who also struggled to assert himself on the pitch.\n\nManchester City ace Foden, who won the 2023-24 Premier League Player of the Season award, looked like a shadow of his brilliant self in England's 1-0 victory over Serbia in their first game of UEFA EURO 2024. Deployed on the left flank, Foden found himself isolated at times, struggling to get on the ball. He also rarely made inroads into the Serbian box, whereas the likes of Jude Bellingham and Bukayo Saka penetrated the area with ease.\n\nOver the course of the game, Foden failed to dispatch even a single shot, let alone land one on target. He also had just one touch inside the opposition box and created a single chance for his teammates.\n\nOn his FIVE podcast, ex-England international Ferdinand discussed why Foden was struggling for England despite playing world-class soccer for Manchester City. The former center-back claimed that the 24-year-old was was not vocal enough, which allowed the likes of Bellingham to take the spotlight away from him. Ferdinand added that the same happened to Veron, who surrendered control to Roy Keane and eventually left United after making just 51 Premier League appearances.\n\nFerdinand said (via Manchester Evening News):\n\n\"Me, Micah [Richards] and Cesc [Fabregas] done that game [for BBC ] the other day and Micah was saying how he felt sorry for Phil and about how [Gareth] Southgate's not getting the best out of him. And then, to be fair, Cesc just put him away, just said, 'listen, no, no, no, it's down to Foden'. Foden's got to go out there and you're talking about body language, being demanding and authoritative with the way that you want the ball.\n\n\"Jude [Bellingham] has got that in spades and I think if we're going to see the best out of Phil Foden, and I agree with Cesc, he's got to really go out there and try and dominate the pitch and dominate some of his teammates to give him the ball and be the first one to shout.\"\n\nDrawing likenesses with Veron's situation at United, Ferdinand added:\n\n\"But I've seen this before at Man United. We had Roy Keane who demanded the ball in the middle of the pitch. We signed a superstar in Juan Sebastian Veron.\n\n\"He was a playmaker that wanted to get the ball off all of the players and that's how he got his rhythm and play. But Roy Keane dominated because he was more animated, the characteristics that he had came out and was much more dominant.\"\n\nHe concluded by adding:\n\n\"He was there before and dominated that area. And Veron folded really and had to be sold and didn't really become a success at Man United. But he was a fantastically talented player and I hope Phil doesn't fall like that.\"\n\nFoden has played 35 matches for England in all competitions, scoring just four times and providing eight assists. It will be interesting to see if he can add to his tally in England's second game in EURO 2024 against Denmark on Thursday (June 20).", "source": {"uri": "sportslens.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportslens.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sushan_chakraborty@sportslens.com", "name": "Sushan Chakraborty", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_Ferdinand", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rio Ferdinand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Foden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Phil Foden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jude_Bellingham", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jude Bellingham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Sebasti\u00e1n_Ver\u00f3n", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Juan Sebasti\u00e1n Ver\u00f3n"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bukayo_Saka", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bukayo Saka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League_Player_of_the_Season", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Premier League Player of the Season"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Keane", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Roy Keane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_Evening_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manchester Evening News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playmaker", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Playmaker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Denmark national football team"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online/Strategy", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online/Strategy", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://sportslens.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Phil-Foden-England.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9657992", "eventUri": "eng-9657992", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-20", "textStart": 3104, "textEnd": 3111}], "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

He needs to want it more than the rest and for me today, it showed that Jude (Bellingham) is a little bit above him in this regard.\"\n\nBut Keane did not agree, saying on ITV of Foden's performance: \"I thought he done okay, but this idea that the manager should take him out of the team... Phil Foden is an amazing, fantastic player. He's had a great season. Okay he was quiet last night, but he's entitled to an off night.\n\n\"But don't be writing this kid off. He's got so much talent.

He's a leader now. I think he's turning into a leader. I think our link-up play is good at times and I think it's improving as well, and can keep getting better. So, he's an exciting talent and I enjoy playing with him.\"\n\nSouthgate has some options, and finding the right one could determine whether England is able to live up to its pre-tournament billing as favorite to lift the trophy.\n\n[Euro 2024 team futures]\n\nHe could leave things as they are, with Bellingham in an advanced \"No. 10\" position and Foden on the left, plus Bukayo Saka remaining in the right-sided position from where he was effective against Serbia, and hope that the chemistry gets better as the tournament progresses.\n\nSouthgate could also drop Bellingham into something more closely resembling the deeper midfield spot he most often occupied before his move to Madrid.\n\nHowever, such was the explosive effectiveness of that switch over the past year, that it seems unlikely he would wish to do so, even though it would allow Foden to gravitate more toward the middle.\n\nA final alternative would be to leave Foden out altogether, and use a more natural left-sided player like Chelsea youngster Cole Palmer or Newcastle's Anthony Gordon on that flank.\n\nThat would seem harsh given Foden's level of performance during the club season, and Southgate's insistence that his primary method for choosing his squad was the quality of each player's form in the most recent campaign.\n\n[Want great stories delivered right to your inbox?

Neither Denmark nor Slovenia has shown any inclination to employ a congested back-five like that used by Serbia head coach Dragan Stojkovic.\n\nAlmost as much of a concern as how the 24-year-old links with Bellingham will be the way he seemed unable to get on the same page as England left-back Kieran Trippier, stifling any attempt at fluidity down that channel.\n\n\"I think the first game of a major tournament is always the most difficult,\" Foden added. \"I think it's important to get off to a win and, yeah, we did that. It was difficult at times. Obviously, we had to defend at times and dig deep.\n\n\"But I think that shows a different side to us and if we're going to win something, I think that we have to do that.\"\n\nDenmark presents as England's toughest test of the group stage. Despite managing only a 1-1 tie in its clash with Slovenia, the Danes are a highly-skilled unit and pushed Southgate's squad close when the sides met in the semifinal of Euro 2020, which was delayed until the following year due to COVID.\n\nHead coach Kasper Hjulmand has an attacking issue of his own as his star forward, Rasmus Hojlund of Manchester United, has scored only once in his last nine games for the national team and missed a one-on-one with goalkeeper Jan Oblak against Slovenia. He was replaced by Yussuf Poulsen with seven minutes left.\n\n\"It comes in phases as a striker,\" Hjulmand told a press conference. \"Rasmus always makes a big difference, so it's not a concern, and I am sure the goals will come.\"", "source": {"uri": "foxsports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FOX Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jude_Bellingham",

The team to play next had been leaked in the press already with Gareth Southgate showing faith in his players. Alan Shearer wanted Anthony Gordon to start but he looks set to be disappointed.\n\nHaving won their first game against Serbia by a single goal, all eyes now turn to Denmark as England aim to advance out of their Euro 2024 group and go deep into the tournament.\n\nBefore the game even begins, Gareth Southgate will have a big decision to make. Indeed, he must name the XI he feels is best placed to get him across the line.\n\nThe Three Lions weren't exactly brilliant against Serbia but they did get all three points. Now, less than 24 hours before the game, it appears as though the national team manager has made peace with that performance. At least that's the impression given upon viewing the team which has been leaked in the press.\n\nEngland XI vs Denmark Southgate remains unchanged\n\nAccording to journalist Sami Mokbel, Southgate will stick with an unchanged team against the Danes. While it's no surprise that the spine of the team will stay the same, there has been some doubt over a few different positions.\n\nNamely, Phil Foden and Trent Alexander-Arnold struggled to impress. As such, the likes of Anthony Gordon and Conor Gallagher have both been touted as possible candidates to come into the team.\n\nThe Liverpool right-back - playing in central midfield - was substituted in place of Gallagher in the second half and the Chelsea man worked hard to help England hand on to all three points. Gordon did not get onto the pitch vs Serbia but his speed is viewed as making him a better fit to play alongside Harry Kane and Bukayo Saka in the front line.\n\nRelated 3 England Players Gareth Southgate Should Have Taken to Euro 2024\n\nThe Three Lions are missing some key players who could have made them even better\n\nThe good news is that Kieran Trippier seems fit to play. Mokbel noted that he appeared to be in some discomfort during the closing stages of the first game but is now in line to win his 50th cap. With Luke Shaw still out injured, the Newcastle defender's fitness is vital for the Three Lions - perhaps he's been boosted by pickle juice.\n\nShaw hasn't played since February due to a hamstring injury and didn't train with his team-mates on Wednesday. It was hoped that the Manchester United left-back would be fit enough to play some part in the game vs Denmark but it remains unclear if he'll even be back in time for any of the group stages.\n\nEngland 1-0 Serbia\n\nStat\n\nEngland\n\nSerbia\n\nPossession\n\n53.2%\n\n46.8%\n\nShots\n\n5\n\n6\n\nShots on Target\n\n3\n\n1\n\nTotal touches in the box\n\n12\n\n11\n\nCorner\n\n1\n\n2\n\nFouls\n\n8\n\n19\n\nMarc Guehi impressed in the backline alongside John Stones and so has done more than enough to retain his spot in the side, while the likes of Jude Bellingham, Declan Rice and Saka all stood out against Serbia. Kane will hope to have more of an influence on proceedings this time out, as he managed just two touches of the ball during the first half of England's opening fixture.\n\nAlan Shearer Wants Gordon to Start Foden pushed into midfield with Rice and Bellingham\n\nIf the team does stay the same, the news might not go down too well with Alan Shearer. The former England striker had a few ideas on how to get the best out of Foden.\n\nIndeed, he wanted just one change made to the team with Gordon coming into the XI for Alexander-Arnold. This would mean Bellingham would drop down beside Rice, with Foden moving into an attacking midfielder role and the Newcastle winger heading to the left flank.\n\nHe explained: \"Trippier is a really, really good full-back. But having a right-footed player at left-back, when he's receiving the ball, he's receiving the ball facing the goalkeeper rather than facing out to the left-hand side. So I don't think that actually helped Foden in that position either.\"\n\nIt remains to be seen how patient Southgate will be with Foden and Alexander-Arnold. Another underwhelming display could prompt the English manager into changes soon enough and they both seem to be at risk.\n\nRelated Bukayo Saka vs Phil Foden's Total England Career Stats Comparison

Despite a less-than-impressive performance against Serbia, Southgate seems intent on maintaining an unchanged starting eleven, which has left supporters baffled and outraged.\n\nAccording to multiple reports, Southgate is set to field the same starting XI that played against Serbia. This decision means Alexander-Arnold and Foden will keep their places, despite heavy criticism for their recent performances. Southgate's preference for continuity after just one game suggests he believes in giving his players another chance to prove themselves.\n\nFan reactions\n\nPhil Foden's display on the left wing against Serbia drew significant ire from fans, many of whom feel he should be dropped from the starting lineup. Social media was ablaze with criticism directed at the Manchester City star.\n\n@FrankyRN51 didn't mince words, posting: \"Foden needs [to be] dropped.\"\n\nAnother user, @thefmetzger, was even more blunt: \"Foden should be on the beach in Ibiza.\"\n\nTrent Alexander-Arnold, who was deployed in an unfamiliar midfield role, received a mixed reaction. Some fans sympathized with his struggle in a new position, while others felt he didn't deserve to start.\n\n@LFC_Laith showed support for Alexander-Arnold but criticized Foden: \"Good on Trent he deserves it but Foden stinks.\"\n\nConversely, @madm0007 was shocked by the decision to include Alexander-Arnold: \"Shock!! So obvious. TAA in, really?\"\n\n@allstars_aag defended Alexander-Arnold: \"Why's Trent included in this.. Starboy Phil dropped an absolute stinker.\"\n\nDespite concerns about Kieran Trippier's fitness after he was seen struggling with cramps towards the end of the Serbia match, he is reportedly fit to start against Denmark. His availability is a boost for Southgate, who relies on Trippier's experience and versatility.\n\nUnfortunately for England, Luke Shaw will not be available for the Denmark match as he continues to recover from a hamstring injury. This ongoing absence leaves a gap in the defensive lineup, putting additional pressure on Southgate to get his team selection right.\n\nThe stakes against Denmark at Euro 2024\n\nEngland's narrow victory over Serbia has set the stage for a crucial clash with Denmark. A win on Friday would guarantee England a place in the knockout stages of Euro 2024. The pressure is on for key players like Harry Kane, Alexander-Arnold, and Foden to step up and deliver strong performances to silence their critics and secure England's progression in the tournament.\n\nHarry Kane, England's captain and talisman, will be looking to lead by example and find the back of the net. Similarly, both Alexander-Arnold and Foden will be keen to justify Southgate's faith in them and turn their fortunes around with standout performances.\n\nAs England prepares to face Denmark, the pressure is mounting on Gareth Southgate and his team. Fans are eager to see changes and improvements, particularly from players like Foden and Alexander-Arnold who have been under the spotlight.

The 24-year-old netted 19 goals and registered eight assists, which helped Manchester City lift their fourth consecutive Premier League title.

You know, sometimes the bits with the ball are obvious and they catch the eye, but the amount of ground he covered, the angles of pressing, the filling in for people who were further forward,\" Southgate said, as quoted from Sky Sports.\n\n\"I thought without Phil's contribution without the ball - and I know that's not the sexy bit and everybody wants to see him on the ball - I don't think we win the game. So then later in the game, when we needed somebody to retain the ball and take the pressure, I thought he did that really well for us,\" he added.\n\nSouthgate went on to point out the difference for Foden when he plays for Manchester City and England. The English manager pointed out familiarity and adaptation as the two factors that lead to different performances for both teams.\n\n\"I think Phil has obviously set an incredibly high bar at Manchester City, where he knows exactly where every player is going to be every time he picks the ball up. With us, we're always having to adapt to different team-mates, different runs they make and there is an adaptation with that,\" Southgate remarked.

Traditionalists still believe it would be wiser to drag Phil Foden towards the left, while Trent Alexander-Arnold is thought by most fans and pundits to be more comfortable on the right. The only consensus according to all opinion polls is Jude Bellingham holds the key.\n\nSo how can England coach Southgate unite the different factions for the greater good of the nation? Telegraph Sport looks at his tactical options ahead of the Euro 2014 group game against Denmark on Thursday night.\n\nThe sample size upon which a few thousand words of forensic analysis have been dedicated to England's new-look midfield is so minuscule, it serves to underline what a thankless job being a national coach is. Southgate and his assistant Steve Holland have worked out a formula to enable Foden and Bellingham to circulate in the central areas where they inflict most damage on opponents - as shown by England's first goal of the tournament.\n\nFor 45 minutes against Serbia it worked. Foden, Bellingham and Trent Alexander-Arnold interconnected, closing gaps across the centre of the pitch, and retaining possession with precise, well-paced passes, dragging the Serbian defence into uncomfortable areas. With Declan Rice in supreme form as the deepest midfielder, the balance looked good. The dominance did not last into the second half, but the theory this is because of Foden and Bellingham's positioning is half-baked.\n\nThe main worry in the latter stages against the Serbs was England's fatigue. Ditching the master plan after one game would smack of weakness and suggest Southgate is too preoccupied with populist propaganda. The system needs to evolve - most notably by ordering Harry Kane to make more runs beyond the shoulders of defenders, as Bukayo Saka does - but England's so-called midfield 'problem' has been greatly exaggerated. It is their strongest area.\n\nIf Harry Kane is going to persist in dropping to the No 10 position because he is frustrated when not getting a touch of the ball, clearly there is a tactical problem against deep defences. The congestion 40 yards from goal as Foden, Bellingham, Alexander-Arnold and Kane exchange passes will leave Saka as the only one making forward runs to occupy defenders and benefit from Alexander-Arnold's ability to find a killer pass. That reduces the Liverpool's man's effectiveness. In that situation, it makes more sense to select an out-and-out left winger such as Anthony Gordon to replicate Saka's role on the right.\n\nAsking Foden to play more as a left midfielder will not make much difference as he always drifts inside anyway rather than sprinting beyond full-backs. That means if Southgate has doubts about the system already - which is doubtful - and wants a left midfielder getting chalk on his boots, he will probably have to sacrifice Foden. But Southgate will be thinking longer-term. To win the tournament, England must beat one of the more technically proficient teams like Spain, Portugal and Germany, where previous wounding experiences proved the ability to retain possession is pivotal to controlling the game.\n\nIn those games, England outnumbering teams in the middle can be a supreme advantage - especially with players so comfortable on the ball - and Gordon's pace will be a more potent weapon between 70-90 minutes when the games open up against tiring defences.\n\nWhen England were at their best on Sunday, Rice was effectively this already as the Serbs were pinned back and Alexander-Arnold was too advanced to be described as a second No 6. Nevertheless, there are many who will argue that if Southgate likes this set-up so much it is more logical to select an out-and-out midfielder rather than someone learning on the job, especially at international level.\n\nIf Rice is the only holding midfielder, Bellingham and Foden can continue to play as interchanging No 10s and a space is freed for another attacker, with either Anthony Gordon on the left, or one of the Chelsea offensive midfield duo of Cole Palmer or Conor Gallagher. Picking Gordon ahead of Alexander-Arnold is illogical because the Newcastle man would be beneficiary of the playmaker's service. If one of Chelsea players replaces Alexander-Arnold, Kane will still need to play further up the pitch to stop getting in the way of the creative midfielders.\n\nAlso, any clamour for Palmer and Gallagher to be picked over Alexander-Arnold is contradictory since the main concerns about the Liverpool man focus on his defensive capacities. Leaving sole responsibility to Rice to protect the back four will make England more vulnerable against the strongest nations. So with this option, the midfield looks more imbalanced.\n\nAs Jamie Carragher pointed out in his post-Serbia Telegraph column, the main tactical concern for England on Sunday night was not the balance of the midfield, but how it impacted on Harry Kane. If Kane plays as a traditional No 9 it gives the creative players multiple passing options and the balance is better. Foden can indulge on his mazy dribbles and through balls, Bellingham can find the spaces between centre-backs as they are occupied by an out-and-out striker, and Alexander-Arnold has a six yard box target for his pinpoint deliveries.\n\nWhen Kane keeps dropping deep, the midfielders look up and see nothing. That is the opposite of what Foden is confronted with when taking possession for City, or Alexander-Arnold when adopting the hybrid role for Liverpool and seeing Mohamed Salah, Luis Diaz and Darwin Nunez dashing beyond defenders. If Kane is disciplined in his task as a target man, Foden and Bellingham can operate 'between the lines'. The tactical dilemma then is whether Kane is being compromised too much to accommodate all the midfielders.\n\nIt is a work in progress and too early for definitive conclusions. With England virtually guaranteed qualification into the knockout phase, the Denmark and Slovenia fixtures are a chance to cast further judgments and iron out the flaws.", "source": {"uri":

Traditionalists still believe it would be wiser to drag Phil Foden towards the left, while Trent Alexander-Arnold is thought by most fans and pundits to be more comfortable on the right. The only consensus according to all opinion polls is Jude Bellingham holds the key.\n\nSo how can England coach Southgate unite the different factions for the greater good of the nation? Telegraph Sport looks at his tactical options ahead of the Euro 2014 group game against Denmark on Thursday night.\n\nOPTION ONE: Change nothing\n\nThe sample size upon which a few thousand words of forensic analysis have been dedicated to England's new-look midfield is so minuscule, it serves to underline what a thankless job being a national coach is. Southgate and his assistant Steve Holland have worked out a formula to enable Foden and Bellingham to circulate in the central areas where they inflict most damage on opponents - as shown by England's first goal of the tournament.\n\nFor 45 minutes against Serbia it worked. Foden, Bellingham and Trent Alexander-Arnold interconnected, closing gaps across the centre of the pitch, and retaining possession with precise, well-paced passes, dragging the Serbian defence into uncomfortable areas. With Declan Rice in supreme form as the deepest midfielder, the balance looked good. The dominance did not last into the second half, but the theory this is because of Foden and Bellingham's positioning is half-baked.\n\nThe main worry in the latter stages against the Serbs was England's fatigue. Ditching the master plan after one game would smack of weakness and suggest Southgate is too preoccupied with populist propaganda. The system needs to evolve - most notably by ordering Harry Kane to make more runs beyond the shoulders of defenders, as Bukayo Saka does - but England's so-called midfield 'problem' has been greatly exaggerated. It is their strongest area.\n\nOPTION TWO: Drop Foden\n\nIf Harry Kane is going to persist in dropping to the No 10 position because he is frustrated when not getting a touch of the ball, clearly there is a tactical problem against deep defences. The congestion 40 yards from goal as Foden, Bellingham, Alexander-Arnold and Kane exchange passes will leave Saka as the only one making forward runs to occupy defenders and benefit from Alexander-Arnold's ability to find a killer pass. That reduces the Liverpool's man's effectiveness. In that situation, it makes more sense to select an out-and-out left winger such as Anthony Gordon to replicate Saka's role on the right.\n\nAsking Foden to play more as a left midfielder will not make much difference as he always drifts inside anyway rather than sprinting beyond full-backs. That means if Southgate has doubts about the system already - which is doubtful - and wants a left midfielder getting chalk on his boots, he will probably have to sacrifice Foden. But Southgate will be thinking longer-term. To win the tournament, England must beat one of the more technically proficient teams like Spain, Portugal and Germany, where previous wounding experiences proved the ability to retain possession is pivotal to controlling the game.\n\nIn those games, England outnumbering teams in the middle can be a supreme advantage - especially with players so comfortable on the ball - and Gordon's pace will be a more potent weapon between 70-90 minutes when the games open up against tiring defences.\n\nOPTION THREE: Play Rice as the only holding midfielder\n\nWhen England were at their best on Sunday, Rice was effectively this already as the Serbs were pinned back and Alexander-Arnold was too advanced to be described as a second No 6. Nevertheless, there are many who will argue that if Southgate likes this set-up so much it is more logical to select an out-and-out midfielder rather than someone learning on the job, especially at international level.\n\nIf Rice is the only holding midfielder, Bellingham and Foden can continue to play as interchanging No 10s and a space is freed for another attacker, with either Anthony Gordon on the left, or one of the Chelsea offensive midfield duo of Cole Palmer or Conor Gallagher. Picking Gordon ahead of Alexander-Arnold is illogical because the Newcastle man would be beneficiary of the playmaker's service. If one of Chelsea players replaces Alexander-Arnold, Kane will still need to play further up the pitch to stop getting in the way of the creative midfielders.\n\nAlso, any clamour for Palmer and Gallagher to be picked over Alexander-Arnold is contradictory since the main concerns about the Liverpool man focus on his defensive capacities. Leaving sole responsibility to Rice to protect the back four will make England more vulnerable against the strongest nations. So with this option, the midfield looks more imbalanced.\n\nOPTION FOUR: Play Kane as out-and-out No 9\n\nAs Jamie Carragher pointed out in his post-Serbia Telegraph column, the main tactical concern for England on Sunday night was not the balance of the midfield, but how it impacted on Harry Kane.

The Three Lions secured a narrow win in the Group C game, with Real Madrid star Jude Bellingham scoring the only goal with a stunning header early in the first half.\n\nFoden, who operated from the left flank, failed to showcase his A-game in Gelsenkirchen. England boss Gareth Southgate, however, seems not quite worried about Foden's form. The manager feels the Manchester City star made a great impact with his off-the-ball movements despite not finding his place in the scoresheet.\n\nWith England gearing up for their next EURO assignment against Denmark, Southgate will likely go with the same playing eleven that featured in the previous match. After the opening game, there were widespread speculations about if Foden would be able to keep his place in the team. Southgate has now rubbished those claims, praising the 24-year-old midfielder for his performance against Serbia.\n\n\"I thought Phil did an incredible job for the team on Sunday. You know, sometimes the bits with the ball are obvious and they catch the eye, but the amount of ground he covered, the angles of pressing, the filling in for people who were further forward. I thought without Phil's contribution without the ball - and I know that's not the sexy bit and everybody wants to see him on the ball - I don't think we win the game,\" Southgate explained in a press conference, as quoted by Sky Sports.\n\nThe England manager further shed light on Foden's role in the midfield, saying, \"Towards the end of the game he retained the ball for us in really crucial moments. He had a half chance in the first couple of minutes where a slightly better touch and a shot away on goal we could be talking about something very different. He linked the game well in that opening period with the others.

It was a nervy win for Gareth Southgate's side as they never appeared to dominate the game.\n\nDespite the criticism aimed towards Foden in the past week, the Man City midfielder played a key role in Pep Guardiola's side winning the title. He looks a lot more comfortable when playing in City's system which is the case for the vast majority of their players.\n\nFerdinand believes Foden needs to \"dominate\" his teammates more and demand the ball if he's to shine at the Euros this summer.\n\nSpeaking on his FIVE podcast, Ferdinand said: \"Me, Micah [Richards] and Cesc [Fabregas] done that game [for BBC] the other day and Micah was saying how he felt sorry for Phil and about how [Gareth] Southgate's not getting the best out of him.\n\n\"And then, to be fair, Cesc just put him away, just said, 'listen, no, no, no, it's down to Foden'.

He did not get as involved in the game as many had hoped, spending the entire night on the fringes.

Jude Bellingham dominated the match, strutting his stuff. It was a relief to see him given the freedom to roam from the number 10 position, often dropping back into deeper areas to collect the ball and create.\n\nThere were a few important tackles and blocks from the Real Madrid man, who looks far more effective with the picture ahead of him. His strength and power make him a perfect box-to-box, do-it-all midfielder, not someone who should be confined to the top-end of the pitch.\n\nThe way Bellingham dominated the centre of the pitch was reminiscent of Steven Gerrard. The perfect timing of his late run into the box was Frank Lampard-esque. The sheer desire to meet Bukayo Saka's cross outweighed the defender and produced the decisive moment.\n\nThe Arsenal winger was the main competition for Bellingham's player-of-the-match award on first-half evidence. With his team-mate roaming and Phil Foden drifting, Saka gave them the width needed and constantly beat his full-back.\n\nI don't know what happened in the second half but England were a different team. Southgate alluded to fitness issues perhaps tempting them to defend deeper. Possibly?\n\nThe way they surrendered the ascendency was worrying, as was the England boss' lack of reaction from the bench. I am not a Southgate basher by any means but criticism of his in-game management can't be defended, at times.\n\nIt was clear on the hour-mark that England had run out of steam, needed more legs in the middle and a better outlet out wide to stretch Serbia.\n\nConnor Gallagher came 10 minutes too late, as did Jarrod Bowen. Anthony Gordon should've been introduced too given how ineffective Foden became and how lop-sided their attack was.\n\nThe biggest concern for me in the group stages is England's left side. How do they get a better balance? Well, hopefully, Luke Shaw will be fit soon and that will certainly help, but it's worrying to rely on a half-cooked defender who hasn't played since February.\n\nFor the good of the team, Southgate either needs to compromise or drop one of his star attackers. On the evidence of the first half, I see no reason why Declan Rice, who was excellent, Bellingham and Foden can't play together. Particularly, against weaker opposition.\n\nIf Southgate is insistent that isn't for him then someone has to be sacrificed for the balance of the team. England have always looked at their best with runners beyond Harry Kane, think Raheem Sterling and Marcus Rashford at their best.\n\nThe captain was isolated and ineffectual, particularly second half, through little fault of his own. England would be a far better team, in my opinion, with Saka and Gordon in the team, on either flank.\n\nFoden has not produced the moments of magic we've seen regularly for Manchester City. Saka and Bellingham's contributions in an England shirt far outweigh his, unfortunately.\n\nIt would be a crying shame if someone as talented as Foden can't get in the England team. But it would be even worse to jeopardise the effectiveness of the team just to shoe-horn him in.\n\nEngland's defence stood up to the challenge, which was a big positive. Bellingham shrugged off any worries of burn-out or fatigue. But the same nagging doubts weren't eased on matchday one.\n\nPhil Foden had an off night for England - but was it the end of the world? (Image: PA)\n\nEngland View - Marc Iles:\n\nNothing can be 'okay' anymore, as England found out on Sunday night.\n\nIn the lawless land of social media, you are either the greatest thing since sliced bread or the worst manager, player or team in the world, there is no middle ground.\n\nYou don't have to search very far to know what I mean. Phil Foden put out a tweet not long after the final whistle of a 1-0 win against Serbia, met largely by a barrage of abuse from nameless morons who should have been in bed.\n\nHe didn't play particularly well and there is definitely a wider debate to be had about his starting position in his England team, and whether he can have the same impact out wide without the guiding hand of a Bernardo Silva or a Kevin De Bruyne around him.\n\nBut judging by some of the comments you'd think his inclusion in the team was somehow controversial, and that he wasn't a generational talent comparable with anyone in this tournament.\n\nHas social media reduced concentration and intellect levels to the point where we can't consider one performance on its merits, and must polarise every single opinion lest we miss out on a few likes?\n\nFoden's performance was a five out of 10, I'd argue the same could be said about Kieran Trippier who played within himself on the left. That literally nothing was going down that side of the pitch for England reinforces those lopsided arguments that have been thrown at England, especially without Luke Shaw.\n\nI can understand disappointment that the team became unnecessarily submissive in the second half and there were some poor choices in possession all over the pitch which meant they could not build attacks in the same way they did over the first half an hour.\n\nIt might just mean, however, that England are a good team finding their form, not a great one taking backward steps. And that's OK, it might still be enough to win them the tournament.\n\nJude Bellingham celebrates at the end of the game, in front of those omnipotent Lidl ads (Image: PA)\n\nTV View - Marc Iles:\n\nNearly 15 million people tuned into England v Serbia at its peak - which is four million more than any other UK programme during 2024.\n\nAmazing numbers in this digital world and good ammunition for whoever sells the adverts for these major tournaments.\n\nI don't claim to have a firm grip on global branding but there are some weird company names claiming centre stage in Germany.\n\nI've already expressed my dislike for ITV's coverage giving blanket sponsorship to 'Visit Qatar' though I appreciate it is probably a UEFA tie-in. I am becoming increasingly frustrated at the BBC lobbing in trailers for iPlayer, though, regardless of how well Mark Pougatch builds-up the new season of the Great British Sewing Bee.\n\nThe corporate sponsors have provided some head-scratching moments. The perimeter of the pitch often flashes up someone boasting to be the \"No1 Nev Maker\" - a title that can surely only be bestowed on Gary Neville's grandad.\n\nDavid Beckham pops up in random adverts for Alipay, giving little clue what they actually do, and something called Hisense proudly and ambiguously claims to be ranked \"Number Two Globally\". Well done them.\n\nLidl's name is everywhere, as is a company called Atos, which according to Google specialises in hi-tech transactional services, unified communications, cloud, big data and cybersecurity services. Nope, me neither.\n\nThrow in the fact you can't turn on a laptop up to three hours before an England game without Paddy Power finding some way to offer you a novel way to fritter your money away, and it all leaves you feeling a bit icky.\n\nNot quite as bad, however, as the advert for Hellman's mayonnaise, clearly filmed well in advance of the Euros, which has among its stars Jack Grealish and Marcus Rashford.

I've watched a lot of him at Manchester City and I truly believe that he was restricted in his role against Serbia.\n\n\"He wasn't doing what he does for City, starting on the left and popping up in the centre, rotating his position. It seemed like he was made to stay wide on the left-hand side.\n\n\"When you see him at his best, he picks up the ball and can beat as many players as he wants. He plays with freedom at City, but he can't seem to find that with England.\"\n\nAllardyce went on to explain that he would change the setup of England's midfield if he was still in charge of the Three Lions.\n\nHinting that he would take Trent Alexander-Arnold out of the midfield three and play Foden and Bellingham alongside Declan Rice instead.\n\nHe added: \"He's better off in a central role than on the left. He can play on the left but what he's done from midfield for City this season has been outstanding, so that's where I'd like to see him.\n\n\"I'd have Declan Rice as the only sitting midfielder because that's my favourite system.\n\n\"Foden and Bellingham could share the load, when one goes forward the other sits back. If you do it right, you don't get exposed.\"\n\nAllardyce had his time in the hot-seat when he took over as England boss in 2016.\n\nBut the former West Ham gaffer only took charge of ONE GAME after he was sacked for following controversy surrounding an undercover sting.\n\nAllardyce was the England manager for just 67 days, but remains the only Three Lions boss to have a 100 per cent win record - thanks to a 1-0 win over Slovakia in his only game in charge.\n\nCurrent manager Southgate will have tactical decision to make ahead of England's Group C clash with Denmark tomorrow with concerns over Foden's contribution.\n\nOne thing that is clear is that the left-back playing behind the left-wing position, that Foden occupied last time out, won't be Luke Shaw.\n\nSouthgate revealed in his press conference that the Man Utd defender is still injured and will miss the game.", "source": {"uri": "thesun.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Irish Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joshua_hall@thesun.ie", "name": "Joshua Hall", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Allardyce", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sam Allardyce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Foden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Phil Foden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jude_Bellingham", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jude Bellingham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declan_Rice", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Declan Rice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Lions", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Three Lions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trent_Alexander-Arnold", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trent Alexander-Arnold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Shaw", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luke Shaw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Denmark national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Ham_United_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "West Ham United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovakia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Slovakia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Slovakia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Drama", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Drama", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Left-Handed_Products", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Left-Handed Products", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/Europe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/Europe", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill_or_Bust", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill or Bust", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.thesun.ie/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/06/crop-28608145.jpg?strip=all&quality=100&w=1920&h=1080&crop=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9657992", "eventUri": "eng-9657992", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 141, "relevance": 1}

However, Denmark will offer a more skill-based challenge than the physical Serbs so Gareth Southgate needs to make a tactical change.\n\nOn Sunday, everything went down the right hand side and Serbia nullified that in the second half knowing that we offered nothing on the left, so that needs to be rectified.\n\nIt pains me to say it, but if we do make a change, maybe Anthony Gordon should play in front of Kieran Trippier with Trent Alexander-Arnold dropping to the bench. That would mean a midfield four of Bukayo Saka, Declan Rice, Jude Bellingham and Gordon, with Phil Foden being allowed more of the freedom he enjoys with Manchester City.\n\nHopefully Harry Kane will be able to make more of an impact on this match but if he doesn't, we have Eberechi Eze on the bench and he could prove to be the surprise package of the tournament if he's given the chance.\n\nThe Danes will give us a good game but I'd go for a 2-1 win for us.\n\nI think the biggest issue is the balance of the team, particularly on the left hand side.\n\nAs a right-footed left back, Kieran Trippier doesn't offer width and Phil Foden isn't a natural left winger, so the vast majority of our attacks against Serbia were coming down the right hand side.\n\nI think Anthony Gordon should start on the left wing.\n\nThat could be in place of Trent Alexander-Arnold, with Jude Bellingham pushing slightly deeper and allowing Foden to play in the number ten position.\n\nAlternatively, he could replace Foden, which would certainly raise some eyebrows.\n\nThe big question concerns Luke Shaw's fitness, as he's another player who would give us some width. If he starts the game and lasts for sixty minutes to regain some match fitness, I think that would be a good move, but getting him back fit is crucial.\n\nIt'll be an interesting team selection on Thursday.\n\nI'd agree with Derek in the main.\n\nWe need to learn from these group games whilst also ensuring we progress, and you could say that if we repeated the first half on Sunday and won 2-0 or 3-0, everyone would be really up for this.\n\nHowever, the second half against Serbia killed off a bit of that potential optimism, but it was a clean sheet and a win so we take it and move on.\n\nAlthough Harry Kane was unlucky not to score from a header after a wonder save from the Serbia goalkeeper, he was rarely involved.\n\nWe can and should get more from such a prolific frontman, and if it isn't working out in the group games- either due to his own efforts or because of how we're feeding him- maybe we should provide some game time for others.\n\nThese games need to be used to help us work out our best team and we probably only need one more point to get through, so maybe vary it in midfield and attack and see what works, if we get a chance to do so.\n\nIn midfield, we'll need to be on point to manage the increased technical ability of the Danes.\n\nIf we give them possession like we gave it to Serbia in the second period, they're more likely to open us up, so possession needs to be controlled better than it was after the break on Sunday.\n\nIn general, it would be to see us play like we can, so can we not focus on our abilities rather than focus on what they can do?\n\nWe have a team of superstars, so why not play the best way for us and make them worry about us, rather than the other way round?\n\nPhil Foden needs to get more central, and I'd love to see more of Kobbie Mainoo and Eberechi Eze, so I say 'let's set up to play our best football, get another win or draw and then experiment a bit more with any remaining time we have at this stage'.\n\nYou win nothing by being perfect right now, but if we can build our performances and keep winning even when it's a bit ugly, who knows where we may get to?", "source": {"uri":

[Bukayo] Saka on the right in the first half was unplayable, he tied the two left-sided players inside out, in the second half he didn't really have a kick because they came out and did much better.\n\n\"I would play Bellingham alongside Rice and Foden as the 10, which is where he wants to play. I don't think that would be a problem at all, you're playing Bellingham with Rice so you free up that left side for someone who can run in behind, whether that would be Eze or Gordon. That's what I would have done and that's what I'd do against Denmark.\"", "source": {"uri": "dazn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "DAZN"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alexander_netherton@dazn.com", "name": "Alexander Netherton", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Shearer", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alan Shearer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trent_Alexander-Arnold", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Trent Alexander-Arnold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Foden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Phil Foden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Gordon_(footballer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Gordon (footballer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declan_Rice", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Declan Rice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kieran_Trippier", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kieran Trippier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jude_Bellingham", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jude Bellingham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eberechi_Eze", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eberechi Eze"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bukayo_Saka", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bukayo Saka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Denmark national football team"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Drama", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Drama", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Left-Handed_Products", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Left-Handed Products", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Jorkyball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Jorkyball", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill_or_Bust", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill or Bust", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://images.daznservices.com/di/library/DAZN_News/53/b8/alexander-arnold-20210602-getty-ftr_qvv9qvcn7zjh1n6ixlgfyxv88.jpg?t=-689005639", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9657992", "eventUri": "eng-9657992", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 138, "relevance": 1}

Jude Bellingham dominated the match, strutting his stuff. It was a relief to see him given the freedom to roam from the number 10 position, often dropping back into deeper areas to collect the ball and create.\n\nThere were a few important tackles and blocks from the Real Madrid man, who looks far more effective with the picture ahead of him. His strength and power make him a perfect box-to-box, do-it-all midfielder, not someone who should be confined to the top-end of the pitch.\n\nThe way Bellingham dominated the centre of the pitch was reminiscent of Steven Gerrard. The perfect timing of his late run into the box was Frank Lampard-esque. The sheer desire to meet Bukayo Saka's cross outweighed the defender and produced the decisive moment.\n\nThe Arsenal winger was the main competition for Bellingham's player-of-the-match award on first-half evidence. With his team-mate roaming and Phil Foden drifting, Saka gave them the width needed and constantly beat his full-back.\n\nI don't know what happened in the second half but England were a different team. Southgate alluded to fitness issues perhaps tempting them to defend deeper. Possibly?\n\nThe way they surrendered the ascendency was worrying, as was the England boss' lack of reaction from the bench. I am not a Southgate basher by any means but criticism of his in-game management can't be defended, at times.\n\nIt was clear on the hour-mark that England had run out of steam, needed more legs in the middle and a better outlet out wide to stretch Serbia.\n\nConnor Gallagher came 10 minutes too late, as did Jarrod Bowen. Anthony Gordon should've been introduced too given how ineffective Foden became and how lop-sided their attack was.\n\nThe biggest concern for me in the group stages is England's left side. How do they get a better balance? Well, hopefully, Luke Shaw will be fit soon and that will certainly help, but it's worrying to rely on a half-cooked defender who hasn't played since February.\n\nFor the good of the team, Southgate either needs to compromise or drop one of his star attackers. On the evidence of the first half, I see no reason why Declan Rice, who was excellent, Bellingham and Foden can't play together. Particularly, against weaker opposition.\n\nIf Southgate is insistent that isn't for him then someone has to be sacrificed for the balance of the team. England have always looked at their best with runners beyond Harry Kane, think Raheem Sterling and Marcus Rashford at their best.\n\nThe captain was isolated and ineffectual, particularly second half, through little fault of his own. England would be a far better team, in my opinion, with Saka and Gordon in the team, on either flank.\n\nFoden has not produced the moments of magic we've seen regularly for Manchester City. Saka and Bellingham's contributions in an England shirt far outweigh his, unfortunately.\n\nIt would be a crying shame if someone as talented as Foden can't get in the England team. But it would be even worse to jeopardise the effectiveness of the team just to shoe-horn him in.\n\nEngland's defence stood up to the challenge, which was a big positive. Bellingham shrugged off any worries of burn-out or fatigue. But the same nagging doubts weren't eased on matchday one.\n\nNothing can be 'okay' anymore, as England found out on Sunday night.\n\nIn the lawless land of social media, you are either the greatest thing since sliced bread or the worst manager, player or team in the world, there is no middle ground.\n\nYou don't have to search very far to know what I mean. Phil Foden put out a tweet not long after the final whistle of a 1-0 win against Serbia, met largely by a barrage of abuse from nameless morons who should have been in bed.\n\nHe didn't play particularly well and there is definitely a wider debate to be had about his starting position in his England team, and whether he can have the same impact out wide without the guiding hand of a Bernardo Silva or a Kevin De Bruyne around him.\n\nBut judging by some of the comments you'd think his inclusion in the team was somehow controversial, and that he wasn't a generational talent comparable with anyone in this tournament.\n\nHas social media reduced concentration and intellect levels to the point where we can't consider one performance on its merits, and must polarise every single opinion lest we miss out on a few likes?\n\nFoden's performance was a five out of 10, I'd argue the same could be said about Kieran Trippier who played within himself on the left. That literally nothing was going down that side of the pitch for England reinforces those lopsided arguments that have been thrown at England, especially without Luke Shaw.\n\nI can understand the disappointment that the team became unnecessarily submissive in the second half and there were some poor choices in possession all over the pitch which meant they could not build attacks in the same way they did over the first half an hour.\n\nIt might just mean, however, that England are a good team finding their form, not a great one taking backward steps. And that's OK, it might still be enough to win them the tournament.\n\nNearly 15 million people tuned into England v Serbia at its peak - which is four million more than any other UK programme during 2024.\n\nAmazing numbers in this digital world and good ammunition for whoever sells the adverts for these major tournaments.\n\nI don't claim to have a firm grip on global branding but there are some weird company names claiming centre stage in Germany.\n\nI've already expressed my dislike for ITV's coverage giving blanket sponsorship to 'Visit Qatar' though I appreciate it is probably a UEFA tie-in. I am becoming increasingly frustrated at the BBC lobbing in trailers for iPlayer, though, regardless of how well Mark Pougatch builds up the new season of the Great British Sewing Bee.\n\nThe corporate sponsors have provided some head-scratching moments. The perimeter of the pitch often flashes up someone boasting to be the \"No1 Nev Maker\" - a title that can surely only be bestowed on Gary Neville's grandad.\n\nDavid Beckham pops up in random adverts for Alipay, giving little clue what they actually do, and something called Hisense proudly and ambiguously claims to be ranked \"Number Two Globally\". Well done to them.\n\nLidl's name is everywhere, as is a company called Atos, which according to Google specialises in hi-tech transactional services, unified communications, cloud, big data and cybersecurity services. Nope, me neither.\n\nThrow in the fact you can't turn on a laptop up to three hours before an England game without Paddy Power finding some way to offer you a novel way to fritter your money away, and it all leaves you feeling a bit icky.\n\nNot quite as bad, however, as the advert for Hellman's mayonnaise, clearly filmed well in advance of the Euros, which has among its stars Jack Grealish and Marcus Rashford.

And who is the subject of the biggest Clamour to come in? We rank the top five...\n\n5) Adam Wharton\n\n'With all the caveats of - I'm not watching training, I've never seen him play a full 90, he plays higher up the pitch than I thought and I'VE NEVER PLAYED THE GAME, I'd like Adam Wharton in,' tweeted Max Rushden in that terrifically clever manner that protects him against accusations that his instincts are unfounded while still voicing those largely unfounded instincts.\n\nWharton would be higher up this list if he had played more than 16 Premier League games and more than 28 minutes of international football, but there is still a sizeable Clamour building for his inclusion at the expense of Trent Alexander-Arnold, who looks uncomfortable in midfield because he is not a midfielder. Which seems important.\n\nThe truth? There is no perfect solution to that midfield problem. And in the absence of a perfect solution, Gareth Southgate has opted for the best footballer - but not the best midfielder - available.\n\n4) Kobbie Mainoo\n\nA year younger than Wharton but with a whole 25 Premier League games (and one barnstorming FA Cup final display) under his belt, which is probably why he eventually came on for Jude Bellingham in the 'seeing it out' role. Rio Ferdinand has said he should have come on earlier, presumably instead of the energetic but absolutely not composed Conor Gallagher.\n\nThere will always be a greater Clamour for players from well-supported clubs and it does feel rather odd that England started a major tournament without a Manchester United player. He does have a significant advantage over Alexander-Arnold in that he is actually a midfielder. Which seems important.\n\nOh and he was excellent alongside Declan Rice v Belgium in March, when we wrote: 'Literally impossible to watch his interplay with Jude Bellingham and not get very giddy indeed.'\n\nMORE ON SERBIA v ENGLAND FROM F365:\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Jude Bellingham's England (just) beat Serbia: 16 Conclusions on an unnecessarily nervy opener\n\n\ud83d\udc49 England player ratings v Serbia: Bellingham runs the show, Kane quiet, Saka shows positive signs\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Harry Kane was 'static and lumbering' as he faces calls to be dropped by England\n\n3) Eberechi Eze\n\n\"I'm going to say and I'm going to make this statement as early as possible. We talked about early substitutions leading into the game, I tell you what I'd do, I'd bring Eze on now to attack instead of Foden. You ask for my opinion and I'll give you my solution after 29 minutes!\"\n\nStuart Pearce went very, very early but he was soon joined by many others who wanted the ineffective Phil Foden replaced by a player who had made such an impact on the left side against Bosnia and Herzegovina in a Euro 2024 warm-up match that he immediately cemented a place on the plane.\n\nThere was such a stark contrast between the impact of Bukayo Saka on the right and Foden on the left that it screams classic Clamour this week; that problematic left side has rich history in this particular narrative as Jack Grealish and James Maddison have both been regular beneficiaries. Eze does not quite have those 'We need a maverick!' vibes, which is why he is third and no higher on this list.\n\n2) Cole Palmer\n\nIt says something about the strength of England's other striker options that the main beneficiary of Kane largely being nothing more than a bystander against Serbia is Cole Palmer rather than Ollie Watkins or Ivan Toney.\n\nPalmer finished the season with more combined Premier League goals and assists than any other player so there was always going to be some consternation about him not even getting on the pitch v Serbia. He cannot replace Saka (and Jarrod Bowen's cameo put paid to any talk of him being the best back-up alternative there), has no history of playing on the left and Jude Bellingham is untouchable, so striker it is.\n\nFerdinand has called for \"someone like Cole Palmer who has got that bit of swagger and arrogance to say give me that ball\". He will not be the last.\n\n1) Anthony Gordon\n\nTrending on Monday morning because England lacked any kind of penetration down the left, and Gordon and his direct running is absolutely the antidote to Foden and the Pep-like inside-left interplay that nobody wants to see from England players (unless it goes well).\n\nProbably England's best left-sided winger but the question is whether Gareth Southgate wants a winger out there or just wants another of England's best footballers on the pitch. Gordon is about to become a cause celebre for all those who want Trent Alexander-Arnold dropped and Foden brought central alongside Jude Bellingham. They're all going to think they're the first to come up with that solution, because nobody joining a Clamour believes they are in a Clamour.", "source": {"uri": "football365.com", "dataType": "news",

However, he was unable to have the same influence on the game as he does for City, with Bellingham ultimately scoring the winner as England beat Serbia 1-0.\n\nAnd former Spain star Cesc Fabregas, who won the Euros twice in 2008 and 2012, suggested after the game that Foden needs \"impose himself\" on the game more like Bellingham did. Ferdinand agrees with Fabregas' assessment, claiming Foden is in a similar situation to Veron who was a \"ridiculous player\" but struggled at United because Roy Keane was \"much more dominant\".\n\nSpeaking on his FIVE podcast,\" Ferdinand said: \"Me, Micah [Richards] and Cesc done that game [for BBC ] the other day and Micah was saying how he felt sorry for Phil that and about how Southgate's not getting the best out of him.\n\n\"And then to be fair Cesc just put him away, just said, 'listen, no, no, no, it's down to Foden'. Foden's got to go out there and you're talking about body language, being demanding and authoritative with the way that you want the ball.\n\n\"Jude has got that in spades and I think if we're going to see the best out of Phil Foden, and I agree with Cesc, he's got to really go out there and try and dominate the pitch and dominate some of his teammates to give him the ball and be the first one to shout.\n\n\"But I've seen this before at Man United. We had Roy Keane who demanded the ball in the middle of the pitch. We signed a superstar in Juan Sebastian Veron. Ridiculous player, the streets will never forget this guy, that bandage under the knee...\n\n\"He was a playmaker that wanted to get the ball off all of the players and that's how he got his rhythm and play. But Roy Keane dominated because he was more animated, the characteristics that he had came out and was much more dominant.\n\n\"He was there before and dominated that area. And Sebastian Veron folded really and had to be sold and didn't really become a success at Man United. But he was a fantastically talented player and I hope Phil doesn't fall like that.\"\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

In fact, he's even gone as far as getting the number tattooed onto his neck.\n\nAs an attacking midfielder would traditionally wear the legendary 10 jersey and you'd think that Foden would want to add his name to the long list of stars who've donned the famous shirt number.\n\nHowever Foden appears to have no intention of parting with his 47 shirt, even turning down an offer from departing player Sergio Ag\u00fcero when he left the club in 2021.\n\n\"I did think about it,\" the footballer said of Ag\u00fcero's offer in 2022. \"The ten shirt is such a big number in the club, but I just have a thing with 47.\n\n\"I'd like to create my own legacy and keep that number.\"\n\nThe number eventually went to his England teammate Jack Grealish.\n\nSo why is Foden so attached to the number? Turns out there's a very heartwarming reason.\n\nThe 47 jersey was a personal significance to the footballer, as 47 is the age that his granddad Ronnie passed away - meaning the number is a way for Foden to remember his late grandfather.\n\nIt's also been reported that Ronnie was an avid Manchester City fan, meaning that his grandson's decision to honour him at the club has an even more personal significance.\n\n\"Being a young player you don't have many options when it comes to what you can have on your shirt,\" Foden said in an interview with the Daily Mail.\n\n\"I had a few numbers sent to me and none of them really meant anything to me apart from that one, the 47.\"\n\nFoden then revealed that he'd consulted his dad other number, adding: \"I asked my dad if he would be happy if I wore that number. He said it would be amazing so I took the shirt number and I have loved it ever since.\n\n\"I have it tattooed on me now and it's a shirt I don't ever see changing. It's nice to make your own legacy. It's a strange number nobody else will go for so hopefully in years to come when I have finished, 47 at City will be remembered for Phil Foden.\"", "source": {"uri": "ladbible.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "LADbible"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Foden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Phil Foden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Lions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Three Lions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergio_Ag\u00fcero", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sergio Ag\u00fcero"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pep_Guardiola", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pep Guardiola"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Grealish", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jack Grealish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Clothing/Casual", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Clothing/Casual", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Math/Number_Theory", "label": "dmoz/Science/Math/Number Theory", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Clothing/Custom", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Clothing/Custom", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Lotteries", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Lotteries", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Math/Recreations", "label": "dmoz/Science/Math/Recreations", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://images.ladbible.com/resize?type=webp&quality=70&width=1200&fit=contain&gravity=auto&url=https://images.ladbiblegroup.com/v3/assets/bltcd74acc1d0a99f3a/blt6d64623d5a9ca1b3/667044f670fcd335d26bddf8/foden-number.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9657992", "eventUri": "eng-9657992", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 136, "relevance": 1}

We know what a special player Foden can be, but Jude is special too, those are the two players that can produce in big games.\n\n\"Jude demands the ball and he just wants to get things going. Phil's got to go 'Okay, Jude's doing that bit now, so can I find the positions I have been finding all season for Manchester City?'\n\n\"Find that space off the back line, just those four or five yards where he can get his first touches that will cement that panic in the defenders.\"\n\nWatch and listen to Euro Thrash onYouTube, Apple Podcasts and Spotify with regular new episodes throughout Euro 2024\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

Those are the things I'd be looking at.\n\n\"The two talking points are who plays alongside Rice and who plays on that left side. Saka on the right in the first half was unplayable, he tied the two left sided players inside out, in the second half he didn't really have a kick because they came out and did much better.\n\n\"I would play Bellingham alongside Rice and Foden as the 10, which is where he wants to play. I don't think that would be a problem at all, you're playing Bellingham with Rice so you free up that left side for someone who can run in behind, whether that would be Eze or Gordon. That's what I would have done and that's what I'd do against Denmark.\"\n\nWhat team should England name vs Denmark? Share your thoughts in the comments below\n\nWhile Shearer has demanded some slight tweaks to the England line-up, he does not believe that Southgate will ring the changes against Denmark. He added: \"There's no risk in changing things, you've won the game, you look at the positives and you ask why things happened, how things happened, you look at the negatives and look at how you can improve.\n\n\"We've got a squad of 26 players, of which the vast majority would have no problem with going in the starting line up, it's great to have options. The options he has got, one on the left side and two in the middle of the park are phenomenal. It's not dangerous to change it up, it's dangerous to make six or seven changes which he won't, but he may make one or two.\"\n\nFollowing their clash with Denmark, England then round off their group stage against Slovenia. The two sides clash in Cologne next Tuesday.\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

Why does Germany feel like a country unready to host Euro 2024?\n\nPhil Foden's relatively lack-lustre performance on Sunday against Serbia has left Mail Sport's football experts pondering Gareth Southgate's latest quandary: What to do with the Man City star?\n\nFoden is likely the most technically gifted player that England can call upon, and has had an unbelievable campaign with Man City once more, but he is still yet to bring his best to the national team.\n\nHe appeared ineffectual and frustrated in Gelsenkirchen, and with a huge depth of talent waiting quite literally in the wings, talk has turned to Foden's place in the side - should he be dropped? Should he start at No 10?\n\nAfter Jack Gaughan and Craig Hope discussed where Foden should play - the former claiming it would be 'sacrilege' to drop him, while the latter suggests moving him to No 10 and bringing in Anthony Gordon - Ian Ladyman describes leaving the forward out as 'a kneejerk reaction to end all kneejerk reactions'.\n\nMike Keegan then contends that the XI that faced Serbia was not England's best, and both he and Ladyman agree that Cole Palmer would come in for Trent Alexander-Arnold, with Bellingham dropping in alongside Declan Rice and Foden playing as a No 10.\n\nKeegan also predicts Foden will be named Player of the Tournament, before the discussion turns to whether Bellingham would be as effective alongside Rice, or whether his natural propensity to roam around the field could give England more problems.\n\nListen to It's All Kicking Off! on Spotify or Apple Podcasts.

So why such a negative reaction?\n\nOne positive, at least in my mind, is that all of the above can improve as time goes on in this competition. If you continue to carve out results while the progress is made, then there really shouldn't be any room for complaint.\n\nI want to see Phil Foden back to his best, I want to see England get him into the same sort of areas that Manchester City do, and with Denmark needing a positive result after their draw against Slovenia there is every reason to believe he will get some more space and freedom.\n\nI wanted to see Foden playing number 10, and after the season he had at club level for Southgate to say 'go and win the Euros for us'. You could say the same thing to Jude Bellingham from any of the midfield positions and he would still have a big impact.\n\nBut Foden can't get too down about it, and neither should we. He has ample class to find his way into tonight's game, provided he gets the right kind of support, and you only have to look back in history to see that central players can still affect major tournaments from wide positions - a la Mesut Ozil for Germany (2014), Andres Iniesta for Spain (2010) or Simone Perotta for Italy in 2006.\n\nCesc Fabregas made a good point the other night, talking about the mentality of players like Xavi or Iniesta, and how they wanted to take responsibility of the ball in the most pressured situations at top tournaments.\n\nWe talk about the pressure of the English press and supporters but it is no different in Spain, it is down to the individual.\n\nThe 'problematic left' was an English clich\u00e9 when I was growing up. There always seemed to be some furore about John Barnes not replicating his Liverpool form for his country - although knowing what disgusting abuse he took in some places I can understand why he might have had issues.\n\nThereafter we had a chain of underperforming successors that carried on right the way through the 'Golden Generation' until the game evolved tactically, and it became less of a stigma playing a right-footed player on the left.\n\nNobody bats an eyelid at Bukayo Saka playing out on the right. He was one of England's chief threats on Sunday night against Serbia in the first half before tiring, after which you have to give Jarrod Bowen some credit for the energy he showed as a replacement.\n\nIf Foden isn't working against Denmark then England could turn to Anthony Gordon for more direct running, Eberechi Eze for a bit of skill, or Cole Palmer for a bit more craft, but I'd like to see Southgate make these changes a little earlier.\n\nOverall, I am confident. If England can book their place in the next round and leave us with fewer question marks between here and the final game, then that is progress.\n\nIT must be a strange feeling for Harry Kane, not having the weight of 11 men, a whole club, or a nation on his shoulders.\n\nThe England captain has certainly carried his fair share of weight in the last six or seven years, looked upon for goals, for inspiration, for the right words after every victory and defeat.\n\nBut if there is something to be taken from the opening win against Serbia it is that England do have other talismans these days, it isn't all on Kane to produce a moment of magic.\n\nJude Bellingham is the obvious example. Much has been discussed about Phil Foden - but he is more than capable of being that man too - and Bukayo Saka lit the touchpaper so many times for Arsenal last season, but his star-power is overlooked a little for his country at times.\n\nKane touched the ball twice in the first half on Sunday evening, and that was during England's best spell. He had more involvement in the second half and was unlucky to have one header tipped on to the crossbar but by his sky-high standards it was a mediocre display.\n\nHe is, however, a player on whom you would bet your mortgage if it really mattered. His mentality is second to none and someone who commands respect from every single nation in this tournament.\n\nOpposing teams make plans to stop Harry Kane and if they are successful that might have been a serious problem. Nowadays, though, it feels like the more attention they pay to the number nine, the more space it offers to others.\n\nEngland are learning to share the spotlight, maybe it is their best way to get to where they want to be?\n\nI CAN remember trying to revise for my A Levels during Euro 96, a pointless task which is why I can now tell you more about Davor Suker, Karol Poborsky or Hristo Stoichkov than I can about fluvial dynamics or Schema Theory.\n\nTrying to study while you are also starring for your country? Well, that's just showing off.\n\nBarcelona's Lamine Yamal is managing to do just that for Spain, juggling studies with becoming the youngest-ever player at the Euros aged 16 and 338 days. And if he carries on the way he is going, that 17th birthday party is going to be a banger.\n\nIt is realistic to expect such a young player to continue playing the way he did against Croatia? Of course not. But it is a wonderful story that shows age is nothing but a number.\n\nTurkey's Arder Guler did the same thing, producing a brilliant goal against Georgia in Dortmund.\n\nA couple of years older but a Real Madrid talent who is no less exciting, he was a major influence in what must be the best game of the competition so far.\n\nThrow in elder statesman Jude Bellingham, 10 days shy of his 21st birthday, Germany's Jamal Musiala and Portugal's winning goal-scorer against the Czechs, Fransisco Conceicao, and this tournament has seen some brilliant performances from its youngest players already.\n\nI can't wait to see if Yamal and Spain can shine again when they take on Italy tonight, a game I fear might be a bit cagier than those we have watched in the opening round as neither will want a defeat on their record.\n\nItaly didn't convince me against Albania, so I think Spain have the edge in quality. But if any country can see out a draw and take it to the last game, it will be the Azzurri.", "source": {"uri": "theboltonnews.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Bolton News"}, "authors":

The Liverpool man could be given another chance to prove his worth from the off, but he faces competition from the likes of Conor Gallagher and Kobbie Mainoo to keep his starting spot.\n\nPhil Foden struggled to make the desired impact on the left wing against Serbia and drifted inside on countless occasions to try and put his stamp on the match. The Manchester City star would prefer to operate in the number 10 role or on the right flank, but midfield sensation Jude Bellingham - the match-winner against Serbia - is expected to continue in an advanced central role, with Bukayo Saka playing on the right.\n\nSouthgate is therefore likely to stick with Foden on the left or opt for a change in personnel and hand either Anthony Gordon, Cole Palmer or Eberechi Eze a start, while captain Harry Kane should lead the line once again, despite enduring a quiet outing against Serbia.\n\nEngland possible starting lineup: Pickford; Walker, Stones,

The Three Lions recorded a 1-0 win in Gelsenkirchen but post-game talk was dominated by Phil Foden's invisible display on the left of Gareth Southgate's attack.\n\nThe Manchester City star picked up the Premier League Player of the Season award after a stellar campaign at the champions but questions have emerged as to whether he is being shoehorned into this England team by being pushed out on the left - and whether Anthony Gordon would be a better option in that role for future games.\n\nThe Newcastle United ace was an unused substitute in England's opening game as he watched Jarrod Bowen, Kobbie Mainoo and Conor Gallagher emerge from the bench in the second-half. There is now a debate brewing over Gordon's role in the side going forward and whether he must replace Foden in upcoming games.\n\nREAD MORE: Newcastle United transfer news LIVE as Serie A goalkeeper and Fikayo Tomori linked\n\nREAD MORE: Sell on clause holds up deal and \u00a315m bargain hunt hots up: Newcastle transfers state of play\n\n\"The lack of pace hurt England the longer the game progressed, so it was surprising Anthony Gordon was not introduced,\" Jamie Carragher said at full-time.\n\nFoden's quality is undoubted but with Jude Bellingham excelling in a central attacking midfield role, Foden has been forced out wide on the opposite flank to Bukayo Saka. Some feel the decision is hurting England's attacking chances.\n\n\"Phillip Foden. Phillip f-ing Foden. I'm not going to swear because he doesn't deserve it. What can you do? I told you it doesn't work. It works for Man City if he plays on the right or the left or the No10 because of the rotation,\" City hero Micah Richards told the Rest Is Football podcast.\n\n\"You know how Pep sets up his sides. There's going to be movement, rotation, De Bruyne, Bernardo Silva, Grealish, Doku, whatever it may be alongside Haaland up front. I just think with England there's not enough of that and he's left, at times, isolated.\"\n\nGordon's club form earned him a spot in Southgate's England plans above trusted stars such as Marcus Rashford and Jack Grealish. That was a big vote of confidence by the national team boss but questions now linger over how much game time he plans to give the in-form ex-Everton star while out in Germany.\n\nEngland play Denmark on Thursday and Slovenia the following Tuesday with Gordon hoping to be involved at a major tournament for the first time.", "source": {"uri": "chroniclelive.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title":

Everyone's interchangeable, there's no doubt about that.\n\n\"Harry might need a break sometimes during the game.

We had Roy Keane who demanded the ball in the middle of the pitch. We signed a superstar in Juan Sebastian Veron.\n\n'Ridiculous player, the streets will never forget this guy, that bandage under the knee... He was a playmaker that wanted to get the ball off all of the players and that's how he got his rhythm and play.\n\n'But Roy Keane dominated because he was more animated, the characteristics that he had came out and was much more dominant.

The City star was named the Premier League Player of the Year last season after his superb showings helped drive City to their fourth successive top-flight crown, though he struggled to transfer that form onto the international stage earlier this week.\n\nFerdinand believes Foden needs to \"dominate\" his teammates more and demand the ball if he's to shine at the European Championship in Germany, comparing his situation to the one Veron found himself in at United.

Mainoo and Gordon IN? Alexander-Arnold OUT? / 90min Football\n\nEngland kickstarted their Euro 2024 campaign with a win over Serbia, but it was a win which left fans with more questions than answers regarding Gareth Southgate's tactical set-up.\n\nSome fans called out Southgate's defensive set-up (particularly in the second half), others weren't happy with the Trent Alexander-Arnold midfield experiment, and others wondered why Phil Foden was so quiet on the left flank.\n\nSo how does Southgate address all of these issues?\n\nAhead of the clash with Denmark, 90min's esteemed team of writers and editors have addressed the situation and chosen their ideal XIs for the game.\n\nPicking Trent Alexander-Arnold for the\u00c2 first\u00c2 game was the right decision in my book, but it's clear there's dysfunctionality in England's midfield. Is there any value in adding more fuel to the fire at a major tournament? Probably not, so take the stress out of the situation and drop Jude Bellingham deeper and move Phil Foden centrally.\n\nThe benefit of doing that allows England to bring in a different kind of option, namely Anthony Gordon. Pace in behind, the ability to stretch a game and do something different down the left, that's what it feels like England need against Denmark. If we're really talking ideals, perhaps Alexander-Arnold would be pinging diagonals at right-back instead of Kyle Walker, but one step at a time.\n\nI'm only going with one change from the Denmark game. At this point, the Trent Alexander-Arnold midfield experiment is one I'm still not sure can succeed at a major international tournament, but England lacked creativity out wide so plugging him into his natural right-back role in place of Kyle Walker would at least mean there's a more forward-thinking option to support Bukayo Saka.\n\nAnthony Gordon's express pace would be more beneficial than Phil Foden wandering around out wide with no support from the defensive Kieran Trippier, so the Manchester City star should start centrally where he can effect the game with Jude Bellingham using his twists and turns in a deeper position while bombing into the box. It's one on one.\n\nI'm sticking with the team I picked for the opener against Serbia, in which\u00c2 I was the only member of the team to select Trent Alexander-Arnold in his actual position.\n\nI will die on this hill. Play him at right-back. Drop Kyle Walker.\n\nThere's not many changes for me, and we have the luxury of playing a team like Denmark next while we sit atop the group so we should be quite safe regardless. But we have\u00c2 to make a change\u00c2 on that left hand side, it just does not work.\n\nI'm bringing in Anthony Gordon to add something different on the left. His pace his outstanding and he deserves his chance. It's time we start using player's club performances to pick our squad, and in using that mentality I'm bringing Newcastle's x-factor star in.\u00c2\n\nOur defence is not perfect, and if Luke Shaw was fit then he'd demand a place. But for now it will do.\u00c2\n\nPhil Foden struggled to get time on the ball on Sunday and I think it makes sense to bring in Eberechi Eze at this point, to see what he can do.\n\nI thought Trent Alexander-Arnold played well against Serbia, but Gallagher proved himself to be a good burst of energy when he was subbed on, and I think he deserves to start as a result.\n\nEngland obviously started well against Serbia, but it descended into a backs to the wall job by the end because of a lack of control in the middle. Trent Alexander-Arnold divided opinion because he was fine on the ball but isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a midfielder when it comes to shape and defending.\n\nEngland are screaming out for Kobbie Mainoo, who has already shown at club level he can handle himself despite his age and lack of experience.

Those are the things I'd be looking at.\n\n\"The two talking points are who plays alongside Rice and who plays on that left side. Saka on the right in the first half was unplayable, he tied the two left-sided players inside out, in the second half he didn't really have a kick because they came out and did much better.\n\n\"I would play Bellingham alongside Rice and Foden as the 10, which is where he wants to play. I don't think that would be a problem at all, you're playing Bellingham with Rice so you free up that left side for someone who can run in behind, whether that would be Eze or Gordon.

At some stage, though, you have to start playing well. So, while England's draw with Denmark is hardly a disaster in terms of their prospects of qualifying for the knockout stage of the Euros given that they sit level at the top of their group with their final opponents, Slovenia, the manner of yet another bitterly-disappointing performance has well and truly set the alarm bells ringing.\n\nThis was England, rinse and repeat. Cautious, disjointed and with a number of potentially key players clearly playing out of position. The problems were all there in the opening game against Serbia, and they were even more apparent as England were fortunate to escape with a draw against the Danes.\n\nLeading through Harry Kane's early opener, England were outplayed for the best part of an hour as Denmark rallied, equalised through a long-range strike from Morten Hjulmand and then passed up a couple of decent second-half chances for a winner.\n\nEngland struck the post through Phil Foden, but Trent Alexander-Arnold was badly out-of-sorts again at the heart of midfield, Jude Bellingham was unable to hit the standards he scaled at the weekend and Gareth Southgate was left with a series of questions to answer, both in terms of his tactics and the general sense of conservatism he has indoctrinated into his squad. Why do England's players underperform so regularly with their national team? Increasingly, it is hard not to conclude that it must have a fair bit to do with the manager.\n\nThe pattern of yesterday's game was remarkably similar to Sunday's opener against Serbia, which is turn was similar to so many matches on Southgate's watch. England scored inside the opening 20 minutes, but then retreated into their shell, inviting their opponents to come onto them. At the weekend, Serbia lacked the attacking firepower to take advantage of England's cautious mindset. Here, Denmark were deservedly back level before the break.\n\nFor the second game in a row, there was no sign of the drop-off coming in the opening 20 minutes or so, with England starting positively as they looked to get onto the front foot.\n\nFoden curled an early effort over after turning neatly in the 18-yard box, and when England's opener arrived in the 18th minute, it came via the most reliable of sources.\n\nKyle Walker was the architect of the strike, bursting beyond a switched-off Victor Kristiansen to reach Bellingham's slide-rule pass. Kristiansen thought he had the situation covered, but the wing-back hadn't factored in Walker's pace, and while the Manchester City defender's cut-back took a couple of deflections, the ball dropped invitingly for Kane.\n\nEngland's skipper was criticised after only touching the ball on two occasions in the whole of the first half against Serbia, but he wasn't going to pass up this kind of opportunity, and sure enough, he calmly slotted home from the edge of the six-yard box.\n\nSo far, so promising. But England are never more vulnerable than when they have taken the lead, and sure enough, over the course of the next quarter-of-an hour, Southgate's players dropped deeper and deeper, Denmark's midfielders began to dominate possession, and an equaliser began to feel inevitable.\n\nIt might have arrived just after the half-hour mark had Marc Guehi not produced a perfectly-timed last-ditch challenge to deflect Jonas Wind's shot over the crossbar, but with the red tidal-wave continuing to sweep towards the England goal, parity was restored 11 minutes before the interval.\n\nIt was a sloppy goal for England to concede, with the move starting from their own throw-in. Kane conceded possession to Kristiansen, he shuffled the ball infield, and from 30 yards, Hjulmand found the bottom left-hand corner via the inside of the post. Jordan Pickford appeared to have been unsighted by the players in front of him, and should perhaps have got closer to the ball, but the quality of Hjulmand's strike was undeniable.\n\nPickford had to deal with another long-range strike before the break, saving from Tottenham's Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg, and while Foden shot straight at Kasper Schmeichel at the other end after slaloming down the middle of the pitch, the game had developed a familiar feel.\n\nEngland's midfield wasn't functioning effectively - for the second game in row, Trent Alexander-Arnold felt like a square peg in a round hole as he repeatedly gave the ball away - but Southgate stuck steadfastly to his guns, refusing to make a half-time alteration.\n\nWhen Alexander-Arnold conceded possession cheaply again at the start of the second half, his time was finally up, although the introduction of Conor Gallagher in his place felt like another somewhat conservative move. Yes, Adam Wharton is untried. But is there any point in taking the Crystal Palace midfielder to Germany if you're not going to use him?\n\nAt least Foden was showing signs of life in a much-improved display from the weekend, and while he might not quite be 'on fire', despite the song that has been ringing around Germany on repeat in the last week, he came within an inch or two of restoring England's lead just before the hour mark.\n\nDrifting infield from his position on the left, which definitely doesn't play to his strengths, Foden drilled a 25-yard effort against the base of the right-hand post. A couple of minutes later, with England starting to get some joy on the break, Bukayo Saka fired over after dribbling his way into the box.\n\nIt was still all very disjointed though, with passes going astray and a sense of panic appearing to set in. Declan Rice blamed the admittedly-dreadful state of the pitch when he put the ball out for a corner midway through the second half, but the incident was indicative of England's general unease.",

That was sh*t...\n\nJordan Pickford\n\nEngland's No.1 had a couple of nervy moments as he flapped at a cross and was beaten to the ball by Christian Eriksen when off his line. But for the goal, there was nothing more that Pickford could do as Morten Hjlulmand's sublime strike from range bounced off the inside of the post and into the net.\n\nThe players in front of Pickford were fortunate that their endless number of lapses in possession did not lead to more clean-cut chances in front of goal, as most of Denmark's on-target attempts went straight at the 'keeper. One of England's better performers, but that's really not saying much.\n\nKyle Walker\n\nOne of barely a handful of good moments from England's perspective came via Walker's advancing runs. He made a loose pass from Jude Bellingham look somewhat decent as he caught Victor Kristensen napping to nip the ball away from the Denmark man to play in Harry Kane for his goal.\n\nJohn Stones\n\nDecent but not sparkling. Looks a far cry from the player he is when at his roaming best in his hybrid role for Man City. One of many cases of an immense talent not being given the license to shine by the overly defensive-minded manager in the dugout.\n\nMarc Guehi\n\nEngland's best player. He did a great job of handling Manchester United's Rasmus Hojlund, whose inexperience and rawness was just as evident for Denmark as it was at Old Trafford for much of his debut season.\n\nGuehi did not have it all his way and had to make a brilliant recovery block to prevent a huge chance after being dispossessed in a dangerous area. But he did so admirably and was one player who stepped up when most others went missing.\n\nOne of the main talking points heading into this tournament surrounded Guehi being England's weak link. But his first two appearances suggest he's the opposite, with Gareth Southgate having far more serious problems which require immediate attention if his side are to reach the latter stages of Euro 2024.\n\nKieran Trippier\n\nEven in an unnatural position, he's rarely left wanting when defending in an England shirt. He's currently doing a job for Southgate and is rightly pushing forward and hogging the flank when Foden drops deep, but does not offer a threat and the Three Lions desperately need Shaw back to full fitness if this system is to have any hope of working later in the tournament.\n\nMORE ON ENGLAND FROM F365...\n\n\ud83d\udc49 'Lost on the pitch', 'one good ball', 'didn't work' - 10 pundit takes on Trent Alexander-Arnold\n\n\ud83d\udc49 France, Belgium booted out, Modric embarrassing and England win - what Euro 2024 shirt numbers say\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Ranking England's 15 benchwarmers on their chances of gatecrashing Gareth Southgate's first XI\n\nTrent Alexander-Arnold\n\nDid nothing to justify Southgate's insistence on playing the Liverpool right-back in midfield. An awful pitch did not help his renowned passing range but he resembles a deer in the headlights in this unfamiliar position and is far from assured with any of his work. He was dragged off after 53 minutes and the change should have happened earlier.\n\nHis ineffective display should surely end a Southgate experiment doomed to fail from the get-go and has exposed the manager's tactical frailties. His baffling use of Alexander-Arnold will contribute to his final chapter as England's boss being a downer.\n\nDeclan Rice\n\nSimilar to Stones, Rice resembles a footballer playing with shackles around his ankles in this system after he clearly showed during the Premier League run-in that his best position is as a No.8.\n\nBut Southgate has never had trust in his defence and as long as he's England's manager (which thankfully, will not be for much longer), Rice will be held back in this current role.\n\nSaying that, like the rest of his England team-mates, Rice was pretty hopeless in possession and the scoreline would have been ugly were they playing a more clinical opponent.\n\nBukayo Saka\n\nHis first-half performance against Serbia was the Arsenal winger at his scintillating best, but he faded in that game after being taken off and only impressed in flashes.\n\nHe was probably a 6/10 while others were 4/10 or worse, but Saka does not seem to be fully recovered from his injury issues as he's showing restraint when running at defenders and giving his opponents an easier ride than they are used to.\n\nJude Bellingham\n\nThe Real Madrid sensation pretty much beat Serbia single-handedly in England's opening game, but the imperious 20-year-old slipped to the same level as his underperforming teammates as he let the game pass him by without making much of an impact.\n\nDid not come close to taking the game by the scruff of the neck as he did against Serbia and was pretty subdued throughout. It's been a gruelling season for the youngster and there were signs this evening of this campaign catching up with him.\n\nREAD: England bound for Euro 2024 glory thanks to druids and despite doom-mongers\n\nPhil Foden\n\nThe clamour for Newcastle United's Anthony Gordon to start on the left enhanced after Foden failed to get into the Serbia game.\n\nThe Manchester City standout was better this evening, but all of his good moments came through the centre of the pitch. It's almost as if he should just be played there. If only his manager cottoned onto that way of thinking...\n\nCame close when he struck the post from range in the 55th minute and in an ideal world, he'd start as a No.10 with Bellingham deeper alongside Rice, while Gordon/Eberechi Eze can be used on the left.\n\nHis emergence as England's Erling Haaland sparked backlash for some reason, but he showed why his work needs to be focused in the 18-yard box when he scored with his first chance to break the deadlock in a typically clinical fashion.\n\nBut signs of Kane reverting to type were clear from kick-off as he had more touches in the opening couple of minutes than he did in the whole first half against Serbia while dropping deep. This continued as the pressure immediately built on England after going in front.\n\nA frustrating theme of England in major tournaments is they drop back as soon as they take the lead and Kane's insistence on getting involved in midfield *once again* ensured they had no out ball when in trouble.\n\nAnd Kane contributed to Denmark's equaliser as an empty-headed pass - to God knows - from on the edge of England's box found Morten Hjlulmand, who let rip from range for a deserved leveller.\n\nConor Gallager (on 53rd min)\n\nHis first act saw him booked for a late foul after leading a solo press and got no better after as the one-dimensional terrier and favourite of Southgate did his case to replace Alexander-Arnold in the starting XI no good at all.\n\nEberechi Eze (on 68th min)\n\nWon a couple of fouls in the attacking half, but was unable to alter the course of the game as England's woefulness continued after Southgate's bold triple change with 20 minutes to go.\n\nOllie Watkins (on 68th min)\n\nSouthgate's uncharacteristically bold roll of the dice in the latter stages saw Kane, Foden and Saka replaced.\n\nThis switch reeks of a desperate manager hoping his increasingly frustrated critics would gloss over his negative ineptness and concentrate on him having a go in the latter moments with these changes. Unfortunately, he has no such luck with #SouthgateOut quickly trending on social media after full-time.\n\nOf the three players to come on at this point, Watkins was the most effective as a trademark in-behind run from a pass by Bellingham and his subsequent shot forced Schmeichel into a decent save. A positive sign and evidence he is a useful alternative option when Kane up front on his own is not working.\n\nJarrod Bowen (on 68th min)\n\nThe West Ham star really impressed after replacing Saka against Serbia as he further established himself as Southgate's go-to right winger if the Arsenal man gets injured. He was less good here as he could not make a difference.", "source": {"uri": "football365.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Football News -"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lewis_oldham@football365.com",

Or three at the back v Denmark?", "body": "England won on Sunday but there are calls for changes, with suggestions about two out-and-out wingers. Or none at all.\n\nSend your views on England, Euro 2024 and more to theeditor@football365.com\n\nPlay Saka AND Bowen\n\nThere's lots of talk about Eze or Gordon taking Fodens place in the left wing. But the stats (goals & assists) show us that the best two English wingers are Saka and Bowen.\n\nSo play them both. Saka played left back for England, has played games on the left often in his career....he can do it.\n\nThen we'd have two, ultra mobile, goalscoring wingers stretching the defense. That's one more runner/ target for Kane when he inevitably drops deep.\n\nAnd a properly stretched team leaves more time and space for the creative types. Then we could even have young Phil in midfield - where he belongs.\n\nTom E13. (I just realised I'm middle aged with that last sentence)\n\nWingbacks give width and TAA doesn't need to worry about tracking back as Rice can drop to make a back 4. Utilises Bellingham to give his all action box to box performance with Foden license to roam. Kane to stay up top and let Watkins do what he does best and drift into wide positions and help create space, pulling defenders out of position for Bellingham to run through the midfield.\n\nJust an idea but I think worth a try.\n\nA tweak on this would be to play Bellingham off Kane, drop Watkins and add Gallagher along side Rice for energy he gives in the middle of the park.\n\nCheers All.\n\nNik\n\nMORE ON ENGLAND FROM F365:\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Ranking England's 15 benchwarmers on their chances of gatecrashing Gareth Southgate's first XI\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Top 10 England scapegoats for their now sadly inevitable Euro 2024 failure\n\n\ud83d\udc49 England Clamour Rankings: Anthony Gordon offers Trent and Foden solution\n\nCredit to Serbia, maybe?\n\nLots of people seem to be forgetting in their clamour to decide who is most at fault for England not winning 2/3/4/10 - nil that there was an opposition team on the field. Defensively at least, they had a plan and executed it very well. Despite all of that, England found a way to win. Isn't that meant to be the mark of great teams, that they win even when not playing well?\n\nThe plan appeared to be to cut off all routes into Kane's feet and to force Pickford into playing long. They were very happy to force us into aerial duels, probably because they only had 1 starting player below 6'1'' tall. It is notable that Kane only had the ball into feet a few times, mostly very late on, and every time that happened he either recycled possession or won a foul.\n\nThose criticising Kane for not being involved are probably the same folks who criticise him for dropping deep. Hitting him with the long ball won't work very often. He's not terrible in the air but most teams have at least one centre-back who is better than him at that and Serbia had 3. IMO drop-deep-Kane would have been more useful, especially in the long spells where we weren't holding onto the ball.\n\nBellingham looked great and earned his goal through sheer drive and determination, but failed to create much, particularly for Foden. Even more than Kane, Foden needs ball-to-feet in forward areas to be effective. I was very impressed by Guehi and Rice defensively. TAA struggled to find the passes he was selected for, mostly down to Serbia's defensive positional play and aerial prowess.\n\nA ball-carrying player might have suited this opposition better, Mainoo perhaps or even Bellingham alongside Rice and Foden in the free role with Palmer or Bowen starting wide-left.\n\nBlame it all on Gareth\n\nEngland have the strongest team but a sh*t manager ie Gareth Southgate.\n\nHe should have been changed long back. Don't understand why the England management sticks with him.\n\nThis English team is capable of winning everything the game has to offer - they have specialists in each position who is a world beater. Still if they struggle to beat teams it is a wonder.\n\nAnurag Kejriwal\n\nFive reasons why England are insufferable\n\nThe below 5 reasons, sum up why I cannot stand watching England in a tournament.\n\n1 - The media - \"lets build the team up and then knock them down\". Unbridled optimism followed two hours later with scathing criticism. It's tiresome.\n\n2 - the commentators - I do not give two sh*ts that Southgate no longer wears a waistcoat, in fact I never did. I am not your friend and chum, just commentate.\n\n3 - the exaggeration - Pickford made one save in the game. I would expect any goalkeeper over the age of 13 to have made it. It was not Banks from 1970.\n\n4 - the fans - \"England game at 8pm - lets meet at the pub at 12\". There were so many obliterated fans watching the game, using language (in front of children) so despicable that I, and my mates, were embarrassed to be in the same establishment. I would have offered them a thesaurus, but the state they were in, they'd probably have tried to hump it.\n\n5 - the xenophobia - following on from the above point - One national treasure was in the face of a Serbian fan, using the big C word, simply due to him being from Serbia. After his vile outburst he stood proud as peacock basking in the warm glow from his fellow troglodytes' who applauded this brave act.\n\nI would like any reader of this fine website to try and defend the behaviour that England fans exhibit during a tournament.\n\nIan H\n\nPeter, (and I can't believe I'm having to explain this) singing \"10 German bombers\" does not honour the dead. It does not honour those who fought to protect us. In fact, football fans using a war as the basis of a chant to get one over your rivals, is about as offensive to those that fought as you can get.\n\nIt's worth noting that you never heard this chant in 1966. They are more recent. Why? Because people who had actually lived through the war would never dream of being so moronic as to sing about it at a football match. Honestly, watch an interview with a d-day vet where they tearfully talk about lost comrades, then honestly tell me you think those same veterans would enjoy standing on the terraces singing songs about the war.\n\nConsider that the youngest someone who fought in WW2 could possibly be is 95. That's a 16 year old who lied about his age and served in 1945. It's therefore very likely that half the people singing these songs don't even have grandads that fought in the war, let alone fathers. They are so far removed from it that to them WW2 is a game. Something to brag about, rather than a conflict that deserves to be treated with respect.\n\nMike, LFC, Dubai\n\n...Peter Stone; We know the chants about WW2 are neither racist, nor homophobic etc What they are, are pathetic and embarrassing. As you put it, it was 80 years ago.\n\nEverything you said may be historically true, but this is football, not some world war.\n\nAnd the German people are no longer governed by Nazis and are our allies and friends on the world stage. Perhaps they don't want a reminder of their country's dark past - you'd be the first to moan if other countries chanted about the raping, pilaging and killing of native people in the name of the British Empire.\n\nMy own Grandfather was a POW for 5 years in Poland and almost died on the Long March in the winter of 1945 when thousands of POWs were marched west as the Russians advanced. He had no hatred towards the German people and would have been embarrassed to hear chants like \"Ten German bombers.\"\n\nHe actually watched the 1966 World Cup final with Germans in Germany as he was traveling there with my Grandmother and Mother. It was a relaxed and respectful viewing experience with no \"banter\" and thats the thing - its something that developed in the last 30 years or so (probably a little longer when hooligans started becoming a thing) the people who actually took part in WW2 wouldn't have even thought to sing songs like that as they actually experienced it. And it wasn't fun and just a bit of harmless bantz.\n\nJohn Morgan\n\nFixture time\n\nSo the Premier League fixtures for the 2024/25 season have dropped and it is only right I completely overreact to some dates on a website.\n\nTaking a look at the Premier League fixture list, well it has thrown Chelsea into the lion's den! In just one month, we'll be facing Liverpool away, Newcastle at home, Man United away, Arsenal at home, and then Leicester away. It's as if the league decided to compress all our toughest battles into one epic saga. This stretch is going to test our squad's mettle to the limit. Based off last season we are either gonna show up or totally flop, I think come October i will be stocked up on stress relief remedies!\n\nThe opening fixture against Manchester City is probably the best time to play them, no momentum and no expectation, but i am sure Scotland thought the same when they took on Germany and that didn't end to well.\n\nThe Admin @ At The Bridge Pod\n\nFor Lee...\n\nLee (yes that one), men are historically crap at this stuff, but if you ever need anything, or just want to talk, I am happy for 365 to give you my email.\n\nDanny P\n\n...Heartbroken for you.

You can check out at any time. More info\n\nA raging Alan Shearer reckons Gareth Southgate is in for 'serious questions' after England's latest underwhelming display against Denmark.\n\nThe Three Lions were far from at their best as the eeked out a Euro 2024 opening win against Serbia, but dropped points against Denmark, who cancelled out Harry Kane's opener through a brilliant Morten Hjulmand strike to pick up a 1-1 draw, have the English media in panic mode.\n\nThey top their group on four points as things stand but they haven't looked up to it for the most part and Shearer let rip at some of Southgate's decision-making after the game - as well as three players who didn't turn up. He said on the BBC: \"Gareth Southgate will get serious questions. You see the players out there...Phil Foden and what he has done all season for Man City, Jude Bellingham turning up in the first game and not so much tonight, John Stones and what we have seen him do at club level. There is far more to get out of those players than he is getting at the moment.\n\n\"It was very poor, it wasn't good enough. Listening to Kyle Walker's interview, we've all been there as players, you try and take the positives. But it's Southgate's job to dissect where it's gone wrong, and there's plenty to look at there. Where do you start? No energy, no guile, I wouldn't say a lack of effort but there's so much more to come from those players.\"\n\nHost Gary Lineker meanwhile focused on Kane's performance as he said: \"As a striker you have two jobs, score goals, which Harry Kane has been good at all his career, and make space. He needs his manager to come to him and ask a little bit more of him. I would have expected that if I'd put in that kind of performance. Against a back three he has to stretch the play, run one way and then come short so you don't have to come too far to receive it. He needs to make more space for the midfield players behind him to create chances.\"\n\nAnd pundit Rio Ferdinand added: \"The current balance of the team is not allowing the players to reach the levels that they have done for clubs. Phil Foden is out of position and not playing his best, maybe Jude Bellingham would be better playing at number eight. It is a big concern.\"", "source": {"uri": "dailyrecord.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Record"}, "authors": [{"uri": "robbie_copeland@dailyrecord.co.uk", "name": "Robbie Copeland", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Shearer", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Alan Shearer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Kane", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Harry Kane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Lions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Three Lions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jude_Bellingham", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jude Bellingham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Walker", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Walker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Stones", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John Stones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Foden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Phil Foden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Lineker", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gary Lineker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_Ferdinand", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rio Ferdinand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Lacrosse/Drills_and_Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Lacrosse/Drills and Coaching", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Players", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Players", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article33075514.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Denmark-v-England-Group-C-UEFA-EURO-2024.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9657992", "eventUri": "eng-9657992", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 112, "relevance": 1}

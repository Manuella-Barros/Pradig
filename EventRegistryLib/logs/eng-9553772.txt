Jeremy Swayman, who's taken the reins as the team's starting goaltender this postseason, was pulled after Florida took a 4-1 lead early in the third period.\n\nConsidering Swayman had only allowed one or two goals in his first seven postseason starts this year, the four goals allowed (on 23 shots) represented a significant drop back to earth for the 25-year-old.\n\nYet according to Bruins head coach Jim Montgomery, Swayman had a tremendous night in goal. It was the rest of the team that sputtered.\n\n\"Swayman was terrific,\" Montgomery said.\n\nSwayman and Linus Ullmark have essentially split time as the team's starting goalie over the past two years, which means Swayman has never played this many games in a row at the NHL level, and he's never played this many games in such a condensed schedule. Because of that, Montgomery was asked if the heavy workload had caught up to the netminder.\n\n\"No, the workload hasn't played into Jeremy Swayman. The workload played into our effort tonight,\" Montgomery said. \"We didn't have juice tonight.\"\n\nMontgomery said he thought about taking Swayman out of the game after the second intermission, when the score was 3-1, just to give him a rest of sorts. And while Montgomery did make the call just 88 seconds into the third period, he made sure to note that Swayman \"made two great saves before it went in.\"\n\nSo it doesn't sound as if there will be much doubt or question heading into Friday night's Game 3 in Boston regarding the starting goaltender for the Bruins. Yet the third period in a game when Bruins skaters likely weren't going to mount a comeback offered the coach an opportunity for Ullmark to get his first playing time since Game 2 of the opening round. Ullmark didn't fare any better, allowing two goals on the 10 shots he faced.\n\nThrough it all, Swayman is keeping his trademark sense of positivity moving forward.\n\n\"We have so much belief in this room, we have so much confidence in this room,\" Swayman told reporters. \"And to see the way that we responded, we're never gonna back down. And there's so much to be excited for come Friday.\"", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Swayman", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jeremy Swayman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Montgomery_(ice_hockey)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jim Montgomery (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goaltender", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Goaltender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Hockey League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Ullmark", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Linus Ullmark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Forward (ice hockey)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Spill_and_Spell", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Spill and Spell", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/05/09/34b2bd74-08a7-40a5-a93c-16dc2b33ce39/thumbnail/1200x630g2/4bdfa2199b7ac212ab12eb53fd1162ec/gettyimages-2151601174.jpg?v=3a71db5e6dd1c027f95668a1c7b6fcaf", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9553772", "eventUri": "eng-9553772", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.08235294117647063, "wgt": 229, "relevance": 1}

We didn't have juice tonight.\"\n\nThe five-goal loss would have been steeper had it not been for Swayman, in a game where the Bruins often handled pucks like hand grenades. Those repeated fumblings had Swayman catching the resulting shrapnel in the crease.\n\nAfter Eetu Luostarinen's tap-in just 1:28 into the third period made it 4-1, Montgomery offered some words of encouragement to Swayman as the goalie made his way down the tunnel.\n\n\"I trust that guy with my life,\" Swayman said. \"He's going to make decisions that are going to help the team. And all I can say is I can't wait for Friday.\"\n\nMontgomery had little reason to harp on Swayman's fortitude in net, not with the miscues piling up in front of him throughout the sloppy showing.\n\n\"Swayman was terrific,\" Montgomery said. \"I thought about taking him out at 3-1, going into the third. And then when the fourth goal went in, I was like, 'I'm taking him out now.' He made two great saves before [Luostarinen's goal].\"\n\nOf the four goals scored against Swayman, two were generated off rough shifts byCharlie McAvoy in the second period, with the stickless defenseman unable to tie up Aleksander Barkov's rebound strike at 9:49 that made it 2-1 before screening his goalie on Gustav Forsling's buzzer-beater that followed a failed clear by Brad Marchand.\n\nMiscommunication and a defensive breakdown led to an uncovered Steven Lorentz redirecting a Brandon Montour shot past Swayman for Florida's opening strike at 1:56 of the second, while Luostarinen's goal capped a sequence that the Bruins initially thought was icing and ended with Brandon Carlo coughing up the puck along the endboards.\n\nSwayman is far from the reason the Bruins return to TD Garden in a 1-1 series deadlock. But will that be enough to steer Montgomery away from Ullmark in Game 3?\n\nBruins general manager Don Sweeney noted before the playoffs that \"performance and results will dictate\" the goalie deployment. That was the case when Swayman earned seven consecutive starts, including a 38-save gem against Florida Monday night in Game 1.\n\nWednesday's loss seemingly would signal that it's Ullmark's turn to try to stem the tide. It's a contingency plan that most teams would love to have -- especially with the reigning Vezina Trophy winner sporting a .947 save percentage over three appearances against Florida during the regular season.\n\nRest is no issue for Ullmark, who last started a game April 22 vs. Toronto.\n\nThe NHL is a results-based business, especially at this juncture of the calendar. But after a night when his skaters largely left him hung out to dry, should Swayman be the one to get the hook in what has all the makings of a pugnacious rematch on Causeway Street?\n\nWith Wednesday's loss, Swayman's save percentage has dipped ... to a stellar .943 over eight games. According to Natural Stat Trick, he leads all playoff goalies in goals saved above average at 9.14. New York's Igor Shesterkin ranks second i at 4.33.\n\n\"One game at a time is all I'm worried about,\" Swayman noted. \"Body feels great. I'm very lucky to be in this position.

We didn't have juice tonight.\"\n\nA five-goal loss likely would have been far steeper had it not been for Swayman -- especially in a game where Boston's puck carriers handled the biscuit like hand grenades. Those repeated fumblings had Swayman catching all of the resulting shrapnel in the crease.\n\nAfter Eetu Luostarinen's tap-in tally just 1:28 into the third period, Montgomery offered some words of encouragement to Swayman as he made his way down the tunnel.\n\n\"I trust that guy with my life,\" Swayman said of his quick chat with Montgomery. \"He's gonna make decisions that are going to help the team. And all I can say is I can't wait for Friday.\"\n\nMontgomery had little reason to harp on Swayman's fortitude in net, not with the miscues piling up in front of him throughout Wednesday's sloppy showing.\n\n\"Swayman was terrific,\" Montgomery added. \"I thought about taking him out at 3-1, going into the third. And then when the fourth goal went in, I was like, 'I'm taking him out now.' He made two great saves before [Luostarinen's goal] went in.\"\n\nOf Florida's four goals scored against Swayman, two were generated off of rough shifts from Charlie McAvoy -- with the stickless defenseman unable to tie up Aleksander Barkov's rebound strike at 9:49 in the second period before screening his goalie on Gustav Forsling's buzzer beater (a play generated off a failed clear by Brad Marchand).\n\nMiscommunication and a defensive breakdown led to an uncovered Steven Lorentz redirecting a Brandon Montour shot past Swayman for Florida's opening strike at 1:56 in the second, while Luostarinen's haymaker capped off a sequence that the Bruins initially thought was icing, and ended with Brandon Carlo coughing up the puck along the endboards.\n\nSwayman was far from the reason why the Bruins now return to TD Garden stuck in a 1-1 series deadlock. But will that be enough to steer Boston away from turning to Ullmark in Game 3?\n\nDon Sweeney noted before Boston's playoff push that \"performance and results will dictate\" any changes to the Bruins' goalie rotation during this run. That was validated by Swayman earning seven consecutive starts en route to a gutsy first-round triumph over the Maple Leafs, and a 38-save gem against Florida on Monday night.\n\nWednesday's loss would seemingly signal that it's Ullmark's turn to try and stem the tide. It's a contingency plan that most teams would love to have available -- especially with the reigning Vezina Trophy winner sporting a .947 save percentage over three appearances against Florida during regular-season action.\n\nRest is no issue for Ullmark, who last started a game on April 22 vs. Toronto.\n\nIt's a results-based business in the NHL, especially at this juncture of the league calendar. But on a night where his skaters largely left him out to dry, should Swayman be the one to get the hook in what has all the makings of a pugnacious rematch on Causeway Street?\n\nAfter Wednesday's loss, Swayman's save percentage has dipped ... to a stellar .943 over eight games. According to Natural Stat Trick, Swayman leads all playoff goalies in goals saved above average at 9.14. New York's Igor Shesterkin ranks second in the same category -- at 4.33 goals saved above average.\n\nSwayman has done little to persuade the Bruins to make a change -- even if the final score on Wednesday might tell a different story.\n\n\"One game at a time is all I'm worried about,\" Swayman noted. \"Body feels great. I'm very lucky to be in this position. And I can't wait till Friday.\"\n\nWhether he spends Friday on the bench or back in net remains to be seen.", "source": {"uri": "boston.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Boston"}, "authors": [{"uri": "conor_ryan@boston.com", "name": "Conor Ryan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Swayman", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jeremy Swayman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Montgomery_(ice_hockey)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jim Montgomery (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Ullmark", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Linus Ullmark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hockey_puck", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hockey puck"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Panthers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida Panthers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrise,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sunrise, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sunrise, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksander_Barkov", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aleksander Barkov"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eetu_Luostarinen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eetu Luostarinen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_hockey_rink", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ice hockey rink"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Marchand", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brad Marchand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defenceman", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Defenceman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_McAvoy", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Charlie McAvoy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustav_Forsling", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gustav Forsling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Igor_Shesterkin", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Igor Shesterkin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Montour", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brandon Montour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Sweeney", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Don Sweeney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icing_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Icing (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TD_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TD Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vezina_Trophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vezina Trophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Hockey League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Carlo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brandon Carlo"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Adventure", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Adventure", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://bdc2020.o0bc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Bruins_Panthers_Hockey_88679-663c6a1658dad-768x432.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9553772", "eventUri": "eng-9553772", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sunrise, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-22", "textStart": 3810, "textEnd": 3818}], "sentiment": -0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 210, "relevance": 1}

Swayman has started all but one game in the Stanley Cup playoffs thus far for Boston, but Game 2 in the Eastern Conference semifinals marked his ugliest start yet.\n\nEven so, that doesn't mean Game 3's net belongs to Linus Ullmark.\n\n\"I haven't (made a decision),\" Montgomery said Thursday.\n\nSwayman, for the first time in this year's playoffs, surrendered more than two goals (four on 23 shots) in the Bruins' 6-1 Game 2 loss to the Florida Panthers on Wednesday night. After the fourth goal, Montgomery pulled Swayman in favor of Ullmark -- his first time back between the pipes since Game 2 in the first round against the Toronto Maple Leafs.\n\nThe final score of Game 2 was not indicative to how either goalie played. Not capitalizing on several first-period opportunities, defensive zone breakdowns, Boston failing to clear the puck out of its zone and a rough game from Charlie McAvoy didn't help Swayman, but the visitors could muster only one goal after potting five in Game 1.\n\nDerek Forbort was late getting to the front of net, leaving Steven Lorentz all alone to score the equalizer in the second period of Game 2. McAvoy lost his stick and was beaten by Sam Reinhart to the net, and the veteran defender's rough outing continued when he screened Swayman on another Panthers goal. McAvoy also had a costly turnover leading to Florida's fourth goal.\n\n\"Did he have his best game last night? No,\" Montgomery said of McAvoy. \"But I don't think there was a Bruin -- except for maybe Swayman -- who had his best night last night.\"\n\nMontgomery sounded confident Swayman will be ready to go for Game 3 if called upon.\n\nBut he also touched upon the importance of getting Ullmark some action for the first time since April 22.\n\n\"He looked really good,\" Montgomery said. \"Again, it's the strength of our team.

The duo of Linus Ullmark and Jeremy Swayman carried the team to the best regular season in NHL history in 2022-23. They followed that up with a second-place finish in the Atlantic Division in 2023-24 that exceeded preseason expectations. They need to revert back to that system now if they want to push for a Stanley Cup.\n\nLast postseason, the Bruins benched Swayman in favor of Ullmark until Game 7 of their first-round series against the Florida Panthers. By then, their 1B netminder had not seen the ice in over two weeks, and it was too late. Swayman came up one save short, and the Bruins lost in overtime to exit the playoffs. Ullmark did not play poorly throughout the series, but more than once, he did not look like the season's Vezina Trophy winner.\n\nFans and analysts had called for Swayman to appear earlier in the series. Ullmark, however, was the hot hand and the better of the two during the regular season. While the roles are reversed in 2023-24, with Swayman carrying the weight for most of round one and into round two, the same lesson applies: Ullmark and Swayman are dominant because they don't have to bear all the workload, like Juuse Saros or Alexander Georgiev.\n\nThere is no denying that Swayman was unbelievable in Round 1, and his stellar play continued into Game 1 of Round 2 against the same Panthers. His performance against the Toronto Maple Leafs was as good as any we've seen in recent years, and if it had been anyone else in net, the Bruins' season might be over.\n\nThe Alaskan netminder went seven consecutive games allowing two goals or fewer, and he did it in style, making several highlight-reel saves along the way. Even if the Bruins can't move past the Panthers, their fans will remember his performance against the Maple Leafs. That said, his magical run was stymied by the Panthers in Game 2 on Wednesday night. He allowed three goals in the second period after blanking them in the first frame - the third came with less than a second left on the clock. He was pulled after allowing a fourth goal to start the third.\n\nRelated: Bruins' Swayman Had MVP Performance in First Round\n\nI am not saying that these goals were expressly Swayman's fault because they weren't. The team in front of him played their worst game of the postseason, committing several careless turnovers. That said, their netminder was not as good as he was in games past. For the Bruins to win, they will need both goaltenders to stand on their heads, as they are not as deep or as explosive offensively as the Panthers. It would be unfair to expect Swayman, who is used to playing directionally every four days, to take the ice every other night for the rest of the playoffs and be at his best.\n\nFortunately, the Bruins have another Vezina-caliber goalie who can give them a lights-out performance on any given night. Rather than expect Swayman to carry an unprecedented workload and hope he can withstand the wear and tear of a long postseason run, the Bruins should rely on their proven strategy of rotating between their two all-world netminders and give Ullmark some starts.\n\nRiding the hot hand worked in the first round, but if the team hopes to win the Stanley Cup, they have to win 11 more games, more than double the number they have won so far. They should reset in Game 3 and give the net to Ullmark, who has a spectacular 7-0-0 record this season with a 0.937 save percentage (SV%) when starting games after seven or more days of rest. From there, they should continue to rotate the two and ride the hot hand as needed, but they should not be quick to hand the net to either for good.", "source": {"uri": "thehockeywriters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hockey Writers"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ryan_ventura@thehockeywriters.com", "name": "Ryan Ventura", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Swayman", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jeremy Swayman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Ullmark", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Linus Ullmark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Division_(NHL)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlantic Division (NHL)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vezina_Trophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vezina Trophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Bruins", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston Bruins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Panthers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida Panthers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Hockey League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandar_Georgiev", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alexandar Georgiev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juuse_Saros", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Juuse Saros"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Maple_Leafs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Toronto Maple Leafs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2023 NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goaltender", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Goaltender"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://s3951.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Linus-Ullmark-Jeremy-Swayman-Bruins-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9553772", "eventUri": "eng-9553772", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 201, "relevance": 1}

Swayman has started all but one game in the Stanley Cup Playoffs thus far for Boston, but Game 2 in the Eastern Conference semifinals marked his ugliest start yet.\n\nEven so, that doesn't mean Game 3's net belongs to Linus Ullmark.\n\n\"I haven't (made a decision),\" Montgomery said Thursday.\n\nSwayman, for the first time in this year's playoffs, surrendered more than two goals (four on 23 shots) in the Bruins' 6-1 Game 2 loss to the Florida Panthers on Wednesday night. After the fourth goal, Montgomery pulled Swayman in favor of Ullmark -- his first time back between the pipes since Game 2 in the first round against the Toronto Maple Leafs.\n\nThe final score of Game 2 was not indicative to how either goalie played. Not capitalizing on several first period opportunities, defensive zone breakdowns, Boston failing to clear the puck out of its zone and a rough game from Charlie McAvoy didn't help Swayman, but the visitors could only muster one goal after potting five in Game 1.\n\nDerek Forbort was late getting to the front of net, leaving Steven Lorentz all alone to score the equalizer in the second period of Game 2, McAvoy lost his stick and was beat by Sam Reinhart to the net, and the veteran defender's tough game continued when he screened Swayman on another Panthers goal. McAvoy also had a costly turnover leading to Florida's fourth goal.\n\n\"Did he have his best game last night? No,\" Montgomery said of McAvoy. \"But I don't think there was a Bruin -- except for maybe Swayman -- who had his best night last night. He was our biggest minute cruncher.\"\n\nMontgomery sounded confident Swayman will be ready to go for Game 3 if called upon, but also touched upon the importance of getting Ullmark some action for the first time since April 22.\n\n\"He looked really good,\" Montgomery said. \"Again, it's the strength of our team.

He said after the game, \"One game at a time is all I'm worried about. Body feels great. I'm very lucky to be in this position, and I can't wait until Friday.\"\n\nIf the goalie gets the nod Friday, it would mark his eighth consecutive start. The Bruins and Panthers head to Boston for Game 3 at TD Garden (7 p.m. ET; MAX, truTV, TNT, SN, TVAS, CBC) tied 1-1 in the best-of-7 series.\n\n\"That guy's always dialed in,\" Lohrei said. \"We're never worried about that. He's unbelievable and the backbone of this team. We're lucky to have him.\"\n\nSwayman is playing some of his best hockey in a season that was, already, excellent. He split time with Ullmark, the reigning Vezina Trophy winner voted as best goalie in the NHL, with the pair playing every other game for nearly the entirety of 2023-24. Swayman finished 25-10-8 with a 2.53 GAA and .916 save percentage. They were numbers matched almost exactly by Ullmark, who went 22-10-7 with a 2.57 GAA and .915 save percentage.\n\nThe Bruins started the playoffs by alternating the pair through the first three games against the Maple Leafs, with Swayman getting Games 1 and 3 and Ullmark starting Game 2.\n\nSwayman has started every game since.\n\nBecause, as Bruins coach Jim Montgomery put it, \"When a guy is playing that well, it's like, don't outsmart yourself.\"\n\n\"He just looks really poised and looks like he's making good reads,\" said Alfie Michaud, Swayman's goaltending coach at the University of Maine. \"He's very calm in the net. There's not a lot of extra movement, which means there's not a lot of holes. [There are] usually the holes because you've got extra movement and he's been very calm and compact. And then he's really good at those scrambly situations because he's such a good skater.\"\n\nMichaud, by coincidence, happened to be in Florida this week, so he went to Amerant Bank Arena for Game 1, and noted exactly what his former pupil has been doing right.\n\n\"He competes,\" Michaud said. \"He fights hard to see the puck. I sat behind him a couple periods and he's just working really hard to find sightlines and then he's making that save. \u00e2\u20ac| For the most part, he's been controlling the puck and not creating second-chance opportunities.\"\n\nThe 25-year-old goalie is in his third full season in the NHL and made six starts in the playoffs prior to this year, going 3-4 with a .901 save percentage and allowing 18 goals on 181 shots. It was good, but nothing like this.\n\nAnd what has been particularly notable is that calm, that ability to take it all in stride, the laughter coming out of a pile of bodies in the crease, the singing on the ice, the coolness in the postgame locker room, the unflappability at all times.\n\nIt's something that hasn't always been there.\n\n\"I think he was so dialed when he was younger, so focused, he was trying to make a name for himself,\" Michaud said. \"I think now he's starting to realize that it's more about the journey than the end result and if you take care of that, then that other stuff will just kind of happen naturally.\n\n\"But if you're fretting about three steps ahead, the here and now will never turn out how you want.\"\n\nThat attitude has made an impression on his teammates, their confidence in him and the confidence in themselves. It has made them feel secure in their play, their decision-making, and even their mistakes.\n\n\"His positivity on the ice is outstanding,\" defenseman Charlie McAvoy said. \"His attitude really is incredible. It's always about the next play. If he makes a mistake, he's the first one to come and tell you, like, 'I've got to better, I'll be better, we'll get that back.' And then when we make a mistake it's the same, he does the same thing, so he can take that responsibility in way off of guys shoulders, which is a gift.\"\n\nSwayman can handle it. He has handled it.\n\n\"That's what a goalie's there for,\" Michaud said. \"We're there to fix mistakes. That's what people don't understand [is] these guys are equipped with that. He's been doing it since he was 6 years old. It's not like this is a new thing. Is it on a bigger scale? Yeah, no question, but him getting scored on as a 6, 7-year-old is the same as him getting scored on as a 25-year-old. You feel crappy when the puck goes in the net because you feel like you let down your team. That's just how it is.\"\n\nBecause every goalie, whether it's Swayman or Patrick Roy, is going to let in goals, even though Swayman hasn't let in many, allowing no more than two in any of his starts.\n\nIt's what happens after that.\n\n\"It's just inevitable,\" Michaud said. \"It's just how do you deal with it? And he's seemed to find a way that when he does give one up, he's able to walk it back in and get ready for the next shot.\"\n\nSwayman is a long way from Alaska right now. He is a long way from Denali and those campsites and bears passing by on the trails or snorting and thumping by his tent at night. The attention of the hockey world is focused on him while he plays under the lights and the scrutiny, robs one scorer after another, stealing goal after goal.\n\nBut it was back in Alaska where he learned to live in the moment, learned to appreciate the outdoors and the animals, the nature and the natural. It was where he learned to be calm and levelheaded, to not budge when faced with danger.\n\n\"The way we look at it is it's one save at a time and that's all we got,\" Ken Swayman said. \"You can't think of anything other than one save at a time. That's how Jeremy approaches it, and he's taught me to approach it, I can't think of next week, I can't think of next month.\n\n\"All he's got is the next shot.

They discussed the Bruins' goalie rotation strategy, wondering if it's part of their signature style. Levy was unsure about ditching this strategy, stressing the team's resilience and adaptability. He mentioned Swayman and Ullmark's performances, suggesting they could stick with the rotation. Fred Toucher agreed, citing local experts who back this tactic due to the team's preparedness and strong culture.\n\nHardy: Do you think the Bruins were trying to establish their signature by starting this postseason with a goalie rotation? And if so, what did you make of it then? What are your thoughts now that it seems to have been abandoned?\n\nSteve Levy: I'm not sure it should be abandoned. I might find myself on an island here. I think we should go back to the hallmark. This is a grind, and I'm not blaming Swayman for last night. When Swayman hit the tunnel, you saw Montgomery; I think he was telling him, \"This isn't on you. It's a wake-up call. Let's get you ready.\" Swayman could start tomorrow night. No question. Even if the Bruins lose by a goal in Game 3, it wouldn't be a setback. Again, I could see going back to Ullmark. This is Bruins DNA. The guys are conditioned for it, not just the goalies. The players are used to it, and you need those values. It's just the way it is. Everyone goes that way. The kids are playing great. I wouldn't be surprised if the Rangers go on a long run or have to switch for one game. I wouldn't be surprised at all. In fact, if you look at the Bruins and list all their qualities on paper, goaltending is at the top. Nobody's had better goaltending. So, I wouldn't be surprised to see Ullmark if not tomorrow, then definitely for Game 4. Even if Swayman continues to play great. Before last night, he was the MVP of the entire Stanley Cup playoffs. That's who they've been. That's what Montgomery's plan was. Swayman just outplayed the plan.\n\nFred Toucher: You're not alone. Everyone we've talked to locally, analysts, ex-players, they've all said they would have played Ullmark last night or in Game 4.\n\nSteve Levy: You're not going to upset the culture. Normally you're afraid that if you pull this guy and play the backup, you might lose the starter mentally. That's not the case here because these guys have been through it. They're used to it. You don't have that kind of relationship.", "source": {"uri": "985thesportshub.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "98.5 The Sports Hub - Boston's Home For Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nick_gemelli@985thesportshub.com", "name": "Nick Gemelli", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Swayman", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jeremy Swayman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Levy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Steve Levy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_postseason", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball postseason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goaltender", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Goaltender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Rangers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Rangers"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/North_America", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/North America", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/Europe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/Europe", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 66}], "image": "https://985thesportshub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/88/2024/05/Jeremy-Swayman-Linus-Ullmark-2024-Game-7-Bruins-Leafs.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9553772", "eventUri": "eng-9553772", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

I mean, last night to me was a big question mark type of night, right? Could he carry over what he did in Game 7 7 into this series? Short turnaround, travel, different opponent, all of it. He did of it. He was spectacular. You cannot not play him.\n\nTim McKone: The 1-3-5-7 is dead.\n\nMarc Bertrand: It's dead. Swayman killed it. Swayman slayed the 1-3-5-7. The bulldog ook it by the horns and smashed it into the ground.\n\nTim McKone: I mean, if you're a Bruins fan, you couldn't have asked for a better performance last night. Like you said, Swayman showed up, was the same goalie that he was, and the guys came ready to play from the first period. That was an impressive performance last night from the bronze.\n\nMarc Bertrand: Yeah, it was. And, I thought they did things in this game that they weren't doing in the last series. I just know that at certain points, right out of the gate, to go back to Swayman the early save in the first two minutes of the game. Ridiculous. Tone setting type of save right out of the gate. But the Bruins did a good job keeping the puck in the offensive zone and trying to create chances. They did. It was noticeably better last night than it was against Toronto.

Lynne Sladky/Associated Press\n\nThe emotions and intensity between the Florida Panthers and Boston Bruins had already hit a tipping point Wednesday before the grand finale began.\n\nGAME 3\n\nWHO: Florida Panthers at Boston Bruins\n\nWHEN: 7 p.m. Friday\n\nTELEVISION: TNT\n\nSERIES: Tied, 1-1\n\nTen players had been kicked out in a span of 90 seconds of game action midway through the third period of Florida's 6-1 win in Game 2 of the best-of-7 Stanley Cup playoffs series when Florida's Matthew Tkachuk pointed to Boston's David Pastrnak on the opposing bench.\n\nIt didn't take much to realize what was going to happen next.\n\n\"Definitely for the team. (Tkachuk) was asking me. The game was over at 6-1, so give it a go,\" Pastrnak said. \"There was a lot of emotions. I'm not afraid of him to be honest. I can take a punch and I'd do anything for these guys.\"\n\nOn the ensuing shift, Tkachuk and Pastrnak dropped their gloves near center ice - with Tkachuk laying down a few big right hooks as both tumbled to the ice. Tkachuk got the takedown, but Pastrnak slipped out and tried to continue to tussle, but the officials broke it up and issued both players a major and a misconduct.\n\n\"I'm not a very experienced fighter, I fell down. That's on me,\" Pastrnak said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut the incident made an impact.\n\n\"Man, you're going to see that on the highlights over and over again,\" Panthers Coach Paul Maurice said. \"I think it's a good thing. You get two elite offensive players. Chucky's a 100-point player. Pastrnak's just this brilliant player, but it's the playoffs. They each have their team. They've got their brothers in the room. It's a little spicy out there and they want to go. I think it was awesome. Sorry if anyone's offended by that concept. I don't care. I thought it was awesome.\"\n\nAdded Tkachuk: \"I have tons of respect for him. ... Just to see us out there battling at center ice in a playoff game, I think it's pretty cool. It's good for hockey. We're both emotional guys that are leaders for our team that really just want to show that we will do whatever it takes to win.\"\n\nIt was only a matter of time before the series got to this point, when the heat of the moment between two heated rivals would overtake a portion of the series. It finally happened in the final 10 minutes of Game 2 - and don't expect things to mellow any time soon as the series shifts to Boston's TD Garden for Game 3 on Friday and Game 4 on Sunday.\n\nFlorida and Boston are tied 1-1 in this second-round series, one year after the Panthers rallied from a 3-1 deficit to upend the Bruins in seven games in the opening round of the playoffs.\n\n\"That's playoff hockey,\" said Panthers forward Steven Lorentz, who scored the first of Florida's six unanswered goals after falling behind 1-0 in the first period.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat third period - really, that 2-minute, 17-second span in the third period - epitomized the feisty nature that was expected to come in this series. Florida was already up 4-1 when the first fracas began, with the Bruins' Pat Maroon and the Panthers' Nick Cousins getting the first round of misconducts 10:25 into the third period. Aleksander Barkov scored on the power play 27 seconds later to push the Panthers' lead to 5-1.\n\nEleven seconds after that, following Boston's first shot on goal of the period, the Panthers' Oliver Ekman-Larsson was called for a cross-check before a full skirmish broke out. Four more players - Florida's Dmitry Kulikov and Eetu Luostarinen, as well as Boston's Justin Brazeau and Trent Frederic - were sent to their respective dressing rooms.\n\nAnd then one final full-on scrum came a couple minutes later after Brandon Montour scored a short-handed goal for the Panthers to cap the scoring with 8:02 left to play. Yet another four players - Florida's Sam Reinhart and Niko Mikkola, Boston's Brad Marchand and Charlie McAvoy - left the game.\n\nThat set the stage for the Tkachuk-Pastrnak fight to end the third-period festivities in a game that was far out of reach.\n\n\"This is what playoffs is about,\" Marchand, Boston's captain, told reporters after the game. \"This is where rivalries are built - in the playoffs. With last year, it kind of started there. They play a physical game, and we're able to do that as well. It creates a lot of emotion and adrenaline. A lot of really good battles, guys are competing hard out there. You can see both teams want to win. They're leaving it all out there.\n\n\"It's going to be a physical series, we know that. That's what fans love. It's exciting. And it creates rivalries.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd there's no doubt about it that the bad blood will carry over to Friday.\n\nBoston goaltender Jeremy Swayman watches from the bench after getting pulled from Game 2 in the third period against Florida on Wednesday. Lynne Sladky/Associated Press\n\nGOALIE SHUFFLE: Coach Jim Montgomery pulled Jeremy Swayman, but didn't blame his goalie for Boston's 6-1 Game 2 loss to the Panthers.\n\nSwayman had put up absurdly good numbers in six games against Toronto and Game 1 against the Panthers - 5-2 with a 1.42 goals-against average and a .955 save percentage. But he allowed four goals before leaving less than two minutes into the third period. Linus Ullmark gave up two more in the 6-1 loss.\n\nMontgomery didn't think seven straight starts had worn down his goalie.\n\n\"The workload didn't play into Jeremy Swayman. It played into our effort tonight. We didn't have juice tonight,\" he said. \"Swayman was terrific. I thought about taking him out at 3-1 going into the third. Then the fourth one went in and I thought, 'I'm taking him out now.' He made two great saves before it went in.\"\n\nSwayman had 20 saves through two periods. Ullmark stopped eight in the third period.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTaking Swayman out at that point had two results that could help the Bruins in Game 3. It gave Swayman a little extra rest and allowed Ullmark not to be rusty should the Bruins choose to start him in Game 3. Ullmark hadn't played a game in 16 days.\n\nUllmark has thrived against Florida in the regular season in his career. He is 12-3-1 with a .929 save percentage and a 2.47 goals-against average. He has more wins over the Panthers than any other team in his career. Ullmark was 3-0 with a .947 save percentage and a 1.62 goals-against average against Florida in 2023-24.\n\nROSTER MOVE: With Jesper Boqvist back and Danton Heinen getting closer, the Bruins sent Patrick Brown back to Providence.\n\nHe'll rejoin the P-Bruins, who are competing in the AHL playoffs.\n\nBrown was called up before Game 1 with Boqvist unavailable. He played 13 shifts over 8:27 centering Johnny Beecher and Patrick Maroon on the fourth line. Brown played 11 games for the Bruins this season and had one assist after signing as a free agent in the offseason.\n\nHe's played 149 NHL games in his career. In addition to Boston, he's played for Ottawa, Philadelphia, Vegas and Carolina and has 10 goals and 15 assists. The 31-year-old has 11 goals and 21 assists for 32 points in 42 games this year for Providence. The AHL Bruins are currently in a best-of-five playoff series with the Hartford Wolf Pack.\n\nCopy the Story Link\n\nComments are not available on this story.\n\nSend questions/comments to the

We just kept playing our game, going hard and to the net. That is what we did the whole game.\"\n\nBoston won 5-1 in Monday's series opener, playing just two days after beating the Toronto Maple Leafs in overtime in Game 7 of its first-round series.\n\nMeanwhile, Florida had a week off after eliminating the Tampa Bay Lightning in five games.\n\n\"I don't know if the week off hurt us, (but we) really didn't get into our game in the first one. We knew we needed to respond,\" Florida center Steven Lorentz said. \"We were just chipping away. Once we got the first (goal), we kind of got the ball rolling.\"\n\nThe Panthers now have eight comeback wins in the postseason dating back to their 2023 run to the Stanley Cup Final.\n\nBarkov led the way and now has eight points over his last three games.\n\n\"The thing I heard most when I came here was, 'You have no idea how good Barkov is,'\" Florida coach Paul Maurice said. \"I've got a TV. I've got a pretty good idea. It's not my first game. But they were right. He's better this year than he's ever been.\"\n\nHowever the series turns in Game 3, the physicality should certainly continue after Wednesday featured a combined 148 penalty minutes. The night's fisticuffs were highlighted by the talented duo of Boston's David Pastrnak and Florida's Matthew Tkachuk dropping the gloves.\n\nThe memory of last season's seven-game, first-round series, won by Florida after facing a 3-1 deficit, also adds to the excitement.\n\n\"This is where rivalries are built in the playoffs. With last year, it kind of started there,\" Marchand said. \"They play a physical game and we're able to do that as well. ... A lot of really good battles, guys are competing hard out there. You can see both teams want to win.\"\n\nCharlie Coyle gave the Bruins a 1-0 lead in Wednesday's first period, but it was all Florida from there.\n\n\"I thought our team was emotionally engaged,\" Boston coach Jim Montgomery said. \"I just didn't think we had the juice. We couldn't match the emotion that we had. That's why you had the spillovers in the third period, because we did have emotion. A little undisciplined, but that's part of playoff hockey.\"\n\nBoston's goaltending situation could also be a question again after Linus Ullmark relieved Jeremy Swayman (four goals on 23 shots) in Wednesday's third period.\n\nThe 25-year-old Swayman has started eight of the team's nine playoff games, but he said his workload didn't factor into his tough night, in which he allowed more than two goals for the first time in this run.\n\n\"One game at a time is all I'm worried about,\" Swayman said. \"Body feels great. I'm very lucky to be in this position. And I can't wait 'til Friday.\"", "source": {"uri": "deadspin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Deadspin"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksander_Barkov", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Aleksander Barkov"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Reinhart", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sam Reinhart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Montour", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brandon Montour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Division_(NHL)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlantic Division (NHL)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NHL)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NHL)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Marchand", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brad Marchand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Bruins", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston Bruins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Captain (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Panthers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida Panthers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrise,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sunrise, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sunrise, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Maurice", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paul Maurice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Maple_Leafs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Toronto Maple Leafs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Lightning", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tampa Bay Lightning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Swayman", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jeremy Swayman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Pastr\u0148\u00e1k", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "David Pastr\u0148\u00e1k"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Tkachuk", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Matthew Tkachuk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Montgomery_(ice_hockey)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jim Montgomery (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Coyle", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charlie Coyle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goaltender", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Goaltender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Penalty (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Ullmark", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Linus Ullmark"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Miniatures/Conventions", "label": "dmoz/Games/Miniatures/Conventions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fill,h_675,pg_1,q_80,w_1200/05fb10372685b375d71c52f22b34f2a9.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9553772", "eventUri": "eng-9553772", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 139, "relevance": 1}

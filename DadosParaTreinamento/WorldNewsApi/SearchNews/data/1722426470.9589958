{"id": 243371010, "title": "Iran presidential election: reformist Pezeshkian, hardliner Jalili lead in tight race", "text": "A low-key moderate and a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Iran\u2019s supreme leader are neck-and-neck in the vote count in snap presidential elections marked by voter apathy over economic hardships and social restrictions. More than 14 million votes have been counted so far from Friday\u2019s vote, of which the sole moderate candidate Massoud Pezeshkian had won over 5.9 million votes and his hardline challenger former nuclear negotiator Saeed Jalili over 5.5 million, provisional results by the interior ministry showed. Some insiders said the turnout was around 40 per cent, lower than expected by Iran\u2019s clerical rulers, while witnesses said that polling stations in Tehran and some other cities were not crowded. Iran\u2019s Tasnim news agency said a run-off election was \u201cvery likely\u201d to pick the next president following the death of Ebrahim Raisi in a helicopter crash last month. If no candidate wins at least 50 per cent plus one vote from all ballots cast, including blank votes, a run-off between the top two candidates is held on the first Friday after the result is declared. The election coincides with escalating regional tension due to the war between Israel and Iranian allies Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, as well as increased Western pressure on Iran over its fast-advancing nuclear programme. While the election is unlikely to bring a major shift in the Islamic republic\u2019s policies, its outcome could influence the succession to Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran\u2019s 85-year-old supreme leader, in power since 1989. The clerical establishment sought a high turnout to offset a legitimacy crisis fuelled by public discontent over economic hardship and curbs on political and social freedom. The next president is not expected to usher in any major policy shift on Iran\u2019s nuclear programme or support for militia groups across the Middle East, since Khamenei calls all the shots on top state matters. However, the president runs the government day-to-day and can influence the tone of Iran\u2019s foreign and domestic policy. Pezeshkian\u2019s views offer a contrast to those of Jalili, advocating detente with the West, economic reform, social liberalisation and political pluralism. A staunch anti-Westerner, Jalili\u2019s win would signal the possibility of an even more antagonistic turn in the Islamic republic\u2019s foreign and domestic policy, analysts said. The election was a contest among a tightly controlled group of three hardline candidates and one low profile moderate loyal to the supreme leader. A hardline watchdog body approved only six from an initial pool of 80 and two hardline candidates subsequently dropped out. \u201cBased on unconfirmed reports, the election is very likely heading to a second round \u2026 Jalili and Pezeshkian will compete in a run-off election,\u201d Tasnim reported. Critics of the clerical establishment say that low turnouts in recent years show the system\u2019s legitimacy has eroded. Turnout was 48 per cent in the 2021 presidential election and a record low of 41 per cent of people voted in a parliamentary election in March. All candidates have vowed to revive the flagging economy, beset by mismanagement, state corruption and sanctions reimposed since 2018, after the US ditched Tehran\u2019s nuclear pact. \u201cI think Jalili is the only candidate who raised the issue of justice, fighting corruption and giving value to the poor. \u2026 Most importantly, he does not link Iran\u2019s foreign policy to the nuclear deal,\u201d said Farzan, a 45-year-old artist in the city of Karaj. Pezeshkian, faithful to Iran\u2019s theocratic rule, is backed by the reformist faction that has largely been sidelined in Iran in recent years. \u201cWe will respect the hijab law, but there should never be any intrusive or inhumane behaviour toward women,\u201d Pezeshkian said after casting his vote. He was referring to the death of Mahsa Amini, a young Kurdish woman, in 2022 while in morality police custody for allegedly violating the mandatory Islamic dress code. The unrest sparked by Amini\u2019s death spiralled into the biggest show of opposition to Iran\u2019s clerical rulers in years. Pezeshkian attempted to revive the enthusiasm of reform-minded voters who have largely stayed away from the polls for the last four years as a mostly youthful population chafes at political and social curbs. He could also benefit from his rivals\u2019 failure to consolidate the hardline vote. In the past few weeks, Iranians have made wide use of the hashtag #ElectionCircus on X, with some activists at home and abroad calling for a boycott, saying a high turnout would only serve to legitimise the Islamic republic.", "summary": "The vote to pick the next president following the death of Ebrahim Raisi in a helicopter crash is likely heading to a run-off.", "url": "https://www.scmp.com/news/world/middle-east/article/3268565/iran-presidential-election-reformist-pezeshkian-hardliner-jalili-lead-tight-race", "image": "https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/06/29/bab2fd9c-59db-4a15-98c5-78f409d1fa67_bd0f5beb.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 06:48:12", "author": "Reuters", "authors": ["Reuters"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "cn", "sentiment": -0.032}

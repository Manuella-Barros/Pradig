We Now Have the Answer", "text": "The British royal family may be reducing their summer plans ahead of the country's upcoming general election, but Trooping the Colour remains on the calendar. Although the royals postponed many of their public outings in the weeks leading up to the July 4 election, the British Army confirmed on May 28 that the birthday parade for King Charles will be held on June 15, PA Media reports. The public celebration of the monarch's birthday each June \u2014 regardless of when their actual birthday is \u2014 in London sees the ceremonial presentation of the military's regimental flags, called \"colours.\" Members of the royal family take part in the procession, either on horseback or riding in a carriage, before gathering on the Buckingham Palace balcony to watch a fly past by the Royal Air Force. According to the PA report, almost a thousand soldiers and about 240 horses will step for a \"khaki rehearsal\" at Horse Guards Parade in London on May 30. The Brigade Major of the Household Division Lieutenant Colonel James Shaw will oversee the test run before the Major General\u2019s Review on June 1, the Colonel\u2019s Review on June 8 and Trooping the Colour on June 15. The full parade is actually performed three times on consecutive weekends each year, the Household Division said. An army source previously told PEOPLE that \"the purpose of the Colonel's review is to decide that they are ready for the monarch.\" Because only one flag can be trooped at a time, the five regiments of the Foot Guards \u2014 Grenadier, Coldstream, Scots, Irish and Welsh \u2014 rotate annually in leading the charge. Prince William led the rehearsal last year as Colonel of the Welsh Guards, and Princess Kate, 42, is the honorary colonel of the Irish Guards, which are trooping its flag at the parade this year. The update comes after King Charles, 75, and Prince William, 41, canceled public engagements last week after Prime Minister Rishi Sunak announced on May 22 that a general election will be held on July 4. Buckingham Palace said the royals would postpone outings \"which may appear to divert attention or distract from the election campaign.\" Members of the British royal family are constitutionally non-political and traditionally leave the public space during campaigns to keep the public\u2019s attention on the election and the key issues it presents. However, the political campaign doesn\u2019t negate all outings. Over the weekend, Prince William and Prince George attended a soccer championship at Wembley Stadium. Events surrounding the 80th anniversary of the D-Day Landings, including King Charles' first overseas trip since he announced his cancer diagnosis, are expected to go on as scheduled on June 5 and June 6. Other outings are under review and will be assessed on a case-by-case basis. Can't get enough of PEOPLE's Royals coverage?

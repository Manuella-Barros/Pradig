Ilya Samsonov got the start. Martin Jones backed up.\n\n\u00d7\n\nAlready a Subscriber?

Nick Robertson was scratched to make room for Matthews.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nMatthews was the league's most fearsome scorer in the regular season, and dominated Game 2 of the playoffs. But he left in the third period of Game 4, and missed all of Game 5 and Game 6. The team said he had an illness, which had caused him to cause a midseries practice. But it's believed something else happened -- perhaps a hit from Charlie McAvoy in Game 4 -- that caused his absence.\n\nBut as the Leafs prepared for good news on the Matthews front -- he was on the first bus to the game, a tell -- they got the bad news on Woll, who had been stellar in replacing Samsonov and pulling off wins in Game 5 and 6.\n\nWoll missed 35 games in the regular season with a high ankle sprain.\n\nInjuries to key players have plagued the Leafs in the post- season, with William Nylander missing the first three games and Bobby McMann out all series.\n\nMorning skate\n\nBoth Matthews and McMann (lower body) took part in a 15-minute morning skate, with coach Sheldon Keefe playing it coy about Matthews' status.\n\n\"He was out there today, he is progressing,\" Keefe said. \"The last time we were here, he got about 10 minutes on the ice. Today he got about 15. So that's progress.\"\n\nKeefe was asked if it would be possible to activate Matthews, who hasn't played since the second period of Game 4, and keep his shifts limited to the power play.\n\n\"That's hypothetical at this point,\" Keefe said. \"We'll see what the day brings. As of (the morning), we've got all of our forwards that have been playing in the series preparing to play. That includes (Ryan Reaves), (Noah) Gregor. We've got some decisions to make with some other guys.\n\n\"With Auston, obviously if he's available, you're going to use him.

The loser faces locker cleanout day.\n\nWith the stakes so high, neither side wants to give away much.\n\nThe Leafs hid as much as they could. All the forwards wore white jerseys; usually the top two lines wear blue, the bottom two lines wear white. And they didn't practise in lines.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe Bruins were also up to some gamesmanship. They normally skate at Warrior Ice Arena, their practice facility, leaving the Leafs the TD Garden. So the Leafs have typically skated at 11 a.m. for their 8 p.m. starts. This time, the Bruins used the TD Garden ice, as is their right, and they were on the ice at 10:30 a.m. That bumped the Leafs to 11:30.\n\nSmall details, but ones the hierarchies believe in.\n\n\"We wanted to change things up,\" Bruins coach Jim Montgomery said. \"(This is) one of the things we changed.\"\n\nThe Leafs brought McMann to Boston for the first time. Though he's probably not ready for Game 7, it means he's close to returning and a possibility for the second round if they make it.\n\n\"Not available tonight, but he's progressing really well,\" Keefe said. \"Skated hard (Friday). That allowed him to come on the trip and be a part of the group. He's worked hard. He doesn't look too far off.\"\n\nPrior to the skate, the NHL announced Matthews was a finalist for the Lady Byng Trophy as the league's most gentlemanly player.

It was a fast-paced matchup but tight coverage on both sides meant goals weren't easy to come by. For the Maple Leafs, their best players needed to be on top of their game, but as luck would have it, that wasn't the case for Auston Matthews.\n\nWhat Made Matthews Miss Game 5 & 6\n\nAs Auston Matthews revealed talking to the media this morning, the Leafs' sniper felt very sick after Game 2 of the series, but he battled on for Game 3 and he was still trying to recover in Game 4 when he received a \"weird hit\" which caused him to leave the game and to miss Game 5 and Game 6. In Sportsnet's footage from this morning's press conference, the Arizona native explained:\n\nWhat was the illness exactly? When pressed on and asked if it was the flu, Matthews simply answered \"Yeah, something like that.\"\n\nRelated: Matthews Out For Game 6, More Than Illness Going On Here\n\nIt looks like we'll never know what kind of illness was afflicting him, but I think the \"food poisoning\" thesis can be set aside, because if that was the case, he would just have gone ahead and said that.\n\nLosing Matthews Has Surprising Effect\n\nInterestingly, the Maple Leafs won both of the games they had to play without Matthews to tie the series 3-3 and lost Game 7 with him back in the lineup, something tells me this will be part of the narrative this summer. Even before Game 7, consensus of online discussion was that the Maple Leafs were playing better as a team without Matthews than with him.\n\nIs that Matthews' fault? I don't think so, but when he's in the lineup, teammates are tempted to rely on him, and unconsciously think \"Auston will do it.\" When he's not able to play though, they all know they have to step up, so they perform like a real team and not like \"Matthews' team.\"\n\nThis is something that will be addressed internally, like a great many things in Toronto this summer. The market has always been known as a pressure cooker, but with this being the fourth elimination by the Bruins in as many first-round series, the status quo is no longer acceptable. There's got to be a limit to the number of times an organization can say \"We believe in this team and are confident they've got what it takes to win the Stanley Cup.\"\n\nDo not misunderstand me here -- I'm not saying trade Matthews since the team plays like a real team when he's not dressed, but I am saying it's time to dismantle the core. Last offseason, they decided to add grit and physicality by signing Ryan Reaves, but it's not what they need. They need their leaders -- the talented guys who can score -- to be more gritty and physical. Picking up Max Domi was a step in the right direction, but they need more players who can both score and handle the physicality of the playoffs. How are they going to do that? That's a story for another time, but it certainly won't be easy.", "source": {"uri": "thehockeywriters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hockey Writers"}, "authors": [{"uri": "karine_hains@thehockeywriters.com", "name": "Karine Hains", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auston_Matthews", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Auston Matthews"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Maple_Leafs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toronto Maple Leafs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Bruins", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston Bruins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sportsnet", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sportsnet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Reaves", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Reaves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Domi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Max Domi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/Europe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/Europe", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 52}], "image": "https://s3951.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Auston-Matthews-Maple-Leafs-6.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9539996", "eventUri": "eng-9539996", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1529411764705882, "wgt": 203, "relevance": 1}

Woll had started each of the last three games for Toronto.\n\nMatthews sustained an injury at some point during Game 4 while playing through illness, Kaplan added.\n\nThe Athletic's Chris Johnston initially reported that Matthews was \"a good bet to return\" for Saturday contest.\n\nJohnston and Jonas Siegel previously reported for The Athletic that Matthews suffered an injury on a hit in Game 4 while also battling an illness.\n\nThe Leafs have won two straight games without Matthews to extend the series, but the return of the NHL's leading goalscorer could improve Toronto's chances of advancing to the second round.\n\nMatthews previously recorded three points, including the third-period game-winner, in the Maple Leafs' 3-2 Game 2 victory in Boston.\n\nLeafs head coach Sheldon Keefe said after morning practice that Matthews' status was \"undetermined\" for Saturday night's game, per Sportsnet's Luke Fox.\n\nThere are indications the decision as to whether he will play is at least closer than it was in Games 5 and 6. Matthews rejoined his teammates at for a Saturday morning skate for the first time since leaving Game 4, and did not stay late for extra work, per TSN's Mark Masters and The Hockey News' David Alter.\n\nThat skate only lasted 15 minutes, The Athletic's Jonas Siegel noted.\n\nMatthews then arrived with his teammates to the game at TD Garden, per Sportsnet's Elliotte Friedman.\n\nMatthews led the NHL with 69 goals, including a league-best 51 at even strength, in 81 games during the regular season.\n\nHis absence isn't the first time the Leafs have been missing a member of their offensive core during this series. William Nylander missed the first three games of the series, meaning the Leafs have not yet played a full playoff game with all of their stars available this season.\n\nToronto will hope that can change with Matthews' potential return tonight. The Leafs are looking to advance to the next round for the second year in a row after six straight years of disappointing early exits.\n\nThe Bruins will meanwhile need to brace for the potential return of Matthews as they hope to avoid repeating last year's upset by the Florida Panthers.

However, Matthews provided clarity while addressing the media on Monday. He shed light on the mysterious ailments that sidelined him for multiple crucial games.\n\nAccording to NHL reporter Kristen Shilton, Matthews revealed that his ordeal began after Game 2, where he delivered a stellar performance, winning with a breakaway goal.\n\nHowever, shortly after, he fell ill, experiencing symptoms that worsened with exertion. Despite his illness, he took to the ice for Game 3, only to be forced out of Game 4.\n\n\"It was really hard,\" Matthews was quoted saying.\n\nDuring Game 7, Matthews returned to the lineup, albeit noticeably slower, and started on the third line. Nonetheless, he set up William Nylander's crucial go-ahead goal in the third period before the Leafs' ultimate defeat in overtime.\n\nDespite the disappointing end to the season, Matthews' accomplishments stood out. His remarkable 69-goal season broke franchise records and positioned him as a finalist for esteemed trophies such as the Selke and Lady Byng. Additionally, speculation lingered regarding a potential Hart Trophy nomination.\n\nHowever, the Leafs' postseason woes continued, marked by their inability to advance past the first round despite consistent playoff appearances. The defeat to the Bruins marked their fourth Game 7 loss since 2013.\n\nIn the aftermath of the series, questions swirled regarding Matthews' health and its impact on the Leafs' playoff performance. Matthews provided some clarity during the team's locker cleanout day. However, he opted not to delve into specifics about his injury, leaving room for speculation.\n\nToronto Maple Leafs Auston Matthews got nominated for Selke Trophy\n\nToronto Maple Leafs superstar Auston Matthews experienced a bittersweet day.

Matthews vied for the honor alongside Alexander Barkov of the Florida Panthers and Jordan Staal of the Carolina Hurricanes.\n\nThis nomination was more than an achievement for Matthews. He became the first NHL player ever to lead in goals and be nominated for the Selke Award in the same year.\n\nWith the knack of breaking plays, Matthews recorded 93 blocked shots and 85 takeaways and rounded up his performances with 89 hits to contain opponents in different zones. His disciplined play also earned him a nomination for the Lady Byng Trophy for sportsmanship.\n\nMatthews could become the second player for Toronto after Gilmour (1992-93) to win the Selke trophy.

It took until overtime of the final contest of the series, but history repeated itself yet again when the two Original Six rivals met in the Eastern Conference first-round in 2024. And it's Boston moving on to Florida, and Toronto headed for an offseason that could see radical change.\n\nAuston Matthews, who was the game-breaker in Game 2 but missed Games 4-6 due to illness and injury, revealed the extent of his ailments at the team's media availability on Monday.\n\n\"It was tough. I got really, really sick after Game 2, played in Game 3, was still kind of trying to recover going into Game 4. Took a weird hit and couldn't go any longer, and that's as detailed as I'm going to get into it,\" the 69-goal regular-season scorer told reporters, including Sportsnet.\n\n\"It was tough. It was really frustrating, it sucks, and it was killing me to watch. Proud of the guys and how they fought, climbed our way back into the series, I was fortunate to get to play in that Game 7, and just tried to go out there and give it my all, and obviously it's disappointing and frustrating being here today.\"\n\nMatthews stepped up in a huge way in Game 2, scoring the game-winning goal and adding two assists to help Toronto steal back home-ice advantage. But he was a non-factor in Game 3 and only played two periods in Game 4 as Boston opened up a 3-1 lead in the series.\n\nThe Leafs were able to send the series to a Game 7 without the services of their best player, winning Game 5 at TD Garden and Game 6 at Scotiabank Arena -- both by 2-1 scores -- to force a decider in Massachusetts.\n\nMatthews was able to return for the tilt, and things were looking good when he set up William Nylander for the go-ahead goal with just under 11 minutes left in regulation. But the 1-0 lead wouldn't last two minutes before Hampus Lindholm tied things up.\n\nAnd after David Pastrnak's overtime heartbreaker just moments into the extra frame, it's back to the drawing board -- and the beginning of another long summer in Leafland.\n\nAnother long offseason for Auston Matthews, Maple Leafs\n\nBesides beating the Tampa Bay Lightning in six games in the first-round of 2023, the Leafs haven't won another playoff series since 2004. And they've lost six straight series-deciding games, proving that the core is just unable to get the job done in the critical moments.\n\nIt's still nowhere near a Stanley Cup for this franchise, and you've got to think the roster -- or the front office -- are going to look at least a little bit different come training camp.\n\n\"[We lost] Game 7 in OT. I was out for games. Matty was out for games,\" Nylander told reporters on Monday. \"We battled to get back in the series and I think that's huge to have in a group, regardless of who is playing.

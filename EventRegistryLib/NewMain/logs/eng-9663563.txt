Korda said ahead of the Meijer event that the fight she displayed thereafter - even though she didn't make the cut - made her more proud than any of her wins in '24.\n\nGiven all she has accomplished, and coming off her two worst results of the season, the spotlight will be bright this week.

Even for Korda, who has won six times this year, including the first major championship of the year at the Chevron, it's just one of those lulls that happens.\n\nBut that's the thing about golf -- there's always another tournament. This week, the best female players in the world are in Sammamish, Washington, for the 2024 KPMG Women's PGA Championship, the third major of the year. And Sahalee Country Club, which hosted the 2016 KPMG Women's PGA, is where Korda is looking to get back on track.\n\n\"I'm going to go through these situations so many times where I feel like I'm playing really well and I'll go through a little lull where golf is the hardest thing in my life right now,\" Korda said Tuesday during her pre-tournament press conference. \"So that's I feel like what grows myself as a person and what makes me appreciate the sport so much and makes me appreciate the wins and the highs and good shots, the crowds out there as well.\"\n\nKPMG: How to watch\n\nTwo months ago, Korda looked invincible. She had won five straight starts and seemed a lock to win any time she teed it up. Then she had six wins in seven starts heading into the U.S. Women's Open, where a 10 on the par-3 12th squashed any hopes she had of victory.\n\nLast week, Korda surprisingly missed the cut, though there were some positives in Michigan, like a strong second round even with the missed cut. But she isn't going to dwell on what she called poor course management, something she will have to do well at Sahalee.\n\n\"It's just about playing the golf course,\" Korda said. \"You can write as many things into your yardage book and you can pick a game plan that you want to execute, but typically it doesn't happen that way and you just got to adapt. Everything is about adapting, and that's why I like to go out and just play the golf course and see the game that I have that day and try to adapt.\"\n\nKorda said Sahalee is different from other venues the LPGA has played at in Oregon or even Vancouver, Canada. But Korda plans to be aggressive off the tee, using driver every place she can, even on the narrow layout.\n\nHer stellar spring has made Korda's summer schedule a bit busier, too. Last week, she was confirmed as the first American on the Solheim Cup team, set for September at Robert Trent Jones Golf Club in Virginia. But before that, she'll also rep the red, white and blue in the Olympics, where in 2021 she won the gold medal in Tokyo.\n\nThis time, she'll be defending her title in Paris at Le Golf National, site of the 2018 Ryder Cup.\n\n\"I have never been to Paris, and the one thing I'm really looking forward to is the croissants probably on every corner,\" Korda said. \"I love bakeries and baked goods, so that's one thing I'm really looking forward to. And obviously representing my country and getting to compete in the Olympics is such an incredible opportunity.\n\n\"I'm just super excited to get there and even just to play that golf course. I got to watch it in Ryder Cup. To be able to play such amazing golf courses like we do nowadays will be such a treat.\"\n\nBut before the Olympics, there are three major championships to be played, including this week at Sahalee for the KPMG Women's PGA. It's the major Korda got her first title at.\n\nAlthough she comes in off two missed cuts, the pressure may not be as high as it was, but the drive to win remains.\n\n\"I feel like pressure is privilege, and that's something that you're the only one that can kind of control that,\" Korda said. \"You can listen to the outside voices, but at the end of the day, when you have pressure you can take it in a positive way that you are doing good and playing well. But, yeah, I'm just going to stay in my bubble this week and go out and try to execute my shots, be confident in what I have.\"", "source": {"uri": "golfweek.usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Golfweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "cameron_jourdan@golfweek.usatoday.com", "name": "Cameron Jourdan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Women's_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Women's Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sahalee_Country_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sahalee Country Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KPMG", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "KPMG"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meijer_LPGA_Classic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Meijer LPGA Classic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_PGA_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Women's PGA Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelly_Korda", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nelly Korda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_major_golf_championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Women's major golf championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sammamish,_Washington", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sammamish, Washington"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sammamish, Washington"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LPGA", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "LPGA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancouver", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vancouver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Vancouver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oregon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oregon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Golf_National", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Le Golf National"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Trent_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Robert Trent Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solheim_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Solheim Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryder_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ryder Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Instruction", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Women", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Women", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Community_and_Clubs", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Community and Clubs", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://golfweek.usatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/87/2024/06/2157597723.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663563", "eventUri": "eng-9663563", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3333333333333333, "wgt": 224, "relevance": 1}

(AP) -- Inside her yardage book, Nelly Korda keeps the markings simple. The No. 1 player in the world denotes the spots she needs to avoid hitting by writing X's.\n\nAt Sahalee Country Club, with Douglas fir, red cedar and hemlock trees framing every fairway and making each look like a hallway, there are likely to be a substantial amount of those X marks outside the short grass.\n\n\"I think every hole looks a little different. They're all intimidating and great in their own way,\" Korda said.\n\nKorda is again the headliner this week as the KPMG Women's PGA Championship tees off Thursday at Sahalee, the third major of the year on the LPGA Tour.\n\nBut she arrived in the Seattle area in a different place with her game than just a few weeks ago, when she showed up at the U.S. Women's Open having won six of her previous seven starts, including a major at the Chevron Championship. At the time, no player in the world was on more of a roll than Korda and adding another major seemed probable, if not likely.\n\nThat didn't happen. Korda missed the cut at Lancaster Country Club after an opening-round 80 that included a 10 on her third hole and watched as Yuka Saso went on to win the championship for a second time. When she returned last week at the Meijer LPGA Classic, Korda struggled to an opening-round 76 before shooting 67 in the second round, but missed out on playing the weekend by one shot.\n\n\"I'm just going to stay in my bubble this week and go out and try to execute my shots, be confident in what I have,\" Korda said. \"This golf course is already hard enough and if I'm going to put more pressure on myself, then I think it's just going to make it even harder this week.\"\n\nSahalee is the first course to host the tournament twice since the partnership between the PGA of America and LPGA began a decade ago and boosted the prominence and purse for this major championship. This year's tournament has a record purse of $10.4 million.\n\nThe course measures just over 6,700 yards and water comes into play on only a handful of holes. It'll play to a par 72, one stroke higher than 2016 as the 18th has been converted to a par 5. Players have noted the greens seem softer than 2016, although temperatures are supposed to push into the 80s for the first two rounds and dry out the putting surfaces.\n\nBut the favorite word for the week to describe the course seems to be \"intimidating,\" because of the tree-lined tunnels from which shots will emerge.\n\n\"It's really tight for the tee shot. It's I think a classic ball-striking course,\" said defending champ Ruoning Yin, who won last year at Baltusrol.\n\nOne player who proved she can maneuver successfully through the trees is Brooke Henderson, who won the first of her two career majors in 2016 at Sahalee, beating Lydia Ko in a playoff.\n\nAt 18, Henderson was the youngest winner in the history of the event. She shot 65 in the final round to get into the playoff and birdied the first extra hole with a 7-iron from 155 yards to a couple of feet. The course unveiled a plaque this week from the location on the 18th fairway where Henderson hit that shot.\n\nThe memories are still fresh and came flooding back as Henderson, now 26 and 13th in the world ranking, made her way around the course.\n\n\"I love the huge towering trees and the tight fairways. It's almost majestic. Feels very peaceful and amazing,\" Henderson said.\n\nAt the same time, she was reminded of how claustrophobic Sahalee can feel and the importance of simply hitting the ball straight. Do that, and the place can feel downright serene.\n\n\"Every tee shot you have to really pay attention. Can never really take a break out here. Even the approach shots you got to know where the slopes are and where your misses are,\" Henderson said. \"But at the same time, if you're playing well and you can kind of lean into the beauty that surrounds you and soak it in, it makes for a really nice walk around this place.\"\n\n___\n\nAP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sahalee_Country_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sahalee Country Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelly_Korda", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nelly Korda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_Golfers'_Association_of_America", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Professional Golfers' Association of America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Women's_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Women's Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_PGA_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Women's PGA Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thuja_plicata", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thuja plicata"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_fir", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Douglas fir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LPGA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "LPGA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sammamish,_Washington", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sammamish, Washington"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sammamish, Washington"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevron_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chevron Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lancaster_Country_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lancaster Country Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuka_Saso", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yuka Saso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meijer_LPGA_Classic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Meijer LPGA Classic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_major_golf_championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Women's major golf championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooke_Henderson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brooke Henderson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltusrol_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baltusrol Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_World_Golf_Ranking", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Official World Golf Ranking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lydia_Ko", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lydia Ko"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Courses", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Courses", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Golo_Golf", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Golo Golf", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Customer_Service/Conferences", "label": "dmoz/Business/Customer Service/Conferences", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/JRFv_yOHKLgMXwCTM5RwPg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/aol_associated_press_484/25d82696a517b7f99ec4cc7a92216f45", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663563", "eventUri": "eng-9663563", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2020-06-", "textStart": 111, "textEnd": 118}], "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 223, "relevance": 1}

Yes, the tee shots are pretty intimidating, but the greens, the second shot in is pretty tough as well.\n\n\"So overall, I mean, if you have the length you may as well -- you have to hit it. This is the type of golf course where you just got to sack up and hit your driver.\"\n\nThe course is a \"completely different\" test in Korda's eyes than Lancaster Country Club in Pennsylvania, host of last month's U.S. Women's Open. While the turf at Lancaster was undulated, she found the tee shots less intimidating than Sahalee's.\n\n\"If you hit it a little off line here off the tee, you have a bunch of trees in your way so you're pitching out the majority of the time,\" she said. \"... I'm just trying to make a game plan for this week, and every week is just a refresh.\"\n\nKorda hopes that refresh will lead to improved results after surprise dip in her form. She won five straight LPGA starts and six of seven earlier this season, a run rivaling that of men's World No. 1 Scottie Scheffler.\n\nThen came a shocking 10-over 80 in the first round of the U.S. Women's Open, where she was done in by a septuple-bogey 10 on a par-3 hole. After that cut, she couldn't recover from an opening 76 at last week's Meijer LPGA Classic and missed her second straight weekend.\n\nKorda insisted she isn't dwelling on the negatives.\n\n\"I did have a good round on Friday and I drove it really well, so trying to take the positives from that,\" she said.\n\n\"But that's golf. I mean, I'm going to go through these situations so many times where I feel like I'm playing really well and I'll go through a little lull where golf is the hardest thing in my life right now.

Henderson, of Canada, putts on the green on the 18th hole during a practice round for the Womens PGA Championship golf tournament at Sahalee Country Club, Wednesday, June 19, 2024, in Sammamish, Wash.\n\nSAMMAMISH, Wash. (AP) -- Inside her yardage book, Nelly Korda keeps the markings simple. The No. 1 player in the world denotes the spots she needs to avoid hitting by writing X's.\n\nAt Sahalee Country Club, with Douglas fir, red cedar and hemlock trees framing every fairway and making each look like a hallway, there are likely to be a substantial amount of those X marks outside the short grass.\n\n\"I think every hole looks a little different. They're all intimidating and great in their own way,\" Korda said.\n\nKorda is again the headliner this week as the KPMG Women's PGA Championship tees off Thursday at Sahalee, the third major of the year on the LPGA Tour.\n\nBut she arrived in the Seattle area in a different place with her game than just a few weeks ago, when she showed up at the U.S. Women's Open having won six of her previous seven starts, including a major at the Chevron Championship. At the time, no player in the world was on more of a roll than Korda and adding another major seemed probable, if not likely.\n\nThat didn't happen. Korda missed the cut at Lancaster Country Club after an opening-round 80 that included a 10 on her third hole and watched as Yuka Saso went on to win the championship for a second time. When she returned last week at the Meijer LPGA Classic, Korda struggled to an opening-round 76 before shooting 67 in the second round, but missed out on playing the weekend by one shot.\n\n\"I'm just going to stay in my bubble this week and go out and try to execute my shots, be confident in what I have,\" Korda said. \"This golf course is already hard enough and if I'm going to put more pressure on myself, then I think it's just going to make it even harder this week.\"\n\nSahalee is the first course to host the tournament twice since the partnership between the PGA of America and LPGA began a decade ago and boosted the prominence and purse for this major championship. This year's tournament has a record purse of $10.4 million.\n\nThe course measures just over 6,700 yards and water comes into play on only a handful of holes. It'll play to a par 72, one stroke higher than 2016 as the 18th has been converted to a par 5. Players have noted the greens seem softer than 2016, although temperatures are supposed to push into the 80s for the first two rounds and dry out the putting surfaces.\n\nBut the favorite word for the week to describe the course seems to be \"intimidating,\" because of the tree-lined tunnels from which shots will emerge.\n\n\"It's really tight for the tee shot. It's I think a classic ball-striking course,\" said defending champ Ruoning Yin, who won last year at Baltusrol.\n\nOne player who proved she can maneuver successfully through the trees is Brooke Henderson, who won the first of her two career majors in 2016 at Sahalee, beating Lydia Ko in a playoff.\n\nAt 18, Henderson was the youngest winner in the history of the event. She shot 65 in the final round to get into the playoff and birdied the first extra hole with a 7-iron from 155 yards to a couple of feet. The course unveiled a plaque this week from the location on the 18th fairway where Henderson hit that shot.\n\nThe memories are still fresh and came flooding back as Henderson, now 26 and 13th in the world ranking, made her way around the course.\n\n\"I love the huge towering trees and the tight fairways. It's almost majestic. Feels very peaceful and amazing,\" Henderson said.\n\nAt the same time, she was reminded of how claustrophobic Sahalee can feel and the importance of simply hitting the ball straight. Do that, and the place can feel downright serene.\n\n\"Every tee shot you have to really pay attention. Can never really take a break out here. Even the approach shots you got to know where the slopes are and where your misses are,\" Henderson said. \"But at the same time, if you're playing well and you can kind of lean into the beauty that surrounds you and soak it in, it makes for a really nice walk around this place.\"\n\nAP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf", "source": {"uri": "eagletribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

The No. 1 player in the world denotes the spots she needs to avoid hitting by writing X's.\n\nAt Sahalee Country Club, with Douglas fir, red cedar and hemlock trees framing every fairway and making each look like a hallway, there are likely to be a substantial amount of those X marks outside the short grass.\n\n\"I think every hole looks a little different. They're all intimidating and great in their own way,\" Korda said.\n\nKorda is again the headliner this week as the KPMG Women's PGA Championship tees off Thursday at Sahalee, the third major of the year on the LPGA Tour.\n\nBut she arrived in the Seattle area in a different place with her game than just a few weeks ago, when she showed up at the U.S. Women's Open having won six of her previous seven starts, including a major at the Chevron Championship. At the time, no player in the world was on more of a roll than Korda and adding another major seemed probable, if not likely.\n\nThat didn't happen. Korda missed the cut at Lancaster Country Club after an opening-round 80 that included a 10 on her third hole and watched as Yuka Saso went on to win the championship for a second time. When she returned last week at the Meijer LPGA Classic, Korda struggled to an opening-round 76 before shooting 67 in the second round, but missed out on playing the weekend by one shot.\n\n\"I'm just going to stay in my bubble this week and go out and try to execute my shots, be confident in what I have,\" Korda said. \"This golf course is already hard enough and if I'm going to put more pressure on myself, then I think it's just going to make it even harder this week.\"\n\nSahalee is the first course to host the tournament twice since the partnership between the PGA of America and LPGA began a decade ago and boosted the prominence and purse for this major championship. This year's tournament has a record purse of $10.4 million.\n\nThe course measures just over 6,700 yards and water comes into play on only a handful of holes. It'll play to a par 72, one stroke higher than 2016 as the 18th has been converted to a par 5. Players have noted the greens seem softer than 2016, although temperatures are supposed to push into the 80s for the first two rounds and dry out the putting surfaces.\n\nBut the favorite word for the week to describe the course seems to be \"intimidating,\" because of the tree-lined tunnels from which shots will emerge.\n\n\"It's really tight for the tee shot. It's I think a classic ball-striking course,\" said defending champ Ruoning Yin, who won last year at Baltusrol.\n\nOne player who proved she can maneuver successfully through the trees is Brooke Henderson, who won the first of her two career majors in 2016 at Sahalee, beating Lydia Ko in a playoff.\n\nAt 18, Henderson was the youngest winner in the history of the event. She shot 65 in the final round to get into the playoff and birdied the first extra hole with a 7-iron from 155 yards to a couple of feet. The course unveiled a plaque this week from the location on the 18th fairway where Henderson hit that shot.\n\nThe memories are still fresh and came flooding back as Henderson, now 26 and 13th in the world ranking, made her way around the course.\n\n\"I love the huge towering trees and the tight fairways. It's almost majestic. Feels very peaceful and amazing,\" Henderson said.\n\nAt the same time, she was reminded of how claustrophobic Sahalee can feel and the importance of simply hitting the ball straight. Do that, and the place can feel downright serene.\n\n\"Every tee shot you have to really pay attention. Can never really take a break out here.

I'm going to go through these situations so many times where I feel like I'm playing really well; and I'll go through a little lull where golf is the hardest thing in my life right now.\n\n\"I feel like that's what grows myself as a person and what makes me appreciate the sport so much and makes me appreciate the wins and the highs and good shots.\"\n\nWhile accuracy off the tee at Sahalee is critical, Korda says she has no plans to rein in her signature, big-hitting style as she tackles the demanding 6,731-yard, par-72 layout.\n\n\"Still going to be aggressive,\" she said. \"There's a couple holes where I can't hit driver, but majority of the round I will be hitting driver just because you don't want a longer club into these greens.\n\n\"If you have the length you may as well -- you have to hit it. This is the type of golf course where you just got to sack up and hit your driver.\"\n\nKorda is also not prone to \"analysis-paralysis\" as she plots her way around this week's championship course. Instead she intends to play it as she sees it.\n\n\"You can write as many things into your yardage book and you can pick a game plan that you want to execute, but typically it doesn't happen that way and you just got to adapt,\" she said.\n\n\"Everything is about adapting, and that's why I like to go out and just play the golf course and see the game that I have that day.\"\n\nKorda, who won her first major at the 2021 Women's PGA Championship, admits she also has one eye on the defence of her Olympic gold medal at the Paris games next month.\n\n\"I have never been to Paris, and the one thing I'm really looking forward to is the croissants probably on every corner,\" Korda said.", "source": {"uri": "france24.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "France 24"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_PGA_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Women's PGA Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Women's_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Women's Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sahalee_Country_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sahalee Country Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelly_Korda", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nelly Korda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LPGA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "LPGA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Northwest", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pacific Northwest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agence_France-Presse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Agence France-Presse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sammamish,_Washington", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sammamish, Washington"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sammamish, Washington"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Women's_PGA_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2021 Women's PGA Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Courses", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Courses", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Women", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Women", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://s.france24.com/media/display/699841e4-2dd7-11ef-ba3f-005056bf30b7/Part-GTY-2158156466-1-1-0.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663563", "eventUri": "eng-9663563", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 215, "relevance": 1}

Inside her yardage book, Nelly Korda keeps the markings simple. The No. 1 player in the world denotes the spots she needs to avoid hitting by writing X's.\n\nSammamish, Washington (USA), Jun 20 (AP) Inside her yardage book, Nelly Korda keeps the markings simple. The No. 1 player in the world denotes the spots she needs to avoid hitting by writing X's.\n\nAt Sahalee Country Club, with Douglas fir, red cedar and hemlock trees framing every fairway and making each look like a hallway, there are likely to be a substantial amount of those X marks outside the short grass.\n\nAlso Read | India vs Afghanistan Live Score Updates of ICC T20 World Cup 2024 Super 8: Rohit Sharma Wins Toss, Opts to Bat.\n\n\"I think every hole looks a little different. They're all intimidating and great in their own way,\" Korda said.\n\nKorda is again the headliner this week as the KPMG Women's PGA Championship tees off Thursday at Sahalee, the third major of the year on the LPGA Tour.\n\nAlso Read | Argentina vs Canada, Copa America 2024 Live Streaming and Match Time in IST: How to Watch Free Live Telecast of ARG vs CAN on TV and Online Stream Details of Football Match in India.\n\nBut, she arrived in the Seattle area in a different place with her game than just a few weeks ago, when she showed up at the US Women's Open having won six of her previous seven starts, including a major at the Chevron Championship. At the time, no player in the world was on more of a roll than Korda and adding another major seemed probable, if not likely.\n\nThat didn't happen. Korda missed the cut at Lancaster Country Club after an opening-round 80 that included a 10 on her third hole and watched as Yuka Saso went on to win the championship for a second time.\n\nWhen she returned last week at the Meijer LPGA Classic, Korda struggled to an opening-round 76 before shooting 67 in the second round but missed out on playing the weekend by a shot.\n\n\"I'm just going to stay in my bubble this week and go out and try to execute my shots, be confident in what I have,\" Korda said.\n\n\"This golf course is already hard enough and if I'm going to put more pressure on myself, then I think it's just going to make it even harder this week.\"\n\nSahalee is the first course to host the tournament twice since the partnership between the PGA of America and LPGA began a decade ago and boosted the prominence and purse for this major championship. This year's tournament has a record purse of USD 10.4 million.\n\nThe course measures just over 6,700 yards and water comes into play on only a handful of holes. It'll play to a par 72, one stroke higher than in 2016 as the 18th has been converted to a par 5. Players have noted the greens seem softer than in 2016, although temperatures are supposed to push into the 80s for the first two rounds and dry out the putting surfaces.\n\nBut, the favourite word for the week to describe the course seems to be \"intimidating,\" because of the tree-lined tunnels from which shots will emerge.\n\n\"It's really tight for the tee shot. It's I think a classic ball-striking course,\" said defending champ Ruoning Yin, who won last year at Baltusrol.\n\nA player who proved she can manoeuvre successfully through the trees is Brooke Henderson, who won the first of her two career majors in 2016 at Sahalee, beating Lydia Ko in a playoff.\n\nAt 18, Henderson was the youngest winner in the event's history. She shot 65 in the final round to get into the playoff and birdied the first extra hole with a 7-iron from 155 yards to a couple of feet. This week, the course unveiled a plaque from the location on the 18th fairway where Henderson hit that shot.\n\nThe memories are fresh and came flooding back as Henderson, now 26 and 13th in the world ranking, made her way around the course.\n\n\"I love the huge towering trees and the tight fairways. It's almost majestic. Feels very peaceful and amazing,\" Henderson said.\n\nAt the same time, she was reminded of how claustrophobic Sahalee can feel and the importance of simply hitting the ball straight. Do that, and the place can feel downright serene.\n\n\"Every tee shot you have to really pay attention. Can never really take a break out here. Even the approach shots you got to know where the slopes are and where your misses are,\" Henderson said.\n\n\"But, at the same time, if you're playing well and you can kind of lean into the beauty that surrounds you and soak it in, it makes for a really nice walk around this place.\" (AP)", "source": {"uri": "latestly.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "LatestLY"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Yes, the tee shots are pretty intimidating, but the greens, the second shot in is pretty tough as well.\n\n\"So overall, I mean, if you have the length you may as well -- you have to hit it. This is the type of golf course where you just got to sack up and hit your driver.\"\n\nThe course is a \"completely different\" test in Korda's eyes than Lancaster Country Club in Pennsylvania, host of last month's U.S. Women's Open. While the turf at Lancaster was undulated, she found the tee shots less intimidating than Sahalee's.\n\n\"If you hit it a little off line here off the tee, you have a bunch of trees in your way so you're pitching out the majority of the time,\" she said. \"... I'm just trying to make a game plan for this week, and every week is just a refresh.\"\n\nKorda hopes that refresh will lead to improved results after surprise dip in her form. She won five straight LPGA starts and six of seven earlier this season, a run rivaling that of men's World No. 1 Scottie Scheffler.\n\nThen came a shocking 10-over 80 in the first round of the U.S. Women's Open, where she was done in by a septuple-bogey 10 on a par-3 hole. After that cut, she couldn't recover from an opening 76 at last week's Meijer LPGA Classic and missed her second straight weekend.\n\nKorda insisted she isn't dwelling on the negatives.\n\n\"I did have a good round on Friday and I drove it really well, so trying to take the positives from that,\" she said.\n\n\"But that's golf. I mean, I'm going to go through these situations so many times where I feel like I'm playing really well and I'll go through a little lull where golf is the hardest thing in my life right now.

The surge has planted Korda firmly at the top of the Rolex Rankings as the best golfer in the world.\n\nEven coming off a pair of missed cuts at the U.S. Women's Open and Meijer LPGA Classic, Korda is one of the favorites to watch this week at Sahalee.\n\n\"I'm just going to stay in my bubble this week and go out and try to execute my shots, be confident in what I have,\" Korda said on Tuesday. \"This golf course is already hard enough, and if I'm going to put more pressure on myself, then I think it's just going to make it even harder this week.\"\n\nKorda has been widely regarded as one of the best in the women's game for several years. However, her ascendance to the top of the game with six victories already this season hadn't seemed imminent entering the year. Korda didn't win once on the LPGA Tour last season, though she did have ten top 10 finishes and five top 5 finishes.\n\nA solo second place at the HSBC Women's World Championship, and a solo third place at the Chevron Championship were her best finishes of the year as she couldn't find the winner's circle.\n\nBut it was immediately clear that 2024 was going to be different. She won her second start of the year in the LPGA's Drive-On Championship in January. After skipping the tour's asian swing through February and early March, she won again in her next start in the FIR HILLS SERI PAK Championship.\n\nShe followed that with wins in the Ford Championship and LPGA Match Play the next two weeks leading into the first major of the year: the Chevron Championship at The Club at Carlton Woods.\n\nKorda bounced back from two bogeys on the final nine of the tournament and delivered a birdie on the 18th hole to defeat Maja Stark by two shots to claim her second major crown.\n\nScottie Scheffler on the PGA Tour is the only other golfer in the world currently playing at such a high level.\n\n\"It's harder than ever to win. That's what makes Nelly's run so much more impressive,\" former No. 1 player Stacy Lewis said.\n\nIt is Korda's first time on the grounds at Sahalee Country Club. Korda didn't play in the 2016 event as she had just turned professional and was playing on the developmental Symetra Tour. However, Nelly's older sister, Jessica, did play in the event, missing the cut by a shot. Jessica isn't playing this year while on maternity leave, but did give some advice to her sister about the course.\n\n\"She just told me you really have to hit your shots out here, especially your tee shots,\" Korda said. \"It's just a really beautiful golf course as well. You kind of get lost in the nature out here.\"\n\nHowever, Korda is a past champion of this event, winning the 2021 edition at the Atlanta Athletic Club for her first major triumph.\n\nSahalee presents a far different test than Atlanta Athletic Club or the Club at Carlton Woods. It's tightly-lined fairways make driving accuracy a premium. But players also can't afford to hit less than driver often due to the course's length and the need to hit shorter clubs into Sahalee's challenging greens.\n\n\"Still going to be aggressive,\" Korda said. \"There's a couple holes where I can't hit driver, but majority of the round I will be hitting driver just because you don't want a longer club into these greens. Yes, the tee shots are pretty intimidating, but the greens, the second shot in is pretty tough as well.\n\n\"So overall, I mean, if you have the length you may as well -- you have to hit it. This is the type of golf course where you just got to sack up and hit your driver.\"\n\nKorda's comes into the championship off a pair of missed cuts, but that doesn't mean she's playing poor golf. Korda made a stunning 10 on the par 3 12th hole at Lancaster Country Club in the first round of the U.S. Women's Open last month that essentially ended her event on the third hole of the championship. Korda hit three balls into the water after missing the green to a treacherous front hole location.\n\nThen last week at the Meijer LPGA Classic, Korda had a bad first day with a 4-over par 76 that took her out of contention early. Korda answered back with a 5-under par 65, which missed the cut by a shot.\n\n\"I did hit it really actually good on Thursday afternoon,\" Korda said. \"I just -- my course management wasn't very good,\" Korda said. \"I was flying my pins and leaving myself in really tough spots, and on kind of bumpy poa greens in the afternoon it's hard to be aggressive with your putting and to kind of gain confidence from that.\n\n\"And then I did have a good round on Friday and I drove it really well, so trying to take the positives from that.\"\n\nWith Korda's success comes massive expectations. She's already accomplished incredible feats this season. She became just the third player in LPGA history to win five straight starts, joining Nancy Lopez and Annika Sorenstam. Korda also became just the 20th different player to win at least six events in a single season, and her year isn't over yet. Only 13 players have won at least seven times, nine players have won eight times, and six players have won at least nine events in a single year: Mickey Wright, Sorenstam, Betsy Rawls, Carol Mann, Kathy Whitworth, and Lopez.\n\nIf Korda were to add a third major title, she would become one of just 30 players in the history of the LPGA Tour to have at least three major championships.\n\n\"I feel like pressure is privilege, and that's something that you're the only one that can kind of control that,\" Korda said. \"You can listen to the outside voices, but at the end of the day, when you have pressure you can take it in a positive way that you are doing good and playing well.\"", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

While the turf at Lancaster was undulated, she found the tee shots less intimidating than Sahalee's.\n\n\"If you hit it a little off line here off the tee, you have a bunch of trees in your way so you're pitching out the majority of the time,\" she said.\n\n\"... I'm just trying to make a game plan for this week, and every week is just a refresh.\"\n\nKorda hopes that refresh will lead to improved results after surprise dip in her form. She won five straight LPGA starts and six of seven earlier this season, a run rivalling that of men's world No.1 Scottie Scheffler.\n\nThen came a shocking 10-over 80 in the first round of the US Women's Open. After that cut, she couldn't recover from an opening 76 at last week's Meijer Classic and missed her second straight weekend.\n\n\"I did have a good round on Friday and I drove it really well, so trying to take the positives from that,\" she said, not dwelling on the negatives.\n\n\"But that's golf. I mean, I'm going to go through these situations so many times where I feel like I'm playing really well and I'll go through a little lull where golf is the hardest thing in my life right now.

I'm going to go through these situations so many times where I feel like I'm playing really well; and then I'll go through a little lull where golf is the hardest thing in my life right now.\n\n\"I feel like that's what grows myself as a person and what makes me appreciate the sport so much and makes me appreciate the wins and the highs and good shots.\"\n\nThe two-time Major winner will indeed need to put behind the horror she experienced at the US Women's Open as soon as possible if she were to move on and get back to winning ways.\n\nKorda carded a shocking 10-over 80 in the first round of the Major, where she was done in by a septuple-bogey 10 on a par-three hole. After that cut, she also could not recover from an opening 76 at last week's Meijer Classic and missed her second straight weekend\n\nWhat she needs to do now is just to focus on the present and not the past, and she has prepared well for this week.\n\nWhile accuracy off the tee at Sahalee is critical, Korda says she has no plans to rein in her signature, big-hitting style as she tackles the demanding 6,731-yard, par-72 layout.\n\n\"Still going to be aggressive,\" she insisted. \"There's a couple holes where I can't hit driver, but majority of the round I will be hitting driver just because you don't want a longer club into these greens.\n\n\"If you have the length you may as well - you have to hit it. This is the type of golf course where you just got to sack up and hit your driver.\"\n\nKorda is also not prone to \"analysis paralysis\" - in other words overthinking a problem - as she plots her way around this week's championship course. Instead, she intends to play it as she sees it.\n\n\"You can write as many things into your yardage book and you can pick a game plan that you want to execute, but typically it doesn't happen that way and you just got to adapt,\" she explained.\n\n\"Everything is about adapting, that's why I like to go out and just play the course and see the game I have that day.\"\n\nKorda, who won her first Major at the 2021 Women's PGA Championship and her second at this season's Chevron Championship, admits she also has one eye on the defence of her Olympic gold medal at the Paris Games in July.\n\n\"I have never been to Paris, and the one thing that I'm really looking forward to is the croissants probably on every corner,\" she said.

Can Vu win again? What to watch at the KPMG Women's PGA Championship", "body": "Senior college football writer Author of seven books on college football Graduate of the University of Georgia\n\nThe stars are aligning on the LPGA Tour, as two-time major championship winner Lilia Vu captured last week's Meijer LPGA Classic in her first start back after missing 11 weeks with a back injury.\n\nWorld No. 1 golfer Nelly Korda and Vu will be back on the course together again at this week's KPMG Women's PGA Championship, the third major of the season, which tees off Thursday at Sahalee Country Club in Sammamish, Washington.\n\nVu, who was named LPGA Player of the Year after winning four times last season, including two majors at the Chevron Championship and AIG Women's Open, has her sights set on returning to No. 1 in the Rolex Women's World Golf Rankings. Of course, that spot belongs to Korda, who has already won six times on tour this season, including the first major at the Chevron Championship in The Woodlands, Texas, on April 21.\n\nKorda won six times in seven starts -- and an LPGA record-tying five times in a row -- before cooling off in her past two starts with missed cuts at the U.S. Women's Open and the Meijer LPGA Classic. She's looking to bounce back after those two disappointments.\n\n\"I'm going to go through these situations so many times where I feel like I'm playing really well, and I'll go through a little lull where golf is the hardest thing in my life right now,\" Korda said Tuesday during a news conference at the Women's PGA Championship.\n\n\"So that's I feel like what grows myself as a person and what makes me appreciate the sport so much and makes me appreciate the wins and the highs and good shots, the crowds out there as well.\"\n\nKorda, 25, was asked Tuesday whether she'd watched tennis star Roger Federer's commencement speech at Dartmouth College on June 9. The 20-time Grand Slam champion noted that while he won 80% of his matches in his career, he won only 54% of the points he played.\n\n\"That's the same thing with golf,\" Korda said. \"They get second serves. If we mess up and make a big number on a hole, it's a little bit more penalizing than if they double fault, let's say, depending on where they are in the match. It's true. You're going to fail more than you win, and I think that's what fuels a player as well more in sports.\"\n\nKorda can relate. On May 30, she carded a 10 on the par-3 12th hole in the first round of the U.S. Women's Open at Lancaster Country Club in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. She posted 80-70 and missed the cut by 2 strokes at 10-over 150.\n\nLast week, she started with double bogey-bogey-bogey en route to a 4-over 76 in windy conditions in the first round of the Meijer LPGA Classic at Blythefield Country Club in Grand Rapids, Michigan. She bounced back with a 5-under 67 in the second round but missed the cut by one.\n\nLike Federer on the tennis courts, there's an expectation that Korda will win each time she tees it up in a tournament.\n\n\"I feel like pressure is [a] privilege, and that's something that you're the only one that can kind of control that,\" Korda said. \"You can listen to the outside voices, but at the end of the day, when you have pressure you can take it in a positive way that you are doing good and playing well. But, yeah, I'm just going to stay in my bubble this week and go out and try to execute my shots, be confident in what I have.\"\n\nKorda and Vu will also compete in the upcoming Olympic women's golf tournament, scheduled for Aug. 7-10 at Le Golf National outside Paris. They rank Nos. 1 and 2 in the women's Olympic Golf Rankings and will make the 60-woman field.\n\n\"I have never been to Paris, and the one thing I'm really looking forward to is the croissants probably on every corner,\" Korda said. \"I love bakeries and baked goods, so that's one thing I'm really looking forward to. And obviously representing my country and getting to compete in the Olympics is such an incredible opportunity.\n\n\"I'm just super excited to get there and even just to play that golf course. I got to watch it in [the 2018] Ryder Cup. To be able to play such amazing golf courses like we do nowadays will be such a treat.\"\n\nA country can have up to four players in the field if they're ranked in the top 15 of the Rolex Women's World Golf Rankings. Along with Korda and Vu, Rose Zhang is No. 9 and will probably make the team, while Megan Khang (No. 16), Alison Lee (No. 18), Ally Ewing (No. 19) and Allisen Corpuz (No. 23) have work to do this week.\n\nThe Olympics field will be finalized after Sunday's final round at Sahalee Country Club.\n\nKorda has already clinched a spot on the U.S. team for the Solheim Cup, which will be played Sept. 13-15 at Robert Trent Jones Golf Club in Gainesville, Virginia. It will be her fourth Solheim Cup appearance.\n\nVu is second in Solheim Cup points -- 911\u00bd behind Korda -- and is all but a lock to make the squad. The top seven golfers on the points list when the qualifying period ends after the AIG Women's British Open at St. Andrews in Scotland on Aug. 22-25 will automatically qualify for the U.S. team. The next two highest players in the world rankings will also make the team, and Stacy Lewis will make three captain's picks.\n\nLewis is happy Vu, a Solheim Cup rookie at last year's event in Andalusia, Spain, is healthy again.\n\n\"The most impressive [thing] was the amount of time that she took off and then just comes back and wins,\" Lewis said. \"That is really hard to do, because [when] you come back, your short game might be rusty. I was most impressed with that.\"", "source": {"uri": "espn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ESPN.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meijer_LPGA_Classic",

I love bakeries and baked goods, so that's one thing I'm really looking forward to.\n\n\"And obviously representing my country and getting to compete in the Olympics is such an incredible opportunity.\n\n\"I'm just super excited to get there and even just to play that golf course. I got to watch it in [the] Ryder Cup. To be able to play such amazing golf courses like we do nowadays will be such a treat.\"\n\nAnd after being asked what the over/under on Strokes Gained: Croissant might be, Korda said: \"I have definitely been crushing too many recently.\"\n\nTurning attention back to the third women's Major of the season, Korda is entering the KPMG Women's PGA Championship off the back of two missed cuts yet is still a pretty sizeable favorite to reign supreme in the eyes of the bookmakers.\n\nSix wins in 10 starts this season means the American is by far and a way the most feared player in the field among her competitors, even if two rough opening rounds in her past two starts had threatened to shake Korda's nerve somewhat.\n\nHowever, the World No.1 is made of sterner stuff these days and is choosing to take the positives from much stronger second rounds at the US Women's Open and the Meijer LPGA Classic as she aims to lift another title.\n\nExplaining her outlook after an underwhelming couple of weeks, Korda said: \"You can dwell on the negatives, but that will never lead you anywhere, so you try it look at the positives.\n\n\"I mean, I'm going to go through these situations so many times where I feel like I'm playing really well and I'll go through a little lull where golf is the hardest thing in my life right now.\n\n\"So that's I feel like what grows myself as a person and what makes me appreciate the sport so much and makes me appreciate the wins and the highs and good shots, the crowds out there as well.\"\n\nAnd what about the pressure placed on her to keep winning after a record-equalling stretch of golf in the first third of the year?\n\nKorda said: \"I feel like pressure is privilege, and that's something that you're the only one that can kind of control that. You can listen to the outside voices, but at the end of the day, when you have pressure you can take it in a positive way that you are doing good and playing well.\n\n\"But, yeah, I'm just going to stay in my bubble this week and go out and try to execute my shots, be confident in what I have. This golf course is already hard enough, and if I'm going to put more pressure on myself, then I think it's just going to make it even harder this week.\"\n\nKorda will take on 155 other players at the brutally narrow Sahalee Country Club in Washington for the largest share of the $10.4 million purse.", "source": {"uri": "golfmonthly.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Golf Monthly Magazine"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jonny_leighfield@golfmonthly.com", "name": "Jonny Leighfield", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_World_Golf_Ranking", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Official World Golf Ranking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lilia_Vu", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lilia Vu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rose_Zhang", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rose Zhang"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_PGA_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Women's PGA Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelly_Korda", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nelly Korda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Golf_National", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Le Golf National"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croissant", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Croissant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmaker_(gambling)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bookmaker (gambling)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryder_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ryder Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Women's_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Women's Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meijer_LPGA_Classic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Meijer LPGA Classic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sahalee_Country_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sahalee Country Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Instruction", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Women", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Women", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Community_and_Clubs", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Community and Clubs", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sk59D5neia7JueffBomdNR-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663563", "eventUri": "eng-9663563", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-07", "dateEnd": "2024-08-10", "textStart": 535, "textEnd": 546}], "sentiment": 0.5450980392156863, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

But parts of the morning were a scramble for Korda as the Douglass fir, red cedar and hemlock trees of Sahalee played their role in making it a challenge. A double bogey on the par-4 fourth hole dropped her back to 2 under.\n\n\"If you try and be aggressive when you've hit it off line, it just bites you in the butt,\" Korda said. \"Overall I think I played pretty well. I took my chances where I could and I played safe the majority of the round.\"\n\nKorda dropped a 15-foot putt on the par-3 ninth hole to take a one-shot advantage.\n\nSeven players were one shot back, including Allisen Corpuz, Celine Boutier, Charley Hull and Leona Maguire. Maguire led this tournament after the third round last year at Baltusrol, but shot 74 on the final day and finished four shots back of the winner, Ruoning Yin.\n\nPlaying with Korda, Yin rebounded from a rough start and shot 33 on her second nine to shoot 71.\n\n\"Luckily hit it pretty straight today. Hit a lot of fairways and greens. But it does feel like a course where once you're out of position it's tough to get back on track,\" said Corpuz, who has an outside chance of making the Olympics for the United States with a strong finish this week.\n\nThe third major of the year on the LPGA Tour returned to Sahalee, which previously hosted in 2016.\n\nAnd Korda got off to a far better start than her last major, when she shot 80 in the opening round of the U.S. Women's Open three weeks ago.\n\nKorda early run of birdies included three straight between Nos. 13-15 and she and went out in 33. She moved to 4 under after a birdie on the third hole -- her 12th of the day -- but dropped two shots on the fourth. Her tee shot on the 398-yard hole ended up tucked behind a tree and after pitching out, her third shot failed to clear a ridge and rolled back toward the front of the green.\n\nKorda was able to scramble out of trouble a few times, including the par-5 second hole when she pulled a fairway wood into a cluster of trees left the green and salvaged par.\n\n\"This entire golf course is so demanding. I had to make some pretty good up-and-downs,\" Korda said.\n\nThe afternoon wave included Lexi Thompson; Lilia Vu, who won last week in her return from a back injury; Brooke Henderson, the 2016 winner at Sahalee; and Yuka Saso, the U.S. Women's Open winner.", "source": {"uri": "daytondailynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Dayton Daily News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leona_Maguire", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Leona Maguire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sahalee_Country_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sahalee Country Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Par_(score)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Par (score)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allisen_Corpuz", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Allisen Corpuz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C\u00e9line_Boutier", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "C\u00e9line Boutier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charley_Hull", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Charley Hull"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltusrol_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Baltusrol Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lilia_Vu", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lilia Vu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Women's_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Women's Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuka_Saso", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yuka Saso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooke_Henderson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brooke Henderson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexi_Thompson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lexi Thompson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LPGA", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LPGA"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Courses", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Courses", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Golo_Golf", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Golo Golf", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Drama", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Drama", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://www.daytondailynews.com/resizer/Tt-L0EtPDAlHy8clF7_vrK0PQys=/1200x630/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coxohio/DOCEM2HTNNUMHW3XIJJ7ELIYCA.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663563", "eventUri": "eng-9663563", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

She returns to Sahalee in 2024, but this time to cheer on her younger sister and current World No. 1, Nelly Korda.\n\nShe explained the best way to attack this tree-lined track.\n\n\"Sahalee is one of the purest tracks I think we've ever played. It's such a great test of golf and an amazing major championship host,\" she said to the LPGA social media team.\n\n\"All you see are these big trees, the roughs up -- you got branches in the way. So paying attention to where the pins are -- coming in at the right angles from the fairway, those are all going to be really important things. You would say it's a second-shot golf course, but it's not. It's an every-shot golf course.\"\n\nPine trees line the fairways at Sahalee, making it a challenge to take home the KPMG Women's PGA Championship trophy on Sunday.\n\nKorda has been on quite the run in 2024, already racking up six victories on the LPGA Tour She won five straight, finished T7 at the Cognizant Founders Cup and won the Mizuho Americas Open the following week.\n\nHowever, since that sixth victory, her game has gone cold.\n\nKorda missed the cut at the U.S. Women's Open at Lancaster Country Club earlier this year and the Meijer LPGA Classic last week. She looks to bounce back and play the weekend at this major championship.\n\nThe 14-time LPGA winner posted a 3-under 69 to sit atop the leaderboard after her round on Thursday. The afternoon group still has to play, but she leads by one shot.\n\nKorda set the tone with six birdies, a bogey, and one double bogey.\n\n\"As long as she can keep it in the fairway, she's going to be fine,\" Jessica Korda said. \"But she does scramble really well. So, as long as she can score, I think that's going to be the most important thing.\"\n\nNelly's double bogey was rough, but she bounced back with a birdie on her 18th hole to reclaim the lead.", "source": {"uri": "sbnation.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SB Nation"}, "authors": [{"uri": "savannah_leigh_richardson@sbnation.com", "name": "Savannah Leigh Richardson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_PGA_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Women's PGA Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sahalee_Country_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sahalee Country Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LPGA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LPGA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Korda", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jessica Korda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_major_golf_championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Women's major golf championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooke_Henderson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brooke Henderson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelly_Korda", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nelly Korda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_World_Golf_Ranking", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Official World Golf Ranking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lydia_Ko", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lydia Ko"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sammamish,_Washington", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sammamish, Washington"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sammamish, Washington"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Women's_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Women's Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meijer_LPGA_Classic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Meijer LPGA Classic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Par_(score)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Par (score)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Women", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Women", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Community_and_Clubs", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Community and Clubs", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LxpcXYbgBZy50l_3C7kqq4fwKxk=/0x130:2884x1572/fit-in/1200x600/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25499776/1799475674.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663563", "eventUri": "eng-9663563", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

The No. 1 player in the world denotes the spots she needs to avoid hitting by writing X's.\n\nAt Sahalee Country Club, with Douglas fir, red cedar and hemlock trees framing every fairway and making each look like a hallway, there are likely to be a substantial amount of those X marks outside the short grass.\n\n\"I think every hole looks a little different. They're all intimidating and great in their own way,\" Korda said.\n\nKorda is again the headliner this week as the KPMG Women's PGA Championship tees off Thursday at Sahalee, the third major of the year on the LPGA Tour.\n\nBut she arrived in the Seattle area in a different place with her game than just a few weeks ago, when she showed up at the U.S. Women's Open having won six of her previous seven starts, including a major at the Chevron Championship. At the time, no player in the world was on more of a roll than Korda and adding another major seemed probable, if not likely.\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nOwner of Starbeck's Smokehouse opening burger restaurant in Cedar Falls in July College Football: Cedar Falls native, grandson of former Panther basketball assistant coach commits to UNI Car trapped under semitruck in collision on North Elk Run Road Cedar Falls man arrested for alleged theft of electric bikes Deere & Co. to pay $1.1 million in back wages, interest to Black and Hispanic applicants Two transported to hospital Saturday after motorcycle crashed in ditch Greene man airlifted after motorcycle crashes with pickup west of Plainfield Two women charged in counterfeiting operation at Evansdale home Angel Reese says Caitlin Clark gets 'special whistle.'

Korda missed the cut at Lancaster Country Club after an opening-round 80 that included a 10 on her third hole and watched as Yuka Saso went on to win the championship for a second time. When she returned last week at the Meijer LPGA Classic, Korda struggled to an opening-round 76 before shooting 67 in the second round, but missed out on playing the weekend by one shot.\n\n\"I'm just going to stay in my bubble this week and go out and try to execute my shots, be confident in what I have,\" Korda said. \"This golf course is already hard enough and if I'm going to put more pressure on myself, then I think it's just going to make it even harder this week.\"\n\nSahalee is the first course to host the tournament twice since the partnership between the PGA of America and LPGA began a decade ago and boosted the prominence and purse for this major championship. This year's tournament has a record purse of $10.4 million.\n\nThe course measures just over 6,700 yards and water comes into play on only a handful of holes. It'll play to a par 72, one stroke higher than 2016 as the 18th has been converted to a par 5. Players have noted the greens seem softer than 2016, although temperatures are supposed to push into the 80s for the first two rounds and dry out the putting surfaces.\n\nBut the favorite word for the week to describe the course seems to be \"intimidating,\" because of the tree-lined tunnels from which shots will emerge.\n\n\"It's really tight for the tee shot. It's I think a classic ball-striking course,\" said defending champ Ruoning Yin, who won last year at Baltusrol.\n\nOne player who proved she can maneuver successfully through the trees is Brooke Henderson, who won the first of her two career majors in 2016 at Sahalee, beating Lydia Ko in a playoff.\n\nAt 18, Henderson was the youngest winner in the history of the event. She shot 65 in the final round to get into the playoff and birdied the first extra hole with a 7-iron from 155 yards to a couple of feet. The course unveiled a plaque this week from the location on the 18th fairway where Henderson hit that shot.\n\nThe memories are still fresh and came flooding back as Henderson, now 26 and 13th in the world ranking, made her way around the course.\n\n\"I love the huge towering trees and the tight fairways. It's almost majestic. Feels very peaceful and amazing,\" Henderson said.\n\nAt the same time, she was reminded of how claustrophobic Sahalee can feel and the importance of simply hitting the ball straight. Do that, and the place can feel downright serene.\n\n\"Every tee shot you have to really pay attention. Can never really take a break out here. Even the approach shots you got to know where the slopes are and where your misses are,\" Henderson said. \"But at the same time, if you're playing well and you can kind of lean into the beauty that surrounds you and soak it in, it makes for a really nice walk around this place.\"\n\nLove\n\n0\n\nFunny\n\n0\n\nWow\n\n0\n\nSad\n\n0\n\nAngry\n\n0\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered

Korda missed the cut at Lancaster Country Club after an opening-round 80 that included a 10 on her third hole and watched as Yuka Saso went on to win the championship for a second time. When she returned last week at the Meijer LPGA Classic, Korda struggled to an opening-round 76 before shooting 67 in the second round, but missed out on playing the weekend by one shot.\n\n\"I'm just going to stay in my bubble this week and go out and try to execute my shots, be confident in what I have,\" Korda said. \"This golf course is already hard enough and if I'm going to put more pressure on myself, then I think it's just going to make it even harder this week.\"\n\nSahalee is the first course to host the tournament twice since the partnership between the PGA of America and LPGA began a decade ago and boosted the prominence and purse for this major championship.

It'll play to a par 72, one stroke higher than 2016 as the 18th has been converted to a par 5. Players have noted the greens seem softer than 2016, although temperatures are supposed to push into the 80s for the first two rounds and dry out the putting surfaces.\n\nBut the favorite word for the week to describe the course seems to be \"intimidating,\" because of the tree-lined tunnels from which shots will emerge.\n\n\"It's really tight for the tee shot. It's I think a classic ball-striking course,\" said defending champ Ruoning Yin, who won last year at Baltusrol.\n\nOne player who proved she can maneuver successfully through the trees is Brooke Henderson, who won the first of her two career majors in 2016 at Sahalee, beating Lydia Ko in a playoff.\n\nAt 18, Henderson was the youngest winner in the history of the event. She shot 65 in the final round to get into the playoff and birdied the first extra hole with a 7-iron from 155 yards to a couple of feet. The course unveiled a plaque this week from the location on the 18th fairway where Henderson hit that shot.\n\nThe memories are still fresh and came flooding back as Henderson, now 26 and 13th in the world ranking, made her way around the course.\n\n\"I love the huge towering trees and the tight fairways.

(AP) -- Nelly Korda birdied her final hole for a 3-under 69 to take the early lead in the first round of the KPMG Women's PGA Championship on Thursday.\n\nKorda started on the back nine and the No. 1 player in the world made four birdies in her first five holes. But parts of the morning were a scramble for Korda as the Douglass fir, red cedar and hemlock trees of Sahalee played their role in making it a challenge. A double bogey on the par-4 fourth hole dropped her back to 2 under.\n\n\"If you try and be aggressive when you've hit it off line, it just bites you in the butt,\" Korda said. \"Overall I think I played pretty well. I took my chances where I could and I played safe the majority of the round.\"\n\nKorda dropped a 15-foot putt on the par-3 ninth hole to take a one-shot advantage.\n\nSeven players were one shot back, including Allisen Corpuz, Celine Boutier, Charley Hull and Leona Maguire. Maguire led this tournament after the third round last year at Baltusrol, but shot 74 on the final day and finished four shots back of the winner, Ruoning Yin.\n\nPlaying with Korda, Yin rebounded from a rough start and shot 33 on her second nine to shoot 69.\n\n\"Luckily hit it pretty straight today. Hit a lot of fairways and greens. But it does feel like a course where once you're out of position it's tough to get back on track,\" said Corpuz, who has an outside chance of making the Olympics for the United States with a strong finish this week.\n\nThe third major of the year on the LPGA Tour returned to Sahalee, which previously hosted in 2016.\n\nAnd Korda got off to a far better start than her last major, when she shot 80 in the opening round of the U.S. Women's Open three weeks ago.\n\nKorda early run of birdies included three straight between Nos. 13-15 and she and went out in 33. She moved to 4 under after a birdie on the third hole -- her 12th of the day -- but dropped two shots on the fourth. Her tee shot on the 398-yard hole ended up tucked behind a tree and after pitching out, her third shot failed to clear a ridge and rolled back toward the front of the green.\n\nKorda was able to scramble out of trouble a few times, including the par-5 second hole when she pulled a fairway wood into a cluster of trees left the green and salvaged par.\n\n\"This entire golf course is so demanding. I had to make some pretty good up-and-downs,\" Korda said.\n\nThe afternoon wave included Lexi Thompson; Lilia Vu, who won last week in her return from a back injury; Brooke Henderson, the 2016 winner at Sahalee; and Yuka Saso, the U.S. Women's Open winner.", "source": {"uri": "winnipegfreepress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Winnipeg Free Press"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_PGA_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Women's PGA Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sahalee_Country_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sahalee Country Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelly_Korda", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nelly Korda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leona_Maguire", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Leona Maguire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Par_(score)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Par (score)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sammamish,_Washington", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sammamish, Washington"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sammamish, Washington"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allisen_Corpuz", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Allisen Corpuz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C\u00e9line_Boutier", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "C\u00e9line Boutier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charley_Hull", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Charley Hull"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltusrol_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Baltusrol Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lilia_Vu", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lilia Vu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Women's_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Women's Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuka_Saso", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yuka Saso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooke_Henderson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brooke Henderson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexi_Thompson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lexi Thompson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LPGA", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LPGA"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Courses", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Courses", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Golo_Golf", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Golo Golf", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads_and_Highways/Interstate_69", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads and Highways/Interstate 69", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://www.winnipegfreepress.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/20240620170640-6674a255a89ed939dcebc6a8jpeg.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663563", "eventUri": "eng-9663563", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

(AP) - Inside her yardage book, Nelly Korda keeps the markings simple. The No. 1 player in the world denotes the spots she needs to avoid hitting by writing X\u00b4s.\n\nAt Sahalee Country Club, with Douglas fir, red cedar and hemlock trees framing every fairway and making each look like a hallway, there are likely to be a substantial amount of those X marks outside the short grass.\n\n\"I think every hole looks a little different. They\u00b4re all intimidating and great in their own way,\" Korda said.\n\nKorda is again the headliner this week as the KPMG Women\u00b4s PGA Championship tees off Thursday at Sahalee, the third major of the year on the LPGA Tour.\n\nBut she arrived in the Seattle area in a different place with her game than just a few weeks ago, when she showed up at the U.S. Women\u00b4s Open having won six of her previous seven starts, including a major at the Chevron Championship. At the time, no player in the world was on more of a roll than Korda and adding another major seemed probable, if not likely.\n\nThat didn\u00b4t happen. Korda missed the cut at Lancaster Country Club after an opening-round 80 that included a 10 on her third hole and watched as Yuka Saso went on to win the championship for a second time. When she returned last week at the Meijer LPGA Classic, Korda struggled to an opening-round 76 before shooting 67 in the second round, but missed out on playing the weekend by one shot.\n\nYuka Saso, of Japan, hits on the ninth hole during a practice round for the Womens PGA Championship golf tournament at Sahalee Country Club, Wednesday, June 19, 2024, in Sammamish, Wash. (AP Photo/Gerald Herbert)\n\n\"I\u00b4m just going to stay in my bubble this week and go out and try to execute my shots, be confident in what I have,\" Korda said. \"This golf course is already hard enough and if I\u00b4m going to put more pressure on myself, then I think it\u00b4s just going to make it even harder this week.\"\n\nSahalee is the first course to host the tournament twice since the partnership between the PGA of America and LPGA began a decade ago and boosted the prominence and purse for this major championship. This year\u00b4s tournament has a record purse of $10.4 million.\n\nThe course measures just over 6,700 yards and water comes into play on only a handful of holes. It\u00b4ll play to a par 72, one stroke higher than 2016 as the 18th has been converted to a par 5. Players have noted the greens seem softer than 2016, although temperatures are supposed to push into the 80s for the first two rounds and dry out the putting surfaces.\n\nBut the favorite word for the week to describe the course seems to be \"intimidating,\" because of the tree-lined tunnels from which shots will emerge.\n\n\"It\u00b4s really tight for the tee shot. It\u00b4s I think a classic ball-striking course,\" said defending champ Ruoning Yin, who won last year at Baltusrol.\n\nOne player who proved she can maneuver successfully through the trees is Brooke Henderson, who won the first of her two career majors in 2016 at Sahalee, beating Lydia Ko in a playoff.\n\nAt 18, Henderson was the youngest winner in the history of the event. She shot 65 in the final round to get into the playoff and birdied the first extra hole with a 7-iron from 155 yards to a couple of feet. The course unveiled a plaque this week from the location on the 18th fairway where Henderson hit that shot.\n\nThe memories are still fresh and came flooding back as Henderson, now 26 and 13th in the world ranking, made her way around the course.\n\n\"I love the huge towering trees and the tight fairways. It\u00b4s almost majestic. Feels very peaceful and amazing,\" Henderson said.\n\nAt the same time, she was reminded of how claustrophobic Sahalee can feel and the importance of simply hitting the ball straight. Do that, and the place can feel downright serene.\n\n\"Every tee shot you have to really pay attention. Can never really take a break out here.

The No. 1 player in the world denotes the spots she needs to avoid hitting by writing X's.\n\nAt Sahalee Country Club, with Douglas fir, red cedar and hemlock trees framing every fairway and making each look like a hallway, there are likely to be a substantial amount of those X marks outside the short grass.\n\n\"I think every hole looks a little different. They're all intimidating and great in their own way,\" Korda said.\n\nKorda is again the headliner this week as the KPMG Women's PGA Championship tees off Thursday at Sahalee, the third major of the year on the LPGA Tour.\n\nBut she arrived in the Seattle area in a different place with her game than just a few weeks ago, when she showed up at the U.S. Women's Open having won six of her previous seven starts, including a major at the Chevron Championship. At the time, no player in the world was on more of a roll than Korda and adding another major seemed probable, if not likely.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Korda missed the cut at Lancaster Country Club after an opening-round 80 that included a 10 on her third hole and watched as Yuka Saso went on to win the championship for a second time. When she returned last week at the Meijer LPGA Classic, Korda struggled to an opening-round 76 before shooting 67 in the second round, but missed out on playing the weekend by one shot.\n\n\"I'm just going to stay in my bubble this week and go out and try to execute my shots, be confident in what I have,\" Korda said. \"This golf course is already hard enough and if I'm going to put more pressure on myself, then I think it's just going to make it even harder this week.\"\n\nSahalee is the first course to host the tournament twice since the partnership between the PGA of America and LPGA began a decade ago and boosted the prominence and purse for this major championship. This year's tournament has a record purse of $10.4 million.\n\nThe course measures just over 6,700 yards and water comes into play on only a handful of holes. It'll play to a par 72, one stroke higher than 2016 as the 18th has been converted to a par 5. Players have noted the greens seem softer than 2016, although temperatures are supposed to push into the 80s for the first two rounds and dry out the putting surfaces.\n\nBut the favorite word for the week to describe the course seems to be \"intimidating,\" because of the tree-lined tunnels from which shots will emerge.\n\n\"It's really tight for the tee shot. It's I think a classic ball-striking course,\" said defending champ Ruoning Yin, who won last year at Baltusrol.\n\nOne player who proved she can maneuver successfully through the trees is Brooke Henderson, who won the first of her two career majors in 2016 at Sahalee, beating Lydia Ko in a playoff.\n\nAt 18, Henderson was the youngest winner in the history of the event. She shot 65 in the final round to get into the playoff and birdied the first extra hole with a 7-iron from 155 yards to a couple of feet. The course unveiled a plaque this week from the location on the 18th fairway where Henderson hit that shot.\n\nThe memories are still fresh and came flooding back as Henderson, now 26 and 13th in the world ranking, made her way around the course.\n\n\"I love the huge towering trees and the tight fairways. It's almost majestic. Feels very peaceful and amazing,\" Henderson said.\n\nAt the same time, she was reminded of how claustrophobic Sahalee can feel and the importance of simply hitting the ball straight. Do that, and the place can feel downright serene.\n\n\"Every tee shot you have to really pay attention. Can never really take a break out here. Even the approach shots you got to know where the slopes are and where your misses are,\" Henderson said. \"But at the same time, if you're playing well and you can kind of lean into the beauty that surrounds you and soak it in, it makes for a really nice walk around this place.\"\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that

Korda missed the cut at Lancaster Country Club after an opening-round 80 that included a 10 on her third hole and watched as Yuka Saso went on to win the championship for a second time. When she returned last week at the Meijer LPGA Classic, Korda struggled to an opening-round 76 before shooting 67 in the second round, but missed out on playing the weekend by one shot.\n\n\"I'm just going to stay in my bubble this week and go out and try to execute my shots, be confident in what I have,\" Korda said. \"This golf course is already hard enough and if I'm going to put more pressure on myself, then I think it's just going to make it even harder this week.\"\n\nSahalee is the first course to host the tournament twice since the partnership between the PGA of America and LPGA began a decade ago and boosted the prominence and purse for this major championship. This year's tournament has a record purse of $10.4 million.\n\nThe course measures just over 6,700 yards and water comes into play on only a handful of holes. It'll play to a par 72, one stroke higher than 2016 as the 18th has been converted to a par 5. Players have noted the greens seem softer than 2016, although temperatures are supposed to push into the 80s for the first two rounds and dry out the putting surfaces.\n\nBut the favorite word for the week to describe the course seems to be \"intimidating,\" because of the tree-lined tunnels from which shots will emerge.\n\n\"It's really tight for the tee shot. It's I think a classic ball-striking course,\" said defending champ Ruoning Yin, who won last year at Baltusrol.\n\nOne player who proved she can maneuver successfully through the trees is Brooke Henderson, who won the first of her two career majors in 2016 at Sahalee, beating Lydia Ko in a playoff.\n\nAt 18, Henderson was the youngest winner in the history of the event. She shot 65 in the final round to get into the playoff and birdied the first extra hole with a 7-iron from 155 yards to a couple of feet. The course unveiled a plaque this week from the location on the 18th fairway where Henderson hit that shot.\n\nThe memories are still fresh and came flooding back as Henderson, now 26 and 13th in the world ranking, made her way around the course.\n\n\"I love the huge towering trees and the tight fairways. It's almost majestic. Feels very peaceful and amazing,\" Henderson said.\n\nAt the same time, she was reminded of how claustrophobic Sahalee can feel and the importance of simply hitting the ball straight. Do that, and the place can feel downright serene.\n\n\"Every tee shot you have to really pay attention. Can never really take a break out here. Even the approach shots you got to know where the slopes are and where your misses are,\" Henderson said. \"But at the same time, if you're playing well and you can kind of lean into the beauty that surrounds you and soak it in, it makes for a really nice walk around this place.\"\n\n0 Comments", "source": {"uri": "stltoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "St. Louis Post-Dispatch"}, "authors":

Although a few years ago, golf fans and golfers did not give much importance to this sport when it came to the Olympics, it seems that attitudes and opinions are slowly changing. Since golf had not been part of the Olympics for 112 years, the passion and desire among some to play there had diminished. In 2016, golf returned for the first time and was played in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. This delighted many fans of the sport, who eagerly awaited the performances of their favorites despite the skepticism.\n\nNow, eight years later, golfers are increasingly emphasizing the honor of playing in the Olympics and representing their country. Currently, the leading figure in women's golf, who seems unstoppable, Nelly Korda, spoke about her impressions of Paris and the Olympics ahead of the KPMG Women's PGA Championship. Korda will, of course, compete in Paris and represent the USA on the big stage. The 25-year-old could not hide her excitement, ready to conquer the competition and win a medal.\n\n\"Representing my country and getting to compete in the Olympics is such an incredible opportunity. I'm just super excited to get there and even just to play that golf course. I got to watch it in [2018] Ryder Cup. To be able to play such amazing golf courses like we do nowadays will be such a treat.\"- she said, as quoted by NBC Sports.\n\nThe 25-year-old golfer admitted that she has never been to Paris, and her biggest wish is to try croissants on every corner, especially since she is a big fan of bakeries. Paris is a major European city that can offer a lot to a young person like her, and we have no doubt that Korda will have a fantastic experience in the French capital.\n\n\"I have never been to Paris, and the one thing I'm really looking forward to is the croissants probably on every corner. I love bakeries and baked goods, so that's one thing I'm really looking forward to.\"-Korda continued.\n\nAfter a series of successful tournaments where she secured six victories, Korda was less successful at the US Women's Open and the Meijer LPGA Classic, as she missed the cut. Golf is such a sport that it is hard to predict what lies ahead, and keeping pace amid so many great golfers is challenging. Korda is a young golfer, but she knows that maintaining rhythm is tough and that such days in golf are entirely normal.\n\nThe KPMG Women's PGA Championship will represent an important challenge for her. The purse for this tournament is $10,400,000, which is a huge motivation for everyone. Last year's winner of this tournament was the Chinese golfer Ruoning Yin.\n\nKorda reflected on her somewhat poorer form in the last two tournaments, noting that it is sometimes hard to get used to poor performances, but that is also why she respects golf, knowing that there will be many ups and downs in her career.\n\n\"I'm going to go through these situations so many times where I feel like I'm playing really well and I'll go through a little lull where golf is the hardest thing in my life right now. So that's I feel like what grows myself as a person and what makes me appreciate the sport so much and makes me appreciate the wins and the highs and good shots, the crowds out there as well.\"- she said.\n\nKorda stresses that pressure is a privilege and something she can control. She explains that while it's possible to listen to external opinions, ultimately, pressure can be seen positively as a sign that she is performing well.\n\nWhen you're such an outstanding golfer, it's natural for people to have high expectations of you, and to feel pressure from tournament to tournament. The best athletes in the world, in addition to their skill, are also the best at handling pressure.\n\nHer plan for the week is to stay focused and confident in her abilities. Korda acknowledges the difficulty of the golf course and emphasizes that adding more pressure on herself would only make it tougher. Therefore, she intends to concentrate on executing her shots and keeping her confidence.\n\nIt remains for us to be patient and see how much this young golfer can do this week, and whether her form will start to rise again. It will also be interesting to follow her at the Olympics in Paris since she is the main favorite to win.\n\nThe 25-year-old is calm for now and ready for new challenges.", "source": {"uri": "tennisworldusa.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tennis World USA"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sead_dedovic@tennisworldusa.org", "name": "Sead Dedovic", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_PGA_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Women's PGA Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelly_Korda", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nelly Korda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croissant", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Croissant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_de_Janeiro", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rio de Janeiro"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rio de Janeiro"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Women's_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Women's Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meijer_LPGA_Classic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Meijer LPGA Classic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_Sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBC Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryder_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ryder Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Disabled", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Disabled", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Women", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Women", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Humor", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 71}], "image": "https://www.tennisworldusa.org/world/media/image150344.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663563", "eventUri": "eng-9663563", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.419607843137255, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

It's I think a classic ball-striking course,\" said defending champ Ruoning Yin, who won last year at Baltusrol.\n\nOne player who proved she can maneuver successfully through the trees is Brooke Henderson, who won the first of her two career majors in 2016 at Sahalee, beating Lydia Ko in a playoff.\n\nAt 18, Henderson was the youngest winner in the history of the event. She shot 65 in the final round to get into the playoff and birdied the first extra hole with a 7-iron from 155 yards to a couple of feet. The course unveiled a plaque this week from the location on the 18th fairway where Henderson hit that shot.\n\nThe memories are still fresh and came flooding back as Henderson, now 26 and 13th in the world ranking, made her way around the course.\n\n\"I love the huge towering trees and the tight fairways. It's almost majestic. Feels very peaceful and amazing,\" Henderson said.\n\nAt the same time, she was reminded of how claustrophobic Sahalee can feel and the importance of simply hitting the ball straight. Do that, and the place can feel downright serene.\n\n\"Every tee shot you have to really pay attention. Can never really take a break out here. Even the approach shots you got to know where the slopes are and where your misses are,\" Henderson said. \"But at the same time, if you're playing well and you can kind of lean into the beauty that surrounds you and soak it in, it makes for a really nice walk around this place.\"\n\nLove 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up!

But when you consider the distance between her and the rest of the class in the world golf rankings, Korda is a redwood among pines.\n\nThe 5.56 points separating her from second-ranked Lilia Vu is equal to the total separating Vu from No. 71 Narin An. In the ultimate walking sport, Korda, from Florida, has run away from the field.\n\nThe problem for the 25-year-old is that she didn't work the weekends in either of her past two tournaments. This wasn't self-care so much as it was self-immolation, as a series of gaffes -- the most notable being a 10 she posted on a par 3 in last month's U.S. Open -- caused her to miss consecutive cuts.\n\nBefore that, Korda had won six of her previous seven tournaments, including the major that was last April's Chevron Championship. It was the type of dominance we used to see from that Nike-capped Stanford grad who wore red on Sundays.\n\nThen came this recent skid. Whoa, Nelly! one second, Woe Nelly the next.\n\nPerhaps that's why Korda isn't the overwhelming favorite to win this week's KPMG Women's PGA Championship at Sahalee. As of press time, the oddsmakers had her at 9-to-1 to capture her third career major, with Thailand's Atthaya Thikikul coming in next at 14-to-1.\n\nBut Korda is still the best player in the world in the midst of the best season in her lifetime. So don't expect to hear much worry in her voice.\n\n\"That's golf. I mean, I'm going to go through these situations so many times where I feel like I'm playing really well, and I'll go through a little lull where golf is the hardest thing in my life,\" said Korda, a three-time Solheim Cup participant who won the Women's PGA Championship in 2021. \"So that's I feel like what grows myself as a person and what makes me appreciate the sport so much, and makes me appreciate the wins and the highs and good shots and crowds out there, as well.\"\n\nIt's possible that Korda's crowd includes longtime Washingtonian Wendy Ward, who will be competing in this week's tournament. The 51-year-old is a four-time winner on the LPGA Tour who earned a spot in the Women's PGA championship by finishing eighth in last year's LPGA Professional National Championship -- an event for instructors.\n\nWard said that if she has a chance to watch Korda in person this week, she's going to do it. She has been a fan of Nelly's for a while now, and remembers advocating for her to be on the 2015 Solheim Cup team as a 17-year-old.\n\nJuli Inkster, the captain at the time, decided not to take her, which surprised Ward. But both saw the potential the kid possessed.\n\n\"I was like, 'Oh, my gosh. She has no weakness,'\" Ward said. \"And Juli goes, 'Yep, I think I'm going to have to pass on her.' We're like, 'What?' She goes, 'Trust me. Just give her another couple years and she's going to do amazing things.'\"\n\nFourteen LPGA wins and two majors later, it's safe to say that Inkster was correct. Oh yeah -- there's also the Olympic gold medal Korda won in Tokyo three years ago, a feat she will attempt to repeat in Paris this summer.\n\nNot that the defense is what will be first and foremost on her mind when she lands in France. Nelly said she is most looking forward to the croissants she anticipates will be on every street corner. She seems to like baked goods as much she does cooking her opponents.\n\nNot that that should make the field feel relaxed.\n\nAfter all, if Korda can emerge as the most successful athlete from her family, how tough can the Women's PGA Championship be?\n\nOK, pretty tough. But her father, Petr, was a tennis player who won the 1998 Australian Open. And her sister, Jessica, is a fellow golfer who won the 2012 Australian Open. Her brother, Sebastian, won the 2018 junior Australian Open in tennis. Nelly's veins are 10% blood and 90% competitive juices.\n\nThis course will test her, though -- but in the most entertaining way. Korda said she is going to have to hit driver most the week and stay aggressive. It's the kind of mentality that could spawn a bogey or six, but is what is necessary to win.\n\nAnd these days, winning is what Korda does best -- even if her last couple tourneys have been among her worst.", "source": {"uri": "seattletimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Seattle Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matt_calkins@seattletimes.com", "name": "Matt Calkins", "type": "author",

But parts of the morning were a scramble for Korda as the Douglass fir, red cedar and hemlock trees of Sahalee played their role in making it a challenge. A double bogey on the par-4 fourth hole dropped her back to 2 under.\n\n\"If you try and be aggressive when you've hit it off line, it just bites you in the butt,\" Korda said. \"Overall I think I played pretty well. I took my chances where I could and I played safe the majority of the round.\"\n\nKorda dropped a 15-foot putt on the par-3 ninth hole to take a one-shot advantage.\n\nSeven players were one shot back, including Allisen Corpuz, Celine Boutier, Charley Hull and Leona Maguire. Maguire led this tournament after the third round last year at Baltusrol, but shot 74 on the final day and finished four shots back of the winner, Ruoning Yin.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Hit a lot of fairways and greens. But it does feel like a course where once you're out of position it's tough to get back on track,\" said Corpuz, ho has an outside chance of making the Olympics for the United States with a strong finish this week.\n\nThe third major of the year on the LPGA Tour returned to Sahalee, which previously hosted in 2016.\n\nAnd Korda got off to a far better start than her last major, when she shot 80 in the opening round of the U.S. Women's Open three weeks ago.\n\nKorda early run of birdies included three straight between Nos. 13-15 and she and went out in 33. She moved to 4 under after a birdie on the third hole -- her 12th of the day -- but dropped two shots on the fourth. Her tee shot on the 398-yard hole ended up tucked behind a tree and after pitching out, her third shot failed to clear a ridge and rolled back toward the front of the green.\n\nKorda was able to scramble out of trouble a few times, including the par-5 second hole when she pulled a fairway wood into a cluster of trees left the green and salvaged par.\n\n\"This entire golf course is so demanding. I had to make some pretty good up-and-downs,\" Korda said.\n\nThe afternoon wave included Lexi Thompson; Lilia Vu, who won last week in her return from a back injury; Brooke Henderson, the 2016 winner at Sahalee; and Yuka Saso, the U.S. Women's Open winner.\n\n0 Comments Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand

(AP) - Nelly Korda birdied her final hole for a 3-under 69 to take the early lead in the first round of the KPMG Women\u00b4s PGA Championship on Thursday.\n\nKorda started on the back nine and the No. 1 player in the world made four birdies in her first five holes. But parts of the morning were a scramble for Korda as the Douglass fir, red cedar and hemlock trees of Sahalee played their role in making it a challenge. A double bogey on the par-4 fourth hole dropped her back to 2 under.\n\n\"If you try and be aggressive when you've hit it off line, it just bites you in the butt,\" Korda said. \"Overall I think I played pretty well. I took my chances where I could and I played safe the majority of the round.\"\n\nKorda dropped a 15-foot putt on the par-3 ninth hole to take a one-shot advantage.\n\nSeven players were one shot back, including Allisen Corpuz, Celine Boutier, Charley Hull and Leona Maguire. Maguire led this tournament after the third round last year at Baltusrol, but shot 74 on the final day and finished four shots back of the winner, Ruoning Yin.\n\nPlaying with Korda, Yin rebounded from a rough start and shot 33 on her second nine to shoot 71.\n\nNelly Korda hits from the 17th tee during the first round of the Women's PGA Championship golf tournament at Sahalee Country Club, Thursday, June 20, 2024, in Sammamish, Wash.

But it does feel like a course where once you\u00b4re out of position it\u00b4s tough to get back on track,\" said Corpuz, who has an outside chance of making the Olympics for the United States with a strong finish this week.\n\nThe third major of the year on the LPGA Tour returned to Sahalee, which previously hosted in 2016.\n\nAnd Korda got off to a far better start than her last major, when she shot 80 in the opening round of the U.S. Women\u00b4s Open three weeks ago.\n\nKorda early run of birdies included three straight between Nos. 13-15 and she and went out in 33. She moved to 4 under after a birdie on the third hole - her 12th of the day - but dropped two shots on the fourth. Her tee shot on the 398-yard hole ended up tucked behind a tree and after pitching out, her third shot failed to clear a ridge and rolled back toward the front of the green.\n\nKorda was able to scramble out of trouble a few times, including the par-5 second hole when she pulled a fairway wood into a cluster of trees left the green and salvaged par.\n\n\"This entire golf course is so demanding. I had to make some pretty good up-and-downs,\" Korda said.\n\nThe afternoon wave included Lexi Thompson; Lilia Vu, who won last week in her return from a back injury; Brooke Henderson, the 2016 winner at Sahalee; and Yuka Saso, the U.S. Women\u00b4s Open winner.\n\nAP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf\n\nNelly Korda hits from the bunker on the 16th hole during the first round of the Women's PGA Championship golf tournament at Sahalee Country Club, Thursday, June 20, 2024, in Sammamish, Wash.

There is a distinctive sound when a golf ball hits a tree, and it's a sound that will be heard often over the next four days of the KPMG Women's PGA Championship at Sahalee, beginning with Thursday's first round.\n\nAvoiding the trees - and hoping for a fortuitous bounce when they don't - will be a huge priority for all 156 players in the field.\n\nNelly Korda, the top-ranked woman in the world, did not play in the 2016 KPMG Women's PGA Championship when it was played at Sahalee. She got her first look at the course this week.\n\n\"Gosh, it's such a beautiful place,' said Korda, who got a scouting report from her sister Jessica, who was part of the field in 2016. \"She just told\n\nme you really have to hit your shots out here, especially your tee shots. ... If you hit it a little off line here off the tee, you have a bunch of trees in your way, so you're pitching out the majority of the time.\"\n\nBrooke Henderson and Lydia Ko finished on top of the leaderboard in 2016 with scores of 6-under 278, setting up a playoff that Henderson won.\n\nThey were two of only seven players who were under par that week. Henderson, who was made an honorary member of Sahalee earlier this week, negotiated the challenge the trees bring as well as anyone in 2016.\n\n\"I love the huge, towering trees and the tight fairways,\" she said. \"It's almost majestic. It feels very peaceful and amazing, but at the same time it's a little bit\n\nstressful because you have to hit it so straight. That's the No. 1 priority this week is trying to hit a lot of fairways, keeping the ball in play, and giving yourself good looks for birdies when you can and making those\n\nclutch par saves when you need to.\n\n\"Remembering back to 2016, this course played really tough. Not very many people were under par at the end of the four days.\"\n\nWendy Ward, a four-time LPGA winner who lives in Spokane, had to tell out-of-state reporters this week that there is a big difference between the west side and east side of the state when it comes to terrain.\n\n\"They grow the trees a lot bigger over here, which I already knew,\" she said.\n\n\"I hit it a lot straighter than I used to, so I am hoping that isn't an issue.\"\n\nYuka Saso, who won her second U.S. Women's Open last month, watched the 2016 event at Sahalee on TV. She got her first in-person look this week.\n\n\"It's very narrow here compared to other golf courses that we play on,\" she said. \"It's going to be very, very difficult. Have to hit it straight and stay out of the trees. I think it makes us focus more. It makes me focus more when it's\n\ndifficult.\"\n\nRuoning Yin, who won this event last year, and is ranked No. 3 in the world, said, \"I think it's a very challenging course, and it's really tight for the tee shot.\"\n\nBut Yin has said she will try not to think about that.\n\n\"I think if you worry about it too much you're just going to screw yourself up,\" she said. \"So I try to not think about how tough the tee shot is. Just swing my swing and I'll be good.\"\n\nFor players, the trees and the nature at Sahalee bring a feeling of peace.\n\n\"When you're standing in the fairways, and walking the fairways, you don't feel like you're on a golf course,\" Henderson said. \"You just feel like you're in amongst nature. It's just a great feeling.\n\n\"I love just kind of looking around and breathing deep and feeling that fresh air. It's an incredible feeling.\"\n\nSaid Korda: \"You kind of get lost in the nature out here.\"\n\nBut then comes the challenge of avoiding those trees with their golf shots.\n\n\"I feel like it's a great mix of being intimidating and scary and also peaceful and\n\nbeautiful and calm,\" Henderson said. \"It's kind of opposites. Every tee shot you have to really pay attention to. You can never really take a break out here.\"\n\n* Caroline Inglis, who grew up in Eugene, Ore., and now lives in Vancouver, is one of two players in the field who lives in Washington (Ward is the other).\n\n* The total purse of the event is $10.4 million, with the winner receiving $1.56 million.\n\n* Henderson earned $525,000 from a purse of $3.5 million in 2016.\n\n* The field will be cut to the low 70 players plus ties after Friday's second round.\n\nFive marquee pairings Thursday\n\n7:49 a.m., hole No. 10: Rose Zhang, Celine Boutier, Nasa Hataoka - Zhang, the ex-Stanford phenom, is ranked No. 9 in the world. Boutier is ranked No. 4.\n\n8:11 a.m., hole No. 10: Nelly Korda, Ruoning Yin, Hannah Green - Korda looks for her seventh win of season; Green her third.

The No. 1 player in the world denotes the spots she needs to avoid hitting by writing X's.\n\nAt Sahalee Country Club, with Douglas fir, red cedar and hemlock trees framing every fairway and making each look like a hallway, there are likely to be a substantial amount of those X marks outside the short grass.\n\n\"I think every hole looks a little different. They're all intimidating and great in their own way,\" Korda said.\n\nKorda is again the headliner this week as the KPMG Women's PGA Championship tees off Thursday at Sahalee, the third major of the year on the LPGA Tour.\n\nBut she arrived in the Seattle area in a different place with her game than just a few weeks ago, when she showed up at the U.S. Women's Open having won six of her previous seven starts, including a major at the Chevron Championship. At the time, no player in the world was on more of a roll than Korda and adding another major seemed probable, if not likely.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Korda missed the cut at Lancaster Country Club after an opening-round 80 that included a 10 on her third hole and watched as Yuka Saso went on to win the championship for a second time. When she returned last week at the Meijer LPGA Classic, Korda struggled to an opening-round 76 before shooting 67 in the second round, but missed out on playing the weekend by one shot.\n\n\"I'm just going to stay in my bubble this week and go out and try to execute my shots, be confident in what I have,\" Korda said. \"This golf course is already hard enough and if I'm going to put more pressure on myself, then I think it's just going to make it even harder this week.\"\n\nSahalee is the first course to host the tournament twice since the partnership between the PGA of America and LPGA began a decade ago and boosted the prominence and purse for this major championship. This year's tournament has a record purse of $10.4 million.\n\nThe course measures just over 6,700 yards and water comes into play on only a handful of holes. It'll play to a par 72, one stroke higher than 2016 as the 18th has been converted to a par 5. Players have noted the greens seem softer than 2016, although temperatures are supposed to push into the 80s for the first two rounds and dry out the putting surfaces.\n\nBut the favorite word for the week to describe the course seems to be \"intimidating,\" because of the tree-lined tunnels from which shots will emerge.\n\n\"It's really tight for the tee shot. It's I think a classic ball-striking course,\" said defending champ Ruoning Yin, who won last year at Baltusrol.\n\nOne player who proved she can maneuver successfully through the trees is Brooke Henderson, who won the first of her two career majors in 2016 at Sahalee, beating Lydia Ko in a playoff.\n\nAt 18, Henderson was the youngest winner in the history of the event. She shot 65 in the final round to get into the playoff and birdied the first extra hole with a 7-iron from 155 yards to a couple of feet. The course unveiled a plaque this week from the location on the 18th fairway where Henderson hit that shot.\n\nThe memories are still fresh and came flooding back as Henderson, now 26 and 13th in the world ranking, made her way around the course.\n\n\"I love the huge towering trees and the tight fairways. It's almost majestic.

The No. 1 player in the world denotes the spots she needs to avoid hitting by writing X's.\n\nAt Sahalee Country Club, with Douglas fir, red cedar and hemlock trees framing every fairway and making each look like a hallway, there are likely to be a substantial amount of those X marks outside the short grass.\n\n\"I think every hole looks a little different. They're all intimidating and great in their own way,\" Korda said.\n\nKorda is again the headliner this week as the KPMG Women's PGA Championship tees off Thursday at Sahalee, the third major of the year on the LPGA Tour.\n\nBut she arrived in the Seattle area in a different place with her game than just a few weeks ago, when she showed up at the U.S. Women's Open having won six of her previous seven starts, including a major at the Chevron Championship. At the time, no player in the world was on more of a roll than Korda and adding another major seemed probable, if not likely.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Korda missed the cut at Lancaster Country Club after an opening-round 80 that included a 10 on her third hole and watched as Yuka Saso went on to win the championship for a second time. When she returned last week at the Meijer LPGA Classic, Korda struggled to an opening-round 76 before shooting 67 in the second round, but missed out on playing the weekend by one shot.\n\n\"I'm just going to stay in my bubble this week and go out and try to execute my shots, be confident in what I have,\" Korda said. \"This golf course is already hard enough and if I'm going to put more pressure on myself, then I think it's just going to make it even harder this week.\"\n\nSahalee is the first course to host the tournament twice since the partnership between the PGA of America and LPGA began a decade ago and boosted the prominence and purse for this major championship. This year's tournament has a record purse of $10.4 million.\n\nThe course measures just over 6,700 yards and water comes into play on only a handful of holes. It'll play to a par 72, one stroke higher than 2016 as the 18th has been converted to a par 5. Players have noted the greens seem softer than 2016, although temperatures are supposed to push into the 80s for the first two rounds and dry out the putting surfaces.\n\nBut the favorite word for the week to describe the course seems to be \"intimidating,\" because of the tree-lined tunnels from which shots will emerge.\n\n\"It's really tight for the tee shot. It's I think a classic ball-striking course,\" said defending champ Ruoning Yin, who won last year at Baltusrol.\n\nOne player who proved she can maneuver successfully through the trees is Brooke Henderson, who won the first of her two career majors in 2016 at Sahalee, beating Lydia Ko in a playoff.\n\nAt 18, Henderson was the youngest winner in the history of the event. She shot 65 in the final round to get into the playoff and birdied the first extra hole with a 7-iron from 155 yards to a couple of feet. The course unveiled a plaque this week from the location on the 18th fairway where Henderson hit that shot.\n\nThe memories are still fresh and came flooding back as Henderson, now 26 and 13th in the world ranking, made her way around the course.\n\n\"I love the huge towering trees and the tight fairways. It's almost majestic. Feels very peaceful and amazing,\" Henderson said.\n\nAt the same time, she was reminded of how claustrophobic Sahalee can feel and the importance of simply hitting the ball straight. Do that, and the place can feel downright serene.\n\n\"Every tee shot you have to really pay attention. Can never really take a break out here. Even the approach shots you got to know where the slopes are and where your misses are,\" Henderson said. \"But at the same time, if you're playing well and you can kind of lean into the beauty that

But parts of the morning were a scramble for Korda as the Douglass fir, red cedar and hemlock trees of Sahalee played their role in making it a challenge. A double bogey on the par-4 fourth hole dropped her back to 2 under.\n\n\"If you try and be aggressive when you've hit it off line, it just bites you in the butt,\" Korda said. \"Overall I think I played pretty well. I took my chances where I could and I played safe the majority of the round.\"\n\nKorda dropped a 15-foot putt on the par-3 ninth hole to take a one-shot advantage.\n\nSeven players were one shot back, including Allisen Corpuz, Celine Boutier, Charley Hull and Leona Maguire. Maguire led this tournament after the third round last year at Baltusrol, but shot 74 on the final day and finished four shots back of the winner, Ruoning Yin.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Hit a lot of fairways and greens. But it does feel like a course where once you're out of position it's tough to get back on track,\" said Corpuz, ho has an outside chance of making the Olympics for the United States with a strong finish this week.\n\nThe third major of the year on the LPGA Tour returned to Sahalee, which previously hosted in 2016.\n\nAnd Korda got off to a far better start than her last major, when she shot 80 in the opening round of the U.S. Women's Open three weeks ago.\n\nKorda early run of birdies included three straight between Nos. 13-15 and she and went out in 33. She moved to 4 under after a birdie on the third hole -- her 12th of the day -- but dropped two shots on the fourth. Her tee shot on the 398-yard hole ended up tucked behind a tree and after pitching out, her third shot failed to clear a ridge and rolled back toward the front of the green.\n\nKorda was able to scramble out of trouble a few times, including the par-5 second hole when she pulled a fairway wood into a cluster of trees left the green and salvaged par.\n\n\"This entire golf course is so demanding. I had to make some pretty good up-and-downs,\" Korda said.\n\nThe afternoon wave included Lexi Thompson; Lilia Vu, who won last week in her return from a back injury; Brooke Henderson, the 2016 winner

There is a distinctive sound when a golf ball hits a tree, and it's a sound that will be heard often over the next four days of the KPMG Women's PGA Championship at Sahalee, beginning with Thursday's first round.\n\nAvoiding the trees -- and hoping for a fortuitous bounce when they don't -- will be a huge priority for all 156 players in the field.\n\nNelly Korda, the top-ranked woman in the world, did not play in the 2016 KPMG Women's PGA Championship when it was played at Sahalee. She got her first look at the course this week.\n\n\"Gosh, it's such a beautiful place,' said Korda, who got a scouting report from her sister Jessica, who was part of the field in 2016. \"She just told\n\nme you really have to hit your shots out here, especially your tee shots. ... If you hit it a little off line here off the tee, you have a bunch of trees in your way, so you're pitching out the majority of the time.\"\n\nBrooke Henderson and Lydia Ko finished on top of the leaderboard in 2016 with scores of 6-under 278, setting up a playoff that Henderson won.\n\nThey were two of only seven players who were under par that week. Henderson, who was made an honorary member of Sahalee earlier this week, negotiated the challenge the trees bring as well as anyone in 2016.\n\n\"I love the huge, towering trees and the tight fairways,\" she said. \"It's almost majestic. It feels very peaceful and amazing, but at the same time it's a little bit\n\nstressful because you have to hit it so straight. That's the No. 1 priority this week is trying to hit a lot of fairways, keeping the ball in play, and giving yourself good looks for birdies when you can and making those\n\nclutch par saves when you need to.\n\n\"Remembering back to 2016, this course played really tough. Not very many people were under par at the end of the four days.\"\n\nWendy Ward, a four-time LPGA winner who lives in Spokane, had to tell out-of-state reporters this week that there is a big difference between the west side and east side of the state when it comes to terrain.\n\n\"They grow the trees a lot bigger over here, which I already knew,\" she said.\n\n\"I hit it a lot straighter than I used to, so I am hoping that isn't an issue.\"\n\nYuka Saso, who won her second U.S. Women's Open last month, watched the 2016 event at Sahalee on TV. She got her first in-person look this week.\n\n\"It's very narrow here compared to other golf courses that we play on,\" she said. \"It's going to be very, very difficult. Have to hit it straight and stay out of the trees. I think it makes us focus more. It makes me focus more when it's\n\ndifficult.\"\n\nRuoning Yin, who won this event last year, and is ranked No. 3 in the world, said, \"I think it's a very challenging course, and it's really tight for the tee shot.\"\n\nBut Yin has said she will try not to think about that.\n\n\"I think if you worry about it too much you're just going to screw yourself up,\" she said. \"So I try to not think about how tough the tee shot is. Just swing my swing and I'll be good.\"\n\nFor players, the trees and the nature at Sahalee bring a feeling of peace.\n\n\"When you're standing in the fairways, and walking the fairways, you don't feel like you're on a golf course,\" Henderson said. \"You just feel like you're in amongst nature. It's just a great feeling.\n\n\"I love just kind of looking around and breathing deep and feeling that fresh air. It's an incredible feeling.\"\n\nSaid Korda: \"You kind of get lost in the nature out here.\"\n\nBut then comes the challenge of avoiding those trees with their golf shots.\n\n\"I feel like it's a great mix of being intimidating and scary and also peaceful and\n\nbeautiful and calm,\" Henderson said. \"It's kind of opposites. Every tee shot you have to really pay attention to. You can never really take a break out here.\"\n\nFive marquee pairings Thursday\n\n7:49 a.m., hole No. 10: Rose Zhang, Celine Boutier, Nasa Hataoka -- Zhang, the ex-Stanford phenom, is ranked No. 9 in the world. Boutier is ranked No. 4.\n\n8:11 a.m., hole No. 10: Nelly Korda, Ruoning Yin, Hannah Green -- Korda looks for seventh win of season; Green her third. Yin is defending champ in this event.\n\n1:17 p.m., hole No. 1: -- Lilia Vu, Minjee Lee, Linn Grant -- Vu won last week and is ranked No. 2 in the world behind Korda. Lee is ranked No. 10\n\n1:28 p.m., hole No. 1: Lexi Thompson, Jin Young Ko, Yuki Saso -- Thompson, 29, retiring from the LPGA at the end of the season, is paired with two, two-time major winners.\n\n1:39 p.m., hole No. 1: Brooke Henderson, Lydia Ko, Ariya Jutanugarn -- the top three finishers from 2016 event are paired together for first two rounds.", "source": {"uri": "seattletimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Seattle Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "scott_hanson@seattletimes.com", "name": "Scott Hanson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_PGA_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Women's PGA Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sahalee_Country_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sahalee Country Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Women's_PGA_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2016 Women's PGA Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelly_Korda", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nelly Korda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sammamish,_Washington", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sammamish, Washington"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sammamish, Washington"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Women's_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Women's Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuka_Saso", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yuka Saso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooke_Henderson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brooke Henderson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lydia_Ko", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lydia Ko"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LPGA", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "LPGA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lilia_Vu", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lilia Vu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linn_Grant", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Linn Grant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rose_Zhang", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rose Zhang"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C\u00e9line_Boutier", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "C\u00e9line Boutier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannah_Green_(golfer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hannah Green (golfer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasa_Hataoka", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nasa Hataoka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariya_Jutanugarn", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ariya Jutanugarn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minjee_Lee", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minjee Lee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexi_Thompson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lexi Thompson"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Courses", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Courses", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Climbing/Tree_Climbing", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Climbing/Tree Climbing", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/tzr_124041.jpg?d=1020x655", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663563", "eventUri": "eng-9663563", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 137, "relevance": 1}

Yeah, really looking forward to it and hopefully try and do it again.\"\n\nKim is seeing the layout at Sahalee Country Club for the first time and will have to contend with a fired-up Korda, who has missed back-to-back cuts, a rarity for a player who has dominated like few others so far in 2024.\n\nKorda said she hadn't got lost in her recent downturn.\n\n\"You can dwell on the negatives, but that will never lead you anywhere, so you try it look at the positives,\" she said.\n\n\"I feel like pressure is privilege, and that's something that you're the only one that can kind of control that.

If I'm going to put more pressure on myself, then I think it's just going to make it even harder.\"\n\nA true test awaits at the Sahalee track, which has previously hosted a World Golf Championship and the US Senior Open.\n\nThe Ted Robinson-designed course was reworked by Rees Jones in 1996 and again in 2022 and the par-72 track is playing 6,731 yards this week.\n\nSahalee means 'high heavenly ground', and the tree-lined course - there are over 7,500 of them - should prove as tough a track, if not tougher, than it did when it last hosted the tournament in 2016, where Canadian Brooke Henderson secured the title, beating Lydia Ko after a play-off.\n\nThere is an eight-hour time difference, which means that Maguire, who is among the early starters, tees off alongside Japan's Ayaka Furue and England's Charley Hull at 4:22pm (Irish time).\n\nMeadow is among the late tee times and heads out for the opening two rounds in the company of Cheyenne Knight from the USA and Japan's Mao Saigo. They tee off at 10:01pm.", "source": {"uri": "rte.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "RTE.ie"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ed_leahy@rte.ie", "name": "Ed Leahy", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}],

Korda, following her recent feat of six victories (including five consecutive wins), has faced unexpected setbacks with consecutive missed cuts, including one at a Major (US Women's Open).\n\nIn contrast, Lilia Vu returned last week with a victory at the Meijer LPGA Classic after a two-month hiatus due to injury, and now aims to close the gap of over five points from the top spot she once held. Regardless of recent form, Nelly Korda remains the undisputed favorite, having claimed the first Major of 2024 (The Chevron Championship) and previously winning this event in 2021, though Lilia Vu's prospects have been rising.\n\nRuoning Yin receives less attention despite two top-ten finishes this year; however, predicting outcomes with such a strong field is always challenging. Among the contenders for the title are the other top-ten players in the world: Celine Boutier, Hannah Green (winner in 2019), Yuka Saso (winner of the US Women's Open, the second Major), Jin Young Ko, Charley Hull, Rose Zhang, and Minjee Lee.\n\nNotable figures on the LPGA Tour include past winners Brooke M. Henderson (2016), Lydia Ko, Megan Khang, and emerging talents such as Linn Grant and Maja Stark. The Sahalee Country Club, designed in 1969 by Ted Robinson and redesigned by Rees Jones in 1996, hosts the event for the second time, following its previous stint in 2016.\n\nFor Roberta Liti, this presents a significant opportunity to gain valuable experience in her first full season on the LPGA Tour, having already finished in the money seven times in her first ten events. The total purse for the championship stands at $10,000,000.\n\nEstablished in 1955, the tournament was originally exclusive to professionals until the rule was amended in 2005 to include amateurs. Formerly known as the LPGA Championship, the event has undergone multiple name changes before adopting its current title.\n\nSponsored by KPMG since 2015, the prize money has seen substantial increases in recent years, rising from $4.5 million in 2021 to the current $10 million, consistent with the 2023 edition. Nine past winners are in the field, including mentioned contenders like Korda, Ruoning, Green, and Henderson, alongside Sei-Young Kim (2020), Danielle Kang (2017), Cristie Kerr (2010), Anna Nordqvist (2009), and Yani Tseng (2008, 2011), the only multiple-time winner still active.\n\nMickey Wright holds the record with four victories, followed by Kathy Whitworth, Nancy Lopez, Patty Sheehan, Se Ri Pak, and Inbee Park with three each. Annika Sorenstam and Inbee Park are the only players to have achieved consecutive wins twice, joined once by Juli Inkster, Patty Sheehan, and Mickey Wright.", "source": {"uri": "tennisworldusa.org",

But parts of the morning were a scramble for Korda as the Douglass fir, red cedar and hemlock trees of Sahalee played their role in making it a challenge. A double bogey on the par-4 fourth hole dropped her back to 2 under.\n\n\"If you try and be aggressive when you've hit it off line, it just bites you in the butt,\" Korda said. \"Overall I think I played pretty well. I took my chances where I could and I played safe the majority of the round.\"\n\nKorda dropped a 15-foot putt on the par-3 ninth hole to take a one-shot advantage.\n\nSeven players were one shot back, including Allisen Corpuz, Celine Boutier, Charley Hull and Leona Maguire. Maguire led this tournament after the third round last year at Baltusrol, but shot 74 on the final day and finished four shots back of the winner, Ruoning Yin.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Hit a lot of fairways and greens. But it does feel like a course where once you're out of position it's tough to get back on track,\" said Corpuz, ho has an outside chance of making the Olympics for the United States with a strong finish this week.\n\nThe third major of the year on the LPGA Tour returned to Sahalee, which previously hosted in 2016.\n\nAnd Korda got off to a far better start than her last major, when she shot 80 in the opening round of the U.S. Women's Open three weeks ago.\n\nKorda early run of birdies included three straight between Nos. 13-15 and she and went out in 33. She moved to 4 under after a birdie on the third hole -- her 12th of the day -- but dropped two shots on the fourth. Her tee shot on the 398-yard hole ended up tucked behind a tree and after pitching out, her third shot failed to clear a ridge and rolled back toward the front of the green.\n\nKorda was able to scramble out of trouble a few times, including the par-5 second hole when she pulled a fairway wood into a cluster of trees left the green and salvaged par.\n\n\"This entire golf course is so demanding. I had to make some pretty good up-and-downs,\" Korda said.\n\nThe afternoon wave included Lexi Thompson; Lilia Vu, who won last week in her return from a back injury; Brooke Henderson, the 2016 winner at Sahalee; and Yuka Saso, the U.S. Women's Open winner.\n\n0 Comments Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand

{"id": 223668756, "title": "Police drones responding to 911 calls in Colorado? &#8220;This really is the future of law enforcement.&#8221;", "text": "Picture this: You call 911 and a drone comes whirring to your door instead of a police officer. That could soon be a reality along parts of Colorado\u2019s Front Range. A handful of local law enforcement agencies are considering using drones as first responders \u2014 that is, sending them in response to 911 calls \u2014 as police departments across Colorado continue to widely embrace the use of the remote-controlled flying machines. Even the Denver Police Department, which long has resisted drones, is now launching its own program and wants to eventually use them to respond to 911 calls across the city. \u201cThis really is the future of law enforcement at some point, whether we like it or not,\u201d said Sgt. Jeremiah Gates, who leads the drone unit at the Arapahoe County Sheriff\u2019s Office. Like at least 20 Front Range agencies, the Arapahoe County Sheriff\u2019s Office already uses drones for tasks that include searching for missing people, mapping crime or crash scenes, providing overhead surveillance during SWAT operations or tracking fleeing suspects. But now, the sheriff\u2019s office is considering using its 20 drones to respond to certain 911 calls, sending them both instead of officers and ahead of officers, Gates said. A remote-controlled drone could be flown to the location of an incident to scope out the area and stream live video back to its operator, who could provide quick, detailed information to responding officers about what\u2019s going on. Or a drone might be the sole response to the 911 call if the operator can determine from the air that officers don\u2019t need to respond. It\u2019s a fledgling but growing trend across policing, and one that raises alarm for American Civil Liberties Union of Colorado staff attorney Laura Moraff. \u201cWe\u2019re worried about what it would mean if drones were really just all over the skies in Colorado,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are worried about what that would mean for First Amendment activities, for speech and organizing and protesting \u2014 because being surveilled by law enforcement, including by drones, can change the way people speak and protest.\u201d The Arapahoe County Sheriff\u2019s Office is in the \u201cvery early stages\u201d of considering the expanded use and has yet to consider logistics like cost, equipment and public input. But Gates envisions a world where a drone is dispatched to a call about a broken traffic light or a suspicious vehicle instead of a sheriff\u2019s deputy, allowing actual deputies to prioritize more pressing calls for help. \u201cI could fly the drone over (a reported suspicious vehicle) and say, \u2018Hey, that vehicle is not out of place,\u2019 and I never had to send an officer over to bother them and I can clear it with that,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s saving resources.\u201d A drone could be flown to a reported broken traffic light and stream video of the traffic signal back to its operator, who could determine whether the light is working properly and take the appropriate next steps without ever sending an officer physically to the scene, Gates said. Drones, which don\u2019t have to deal with traffic congestion, typically arrive on scene faster than officers, so sending them ahead of deputies on higher priority calls could also help keep all involved safe, Gates said. Drones sent out to 911 calls could provide live video of a suspect breaking into a house, help officers follow a suspect in a foot chase, or identify the exact location of a suicidal person, he said. \u201cWhat if we get a call about someone with a gun, and the drone is able to get overhead and see it\u2019s not a gun before law enforcement ever contacts them?\u201d he said. But Moraff said flying drones to low-level reports could just shift the longstanding over-policing of communities of color to the skies. \u201cWe know there is a problem with people reporting Black people doing normal everyday things as if there is something suspicious going on,\u201d she said. \u201cSo sending out a drone for any time there is a 911 call, it could be dangerous and lead to more over-policing of communities of color. There is also just the risk that the more that we normalize having drones in the skies, the more it can really affect behavior on a massive scale, if we are just looking up and seeing drones all over the place, knowing that police are watching us.\u201d Some agencies, like the Weld County Sheriff\u2019s Office, have policies that prohibit using drones for surveillance alone. Others, like the Littleton Police Department, use drones \u201cproactively during large public events to monitor certain areas,\u201d spokeswoman Sheera Poelman said. Loveland police Sgt. Bryan Bartnes, who runs his department\u2019s drone program, said a drone could potentially deliver an automated external defibrillator to a patient several minutes before first responders arrive. Already, the police department\u2019s largest drone can carry a load of up to 16 pounds, he said, though the agency has not yet taken steps toward launching the flying craft as first responders. \u201cOne drawback to it is, obviously, it requires the citizen on scene to apply it and put it on,\u201d Bartnes said of the hypothetical defibrillator delivery. \u201cDrones don\u2019t do that yet.\u201d There are also practical barriers: drones have limited range, can be expensive and police departments must follow extensive Federal Aviation Administration regulations around flights, including, often, keeping the drone within an operator\u2019s or observer\u2019s line of sight. In Commerce City, where drones have been part of policing since 2020, the police department is considering using drones to respond to 911 calls within the next year, said Ben Birdsell, the department\u2019s community service officer supervisor. \u201cWhat we see out of it is, it\u2019s a lot cheaper than an officer, basically,\u201d he said. After resisting, Denver now launching program At the Denver Police Department, former Chief Robert White said no to drones in 2013 over constitutional concerns, and the department in 2018 literally shelved its sole drone, halting the program in Denver even as close to 20 metro police agencies embraced the unmanned aircraft. Denver\u2019s SWAT team uses a single drone for limited indoor searches, and only in emergency situations and with approval, police spokesman Doug Schepman said. The agency also operates one outdoor drone, but has historically relied on the Denver Fire Department to provide drones for other uses. Now, the department is standing up its own drone program, using a $100,000 grant from the Denver Police Foundation to kickstart the effort. Denver police expect to buy several drones with that money and begin a traditional drone program in the next six to 12 months. \u201cIt\u2019s beginning to lift off,\u201d said Phil Gonshak, director of the department\u2019s Strategic Initiatives Bureau. Denver police already have several licensed drone pilots on the force. But the ultimate goal is to use drones as first responders, he said. \u201cThe long-term scope of what we are trying to do is drones as first responders,\u201d he said. \u201cBasically, having stations on top of each one of our districts so we can respond with drones to critical needs or emergencies that arise throughout the city.\u201d Such an effort would cost around $1.5 million to $2 million, he said \u2014 funding the police department doesn\u2019t yet have. He expects such a program would reduce police response times and improve officers\u2019 ability to solve crimes by getting drones on scene and collecting video evidence in minutes. \u201cWe would never simply replace calls-for-service response by police officers,\u201d he said. \u201cThe DPD would respond to any call for service where someone is physically requesting a police officer on scene. But if there was a fight at Colfax and Cherokee and we put a drone in the air and there is no fight and nothing causing traffic issues, then we would reroute our police officers to other emergent calls.\u201d The Denver Police Department already has a detailed, five-page policy on drone use, including a section on \u201cDrones as a First Responder Program.\u201d The short section notes that sending drones to calls before officers could help \u201ctailor the response appropriately to avoid unnecessary escalation,\u201d but doesn\u2019t lay out how such a program would work. The current policy outlines permitted uses for drones, which include helping to apprehend fleeing suspects, assisting the bomb squad or SWAT team, documenting a crime scene or crash, assisting in missing person or rescue operations, and responding to reports of shots fired. The policy also allows drones for emergency uses as authorized by department leadership. Gonshak hopes to create a public-facing dashboard detailing Denver police drone flights as the program starts in earnest, and said drones will be flown with their cameras constantly on so that the department can ensure the aircraft are being used appropriately. \u201cSo there is no question about what we are doing, because I know there is concern about us flying drones and peering through windows without search warrants,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to be very public-conscientious in our efforts.\u201d Privacy, transparency concerns A handful of police departments outside of Colorado already use drones as first responders. In Chula Vista, California, drones have been dispatched instead of officers to more than 4,000 calls since 2018, allowing officers to avoid going to those calls altogether, according to statistics posted on the city\u2019s website. So far this year, drones arrived to priority calls in Chula Vista in just under four minutes on average, while officers arrived in about seven minutes, according to the city\u2019s published statistics. On less urgent calls, drones reached the scene in under five minutes while officers took more than 11 minutes, the statistics show. The city publicly posts maps of its drone flights with details about the location, time and type of call the drones responded to, and drone footage is subject to the same public record release laws and storage retention as officers\u2019 body-worn camera footage. The city also relies on a Technology & Privacy Task Force, made up of residents and experts, to guide its drone use. It\u2019s critical for law enforcement agencies to be transparent about how and when they use drones, and to listen to residents about what they want in a drone program, the ACLU\u2019s Moraff said. She worries police departments will start using drones within set guardrails, but then secretly expand the use of the technology beyond what is legal or appropriate as drones become more ubiquitous. \u201cThe cheaper this technology gets, and the easier it gets to deploy, the more risk there is that it will be used everywhere, and used in circumstances when it is not necessary,\u201d she said. The civil rights organization can see uses for drones in policing \u2014 particularly in response to specific, serious incidents, she said. But agencies must ensure they\u2019re operating within the law. \u201cSafety and security are not just about reducing crime, prosecuting people and finding evidence,\u201d Moraff said. \u201cA truly safe community is one in which people are free to express their views, to organize together and live their lives without unjustified government intrusion.\u201d Sign up to get crime news sent straight to your inbox each day.", "summary": "Even the Denver Police Department, which long has resisted drones, is now launching its own program and wants to eventually use them to respond to 911 calls across the city.", "url": "https://www.denverpost.com/2024/05/26/colorado-police-drones-first-responders/", "image": "https://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/TDP-L-policedrone051424-cha-116.jpg?w=1024", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 12:00:15", "author": "Shelly Bradbury", "authors": ["Shelly Bradbury"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.275}

{"id": 225104450, "title": "Guitarist and oud master Rami Gabriel releases a multifaceted solo debut", "text": "Chicago multi-instrumentalist Rami Gabriel began dabbling in home recording as a teenager in the 1990s, and last week he finally put out his first solo album, the Sooper Records release That\u2019s What I Been Sayin\u2019. Playing in a variety of contexts, he\u2019s already amassed a heady, eclectic catalog that traverses styles and disciplines. For his debut under his own name, he decided to combine as many of them as he could. \u201cI thought, \u2018What if I put all this stuff together instead of making what I\u2019ve been always doing,\u2019\u201d Gabriel says, \u201cwhich is, I make my weird record, I put it out, and it\u2019s for the freaks and for very few people. I put out the jazz record for the jazz people, and I put out the Arabic record for the Arab people. I thought, \u2018You know what, I\u2019m just gonna put stuff together and I\u2019m gonna sing in public,\u2019 which I have avoided doing for many reasons. This record is really a way of bringing together all the stuff I\u2019ve been doing under one name.\u201d Born in Lebanon, Gabriel started playing guitar at age 12 and oud at 16. As a teenager, he immersed himself in Toronto\u2019s underground punk scene by playing in under-the-radar bands. In the late 90s, he moved to California for college and expanded his musical range. He joined a couple of jazz ensembles\u2014one in the mold of \u201cjazz manouche\u201d guitarist Django Reinhardt, the other a free-jazz collective that hosted an experimental music night in Santa Barbara. He also began a deeper study of the oud. \u201cI learned from a teacher named Scott Marcus, who is an expert on music from all over the Arab world,\u201d Gabriel says. \u201cI started learning all the repertoire, and then I started learning the maqam system.\u201d Gabriel moved to Chicago in 2007 to teach psychology at Columbia College. He\u2019s since published three books, most recently last year\u2019s A Suspicious Science: The Uses of Psychology. All the while Gabriel has maintained a busy music career. In the Arab Blues, he melds traditional Middle Eastern music with Delta blues in collaboration with celebrated Egyptian percussionist Karim Nagi. Gabriel also leads Rami & the Reliables, a soulful rock combo with drummer Alex Hall (who runs Reliable Recorders) and Hall\u2019s Flat Five bandmates Casey McDonough and Scott Ligon (both of whom play in NRBQ). Levy devised a three-part odyssey for Candy, and in the second part, she\u2019s a pop star. Last fall he began introducing the world to Candy through her music, releasing a video for the song \u201cCandy Girl.\u201d The track also appears on the February 2024 EP Candy in the House of a Thousand Hearts. Levy is a cinephile whose influences include 2001: A Space Odyssey, Jodorowsky\u2019s Holy Mountain, and Quentin Tarantino. He directed, produced, and edited the new video for \u201cJuicy\u201d with help from director of photography Ethan Schoenborn, assistant producer Hannah Loessberg, and Steadicam operator Sam Tudor-Hidy. Candy wears a black Anna Wintour\u2013style bob and smudged eye makeup and dances in an empty warehouse, switching looks from shot to shot: a jean skirt with elbow-length red gloves and 2000s-style pink shades; a long, sleeveless black dress with a floor-length red scarf and red heels; an angelic white drape. \u201cThere is an exhibitionist aspect to this job,\u201d Levy says. \u201cI\u2019m trying to create a new form, a postgender, post-sexuality being. What the story is, what the character is, it\u2019s really like the nectar of my creativity\u2014the juice of what I am as a person.\u201d", "summary": "<figure><img width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/chicagoreader.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Rami-Gabriel_Credit-Noor-Shawaf_2_social.jpg?fit=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"attachment-rss-image-size size-rss-image-size wp-post-image\" alt=\"a dim, murky Polaroid photo of Rami Gabriel playing a reddish hollow-body guitar and looking out of frame to the left, cropped so that the guitar is barely visible\" decoding=\"async\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/chicagoreader.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Rami-Gabriel_Credit-Noor-Shawaf_2_social.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/chicagoreader.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Rami-Gabriel_Credit-Noor-Shawaf_2_social.jpg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/chicagoreader.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Rami-Gabriel_Credit-Noor-Shawaf_2_social.jpg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/chicagoreader.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Rami-Gabriel_Credit-Noor-Shawaf_2_social.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/chicagor", "url": "https://chicagoreader.com/music/gossip-wolf/rami-gabriel-sayin-sooper-martin-levy-candy-juicy/", "image": "https://chicagoreader.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Rami-Gabriel_Credit-Noor-Shawaf_2_social.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 14:21:23", "author": "DMB Debbie-Marie Brown and Leor Galil", "authors": ["DMB Debbie-Marie Brown and Leor Galil"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.959}

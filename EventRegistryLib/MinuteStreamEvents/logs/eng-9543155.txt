It's believed the powerful weapon was used in the shocking shooting that saw 20-year-old Josh Itseli murdered in a suspected ambush incident on the Knocknarea Road in Drimnagh in the early hours of Monday morning.\n\nLocals have told how as many as 20 shots were heard as a \"Wild West\" style shootout that appeared to take place in the middle of the streets - resulting in Josh's tragic death. It is believed the young man was shot following a collision between a Volkswagen Golf and a Mercedes vehicle, just outside a school, at 12.15am on Bank Holiday Monday.\n\nRead more: First picture of Drimnagh shooting victim killed in 'wild west shootout'\n\nRead more: Bomb squad called to scene where young man was shot to death in Drimnagh\n\nGarda\u00ed believe a dispute between two rival gangs spiralled out of control and turned into a violent incident that also saw gang members bringing a pipe bomb to the scene. However, sources say the device, which has since been made safe by the army's Explosive Ordinance Unit on Monday, was not used, and was recovered near the scene.\n\nTwo men and a teenager in a badly damaged Ford Focus vehicle were then apprehended by armed Garda\u00ed near the Our Lady of Good Counsel church nearby. They were subsequently arrested and are now being detained at a number of Garda stations - while Garda\u00ed formally launch a murder investigation.\n\nShocked family and friends of Josh arrived at the scene on Monday afternoon, and told the Irish Mirror that they are looking for answers as to what exactly happened. One family friend told us: \"It's shocking. You usually hear someone gets sick or died, but no, for just someone to finish everything in one minute. We are very shocked.\"\n\nThe family friend told how Josh's mother, who they said met with Garda\u00ed earlier today, is in a state of shock. \"She knows everything. She's shocked and is not saying anything for the moment. Just crying. We need to know what happened exactly. We know Josh since he was small. He goes to school here. He was born here\".\n\nFamily friends told us that Josh's family are originally from the Congo and that the young man was born and went to school here. He also has two sisters.\n\nThe incident has been widely condemned, with Minister for Justice Helen McEntee stating: \"The attack in Drimnagh last night is not something we will tolerate on our streets. I commend the Garda\u00ed for responding quickly, resulting in the speedy arrest of suspects. Tackling crime and ensuring safer streets continues to be a top priority for this Government.\"\n\nMeanwhile speaking at a press conference outside Sundrive Garda Station on Monday, Superintendent Paul Maher confirmed that a murder investigation has been launched - and told how officers tried to save the victim's life at the scene. \"Last night at approximately 12.15am Garda\u00ed received a number of calls in relation to shots being fired at Knocknarea Road in Drimnagh, Dublin 12.\n\n\"Gardai responding to the scene discovered two vehicles, a black Mercedes Benz, a Volkswagen Golf, which appeared to have been in a collision. A male in his early 20s was discovered with gunshot wounds.\n\n\"Responding Garda\u00ed offered first aid. Despite attempts by Garda\u00ed, Dublin Fire Brigade paramedics the male was pronounced deceased at the scene. Our thoughts are with the deceased's family at this time,\" he said.\n\nThe Superintendent also confirmed the discovery of the pipe bomb device. \"Garda\u00ed became aware of a potential explosive device at Knocknarea Court. The army's Explosive Ordinance Team was requested to attend the scene.\n\n\"The device was made safe by the army OD team and removed from the scene. This device will be subject to further technical examination.\" He also told how armed Garda\u00ed apprehended three suspects nearby - one of whom is a teenager.\n\n\"Shortly after the reports of the shooting, the Garda Regional Armed Support Unit encountered three men on Slieve Bloom Road. Two are in their early 20s and one is a teenage youth.\n\n\"The three men were arrested and are detained under Section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act. The scene at Knocknarea Road has been sealed off. The body of the deceased remains at the scene at this time.\n\n\"A number of other vehicles have been damaged at Knocknarea Road and remain part of the scene and the technical examination. Another vehicle of interest has been identified and is also the subject of technical examination at the moment, and this is a silver Ford Focus.\"\n\nThe senior officer also confirmed a murder investigation has been established - and that the body of the deceased remains at the scene. \"An incident room has been established at Sundrive Road Garda Station under the direction of a Senior Investigating Officer. A family liaison officer has been appointed and a formal identification of the deceased has still to take place.\n\n\"There are a number of scenes right now which are subject to a technical examination by the Garda Technical Bureau at headquarters and the divisional scenes of crime unit. The office of the State Pathologist and the coroner have also been notified.\"\n\nIn an appeal for witnesses he added: \"Investigating Garda\u00ed are appealing for any witnesses to this incident to come forward. In particular we are appealing for any person with dash cam or any other form of vehicle video footage and who were in the Knocknarea area last night between 11:30pm last night and 12:30 to make that footage available to An Garda Siochana.

Locals have told how as many as 10 shots were heard as a \"Wild West\" style shootout appeared to take place in the middle of the streets last night - resulting in Josh's tragic death on the Knocknarea Road.\n\nIt is believed the young man was shot following a collision between a Volkswagen Golf and a Mercedes vehicle, just outside a school, at 12:15AM on Bank Holiday Monday. Gardai believe a dispute between two rival gangs spiralled out of control and turned into a violent incident that also saw gang members bringing a pipe bomb to the scene.\n\nRead more: Bomb squad called to scene where young man was shot to death in Drimnagh\n\nRead more: Tributes pour in for teen girl killed in Wicklow crash\n\nHowever sources say the device, which has since been made safe by the army's Explosive Ordinance Unit on Monday, was not used, and was recovered near the scene. Two men and a teenager in a badly damaged Ford Focus vehicle were then apprehended by armed gardai near the Our Lady of Good Counsel church nearby.\n\nThey were subsequently arrested and are now being detained at a number of Garda stations - while Gardai formally launch a murder investigation. Shocked family and friends of Josh arrived at the scene on Monday afternoon, and told the Irish Mirror that they are looking for answers as to what exactly happened.\n\nOne family friend told us: \"It's shocking. You usually hear someone gets sick or died, but no, for just someone to finish everything in one minute. We are very shocked.\"\n\nThe family friend told how Josh's mother, who they said met with gardai earlier today, is in a state of shock. \"She knows everything. She's shocked and is not saying anything for the moment. Just crying. We need to know what happened exactly. We know Josh since he was small. He goes to school here. He was born here\".\n\nFamily friends told us that Josh's family are originally from the Congo, and that the young man was born and went to school here. He also has two sisters. The incident has been widely condemned, with Minister for Justice Helen McEntee stating: \"The attack in Drimnagh last night is not something we will tolerate on our streets. I commend the Garda\u00ed for responding quickly, resulting in the speedy arrest of suspects.\n\n\"Tackling crime and ensuring safer streets continues to be a top priority for this Government.\" Meanwhile speaking at a press conference outside Sundrive Garda Station Superintendent Paul Maher confirmed that a murder investigation has been launched - and told how officers tried to save the victim's life at the scene.\n\n\"Last night at approximately 12:15am gardai received a number of calls in relation to shots being fired at Knocknarea Road in Drimnagh, Dublin 12. Gardai responding to the scene discovered two vehicles, a black Mercedes Benz, a Volkswagen Golf, which appeared to have been in a collision. A male in his early 20s was discovered with gunshot wounds.\n\n\"Responding gardai offered first aid. Despite attempts by gardai, Dublin Fire Brigade paramedics the male was pronounced deceased at the scene. Our thoughts are with the deceased's family at this time,\" he said.\n\nThe Superintendent also confirmed the discovery of the pipe bomb device. Gardai became aware of a potential explosive device at Knocknarea Court.\n\n\"The army's Explosive Ordinance Team was requested to attend the scene. The device was made safe by the army OD team and removed from the scene. This device will be subject to further technical examination.\"\n\nHe also told how armed gardai apprehended three suspects nearby - one of whom is a teenager. \"Shortly after the reports of the shooting, the Garda Regional Armed Support Unit encountered three men on Slieve Bloom Road\n\n\"Two are in their early 20s and one is a teenage youth. The three men were arrested and are detained under Section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act.\n\n\"The scene at Knocknarea Road has been sealed off. The body of the deceased remains at the scene at this time.\n\n\"A number of other vehicles have been damaged at Knocknarea Road and remain part of the scene and the technical examination. Another vehicle of interest has been identified and is also the subject of technical examination at the moment, and this is a silver Ford Focus.\"\n\nThe senior officer also confirmed a murder investigation has been established - and that the body of the deceased remains at the scene. \"An incident room has been established at Sundrive Road Garda Station under the direction of a Senior Investigating Officer.\n\n\"A family liaison officer has been appointed and a formal identification of the deceased has still to take place. There are a number of scenes right now which are subject to a technical examination by the Garda Technical Bureau at headquarters and the divisional scenes of crime unit.\n\n\"The office of the State Pathologist and the coroner have also been notified.\" In an appeal for witnesses he added: \"Investigating gardai are appealing for any witnesses to this incident to come forward.\n\n\"In particular we are appealing for any person with dash cam or any other form of vehicle video footage and who were in the Knocknarea area last night between 11:30pm last night and 12:30 to make that footage available to An Garda Siochana. An Garda Siochana are also appealing to anyone with CCTV in the wider area of Cooley Road, Brandon Road, Crumlin Road, and the associated side roads to make that footage available to An Garda Siochana.\n\n\"Anyone with any information who can please assist An Garda Siochana with this murder investigation are asked to contact Sundrive Garda Station at 666 66 00 or the Garda Confidential Line on 1800 666 111 or indeed any Garda station.\"\n\nFor all the latest news from Dublin and surrounding areas visit our homepage.\n\nJoin our Dublin Live breaking news service on WhatsApp. Click this link to receive your daily dose of Dublin Live content.

You usually hear someone gets sick or died, but no, for just someone to finish everything in one minute. We are very shocked.\"\n\nThe family friend told how Josh's mother, who they said met with Garda\u00ed earlier today, is in a state of shock.\n\n\"She knows everything. She's shocked and is not saying anything for the moment. Just crying. We need to know what happened exactly. We know Josh since he was small. He goes to school here. He was born here\".\n\nFamily friends told us that Josh's family are originally from the Congo and that the young man was born and went to school here. He also has two sisters.\n\nThe incident has been widely condemned, with Minister for Justice Helen McEntee stating: \"The attack in Drimnagh last night is not something we will tolerate on our streets. I commend the Garda\u00ed for responding quickly, resulting in the speedy arrest of suspects. Tackling crime and ensuring safer streets continues to be a top priority for this Government.\"\n\nMeanwhile speaking at a press conference outside Sundrive Garda Station on Monday, Superintendent Paul Maher confirmed that a murder investigation has been launched - and told how officers tried to save the victim's life at the scene.\n\n\"Last night at approximately 12.15am Garda\u00ed received a number of calls in relation to shots being fired at Knocknarea Road in Drimnagh, Dublin 12.\n\n\"Gardai responding to the scene discovered two vehicles, a black Mercedes Benz, a Volkswagen Golf, which appeared to have been in a collision. A male in his early 20s was discovered with gunshot wounds.\n\n\"Responding Garda\u00ed offered first aid. Despite attempts by Garda\u00ed, Dublin Fire Brigade paramedics the male was pronounced deceased at the scene.\n\n\"Our thoughts are with the deceased's family at this time,\" he said.\n\nThe Superintendent also confirmed the discovery of the pipe bomb device.\n\n\"Garda\u00ed became aware of a potential explosive device at Knocknarea Court. The army's Explosive Ordinance Team was requested to attend the scene.\n\n\"The device was made safe by the army OD team and removed from the scene. This device will be subject to further technical examination.\"\n\nHe also told how armed Garda\u00ed apprehended three suspects nearby - one of whom is a teenager.\n\n\"Shortly after the reports of the shooting, the Garda Regional Armed Support Unit encountered three men on Slieve Bloom Road. Two are in their early 20s and one is a teenage youth.\n\n\"The three men were arrested and are detained under Section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act. The scene at Knocknarea Road has been sealed off. The body of the deceased remains at the scene at this time.\n\n\"A number of other vehicles have been damaged at Knocknarea Road and remain part of the scene and the technical examination. Another vehicle of interest has been identified and is also the subject of technical examination at the moment, and this is a silver Ford Focus.\"\n\nThe senior officer also confirmed a murder investigation has been established - and that the body of the deceased remains at the scene.\n\n\"An incident room has been established at Sundrive Road Garda Station under the direction of a Senior Investigating Officer. A family liaison officer has been appointed and a formal identification of the deceased has still to take place.\n\n\"There are a number of scenes right now which are subject to a technical examination by the Garda Technical Bureau at headquarters and the divisional scenes of crime unit. The office of the State Pathologist and the coroner have also been notified.\"\n\nIn an appeal for witnesses he added: \"Investigating Garda\u00ed are appealing for any witnesses to this incident to come forward. In particular we are appealing for any person with dash cam or any other form of vehicle video footage and who were in the Knocknarea area last night between 11:30pm last night and 12:30 to make that footage available to An Garda Siochana.\n\n\"An Garda Siochana are also appealing to anyone with CCTV in the wider area of Cooley Road, Brandon Road, Crumlin Road, and the associated side roads to make that footage available to An Garda Siochana.\n\n\"Anyone with any information who can please assist An Garda Siochana with this murder investigation are asked to contact Sundrive Garda Station at 666 66 00 or the Garda Confidential Line on 1800 666 111 or indeed any Garda station.\"\n\nJoin the Irish Mirror's breaking news service on WhatsApp. Click this link to receive breaking news and the latest headlines direct to your phone.

You usually hear someone gets sick or died, but no, for just someone to finish everything in one minute. We are very shocked.\"\n\nThe family friend told how Josh's mother, who they said met with gardai earlier today, is in a state of shock.\n\n\"She knows everything. She's shocked and is not saying anything for the moment. Just crying. We need to know what happened exactly. We know Josh since he was small. He goes to school here. He was born here\".\n\nFamily friends told us that Josh's family are originally from the Congo, and that the young man was born and went to school here.\n\nHe also has two sisters. The incident has been widely condemned, with Minister for Justice Helen McEntee stating: \"The attack in Drimnagh last night is not something we will tolerate on our streets. I commend the Garda\u00ed for responding quickly, resulting in the speedy arrest of suspects.\n\n\"Tackling crime and ensuring safer streets continues to be a top priority for this Government.\"\n\nMeanwhile speaking at a press conference outside Sundrive Garda Station Superintendent Paul Maher confirmed that a murder investigation has been launched - and told how officers tried to save the victim's life at the scene.\n\n\"Last night at approximately 12:15am gardai received a number of calls in relation to shots being fired at Knocknarea Road in Drimnagh, Dublin 12.\n\n\"Gardai responding to the scene discovered two vehicles, a black Mercedes Benz, a Volkswagen Golf, which appeared to have been in a collision. A male in his early 20s was discovered with gunshot wounds.\n\n\"Responding gardai offered first aid. Despite attempts by gardai, Dublin Fire Brigade paramedics the male was pronounced deceased at the scene. Our thoughts are with the deceased's family at this time,\" he said.\n\nThe Superintendent also confirmed the discovery of the pipe bomb device. Gardai became aware of a potential explosive device at Knocknarea Court.\n\n\"The army's Explosive Ordinance Team was requested to attend the scene. The device was made safe by the army OD team and removed from the scene. This device will be subject to further technical examination.\"\n\nHe also told how armed gardai apprehended three suspects nearby - one of whom is a teenager. \"Shortly after the reports of the shooting, the Garda Regional Armed Support Unit encountered three men on Slieve Bloom Road\n\n\"Two are in their early 20s and one is a teenage youth. The three men were arrested and are detained under Section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act.\n\n\"The scene at Knocknarea Road has been sealed off. The body of the deceased remains at the scene at this time.\n\n\"A number of other vehicles have been damaged at Knocknarea Road and remain part of the scene and the technical examination.\n\n\"Another vehicle of interest has been identified and is also the subject of technical examination at the moment, and this is a silver Ford Focus.\"\n\nThe senior officer also confirmed a murder investigation has been established - and that the body of the deceased remains at the scene.\n\n\"An incident room has been established at Sundrive Road Garda Station under the direction of a Senior Investigating Officer.\n\n\"A family liaison officer has been appointed and a formal identification of the deceased has still to take place.\n\n\"There are a number of scenes right now which are subject to a technical examination by the Garda Technical Bureau at headquarters and the divisional scenes of crime unit.\n\n\"The office of the State Pathologist and the coroner have also been notified.\" In an appeal for witnesses he added: \"Investigating gardai are appealing for any witnesses to this incident to come forward.\n\n\"In particular we are appealing for any person with dash cam or any other form of vehicle video footage and who were in the Knocknarea area last night between 11:30pm last night and 12:30 to make that footage available to An Garda Siochana.\n\n\"An Garda Siochana are also appealing to anyone with CCTV in the wider area of Cooley Road, Brandon Road, Crumlin Road, and the associated side roads to make that footage available to An Garda Siochana.\n\n\"Anyone with any information who can please assist An Garda Siochana with this murder investigation are asked to contact Sundrive Garda Station at 666 66 00 or the Garda Confidential Line on 1800 666 111 or indeed any Garda station.\"\n\nJoin the Irish Mirror's breaking news service on WhatsApp. Click this link to receive breaking news and the latest headlines direct to your phone.

It appears the victim's vehicle crashed to a halt and further shots were fired into that car. Garda\u00ed believe the gunmen then tried to escape from the area in their car but then crashed into several vehicles and had to abandon their vehicle.\n\nA major Garda operation was under way in the area throughout Monday, with several crime scenes sealed off. They include the location at Knocknarea Road where the crashed car the victim had been in was still visible. The nearby Our Lady of Good Counsel church was also sealed off as a crime scene as the getaway car used by the killers was left abandoned there.\n\nThe parish centre at the end of Knocknarea Road was also sealed off and it appeared some stray rounds from the shooting had been fired into it.\n\nResidents living immediately adjacent to the murder scene were taken from their homes in the early hours after an explosive device was discovered in the area.\n\nOne local man who spoke to The Irish Times said people were alerted to the attack by the sound of a large number of gunshots. \"You could hear it, 'pop, pop, pop, pop, pop'. I saw one of them running, with a gun. And then of course there was loads of garda\u00ed in the area, all over the place and blocking off the roads,\" he said.\n\n\"It's desperate to hear of a young fella being killed like this. And you'd never hear things like that the last few years. It all seemed to have completely quietened down.\"\n\nOther local people said they could hear the Garda helicopter overhead and some believed the killers' car had sped down Curlew Road, to the junction of Knocknarea Road, meeting the car carrying the victim and opening fire on it.\n\nSupt Paul Maher, of Crumlin-Terenure community engagement team, said that when garda\u00ed arrived at the scene they discovered two vehicles - a Mercedes and VW Golf - which appeared to have been in collision on Knocknarea Road.\n\n\"A male in his early 20s was discovered with gunshot wounds,\" he said. \"Responding garda\u00ed offered first aid and despite attempts by garda\u00ed and Dublin Fire Brigade paramedics, the male was pronounced deceased at the scene and our thoughts are with the deceased's family.\"\n\nAn examination of the scene led to the discovery of an explosive device on nearby Knocknarea Court, with residents evacuated and the Army's explosive ordinance disposal team called in. That device was made safe at the scene and is undergoing technical examination.\n\nSup Maher added when members of the Garda's regional Armed Support Unit arrived in the area they encountered three men - two aged in their 20s and one a teenager - on nearly Slievebloom Road and arrested them.\n\nAs well as the two vehicles on Knocknarea Road, another car - a badly damaged Ford Focus - was discovered in Sperrin Road and was being examined.\n\nCllr Daith\u00ed Doolan, of the Ballyfermot-Drimnagh electoral area, said local people he had spoken to were very shocked the events in the early hours.

Then I could hear around 20 shots or more and a lot of shouting,\" she said.\n\n\"Then a car reversed up the road at speed and I've heard since that it was crashing into things as it was moving back, and it drove away. It was like something from the Wild West.\"\n\nOther residents told of seeing a car chase on the road just before the gun attack.\n\nTwo badly damaged cars, a Volkswagen Golf and a Mercedes, are still at the scene after colliding at the junction of Curlew Road and Knocknarea Road outside Our Lady's school.\n\nOn nearby Sperrin Road, garda\u00ed sealed off the road near a church where there was a silver Ford Focus with severe damage.\n\nThe rear passenger side was crushed and the rear light cluster on the driver's side was dislodged. There was also damage to the front of the car and the two tyres on the passenger side were punctured, with damage to the wheel rims. The rear door on the passenger side was open and the rear windows were open.\n\nAnother local resident said she heard two cars crash before hearing bursts of gunfire and shouting.\n\n\"It was late and the first thing we heard was the crash, and then very quickly there was around 10 shots in bursts of three of four. We dropped to the floor in the house, and we could hear shouting,\" she said.\n\n\"Then when we felt it was safe and the emergency services arrived we could see the medics down around the driver's door of one of the cars but outside it.\"\n\nGarda\u00ed said they were investigating the fatal shooting of a man in the early hours of Monday.\n\nAt about 12.15am, a man sustained fatal injuries after being targeted on the Knocknarea Road in the Crumlin-Drimnagh area of Dublin 12, garda\u00ed said.\n\nJustice Minister Helen McEntee criticised the attack.\n\n\"The attack in Drimnagh last night was completely unacceptable and is not something we will tolerate on our streets,\" she said.\n\n\"I commend the Garda\u00ed for responding quickly, resulting in the speedy arrest of suspects.\n\n\"Tackling crime and ensuring safer streets continues to be a top priority for An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na and the Government.\"\n\nSinn F\u00e9in councillor and one of the party's candidates for European elections in Dublin, Daith\u00ed Doolan, lives a five-minute bike ride away from the scene of the crime.\n\nHe said he was awoken \"very late last night\" by a helicopter flying over his house. He said this would not be unusual, but the helicopter flew over the houses for a long period of time.\n\n\"What made it unusual was the length of time it was there,\" he said.\n\n\"But we didn't expect to wake up to the news this morning that a young man was shot dead.\n\n\"Last night's shooting here in Drimnagh has left a young man dead, a family grieving and a community in shock. It was an attack on the whole community.\n\n\"It is hugely important that those involved in this terrible incident are apprehended and are brought to justice.\"\n\nThe scene is currently preserved for examination by the Garda Technical Bureau.\n\nThree men have been arrested and are being detained at Garda stations in the Dublin Region under Section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act

An incident room has been established at Sundrive Road garda station.\"\n\nSupt Maher said investigating gardai are appealing for any witnesses to this incident to come forward.\n\n\"In particular we are appealing for anyone with dashcam or other footage and who were in the Knocknarea Road area last night between 11.30pm and 12.30am to make that footage available to An Garda Siochana,\" he said.\n\n\"We are also appealing for anyone with CCTV footage in the wider area of Cooley Road, Brandon Road, Errigal Gardens, Crumlin Road, Slievenamon Road, Mourne Road and the associated side roads and who were in or around the Knocknarea area to make that available.\n\n\"Anyone with any information is asked to contact Sundrive Road garda station on 01 6666600 or the Garda Confidential Line on 1800 666111, or any garda station.\"\n\nIt is understood garda\u00ed are also searching for a van that may be connected to the killing.\n\nThe Defence Forces confirmed its bomb disposal experts had been called in to deal with a suspect device in the aftermath of the attack.\n\n\"On Sunday night, Defence Forces Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) experts responded to a request for assistance from An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na, in relation to a potential explosive device in the Dublin City region,\" a spokesperson said.\n\n\"Following an assessment by our EOD team, this device was removed from the scene and the scene was made safe. This operation has concluded and all elements have been returned to Barracks.\"\n\nOne local resident said she was awoken by the sound of gunfire.\n\n\"It seems there was shots fired from a moving car at a second car, and then there was a crash. Then I could hear around 20 shots or more and a lot of shouting,\" she said.\n\n\"Then a car reversed up the road at speed and I've heard since that it was crashing into things as it was moving back, and it drove away. It was like something from the Wild West.\"\n\nOther residents told of seeing a car chase on the road just before the gun attack.\n\nTwo badly damaged cars, a Volkswagen Golf and a Mercedes, are still at the scene after colliding at the junction of Curlew Road and Knocknarea Road outside Our Lady's school.\n\nOn nearby Sperrin Road, garda\u00ed sealed off the road near a church where there was a silver Ford Focus with severe damage.\n\nThe rear passenger side was crushed and the rear light cluster on the driver's side was dislodged. There was also damage to the front of the car and the two tyres on the passenger side were punctured, with damage to the wheel rims. The rear door on the passenger side was open and the rear windows were open.\n\nAnother local resident said she heard two cars crash before hearing bursts of gunfire and shouting.\n\n\"It was late and the first thing we heard was the crash, and then very quickly there was around 10 shots in bursts of three of four. We dropped to the floor in the house, and we could hear shouting,\" she said.\n\n\"Then when we felt it was safe and the emergency services arrived we could see the medics down around the driver's door of one of the cars but outside it.\"\n\nGarda\u00ed said they were investigating the fatal shooting of a man in the early hours of Monday.\n\nAt about 12.15am, a man sustained fatal injuries after being targeted on the Knocknarea Road in the Crumlin-Drimnagh area of Dublin 12, garda\u00ed said.\n\nJustice Minister Helen McEntee criticised the attack.\n\n\"The attack in Drimnagh last night was completely unacceptable and is not something we will tolerate on our streets,\" she said.\n\n\"I commend the Garda\u00ed for responding quickly, resulting in the speedy arrest of suspects.\n\n\"Tackling crime and ensuring safer streets continues to be a top priority for An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na and the Government.\"\n\nSinn F\u00e9in councillor and one of the party's candidates for European elections in Dublin, Daith\u00ed Doolan, lives a five-minute bike ride away from the scene of the crime.\n\nHe said he was awoken \"very late last night\" by a helicopter flying over his house. He said this would not be unusual, but the helicopter flew over the houses for a long period of time.\n\n\"What made it unusual was the length of time it was there,\" he said.\n\n\"But we didn't expect to wake up to the news this morning that a young man was shot dead.\n\n\"Last night's shooting here in Drimnagh has left a young man dead, a family grieving and a community in shock. It was an attack on the whole community.\n\n\"It is hugely important that those involved in this terrible incident are apprehended and are brought to justice.\"\n\nThe scene is currently preserved for examination by the Garda Technical Bureau.\n\nThree men have been arrested and are being detained at Garda stations in the Dublin Region under Section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act 1939.\n\nThe investigation into the incident is being led by a Senior Investigating Officer (SIO) and an incident room has been established at Sundrive Road garda station.\n\nGarda\u00ed are appealing for any witnesses to these incidents to come forward.\n\nAnyone with any information that can assist garda\u00ed with their investigation is asked to contact Sundrive Road garda station on 01 666

It sounded like a machine gun with how fast it was going off.\"\n\nAnother resident heard commotion at the end of his street and left his house to see what happened.\n\nHe was shocked to come across emergency services working on a man on the ground who had clearly suffered significant injuries.\n\nHe said: \"Gardai were everywhere. They had the road closed off from all areas and there was at least one helicopter flying just above us.\n\n\"I could see what looked like a garda working on someone on the ground, pumping their chest or whatever they were trying to do to save him.\n\n\"He was just on the ground beside one of the cars and it looked like he was dead on the road.\"\n\nAnother resident said: \"You could hear it, 'pop, pop, pop, pop, pop'.

Residents reported hearing up to 10 shots during what they described as a \"wild west\" style shootout in the streets, resulting in Josh's tragic death on Knocknarea Road.\n\nThe fatal shooting is believed to have occurred after a collision between a Volkswagen Golf and a Mercedes vehicle outside a school at 12:15am on Bank Holiday Monday.\n\nREAD MORE: Mystery UFO-like trio of objects spotted in sky are 'not human-made or mechanical'\n\nClick for more of the latest news from across the world from the Daily Star.\n\nGardai suspect that a feud between two rival gangs escalated into a violent confrontation, with gang members even bringing a pipe bomb to the scene. However, it's understood the device, which was later made safe by the army's Explosive Ordinance Unit, was not used and was found near the scene.\n\nTwo men and a teenager were later arrested in a badly damaged Ford Focus near Our Lady of Good Counsel church. They are currently being held at various Garda stations as a murder investigation gets underway, reports the Irish Mirror.\n\nFamily and friends of Josh are seeking answers as to what exactly happened, as a family friend told the Irish Mirror: \"It's shocking. You usually hear someone gets sick or died, but no, for just someone to finish everything in one minute. We are very shocked.\"\n\nJosh's mother is reportedly in a state of shock and is not speaking at this time. The family friend said that she knows everything and that she is \"just crying\".\n\nThey also said that Josh's family is originally from the Congo and that he was born and went to school in Ireland. He also has two sisters.\n\nMinister for Justice Helen McEntee has condemned the attack, stating: \"The attack in Drimnagh last night is not something we will tolerate on our streets.

And through Monday, as the full scale of what had unfolded began to become clearer, their shock deepened.\n\nOne man was dead -- his body remained at the junction of Knocknarea Road and Sperrin Road throughout the day. Three crashed cars were visible on the street and several crime scenes were sealed off. Those scenes included the local community centre, which was hit by stray bullets from the murder scene hundreds of metres away, and the spot where a suspected pipe bomb was discovered.\n\nVideos were recorded by local people while the attack was under way and also in its immediate aftermath. In one piece of footage, eight shots can be heard, though garda\u00ed believe that the recording only began midway through the attack.\n\nWhile this area of Dublin lived through the notorious Crumlin-Drimnagh gangland feud for almost a decade, the events of early on Monday were even more shocking for many than any of the killings during that past dispute.\n\nThe man shot dead has been named as 20-year-old Josh Itseli, with an address in Ballyfermot, Dublin. Garda\u00ed believe he, and possibly accomplices, were spotted by a rival faction and rammed off the road in a car before the victim was shot repeatedly. The collision and shooting unfolded directly under on-street CCTV cameras.\n\nGarda\u00ed also believe several parties present were armed and that one of them brought the pipe bomb to the scene for deployment against a criminal rival. Three men were spotted by members of the Armed Support Unit walking away from the scene and were arrested. The trio were wearing body armour. A military-grade assault rifle, discarded in the area, was also found by garda\u00ed.\n\nOne local man said people were alerted to the attack by the sound of a large number of gunshots. \"You could hear it, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop. I saw one of them running with a gun. And then of course there was loads of garda\u00ed in the area, all over the place and blocking off the roads,\" he said.\n\n\"It's desperate to hear of a young fella being killed like this. And you'd never hear things like that the last few years. It all seemed to have completely quietened down.\"\n\nOther people met on the street to discuss, and try to make sense of, the scene before them amid a good deal of confusion given the three crashed cars were about 200m apart.\n\nSinn F\u00e9in Cllr Daith\u00ed Doolan said local people he had spoken to were very shocked by the events. He said the shooting would be condemned by all in the area, while the sympathies of everyone would go to the relatives of the victim.\n\n\"I was talking to residents this morning and they had their bank holiday weekend shattered by gunfire -- the noise of a lot of gunfire here last night -- and we wake up this morning to the news that this man had his life taken away as the result of gun crime,\" he said.\n\nMr Doolan appealed to anyone who saw anything to contact garda\u00ed because the public could not be \"held to ransom by gun crime and the criminals behind it\".\n\nSupt Paul Maher, of Crumlin-Terenure community engagement team, said when garda\u00ed arrived at the scene they discovered two vehicles -- a Mercedes and Volkswagen Golf -- which appeared to have been in collision on Knocknarea Road. A third car -- a Ford Focus -- was found very badly damaged, abandoned on nearby Sperrin Road.\n\n\"A male in his early 20s was discovered with gunshot wounds,\" he said. \"Responding garda\u00ed offered first aid and despite attempts by garda\u00ed and Dublin Fire Brigade paramedics, the male was pronounced deceased at the scene and our thoughts are with the deceased's family.\"", "source": {"uri": "irishtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Irish Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garda_S\u00edoch\u00e1na", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipe_bomb", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pipe bomb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dublin", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dublin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dublin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knocknarea", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Knocknarea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drimnagh", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drimnagh"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicopter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Helicopter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garda_Armed_Support_Unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Garda Armed Support Unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_armor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Body armor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed-circuit_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Closed-circuit television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assault_rifle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assault rifle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballyfermot", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ballyfermot"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ballyfermot"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daith\u00ed_Doolan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daith\u00ed Doolan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dublin_Fire_Brigade", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dublin Fire Brigade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_violence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gun violence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinn_F\u00e9in", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sinn F\u00e9in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "First aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramedic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paramedic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Focus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ford Focus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen_Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Volkswagen Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes-Benz", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mercedes-Benz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ransom", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ransom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Councillor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Councillor"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Offroad_Vehicles", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Offroad Vehicles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 53}], "image": "https://www.irishtimes.com/resizer/Uyu_Ihz1klx6SCqGU_Xx7d_2Wbk=/1200x630/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-eu-central-1.images.arcpublishing.com/irishtimes/TBEMCHSFRVA33DHMPGQXCMRQLM.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543155", "eventUri": "eng-9543155", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.584313725490196, "wgt": 131, "relevance": 1}

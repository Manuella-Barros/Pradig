Preston incidentally have been our opponents when we've recorded our opening win for three successive seasons now.\n\nThe team had a better shape about it on Tuesday night, playing Huddlestone and Johnson in front of the back four and a three man attacking midfield which saw Matej Vydra play behind striker David Nugent.\n\nTom Lawrence is the latest player to sign on the dotted line and become a Derby County player. Gary Rowett has been pursuing his interest in the 23-year-old for some time now.\n\nLawrence should add something different to the attack. Apart from his ability to run at defenders, he also has an eye for goal and last season hit double figures playing for a struggling Ipswich side. Many of them coming from long range too!\n\nHopefully Rowett will be able to add a couple more before the transfer window closes.\n\nTwo players that seem to be on their way out are Nick Blackman who was talking to Maccabi Tel Aviv and Jason Shackell. National media speculating he could be gone in this window.\n\nOn the injury front, George Thorne should hopefully be making an appearance in an Under-21 game very soon. Thorne really has had a lot of bad luck with injuries since his arrival three years ago.\n\nFinally the game on Wednesday night saw the lowest crowd at Pride Park for a while! Only 24k which is disappointing after our figures from last season.\n\nI know that some people vote with their feet if they feel that they aren't getting value for money, but the team needs the fans behind them.\n\nWe get some very good crowds at Derby and hopefully the missing fans will be back very soon. There's more to supporting a team than glory days.

This season will be different.\n\n\"The Rams are in a much needed stage of rebuilding. Years of big spending and under-achieving have caught up with them and a clear-out was long overdue - losing Hughes and Ince, who on paper were the Rams biggest assests, is the clearest indicator of this.\n\n\"Rowett has an unthankable task. He must rebuild the squad while still delivering the success a club of Derby's size is expected to deliver and in my opinion, he's done very well so far.\n\n\"When \u00a33m-man Andre Wisdom signed from Liverpool, Cyrus Christie was sold to Middlesbrough for \u00a32.5m to ease the deficit.\n\n\"And when the rumoured arrival of Grant Hanley for \u00a35m was instead announced with the \u00a3500,000 signing of experienced Premier League player Curtis Davies, this confirmed that Derby had a very different approach to their transfers this time around, every signing has been analysed from both a footballing and accounting viewpoint.\n\n\"At this point two years ago, over \u00a330m had been spent on acquisitions, including; \u00a33m on Nick Blackman who hasn't featured at all this season and has just 12 starts in 2 years, \u00a31.5m on Abdoul Camara who scored once in just 19 appearances before departing back to France and \u00a33.7m on Jason Shackell, who played just eight league games last season and is still finding his way back to full fitness.\n\n\"Add into this over \u00a37m on Bradley Johnson and nearly \u00a36m on Jacob Butterfield then it's clear that Derby have to be more frugal in the transfer market.\n\n\"Fast forward to this summer and Wisdom, Davies, Huddlestone and Lawrence have been signed for a estimated total of \u00a310.5m.\n\n\"There are more reasons to be positive, too.\n\n\"Craig Forsyth has returned from a long injury lay-off and, hopefully, we'll soon see George Thorne back in the first-team. Chris Martin is back from a season-long loan at Fulham, too. Any Championship side would be happy with these players in their side; they're almost like new signings for the club.\n\n\"The return to form of Matej Vydra and David Nugent towards the end of the last campaign is also a bonus. Two strikers who have been successful at this level and have both gained promotions.\n\n\"An indifferent start to the season demonstrates that the side have a long way to go before they reach their potential. The improved performance and important first win against Preston on Tuesday is a step in the right direction after the poor showing against Wolves last Saturday. The battling point away at Sunderland could well be an important one come May.\n\n\"Rowett has said there will be a busy end to the transfer window so more comings and goings can be expected before he has the small tight-knit squad he ideally requires, but he has delivered success at his previous clubs under similar circumstances.\n\n\"Whatever happens, the club and the fans simply MUST stick with Rowett's philosophy long term if there is to be any success at the club.\n\n\"The first two home attendances of the season (27,757 and 24,371) are the lowest seen at Pride Park for a while. One of the biggest advantages Derby have is their brilliant support and they need it now more than ever.\n\n\"Derby hit the road again this weekend to face Bolton Wanderers.\n\n\"Building on Tuesday's performance, there is a great opportunity to go to Bolton - who are without a league win this season and under a transfer embargo - and get a win.\n\n\"Two wins in five days, a first away win - plus a debut for Tom Lawrence - and the outlook will certainly be different than it was at tea time last Saturday!\"", "id": "9768994", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Patience needed if Gary

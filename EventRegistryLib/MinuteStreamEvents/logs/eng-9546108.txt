Team Penske suffered a humiliating disqualification Wednesday, April 24, when reigning Indianapolis 500 winner Josef Newgarden was stripped of his victory [...]\n\nRoger Penske on Tuesday said he has suspended the president of Team Penske along with three others for two races for their roles in the cheating scandal that has rocked IndyCar ahead of the Indianapolis 500.\n\nPenske said in an interview with The Associated Press that a review done by his general counsel found that the team had no \"malicious intent by anyone\" and chalked up the incident as a breakdown in internal processes and miscommunication.\n\nHe also said he remains committed to reigning Indianapolis 500 winner Josef Newgarden and is actively trying to sign the two-time IndyCar champion to a contract extension.\n\n\"We're the same company we have been for 50 years and I'm going to hold my head high,\" Penske told the AP. \"This is an unfortunate situation and when you're the leader, you have to take action. We've done that and we're going to move on. I am not trying to run a popularity contest.\"\n\nTim Cindric, who oversees all of Team Penske's operations and is the strategist for Newgarden, is the top name to receive a two-race suspension. Also suspended was team managing director Ron Ruzewski, Newgarden engineer Luke Mason and senior data engineer Robbie Atkinson.\n\nPenske told the AP that Cindric and Ruzewski \"raised their hands as the team leaders\" to accept responsibility for the mess.\n\n\"For Ron and I as leaders of this team, it's not about what we did, it's about what we didn't do. It is our responsibility to provide the team and all our drivers with the right processes to ensure something like this can't happen,\" Cindric said in a statement. \"For that, I apologize to Roger, our team and everyone that supports us. Our number one job is to protect and enhance the reputation of our brand and that of those that support us.\n\n\"In that regard, as the overall leader, I failed, and I must raise my hand and be accountable with the others. This is a team, and in my position, it's the right thing to do.\"\n\nRuzewski and Atkinson both work on Will Power's car -- Ruzewski is his strategist -- and Power is the only of the three Penske drivers not accused of any wrongdoing in the push-to-pass scandal. Penske acknowledged that Power had done nothing wrong and said the suspensions to his crew members were based solely on their roles within the team.\n\nNone of Scott McLaughlin's team members were punished.\n\nThe suspensions are for two races, which cover this weekend's event on the Indianapolis Motor Speedway road course and the Indy 500, which Penske is trying to win for a record-extending 20th time.\n\n\"That's a big deal, a significant impact to the team, to the individuals involved,\" Penske told the AP of the Indy 500 being included in the suspensions. \"I talked to all of them and the goal was, 'How can we move forward and be competitive and win? Win the next two races?' That was the feeling I had when I left the meeting.\"\n\nAsked how Newgarden moves forward and regains the respect of his competitors, Penske said: \"He's got to do it on the racetrack. I think he understands the gravity of this thing and I need to support him.\"\n\nHe said contract talks with Newgarden are ongoing but \"for sure I do\" want to re-sign him.\n\nIn a statement released when the suspensions were announced, Penske apologized for the team's actions.\n\n\"I recognize the magnitude of what occurred and the impact it continues to have on the sport to which I've dedicated so many decades,\" Penske said in the statement. \"Everyone at Team Penske along with our fans and business partners should know that I apologize for the errors that were made and I deeply regret them.\"\n\nThe team said an internal review was completed following IndyCar discovering that all three Penske cars had an illegal software system installed that allowed the drivers to use the push-to-pass function on starts and restarts. The system is controlled by IndyCar and disabled on starts and restarts, when the extra boost of horsepower is illegal.\n\nIndyCar discovered it on the Penske cars in the morning warm-up at Long Beach when a glitch to the software knocked it out of all cars except the three Penske entries. IndyCar's investigation later showed that the software had been in place in the season-opening race and Newgarden used it to his advantage an admitted three times.\n\nMcLaughlin said he used it once at St. Petersburg and Power never illegally used the software. IndyCar stripped Newgarden of the St. Pete win and McLaughlin of his third-place finish, while all three drivers were fined $25,000 and docked 10 points.\n\nPenske owns the race team, IndyCar and the Indianapolis Motor Speedway and has been in damage control since series officials discovered the manipulation late last month. Cindric said the software was inadvertently left on the cars since last August when it was installed to test IndyCar's upcoming hybrid engine.\n\nIndyCar has said it is working on its processes to determine how it wasn't found through inspection at the first three events to open the season.\n\nNewgarden, meanwhile, maintains he thought there had been a rule change and the P2P system was now legal on restarts. McLaughlin said he hit the button out of habit and gained no advantage from the horsepower boost that lasted less than 2 seconds.", "source": {"uri": "tribtown.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@tribtown.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car_suspension", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Car suspension"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INDYCAR", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "INDYCAR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_Penske", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Team Penske"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josef_Newgarden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Josef Newgarden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Penske", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Roger Penske"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis_500", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis 500"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Petersburg,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "St. Petersburg, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "St. Petersburg, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Cindric", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tim Cindric"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IndyCar_Grand_Prix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "IndyCar Grand Prix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auto_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Auto racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Power", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Will Power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis_Motor_Speedway", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis Motor Speedway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hybrid vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horsepower", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Horsepower"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_track", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Race track"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Beach,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Long Beach, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Long Beach, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure_Racing/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure Racing/Teams", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 67}], "image": "https://tribtown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/preview-550.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546108", "eventUri": "eng-9546108", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-24", "textStart": 271, "textEnd": 279}, {"amb": false, "date": "2010-03-", "textStart": 168, "textEnd": 176}], "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 245, "relevance": 1}

It is our responsibility to provide the team and all our drivers with the right processes to ensure something like this can't happen,\" Cindric said in a statement. \"For that, I apologize to Roger, our team and everyone that supports us. Our number one job is to protect and enhance the reputation of our brand and that of those that support us.\n\n\"In that regard, as the overall leader, I failed, and I must raise my hand and be accountable with the others. This is a team, and in my position, it's the right thing to do.\"\n\nRuzewski and Atkinson both work on Will Power's car -- Ruzewski is his strategist -- and Power is the only of the three Penske drivers not accused of any wrongdoing in the push-to-pass scandal. Penske acknowledged that Power had done nothing wrong and said the suspensions to his crew members were based solely on their roles within the team.\n\nNone of Scott McLaughlin's team members were punished.\n\nThe suspensions are for two races, which cover this weekend's event on the Indianapolis Motor Speedway road course and the Indy 500, which Penske is trying to win for a record-extending 20th time.\n\n\"That's a big deal, a significant impact to the team, to the individuals involved,\" Penske told the AP of the Indy 500 being included in the suspensions. \"I talked to all of them and the goal was, 'How can we move forward and be competitive and win? Win the next two races?' That was the feeling I had when I left the meeting.\"\n\nAsked how Newgarden moves forward and regains the respect of his competitors, Penske said: \"He's got to do it on the racetrack. I think he understands the gravity of this thing and I need to support him.\"\n\nHe said contract talks with Newgarden are ongoing but \"for sure I do\" want to re-sign him.\n\nIn a statement released when the suspensions were announced, Penske apologized for the team's actions.\n\n\"I recognize the magnitude of what occurred and the impact it continues to have on the sport to which I've dedicated so many decades,\" Penske said in the statement. \"Everyone at Team Penske along with our fans and business partners should know that I apologize for the errors that were made and I deeply regret them.\"\n\nThe team said an internal review was completed following IndyCar discovering that all three Penske cars had an illegal software system installed that allowed the drivers to use the push-to-pass function on starts and restarts. The system is controlled by IndyCar and disabled on starts and restarts, when the extra boost of horsepower is illegal.\n\nIndyCar discovered it on the Penske cars in the morning warm-up at Long Beach when a glitch to the software knocked it out of all cars except the three Penske entries. IndyCar's investigation later showed that the software had been in place in the season-opening race and Newgarden used it to his advantage an admitted three times.\n\nMcLaughlin said he used it once at St. Petersburg and Power never illegally used the software. IndyCar stripped Newgarden of the St. Pete win and McLaughlin of his third-place finish, while all three drivers were fined $25,000 and docked 10 points.\n\nPenske owns the race team, IndyCar and the Indianapolis Motor Speedway and has been in damage control since series officials discovered the manipulation late last month. Cindric said the software was inadvertently left on the cars since last August when it was installed to test IndyCar's upcoming hybrid engine.\n\nIndyCar has said it is working on its processes to determine how it wasn't found through inspection at the first three events to open the season.\n\nNewgarden, meanwhile, maintains he thought there had been a rule change and the P2P system was now legal on restarts. McLaughlin said he hit the button out of habit and gained no advantage from the horsepower boost that lasted less than 2 seconds.", "source": {"uri": "lasvegassun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Las Vegas Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@lasvegassun.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}, {"uri": "jenna_fryer@lasvegassun.com", "name": "Jenna Fryer", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car_suspension", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Car suspension"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INDYCAR", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "INDYCAR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_Penske", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Team Penske"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josef_Newgarden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Josef Newgarden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Penske", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Roger Penske"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis_500", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis 500"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Petersburg,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "St. Petersburg, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "St. Petersburg, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Cindric", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tim Cindric"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IndyCar_Grand_Prix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "IndyCar Grand Prix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auto_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Auto racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Power", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Will Power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis_Motor_Speedway", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis Motor Speedway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hybrid vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horsepower", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Horsepower"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_track", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Race track"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Beach,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Long Beach, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Long Beach, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure_Racing/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure Racing/Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 67}], "image": "https://media.lasvegassun.com/media/img/photos/2024/05/07/AP24115605426465_t1200.jpg?a58a258a4dac404905303588401680fdf3ee23e4", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546108", "eventUri": "eng-9546108", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2010-03-", "textStart": 180, "textEnd": 188}], "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 243, "relevance": 1}

What to know about the scandal that has rocked IndyCar", "body": "FILE - Team Penske driver Josef Newgarden, right, celebrates his victory with team owner Roger Penske after the IndyCar Grand Prix of St. Petersburg auto race, Sunday, March 10, 2024, in St. Petersburg, Fla. Team Penske suffered a humiliating disqualification Wednesday, April 24, when reigning Indianapolis 500 winner Josef Newgarden was stripped of his victory in the season-opening race for manipulating his push-to-pass system. Penske teammate Scott McLaughlin, who finished third in the opener on the downtown streets of St. Petersburg, Florida, was also disqualified.\n\nRoger Penske took a tough stance this week by suspending two senior leaders and two engineers ahead of the Indianapolis 500 as punishment for a cheating scandal that has engulfed his IndyCar team.\n\nThe issue centers on Indianapolis 500 winner Josef Newgarden's illegal use of his car's push-to-pass system in his March 10 season-opening victory at St. Petersburg, Florida. IndyCar stripped Newgarden of the win and teammate Scott McLaughlin of his third-place finish, docking both and fellow Penske driver Will Power 10 points each and hitting all three with $25,000 fines.\n\nThe Penske suspensions are the latest fallout from an incident that is unusual for IndyCar (first disqualification in 29 years) and for Penske, the IndyCar series owner and motorsports giant whose image has generally been considered one of the most impeccable in auto racing.\n\nWHAT HAPPENED?\n\nThe push-to-pass software provides extra horsepower for a brief amount of time depending on the track. IndyCar controls the system from race control and deactivates it during starts and restarts.\n\nTeam Penske installed a version of the system on its cars while testing hybrid engines last August that allowed push-to-pass to be used on starts and restarts. Penske told The Associated Press this week the coding was not reverted back to its legal form before the March 10 race.\n\nThat meant the three Penske drivers hit the track able to push the button for the extra horsepower during starts and restarts.\n\nIndyCar didn't catch it at St. Pete and in fact did not become aware of the problem until six weeks later, just before the third race of the season.\n\nIn the aftermath, McLaughlin said he hit the button once, out of habit, and the less than 2 seconds it was utilized gained him no on-track position. Newgarden has admitted to using it three times; he says he assumed a rule had been changed. Power did not use the system.\n\nHOW IS THAT POSSIBLE?\n\nPenske has been adamant there was no \"malicious intent\" to cheat, and chalked up the oversight as a breakdown of both processes and communication at Team Penske.\n\nThere was sharp skepticism from other team owners and drivers, who wondered how an entire pit crew would not be aware its driver was using P2P against the rules during a race. Engine data would have shown usage.\n\nIndyCar is also trying to figure out how it missed it during the first two races of the season; it was only noticed April 21 when a glitch knocked out the software at Long Beach on all cars except the Penske entries.\n\nTHE FALLOUT\n\nTo counter the growing outrage, Penske suspended team president Tim Cindric, team managing director Ron Ruzewski and engineers Luke Mason and Robbie Atkinson.\n\nCindric is Newgarden's strategist and Mason is his engineer. Both will miss this week's race on Indy's road course and the showcase Indianapolis 500 later this month. Ruzewski is Power's strategist and Atkinson is his engineer -- and the employee who uploaded the manipulated software last August.\n\nMcLaughlin did not have any members of his crew suspended.\n\nWHAT DOES IT MEAN?\n\nPenske has won the Indy 500 a record 19 times and returns to historic Indianapolis Motor Speedway -- a track he owns -- with Newgarden seeking to defend his victory. But it is not insignificant that he benched Cindric, considered the top strategist in the series, for the biggest race in the world.\n\nCindric has been with Penske since 1999 and was named team president in 2006. His son, Austin, won the Daytona 500 for Penske in 2022.\n\nAt the height of the pandemic, many teams developed \"war rooms\" at their race shops where employees could contribute electronically and during races. Cindric and Ruzewski could theoretically still handle some strategy remotely.\n\nWHAT'S NEXT?\n\nIndyCar said it has reviewed all Team Penske data from 2023 and found no anomalies and all entries were

The suspensions -- for the team president, managing director, and two engineers -- will last two races.\n\nA review done by Penske's legal team found \"no malicious intent by anyone,\" Roger Penske told the Associated Press. He said the situation stemmed from a breakdown in internal processes and miscommunication.\n\n\"We're the same company we have been for 50 years and I'm going to hold my head high,\" Penske said. \"This is an unfortunate situation and when you're the leader, you have to take action. We've done that and we're going to move on. I am not trying to run a popularity contest.\"\n\nTeam Penske came under the microscope in March after a race in St. Petersburg, Fla. IndyCar disqualified the winner, Josef Newgarden, and fellow teammate Scott McLaughlin, who finished third, for illegal use of the push-to-pace system, which illegally boosts cars and is considered cheating in the sport.\n\nIndyCar discovered three of Penske's cars had illegal software installed that allowed drivers to use the push-to-pass function with starts and restarts. IndyCar controls the software, which is disabled during those race phases due to the extra boost of horsepower.\n\nTeam Penske was outed by a software glitch in the warmup of IndyCar's Long Beach race April 21 that knocked it out of every car but Penske's three entries. The investigation showed Penske cars had the software installed throughout the season, and Newgarden confessed to using it three times.\n\nIn 2019, Penske bought IndyCar and the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, which is home to the Indy 500, in a deal worth as much as $300 million.\n\nTim Cindric, who runs Team Penske's operations and is the strategist for Newgarden, the reigning Indianapolis 500 winner, is the biggest name in the suspension. Rob Ruzewski, Team Penske's managing director, senior data engineer Robbie Atkinson and Luke Mason, an engineer for Newgarden, were also suspended.\n\nAccording to Penske, both Cindric and Ruzewski accepted responsibility for the situation. None of McLaughlin's crew members were punished, and all three Penske drivers were fined $25,000 and docked 10 points.\n\n\"For Ron and I as leaders of this team, it's not about what we did, it's about what we didn't do. It is our responsibility to provide the team and all our drivers with the right processes to ensure something like this can't happen,\" Cindric said in a statement Tuesday. \"For that, I apologize to Roger, our team and everyone that supports us. Our number one job is to protect and enhance the reputation of our brand and that of those that support us.\n\n\"In that regard, as the overall leader, I failed, and I must raise my hand and be accountable with the others. This is a team, and in my position, it's the right thing to do.\"\n\nRuzewski and Atkinson both work on fellow Penske driver Will Power's car. Power is one of the few Penske drivers not implicated in the push-to-pass scandal. Roger Penske told the AP that Power remains innocent and the suspensions to his crew members are based on their role within the bigger team.\n\nThe suspensions come as Penske's team is trying to win its 20th Indianapolis 500 in addition to this weekend's event on the Indianapolis Motor Speedway.\n\n\"I recognize the magnitude of what occurred and the impact it continues to have on the sport to which I've dedicated so many decades,\" Penske said in the statement. \"Everyone at Team Penske along with our fans and business partners should know that I apologize for the errors that were made and I deeply regret them.\"", "source": {"uri": "frontofficesports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Front Office Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alex_schiffer@frontofficesports.com", "name": "Alex Schiffer", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INDYCAR", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "INDYCAR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_Penske", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Team Penske"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josef_Newgarden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Josef Newgarden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis_500", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis 500"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Penske", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Roger Penske"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Petersburg,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "St. Petersburg, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "St. Petersburg, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Cindric", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tim Cindric"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_McLaughlin_(racing_driver)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scott McLaughlin (racing driver)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis_Motor_Speedway", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis Motor Speedway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horsepower", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Horsepower"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Beach,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Long Beach, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Long Beach, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Power", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Will Power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure_Racing/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure Racing/Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://frontofficesports.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/pensk-scaled.jpg?quality=100", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546108", "eventUri": "eng-9546108", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-21", "textStart": 1485, "textEnd": 1493}], "sentiment": -0.1607843137254902, "wgt": 229, "relevance": 1}

Six weeks later, the series discovered that the three Penske cars were able to use a software system to get a horsepower boost on starts and restarts, which is against the rules.\n\nTim Cindric, who oversees all Team Penske operations and is the strategist for Newgarden, is the top name to receive the two-race suspension, which includes the showcase Indy 500 on Memorial Day weekend. Also suspended was team managing director Ron Ruzewski, Newgarden engineer Luke Mason and senior data engineer Robbie Atkinson.\n\nCindric and Ruzewski \"raised their hands as the team leaders\" to accept responsibility for the mess, Penske told AP.\n\n\"For Ron and I as leaders of this team, it's not about what we did, it's about what we didn't do.

Penske acknowledged that Power had done nothing wrong and said the suspensions to his crew members were based solely on their roles within the team. None of Scott McLaughlin's team members were punished; the driver was earlier stripped of his third-place finish at the March race.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nThe suspensions cover this weekend's race on the Indianapolis Motor Speedway road course and the Indy 500, which Penske is trying to win for a record-extending 20th time.\n\n\"That's a big deal, a significant impact to the team, to the individuals involved,\" Penske told the AP of the Indy 500 being included in the suspensions. \"I talked to all of them and the goal was, 'How can we move forward and be competitive and win? Win the next two races?' That was the feeling I had when I left the meeting.\"\n\nAsked how Newgarden moves forward and regains the respect of his competitors, Penske said: \"He's got to do it on the racetrack. I think he understands the gravity of this thing and I need to support him.\"\n\nHe said contract talks with Newgarden are ongoing but \"for sure I do\" want to re-sign him.\n\nThe push-to-pass function is controlled by IndyCar and disabled on starts and restarts, when the extra boost of horsepower is illegal. Two weeks ago at Long Beach, a glitch in the software knocked out the software on all cars except the three Penske entries. IndyCar's investigation later showed that the software had been in place in the season-opening race and Newgarden used it to his advantage an admitted three times.\n\nNewgarden said he thought there had been a rule change and the P2P system was now legal on restarts. McLaughlin said he hit the button out of habit and gained no advantage from the horsepower boost that lasted less than 2 seconds.\n\nMcLaughlin said he used it once at St. Petersburg and Power never illegally used it. Besides stripping Newgarden and McLaughlin of their podium finishes, IndyCar fined all three drivers $25,000 and docked them 10 points each.\n\nCindric said the software was inadvertently left on the cars since last August when it was installed to test IndyCar's upcoming hybrid engine but the scandal shook IndyCar, which had not had a disqualification in 29 years.\n\nPenske owns the race team, IndyCar and the Indianapolis Motor Speedway and has been in damage control\n\n\"I recognize the magnitude of what occurred and the impact it continues to have on the sport to which I've dedicated so many decades,\" Penske said in the statement when the punishments were announced. \"Everyone at Team Penske along with our fans and business partners should know that I apologize for the errors that were made and I deeply regret them.\"\n\nIndyCar has said it is trying to determine how the software wasn't found through inspection during the season's first three races.\n\nClose\n\nSan Diego Padres' Manny Machado falls after stopping a base hit by Arizona Diamondbacks' Lourdes Gurriel Jr. during the sixth inning of a baseball game, Saturday, May 4, 2024, in Phoenix.

What to know about the...", "body": "Roger Penske took a tough stance this week by suspending two senior leaders and two engineers ahead of the Indianapolis 500 as punishment for a cheating scandal that has engulfed his IndyCar team.\n\nThe issue centers on Indianapolis 500 winner Josef Newgarden's illegal use of his car's push-to-pass system in his March 10 season-opening victory at St. Petersburg, Florida. IndyCar stripped Newgarden of the win and teammate Scott McLaughlin of his third-place finish, docking both and fellow Penske driver Will Power 10 points each and hitting all three with $25,000 fines.\n\nThe Penske suspensions are the latest fallout from an incident that is unusual for IndyCar (first disqualification in 29 years) and for Penske, the IndyCar series owner and motorsports giant whose image has generally been considered one of the most impeccable in auto racing.\n\nThe push-to-pass software provides extra horsepower for a brief amount of time depending on the track. IndyCar controls the system from race control and deactivates it during starts and restarts.\n\nTeam Penske installed a version of the system on its cars while testing hybrid engines last August that allowed push-to-pass to be used on starts and restarts. Penske told The Associated Press this week the coding was not reverted back to its legal form before the March 10 race.\n\nThat meant the three Penske drivers hit the track able to push the button for the extra horsepower during starts and restarts.\n\nFILE - Team Penske driver Josef Newgarden, center, celebrates his first place finish along with second place finisher Arrow McLaren driver Pato O'Ward of Mexico, left, and third place finisher Team Penske driver Scott McLaughlin of New Zealand in the IndyCar Grand Prix of St. Petersburg auto race, Sunday, March 10, 2024, in St. Petersburg, Fla. Team Penske suffered a humiliating disqualification Wednesday, April 24, when reigning Indianapolis 500 winner Josef Newgarden was stripped of his victory in the season-opening race for manipulating his push-to-pass system. Penske teammate Scott McLaughlin, who finished third in the opener on the downtown streets of St. Petersburg, Florida, was also disqualified. (AP Photo/Mike Carlson, File)\n\nIndyCar didn't catch it at St. Pete and in fact did not become aware of the problem until six weeks later, just before the third race of the season.\n\nIn the aftermath, McLaughlin said he hit the button once, out of habit, and the less than 2 seconds it was utilized gained him no on-track position. Newgarden has admitted to using it three times; he says he assumed a rule had been changed. Power did not use the system.\n\nPenske has been adamant there was no \"malicious intent\" to cheat, and chalked up the oversight as a breakdown of both processes and communication at Team Penske.\n\nThere was sharp skepticism from other team owners and drivers, who wondered how an entire pit crew would not be aware its driver was using P2P against the rules during a race. Engine data would have shown usage.\n\nIndyCar is also trying to figure out how it missed it during the first two races of the season; it was only noticed April 21 when a glitch knocked out the software at Long Beach on all cars except the Penske entries.\n\nTo counter the growing outrage, Penske suspended team president Tim Cindric, team managing director Ron Ruzewski and engineers Luke Mason and Robbie Atkinson.\n\nCindric is Newgarden's strategist and Mason is his engineer. Both will miss this week's race on Indy's road course and the showcase Indianapolis 500 later this month. Ruzewski is Power's strategist and Atkinson is his engineer - and the employee who uploaded the manipulated software last August.\n\nMcLaughlin did not have any members of his crew suspended.\n\nPenske has won the Indy 500 a record 19 times and returns to historic Indianapolis Motor Speedway - a track he owns - with Newgarden seeking to defend his victory. But it is not insignificant that he benched Cindric, considered the top strategist in the series, for the biggest race in the world.\n\nCindric has been with Penske since 1999 and was named team president in 2006. His son, Austin, won the Daytona 500 for Penske in 2022.\n\nAt the height of the pandemic, many teams developed \"war rooms\" at their race shops where employees could contribute electronically and during races. Cindric and Ruzewski could theoretically still handle some strategy remotely.\n\nIndyCar said it has reviewed all Team Penske data from 2023 and found no anomalies and all entries were compliant.\n\nThe series said it will create \"a more obvious and clear infraction indicator is being installed for Push to Pass to create heightened awareness.\" It is also requiring all competitors send their data files to the series following each race.\n\nAP Auto Racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing\n\nFILE - Team Penske driver Josef Newgarden, right, celebrates his victory with team owner Roger Penske after the IndyCar Grand Prix of St. Petersburg auto race, Sunday, March 10, 2024, in St. Petersburg, Fla.

We've done that and we're going to move on. I am not trying to run a popularity contest.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...

Six weeks later, the series discovered that the three Penske cars were able to use a software system to get a horsepower boost on starts and restarts, which is against the rules.\n\nTim Cindric, who oversees all Team Penske operations and is the strategist for Newgarden, is the top name to receive the two-race suspension, which includes the showcase Indy 500 on Memorial Day weekend. Also suspended was team managing director Ron Ruzewski, Newgarden engineer Luke Mason and senior data engineer Robbie Atkinson.\n\nCindric and Ruzewski \"raised their hands as the team leaders\" to accept responsibility for the mess, Penske told AP.\n\n\"For Ron and I as leaders of this team, it's not about what we did, it's about what we didn't do. It is our responsibility to provide the team and all our drivers with the right processes to ensure something like this can't happen,\" Cindric said in a statement. \"For that, I apologize to Roger, our team and everyone that supports us. Our number one job is to protect and enhance the reputation of our brand and that of those that support us.\n\n\"In that regard, as the overall leader, I failed, and I must raise my hand and be accountable with the others. This is a team, and in my position, it's the right thing to do.\"\n\nRuzewski and Atkinson both work on Will Power's car -- Ruzewski is his strategist -- and Power was the only one of the three Penske drivers not accused of wrongdoing. Penske acknowledged that Power had done nothing wrong and said the suspensions to his crew members were based solely on their roles within the team. None of Scott McLaughlin's team members were punished; the driver was earlier stripped of his third-place finish at the March race.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nThe suspensions cover this weekend's race on the Indianapolis Motor Speedway road course and the Indy 500, which Penske is trying to win for a record-extending 20th time.\n\n\"That's a big deal, a significant impact to the team, to the individuals involved,\" Penske told the AP of the Indy 500 being included in the suspensions. \"I talked to all of them and the goal was, 'How can we move forward and be competitive and win? Win the next two races?' That was the feeling I had when I left the meeting.\"\n\nAsked how Newgarden moves forward and regains the respect of his competitors, Penske said: \"He's got to do it on the racetrack. I think he understands the gravity of this thing and I need to support him.\"\n\nHe said contract talks with Newgarden are ongoing but \"for sure I do\" want to re-sign him.\n\nThe push-to-pass function is controlled by IndyCar and disabled on starts and restarts, when the extra boost of horsepower is illegal. Two weeks ago at Long Beach, a glitch in the software knocked out the software on all cars except the three Penske entries. IndyCar's investigation later showed that the software had been in place in the season-opening race and Newgarden used it to his advantage an admitted three times.\n\nNewgarden said he thought there had been a rule change and the P2P system was now legal on restarts. McLaughlin said he hit the button out of habit and gained no advantage from the horsepower boost that lasted less than 2 seconds.\n\nMcLaughlin said he used it once at St. Petersburg and Power never illegally used it. Besides stripping Newgarden and McLaughlin of their podium finishes, IndyCar fined all three drivers $25,000 and docked them 10 points each.\n\nCindric said the software was inadvertently left on the cars since last August when it was installed to test IndyCar's upcoming hybrid engine but the scandal shook IndyCar, which had not had a disqualification in 29 years.\n\nPenske owns the race team, IndyCar and the Indianapolis Motor Speedway and has been in damage control\n\n\"I recognize the magnitude of what occurred and the impact it continues to have on the sport to which I've dedicated so many decades,\" Penske said in the statement when the punishments were announced. \"Everyone at Team Penske along with our fans and business partners should know that I apologize for the errors that were made and I deeply regret them.\"\n\nIndyCar has said it is trying to determine how the software wasn't found through inspection during the season's first three races.\n\nClose\n\nSan Diego Padres' Manny Machado falls after stopping a base hit by Arizona Diamondbacks' Lourdes Gurriel Jr. during the sixth inning of a baseball game, Saturday, May 4, 2024, in Phoenix.

We've done that and we're going to move on. I am not trying to run a popularity contest.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...

Six weeks later, the series discovered that the three Penske cars were able to use a software system to get a horsepower boost on starts and restarts, which is against the rules.\n\nTim Cindric, who oversees all Team Penske operations and is the strategist for Newgarden, is the top name to receive the two-race suspension, which includes the showcase Indy 500 on Memorial Day weekend. Also suspended was team managing director Ron Ruzewski, Newgarden engineer Luke Mason and senior data engineer Robbie Atkinson.\n\nCindric and Ruzewski \"raised their hands as the team leaders\" to accept responsibility for the mess, Penske told AP.\n\n\"For Ron and I as leaders of this team, it's not about what we did, it's about what we didn't do. It is our responsibility to provide the team and all our drivers with the right processes to ensure something like this can't happen,\" Cindric said in a statement. \"For that, I apologize to Roger, our team and everyone that supports us. Our number one job is to protect and enhance the reputation of our brand and that of those that support us.\n\n\"In that regard, as the overall leader, I failed, and I must raise my hand and be accountable with the others. This is a team, and in my position, it's the right thing to do.\"\n\nRuzewski and Atkinson both work on Will Power's car -- Ruzewski is his strategist -- and Power was the only one of the three Penske drivers not accused of wrongdoing. Penske acknowledged that Power had done nothing wrong and said the suspensions to his crew members were based solely on their roles within the team. None of Scott McLaughlin's team members were punished; the driver was earlier stripped of his third-place finish at the March race.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nThe suspensions cover this weekend's race on the Indianapolis Motor Speedway road course and the Indy 500, which Penske is trying to win for a record-extending 20th time.\n\n\"That's a big deal, a significant impact to the team, to the individuals involved,\" Penske told the AP of the Indy 500 being included in the suspensions. \"I talked to all of them and the goal was, 'How can we move forward and be competitive and win? Win the next two races?' That was the feeling I had when I left the meeting.\"\n\nAsked how Newgarden moves forward and regains the respect of his competitors, Penske said: \"He's got to do it on the racetrack. I think he understands the gravity of this thing and I need to support him.\"\n\nHe said contract talks with Newgarden are ongoing but \"for sure I do\" want to re-sign him.\n\nThe push-to-pass function is controlled by IndyCar and disabled on starts and restarts, when the extra boost of horsepower is illegal. Two weeks ago at Long Beach, a glitch in the software knocked out the software on all cars except the three Penske entries. IndyCar's investigation later showed that the software had been in place in the season-opening race and Newgarden used it to his advantage an admitted three times.\n\nNewgarden said he thought there had been a rule change and the P2P system was now legal on restarts. McLaughlin said he hit the button out of habit and gained no advantage from the horsepower boost that lasted less than 2 seconds.\n\nMcLaughlin said he used it once at St. Petersburg and Power never illegally used it. Besides stripping Newgarden and McLaughlin of their podium finishes, IndyCar fined all three drivers $25,000 and docked them 10 points each.\n\nCindric said the software was inadvertently left on the cars since last August when it was installed to test IndyCar's upcoming hybrid engine but the scandal shook IndyCar, which had not had a disqualification in 29 years.\n\nPenske owns the race team, IndyCar and the Indianapolis Motor Speedway and has been in damage control\n\n\"I recognize the magnitude of what occurred and the impact it continues to have on the sport to which I've dedicated so many decades,\" Penske said in the statement when the punishments were announced. \"Everyone at Team Penske along with our fans and business partners should know that I apologize for the errors that were made and I deeply regret them.\"\n\nIndyCar has said it is trying to determine how the software wasn't found through inspection during the season's first three races.\n\nClose\n\nSan Diego Padres' Manny Machado falls after stopping a base hit by Arizona Diamondbacks' Lourdes Gurriel Jr. during the sixth inning of a baseball game, Saturday, May 4, 2024, in Phoenix.

We've done that and we're going to move on. I am not trying to run a popularity contest.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...

Suspended Sioux City inclusion liaison accuses human rights director of harassment, defamation Names released in deadly North Sioux City fire Bill Murray makes lasting impression while in Omaha for Berkshire Hathaway meeting Sioux City cultural inclusion liaison settles lawsuit with USD\n\nThe scandal dates to the IndyCar season-opener in March won by Newgarden. Six weeks later, the series discovered that the three Penske cars were able to use a software system to get a horsepower boost on starts and restarts, which is against the rules.\n\nTim Cindric, who oversees all Team Penske operations and is the strategist for Newgarden, is the top name to receive the two-race suspension, which includes the showcase Indy 500 on Memorial Day weekend. Also suspended was team managing director Ron Ruzewski, Newgarden engineer Luke Mason and senior data engineer Robbie Atkinson.\n\nCindric and Ruzewski \"raised their hands as the team leaders\" to accept responsibility for the mess, Penske told AP.\n\n\"For Ron and I as leaders of this team, it's not about what we did, it's about what we didn't do. It is our responsibility to provide the team and all our drivers with the right processes to ensure something like this can't happen,\" Cindric said in a statement. \"For that, I apologize to Roger, our team and everyone that supports us. Our number one job is to protect and enhance the reputation of our brand and that of those that support us.\n\n\"In that regard, as the overall leader, I failed, and I must raise my hand and be accountable with the others. This is a team, and in my position, it's the right thing to do.\"\n\nRuzewski and Atkinson both work on Will Power's car -- Ruzewski is his strategist -- and Power was the only one of the three Penske drivers not accused of wrongdoing. Penske acknowledged that Power had done nothing wrong and said the suspensions to his crew members were based solely on their roles within the team. None of Scott McLaughlin's team members were punished; the driver was earlier stripped of his third-place finish at the March race.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nThe suspensions cover this weekend's race on the Indianapolis Motor Speedway road course and the Indy 500, which Penske is trying to win for a record-extending 20th time.\n\n\"That's a big deal, a significant impact to the team, to the individuals involved,\" Penske told the AP of the Indy 500 being included in the suspensions. \"I talked to all of them and the goal was, 'How can we move forward and be competitive and win? Win the next two races?' That was the feeling I had when I left the meeting.\"\n\nAsked how Newgarden moves forward and regains the respect of his competitors, Penske said: \"He's got to do it on the racetrack. I think he understands the gravity of this thing and I need to support him.\"\n\nHe said contract talks with Newgarden are ongoing but \"for sure I do\" want to re-sign him.\n\nThe push-to-pass function is controlled by IndyCar and disabled on starts and restarts, when the extra boost of horsepower is illegal. Two weeks ago at Long Beach, a glitch in the software knocked out the software on all cars except the three Penske entries. IndyCar's investigation later showed that the software had been in place in the season-opening race and Newgarden used it to his advantage an admitted three times.\n\nNewgarden said he thought there had been a rule change and the P2P system was now legal on restarts. McLaughlin said he hit the button out of habit and gained no advantage from the horsepower boost that lasted less than 2 seconds.\n\nMcLaughlin said he used it once at St. Petersburg and Power never illegally used it. Besides stripping Newgarden and McLaughlin of their podium finishes, IndyCar fined all three drivers $25,000 and docked them 10 points each.\n\nCindric said the software was inadvertently left on the cars since last August when it was installed to test IndyCar's upcoming hybrid engine but the scandal shook IndyCar, which had not had a disqualification in 29 years.\n\nPenske owns the race team, IndyCar and the Indianapolis Motor Speedway and has been in damage control\n\n\"I recognize the magnitude of what occurred and the impact it continues to have on the sport to which I've dedicated so many decades,\" Penske said in the statement when the punishments were announced. \"Everyone at Team Penske along with our fans and business partners should know that I apologize for the errors that were made and I deeply regret them.\"\n\nIndyCar has said it is trying to determine how the software wasn't found through inspection during the season's first three races.\n\nClose\n\nSan Diego Padres' Manny Machado falls after stopping a base hit by Arizona Diamondbacks' Lourdes Gurriel Jr. during the sixth inning of a baseball game, Saturday, May 4, 2024, in Phoenix.

We've done that and we're going to move on. I am not trying to run a popularity contest.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nThe scandal dates to the IndyCar season-opener in March won by Newgarden. Six weeks later, the series discovered that the three Penske cars were able to use a software system to get a horsepower boost on starts and restarts, which is against the rules.\n\nTim Cindric, who oversees all Team Penske operations and is the strategist for Newgarden, is the top name to receive the two-race suspension, which includes the showcase Indy 500 on Memorial Day weekend. Also suspended was team managing director Ron Ruzewski, Newgarden engineer Luke Mason and senior data engineer Robbie Atkinson.\n\nCindric and Ruzewski \"raised their hands as the team leaders\" to accept responsibility for the mess, Penske told AP.\n\n\"For Ron and I as leaders of this team, it's not about what we did, it's about what we didn't do. It is our responsibility to provide the team and all our drivers with the right processes to ensure something like this can't happen,\" Cindric said in a statement. \"For that, I apologize to Roger, our team and everyone that supports us. Our number one job is to protect and enhance the reputation of our brand and that of those that support us.\n\n\"In that regard, as the overall leader, I failed, and I must raise my hand and be accountable with the others. This is a team, and in my position, it's the right thing to do.\"\n\nRuzewski and Atkinson both work on Will Power's car -- Ruzewski is his strategist -- and Power was the only one of the three Penske drivers not accused of wrongdoing. Penske acknowledged that Power had done nothing wrong and said the suspensions to his crew members were based solely on their roles within the team. None of Scott McLaughlin's team members were punished; the driver was earlier stripped of his third-place finish at the March race.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nThe suspensions cover this weekend's race on the Indianapolis Motor Speedway road course and the Indy 500, which Penske is trying to win for a record-extending 20th time.\n\n\"That's a big deal, a significant impact to the team, to the individuals involved,\" Penske told the AP of the Indy 500 being included in the suspensions. \"I talked to all of them and the goal was, 'How can we move forward and be competitive and win? Win the next two races?' That was the feeling I had when I left the meeting.\"\n\nAsked how Newgarden moves forward and regains the respect of his competitors, Penske said: \"He's got to do it on the racetrack. I think he understands the gravity of this thing and I need to support him.\"\n\nHe said contract talks with Newgarden are ongoing but \"for sure I do\" want to re-sign him.\n\nThe push-to-pass function is controlled by IndyCar and disabled on starts and restarts, when the extra boost of horsepower is illegal. Two weeks ago at Long Beach, a glitch in the software knocked out the software on all cars except the three Penske entries. IndyCar's investigation later showed that the software had been in place in the season-opening race and Newgarden used it to his advantage an admitted three times.\n\nNewgarden said he thought there had been a rule change and the P2P system was now legal on restarts. McLaughlin said he hit the button out of habit and gained no advantage from the horsepower boost that lasted less than 2 seconds.\n\nMcLaughlin said he used it once at St. Petersburg and Power never illegally used it. Besides stripping Newgarden and McLaughlin of their podium finishes, IndyCar fined all three drivers $25,000 and docked them 10 points each.\n\nCindric said the software was inadvertently left on the cars since last August when it was installed to test IndyCar's upcoming hybrid engine but the scandal shook IndyCar, which had not had a disqualification in 29 years.\n\nPenske owns the race team, IndyCar and the Indianapolis Motor Speedway and has been in damage control\n\n\"I recognize the magnitude of what occurred and the impact it continues to have on the sport to which I've dedicated so many decades,\" Penske said in the statement when the punishments were announced. \"Everyone at Team Penske along with our fans and business partners should know that I apologize for the errors that were made and I deeply regret them.\"\n\nIndyCar has said it is trying to determine how the software wasn't found through inspection during the season's first three races.\n\nClose\n\nSan Diego Padres' Manny Machado falls after stopping a base hit by Arizona Diamondbacks' Lourdes Gurriel Jr. during the sixth inning of a baseball game, Saturday, May 4, 2024, in Phoenix.

In a statement from the team, Cindric is being suspended because he has \"accountability for all of Team Penske's operations.\" Cindric has been President at Penske since 2006 and has won 26 races as Newgarden's strategist since 2017, including the 2023 Indianapolis 500.\n\nThe North Carolina-based team also suspended Newgarden's race engineer Luke Mason, who has been on the No. 2 stand since 2023, and senior data engineer Robbie Atkinson. Atkinson has been part of the No. 12 crew with Will Power since 2010, winning two championships and the 2018 Indianapolis 500 on the way.\n\nThe suspensions come following an IndyCar investigation that found Team Penske to be illegally using the push-to-pass system on race starts and restarts, which is explicitly not allowed under series rules. The issue was revealed to series officials during the morning warmup before last month's race at Long Beach. An investigation found that Newgarden, who crossed the finish line first at St. Pete, used push-to-pass three times illegally, and gained a significant competitive advantage. As a result, IndyCar disqualified Newgarden and McLaughlin, giving Arrow McLaren's Pato O'Ward the win over a month after the checkered flag flew. Power did not use push-to-pass at the same time as his teammates, and was subsequently only given a 10-point penalty.\n\n\"I recognize the magnitude of what occurred and the impact it continues to have on the sport to which I've dedicated so many decades. Everyone at Team Penske, along with our fans and business partners should know that I apologize for the errors that were made and I deeply regret them.\"\n\nTeam Penske claims that the setting was first added for hybrid testing in August 2023 and copied over into the 2024 setup. Newgarden gave an emotional press conference on Friday morning at Barber, placing the blame on himself and defending the actions of his team to begin the season. As part of the series' investigation, there were no similar violations found after hybrid testing last season.\n\nTeam owner and Penske Entertainment chairman Roger Penske met privately with team owners on Saturday at Barber and is believed to have apologized on behalf of his team to his fellow owners.\n\nNewgarden currently sits at 16th in the standings, with McLaughlin in ninth, and Power just one point behind leader Colton Herta in second.

What to know about the scandal that has rocked IndyCar", "body": "Roger Penske took a tough stance this week by suspending two senior leaders and two engineers ahead of the Indianapolis 500 as punishment for a cheating scandal that has engulfed his IndyCar team.\n\nThe issue centers on Indianapolis 500 winner Josef Newgarden's illegal use of his car's push-to-pass system in his March 10 season-opening victory at St. Petersburg, Florida. IndyCar stripped Newgarden of the win and teammate Scott McLaughlin of his third-place finish, docking both and fellow Penske driver Will Power 10 points each and hitting all three with $25,000 fines.\n\nThe Penske suspensions are the latest fallout from an incident that is unusual for IndyCar (first disqualification in 29 years) and for Penske, the IndyCar series owner and motorsports giant whose image has generally been considered one of the most impeccable in auto racing.\n\nThe push-to-pass software provides extra horsepower for a brief amount of time depending on the track. IndyCar controls the system from race control and deactivates it during starts and restarts.\n\nTeam Penske installed a version of the system on its cars while testing hybrid engines last August that allowed push-to-pass to be used on starts and restarts. Penske told The Associated Press this week the coding was not reverted back to its legal form before the March 10 race.\n\nThat meant the three Penske drivers hit the track able to push the button for the extra horsepower during starts and restarts.\n\nIndyCar didn't catch it at St. Pete and in fact did not become aware of the problem until six weeks later, just before the third race of the season.\n\nIn the aftermath, McLaughlin said he hit the button once, out of habit, and the less than 2 seconds it was utilized gained him no on-track position. Newgarden has admitted to using it three times; he says he assumed a rule had been changed. Power did not use the system.\n\nPenske has been adamant there was no \"malicious intent\" to cheat, and chalked up the oversight as a breakdown of both processes and communication at Team Penske.\n\nThere was sharp skepticism from other team owners and drivers, who wondered how an entire pit crew would not be aware its driver was using P2P against the rules during a race. Engine data would have shown usage.\n\nIndyCar is also trying to figure out how it missed it during the first two races of the season; it was only noticed April 21 when a glitch knocked out the software at Long Beach on all cars except the Penske entries.\n\nTo counter the growing outrage, Penske suspended team president Tim Cindric, team managing director Ron Ruzewski and engineers Luke Mason and Robbie Atkinson.\n\nCindric is Newgarden's strategist and Mason is his engineer. Both will miss this week's race on Indy's road course and the showcase Indianapolis 500 later this month. Ruzewski is Power's strategist and Atkinson is his engineer -- and the employee who uploaded the manipulated software last August.\n\nMcLaughlin did not have any members of his crew suspended.\n\nPenske has won the Indy 500 a record 19 times and returns to historic Indianapolis Motor Speedway -- a track he owns -- with Newgarden seeking to defend his victory. But it is not insignificant that he benched Cindric, considered the top strategist in the series, for the biggest race in the world.\n\nCindric has been with Penske since 1999 and was named team president in 2006. His son, Austin, won the Daytona 500 for Penske in 2022.\n\nAt the height of the pandemic, many teams developed \"war rooms\" at their race shops where employees could contribute electronically and during races. Cindric and Ruzewski could theoretically still handle some strategy remotely.\n\nIndyCar said it has reviewed all Team Penske data from 2023 and found no anomalies and all entries were compliant.\n\nThe series said it will create \"a more obvious and clear infraction indicator is being installed for Push to Pass to create heightened awareness.\" It is also requiring all competitors send their data files to the series following each race.", "source": {"uri": "sandiegouniontribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "San Diego Union-Tribune"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Push-to-pass", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Push-to-pass"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INDYCAR", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "INDYCAR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_Penske", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Team Penske"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis_500", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis 500"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_McLaughlin_(racing_driver)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Scott McLaughlin (racing driver)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Power", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Will Power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horsepower", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Horsepower"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Penske", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Roger Penske"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IndyCar_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "IndyCar Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auto_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Auto racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorsport", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Motorsport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Petersburg,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "St. Petersburg, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "St. Petersburg, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pit_stop", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pit stop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Cindric", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tim Cindric"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis_Motor_Speedway", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis Motor Speedway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daytona_500", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daytona 500"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Road racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Beach,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Long Beach, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Long Beach, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Austin, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Austin, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0da81b0/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3500x1969+0+182/resize/1200x675!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F7b%2F23%2Feee6cb78679e34a2d37fffffb97f%2F740bc253998f400e9096eb1614c3de7b", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546108", "eventUri": "eng-9546108", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-03-10", "textStart": 313, "textEnd": 321, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-21", "textStart": 2372, "textEnd": 2380}], "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 225, "relevance": 1}

The system is controlled by IndyCar and disabled on starts and restarts, when the extra boost of horsepower is illegal.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nIndyCar discovered it on the Penske cars in the morning warm-up at Long Beach when a glitch to the software knocked it out of all cars except the three Penske entries. IndyCar's investigation later showed that the software had been in place in the season-opening race and Newgarden used it to his advantage an admitted three times.\n\nScott McLaughlin said he used it once at St. Petersburg and Power never illegally used the software. IndyCar stripped Newgarden of the St. Pete win and McLaughlin of his third-place finish, while all three drivers were fined $25,000 and docked 10 points.\n\nPenske owns the race team, IndyCar and the Indianapolis Motor Speedway and has been in damage control since series officials discovered the manipulation late last month. Cindric said the software was inadvertently left on the cars since last August when it was installed to test IndyCar's upcoming hybrid engine.\n\nIndyCar has said it is working on its processes to determine how it wasn't found through inspection at the first three events to open the season.\n\nNewgarden, meanwhile, maintains he thought there had been a rule change and the P2P system was now legal on restarts. McLaughlin said he hit the button out of habit and gained no advantage from the horsepower boost that lasted less than 2 seconds.\n\nAP Motorsports: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

It's an argument that their peers have scoffed at.\n\nCindric also offered a personal statement.\n\n\"For Ron and I as leaders of this team, it's not about what we did, it's about what we didn't do,\" he said. \"It is our responsibility to provide the Team and all our drivers with the right processes to ensure something like this can't happen.\n\n\"For that, I apologize to Roger, our Team and everyone that supports us.

Six weeks later, the series discovered that the three Penske cars were able to use a software system to get a horsepower boost on starts and restarts, which is against the rules.\n\nTim Cindric, who oversees all Team Penske operations and is the strategist for Newgarden, is the top name to receive the two-race suspension, which includes the showcase Indy 500 on Memorial Day weekend. Also suspended was team managing director Ron Ruzewski, Newgarden engineer Luke Mason and senior data engineer Robbie Atkinson.\n\nCindric and Ruzewski \"raised their hands as the team leaders\" to accept responsibility for the mess, Penske told AP.\n\n\"For Ron and I as leaders of this team, it's not about what we did, it's about what we didn't do. It is our responsibility to provide the team and all our drivers with the right processes to ensure something like this can't happen,\" Cindric said in a statement. \"For that, I apologize to Roger, our team and everyone that supports us. Our number one job is to protect and enhance the reputation of our brand and that of those that support us.\n\n\"In that regard, as the overall leader, I failed, and I must raise my hand and be accountable with the others. This is a team, and in my position, it's the right thing to do.\"\n\nRuzewski and Atkinson both work on Will Power's car -- Ruzewski is his strategist -- and Power was the only one of the three Penske drivers not accused of wrongdoing. Penske acknowledged that Power had done nothing wrong and said the suspensions to his crew members were based solely on their roles within the team. None of Scott McLaughlin's team members were punished; the driver was earlier stripped of his third-place finish at the March race.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nThe suspensions cover this weekend's race on the Indianapolis Motor Speedway road course and the Indy 500, which Penske is trying to win for a record-extending 20th time.\n\n\"That's a big deal, a significant impact to the team, to the individuals involved,\" Penske told the AP of the Indy 500 being included in the suspensions. \"I talked to all of them and the goal was, 'How can we move forward and be competitive and win? Win the next two races?' That was the feeling I had when I left the meeting.\"\n\nAsked how Newgarden moves forward and regains the respect of his competitors, Penske said: \"He's got to do it on the racetrack. I think he understands the gravity of this thing and I need to support him.\"\n\nHe said contract talks with Newgarden are ongoing but \"for sure I do\" want to re-sign him.\n\nThe push-to-pass function is controlled by IndyCar and disabled on starts and restarts, when the extra boost of horsepower is illegal. Two weeks ago at Long Beach, a glitch in the software knocked out the software on all cars except the three Penske entries. IndyCar's investigation later showed that the software had been in place in the season-opening race and Newgarden used it to his advantage an admitted three times.\n\nNewgarden said he thought there had been a rule change and the P2P system was now legal on restarts. McLaughlin said he hit the button out of habit and gained no advantage from the horsepower boost that lasted less than 2 seconds.\n\nMcLaughlin said he used it once at St. Petersburg and Power never illegally used it. Besides stripping Newgarden and McLaughlin of their podium finishes, IndyCar fined all three drivers $25,000 and docked them 10 points each.\n\nCindric said the software was inadvertently left on the cars since last August when it was installed to test IndyCar's upcoming hybrid engine but the scandal shook IndyCar, which had not had a disqualification in 29 years.\n\nPenske owns the race team, IndyCar and the Indianapolis Motor Speedway and has been in damage control\n\n\"I recognize the magnitude of what occurred and the impact it continues to have on the sport to which I've dedicated so many decades,\" Penske said in the statement when the punishments were announced. \"Everyone at Team Penske along with our fans and business partners should know that I apologize for the errors that were made and I deeply regret them.\"\n\nIndyCar has said it is trying to determine how the software wasn't found through inspection during the season's first three races.\n\nClose 1 of 17\n\nSan Diego Padres' Manny Machado falls after stopping a base hit by Arizona Diamondbacks' Lourdes Gurriel Jr. during the sixth inning of a baseball game, Saturday, May 4, 2024, in Phoenix.

We've done that and we're going to move on. I am not trying to run a popularity contest.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...

WJBC mourns loss of former radio host Scott Laughlin\n\nThe scandal dates to the IndyCar season-opener in March won by Newgarden. Six weeks later, the series discovered that the three Penske cars were able to use a software system to get a horsepower boost on starts and restarts, which is against the rules.\n\nTim Cindric, who oversees all Team Penske operations and is the strategist for Newgarden, is the top name to receive the two-race suspension, which includes the showcase Indy 500 on Memorial Day weekend. Also suspended was team managing director Ron Ruzewski, Newgarden engineer Luke Mason and senior data engineer Robbie Atkinson.\n\nCindric and Ruzewski \"raised their hands as the team leaders\" to accept responsibility for the mess, Penske told AP.\n\n\"For Ron and I as leaders of this team, it's not about what we did, it's about what we didn't do. It is our responsibility to provide the team and all our drivers with the right processes to ensure something like this can't happen,\" Cindric said in a statement. \"For that, I apologize to Roger, our team and everyone that supports us. Our number one job is to protect and enhance the reputation of our brand and that of those that support us.\n\n\"In that regard, as the overall leader, I failed, and I must raise my hand and be accountable with the others. This is a team, and in my position, it's the right thing to do.\"\n\nRuzewski and Atkinson both work on Will Power's car -- Ruzewski is his strategist -- and Power was the only one of the three Penske drivers not accused of wrongdoing. Penske acknowledged that Power had done nothing wrong and said the suspensions to his crew members were based solely on their roles within the team. None of Scott McLaughlin's team members were punished; the driver was earlier stripped of his thirdplace finish at the March race.\n\nThe suspensions cover this weekend's race on the Indianapolis Motor Speedway road course and the Indy 500, which Penske is trying to win for a record-extending 20th time.\n\n\"That's a big deal, a significant impact to the team, to the individuals involved,\" Penske told the AP of the Indy 500 being included in the suspensions. \"I talked to all of them and the goal was, 'How can we move forward and be competitive and win? Win the next two races?' That was the feeling I had when I left the meeting.\"\n\nAsked how Newgarden moves forward and regains the respect of his competitors, Penske said: \"He's got to do it on the racetrack. I think he understands the gravity of this thing and I need to support him.\"\n\nHe said contract talks with Newgarden are ongoing but \"for sure I do\" want to re-sign him.\n\nThe push-to-pass function is controlled by IndyCar and disabled on starts and restarts, when the extra boost of horsepower is illegal. Two weeks ago at Long Beach, a glitch in the software knocked out the software on all cars except the three Penske entries. IndyCar's investigation later showed that the software had been in place in the season-opening race and Newgarden used it to his advantage an admitted three times.\n\nNewgarden said he thought there had been a rule change and the P2P system was now legal on restarts. McLaughlin said he hit the button out of habit and gained no advantage from the horsepower boost that lasted less than 2 seconds.\n\nMcLaughlin said he used it once at St. Petersburg and Power never illegally used it. Besides stripping Newgarden and McLaughlin of their podium finishes, IndyCar fined all three drivers $25,000 and docked them 10 points each.\n\nLove 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nTags Sports Law

Six weeks later, the series discovered that the three Penske cars were able to use a software system to get a horsepower boost on starts and restarts, which is against the rules.\n\nTim Cindric, who oversees all Team Penske operations and is the strategist for Newgarden, is the top name to receive the two-race suspension, which includes the showcase Indy 500 on Memorial Day weekend. Also suspended was team managing director Ron Ruzewski, Newgarden engineer Luke Mason and senior data engineer Robbie Atkinson.\n\nCindric and Ruzewski \"raised their hands as the team leaders\" to accept responsibility for the mess, Penske told AP.\n\n\"For Ron and I as leaders of this team, it's not about what we did, it's about what we didn't do. It is our responsibility to provide the team and all our drivers with the right processes to ensure something like this can't happen,\" Cindric said in a statement. \"For that, I apologize to Roger, our team and everyone that supports us. Our number one job is to protect and enhance the reputation of our brand and that of those that support us.\n\n\"In that regard, as the overall leader, I failed, and I must raise my hand and be accountable with the others. This is a team, and in my position, it's the right thing to do.\"\n\nRuzewski and Atkinson both work on Will Power's car -- Ruzewski is his strategist -- and Power was the only one of the three Penske drivers not accused of wrongdoing. Penske acknowledged that Power had done nothing wrong and said the suspensions to his crew members were based solely on their roles within the team. None of Scott McLaughlin's team members were punished; the driver was earlier stripped of his third-place finish at the March race.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nThe suspensions cover this weekend's race on the Indianapolis Motor Speedway road course and the Indy 500, which Penske is trying to win for a record-extending 20th time.\n\n\"That's a big deal, a significant impact to the team, to the individuals involved,\" Penske told the AP of the Indy 500 being included in the suspensions. \"I talked to all of them and the goal was, 'How can we move forward and be competitive and win? Win the next two races?' That was the feeling I had when I left the meeting.\"\n\nAsked how Newgarden moves forward and regains the respect of his competitors, Penske said: \"He's got to do it on the racetrack. I think he understands the gravity of this thing and I need to support him.\"\n\nHe said contract talks with Newgarden are ongoing but \"for sure I do\" want to re-sign him.\n\nThe push-to-pass function is controlled by IndyCar and disabled on starts and restarts, when the extra boost of horsepower is illegal. Two weeks ago at Long Beach, a glitch in the software knocked out the software on all cars except the three Penske entries. IndyCar's investigation later showed that the software had been in place in the season-opening race and Newgarden used it to his advantage an admitted three times.\n\nNewgarden said he thought there had been a rule change and the P2P system was now legal on restarts. McLaughlin said he hit the button out of habit and gained no advantage from the horsepower boost that lasted less than 2 seconds.\n\nMcLaughlin said he used it once at St. Petersburg and Power never illegally used it. Besides stripping Newgarden and McLaughlin of their podium finishes, IndyCar fined all three drivers $25,000 and docked them 10 points each.\n\nCindric said the software was inadvertently left on the cars since last August when it was installed to test IndyCar's upcoming hybrid engine but the scandal shook IndyCar, which had not had a disqualification in 29 years.\n\nPenske owns the race team, IndyCar and the Indianapolis Motor Speedway and has been in damage control\n\n\"I recognize the magnitude of what occurred and the impact it continues to have on the sport to which I've dedicated so many decades,\" Penske said in the statement when the punishments were announced. \"Everyone at Team Penske along with our fans and business partners should know that I apologize for the errors that were made and I deeply regret them.\"\n\nIndyCar has said it is trying to determine how the software wasn't found through inspection during the season's first three races.\n\nClose\n\nSan Diego Padres' Manny Machado falls after stopping a base hit by Arizona Diamondbacks' Lourdes Gurriel Jr. during the sixth inning of a baseball game, Saturday, May 4, 2024, in Phoenix.

His teammate, Scott McLaughlin, was also disqualified from his third-place finish in the race.\n\nPenske said Tuesday that a review done by his general counsel found no \"malicious intent by anyone\" and chalked up the incident as a breakdown in internal processes and miscommunication.\n\nHowever, the series discovered that the three Penske cars were able to use a software system to get a horsepower boost on starts and restarts, which is against the rules.\n\nThe push-to-pass function is controlled by IndyCar and disabled on starts and restarts, when the extra boost of horsepower is illegal. Two weeks ago at Long Beach, a glitch in the software knocked out the software on all cars except the three Penske entries. IndyCar's investigation later showed that the software had been in place in the season-opening race and Newgarden used it to his advantage an admitted three times.\n\nNewgarden said he thought there had been a rule change and the P2P system was now legal on restarts. McLaughlin said he hit the button out of habit and gained no advantage from the horsepower boost that lasted less than two seconds.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nMcLaughlin said he used it once at St. Petersburg, and Will Power never illegally used it.

He wasn't, however, officially declared the winner of the race.\n\nNewgarden was disqualified and stripped of a victory for manipulating his push-to-pass system. His Penske teammates, Scott McLaughlin and Will Power were also penalized after season-opening race.\n\nMcLaughlin finished third and was disqualified, while Power, who placed fourth, was docked 10 points.\n\nAll three Penske entries in the race were fined $25,000. The racers also forfeited all the prize money associated with the race.\n\nNewgarden's disqualification paved the way for Pato O'Ward, who technically finished one sport behind Newgarden, to win the race. O'Ward's victory marked the first for McLaren's IndyCar team since 2022.\n\nPrevious reporting shows that Team Penske manipulated overtake systems, allowing their three drivers to use push-to-pass on starts and restarts. IndyCar rules dictate that an overtake system should not be used until a driver crosses the alternate finish line.\n\nAt the time of Newgarden's disqualification, Cindric said that the push-to-pass software was not removed from Penske's vehicles following recent hybrid testing the team had been conducting.\n\n\"This software allowed for push-to-pass to be deployed during restarts at the St. Petersburg Grand Prix race when it should not have been permitted,\" Cindric said after the Firestone Grand Prix. \"The No. 2 car driven by Josef Newgarden and the No. 3 car driven by Scott McLaughlin, both deployed push-to-pass on a restart, which violated IndyCar rules. Team Penske accepts the penalties applied by IndyCar.\"\n\nIn a statement posted on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, Team Penske indicated that it had conducted a comprehensive internal review of the situation. The team discovered \"that there were significant failures in (its) processes and internal communications\" during its investigation.\n\n\"I recognize the magnitude of what occurred and the impact it continues to have on the sport to which I've dedicated so many decades,\" Roger Penske wrote in a prepared statement. \"Everyone at Team Penske, along with our fans and business partners, should know that I apologize for the errors that were made, and I deeply regret them.\"\n\nTeam Penske's infractions allegedly happened in Florida but weren't discovered until its drivers were warming up for the Acura Grand Prix of Long Beach in California more than a month later.\n\nPenske's NASCAR team was also penalized earlier this year.

Newgarden's race engineer Luke Mason, as well as Power's data engineer Robbie Atkinson have also been suspended, according to the team.\n\nThe news was first reported by Trackside Online.\n\nThe internal punishments stem from a team-wide infraction involving improper coding in the setup software of all three of Team Penske's IndyCar entries at the St. Pete season-opener, giving Newgarden, Power and Scott McLaughlin the capability of using push-to-pass boost during starts and restarts -- something that has long been banned by the series. The team claims coding was added to the software last August at the outset of intensive manufacturer hybrid testing and then accidentally copy-and-pasted into the 2024 regular season setups, allowing Newgarden to use overtake three times during his resounding win from pole (for 9 seconds total) when his competitors only had typical horsepower at their disposal.\n\n'The god-honest truth': Cindric explains how IndyCar team ran afoul of rules -- by accident\n\nMcLaughlin hit the button once for 1.9 seconds, and Power was found not to have used it at all. Newgarden and McLaughlin, who finished third in the season-opener, were disqualified. Power was docked 10 points. The transgression, shrouded by multiple conflicting stories between team personnel and their drivers as to what led to the series' stiffest penalties in recent memory, was wholly accidental, Cindric told IndyStar a day after IndyCar announced the penalties.\n\n\"The difficulty with this whole situation is people expect we were trying to circumvent the rules with the software, and we honestly weren't,\" Cindric told IndyStar April 25. \"I know it sounds like we're making this up, but it's the truth.\n\n\"If we were trying to gain an advantage, why would we do it when the push-to-pass and RPM data is available for everyone to see, and why would we think no one would notice? These are things you can't hide, so to say we purposefully did this to gain an advantage, I don't know how you can come to that conclusion, unless that's what you want to believe.\"\n\n'You think we're all stupid?': IndyCar reacts to Team Penske's rules violations\n\nIn an emotional 25-minute press conference to kickoff the race weekend at Barber Motorsports Park, Newgarden claimed that personnel on his No. 2 car -- seemingly implicating not only him, but quite possibly Cindric as well, among others -- misunderstood rules around push-to-pass for the 2024 season. The 2023 Indy 500 winner stated they understood that overtake had been made legal on starts and restarts schedule-wide, rather than just for the $1 Million Challenge exhibition at The Thermal Club March 24. And so when he hit the overtake button those three times at St. Pete, and it worked, he thought nothing of it.\n\nFor good measure, Newgarden told reporters, he even asked for his team to remind him of the perceived rule change, further implicating his strategist. \"Whenever you get something new as a driver, it's like, 'Please remind me,'\" Newgarden said of his message to his team members. \"It's easy for me to forget this stuff with everything going on inside the car. I specifically asked for that, too. We all knew about that.\"\n\nHow one of the most meticulous drivers in the sport, driving for one of the most successful team officials the sport has seen -- for a team owned by Roger Penske, no less -- convinced themselves a rule change had happened when it hadn't, when Power and McLauglin both told reporters that no such change was ever discussed team-wide, is unclear. For what it's worth, Newgarden himself admitted the reasoning lacked believability and by no means should be seen as a worthwhile excuse.\n\n\"I know what happened. I know why it happened. I don't think it's very believable, even when I try to tell the story back. I don't think any of us believe it will be believable to somebody, but it's the truth,\" he said. \"The facts are that I used it illegally, and I can't change that. Whatever I say going forward will not change those facts.\n\n\"It kills me that it doesn't. I wish I could go back in time and somehow reverse all this, but I can't.\"\n\n'I don't think it's very believable': Newgarden responds to cheating allegations\n\nEntangled in this -- along with the fact McLaughlin claims not to have noticed the extra 50 horsepower boost his No. 3 Chevy received when he unknowingly hit the overtake button -- is the fact that no engineers, whether they be on Team Penske or Chevy/Ilmor's side, noticed any abnormality in either Newgarden or McLaughlin's data during traditional internal post-race reviews -- which handfuls of rival drivers and team officials told IndyStar should've been a simple catch. IndyCar's on-track officiating crew, spearheaded by series president Jay Frye, also admitted to not catching the coding advantage in the six weeks between the first and second points-paying races of the year, until race control noticed Team Penske drivers using push-to-pass during Sunday morning warmup at Long Beach when the capability had not been turned on for the field.\n\nIn a media scrum at Barber, both Frye and Penske Entertainment president and CEO Mark Miles told reporters that the series had combed back through all Team Penske's 2023 data and found no evidence of prolonged race infractions outside St. Pete this year. They deemed their investigation complete and the penalties set.\n\nThe bulk of the paddock believes something purposeful, or at minimum unethical, had gone on inside Team Penske. Whether Penske himself, who also owns the series and has, since his acquisition, pledged to have safeguards between he and the day-to-day competition side of his team, actively knew of the alleged cheating, paddock team leaders remain split. But few, if any, believe the story plainly to be one of accidents, oversights and misunderstandings.\n\n'I don't really believe the story': Ex-Penske employee on team's push to pass violations\n\n\"Roger's got to clean his own house up,\" Dale Coyne told IndyStar at Barber after Penske held a private meeting with representatives of the nine other teams to apologize and take responsibility for his team's gaffes.\n\nIn the wake of speculation as to whether its own engineers either actively and purposefully gave Team Penske drivers an advantage to start this season, or whether they uncovered it post-St. Pete and remained silent, General Motors president Mark Reuss announced last week that the company had hired a third-party law firm to \"conduct a thorough review\" of Chevy's culpability. They found no evidence of wrongdoing, Reuss said in a statement Friday.\n\n\"We respect the decision and actions of IndyCar, as well as Team Penske's commitment to improve their processes and controls,\" Reuss said in the release, noting that no Chevy employees \"had any knowledge of or involvement in the matter.\"\n\n\"Chevy looks forward to engaging with IndyCar and our partner race teams to assist in any enhancements that further support the integrity of IndyCar competition.\"\n\n'Roger's got to clean his house up': IndyCar owners meet with Penske over scandal\n\nEven without admission of purposeful wrongdoing, Tuesday's announcement of severe internal punishments at Team Penske marks a swift about-face after multiple team members talked of banding together and closing ranks in the wake of McLaughlin's win and Power's runner-up finish at Barber, where Ruzewski told IndyStar he and others couldn't entirely block out external chatter from their rivals implying Team Penske had engaged in purposeful cheating. Nonetheless, he said, there were no internal \"hidden agendas\" or \"lies\" that had to be covered up. \"Haters are always going to hate and always try to find something to bring you down, but one thing we won't do is let this tear us down,\" Ruzewski told IndyStar at Barber.\n\nHours after the scandal came to light, Cindric told IndyStar he was confident that no Team Penske members had knowingly skirted the rules, noting that if he or Penske had, \"you would've known who it was by now.\"", "source": {"uri": "indystar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Indystar"}, "authors": [{"uri": "indianapolis_star@indystar.com", "name": "Indianapolis Star", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Push-to-pass", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Push-to-pass"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INDYCAR", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "INDYCAR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_Penske", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Team Penske"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_McLaughlin_(racing_driver)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scott McLaughlin (racing driver)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Power", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Will Power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josef_Newgarden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Josef Newgarden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis_500", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis 500"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Indianapolis_Star", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Indianapolis Star"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car_suspension", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Car suspension"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Cindric", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tim Cindric"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_engineer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Race engineer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis_Motor_Speedway", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis Motor Speedway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chevrolet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horsepower", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Horsepower"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hybrid electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barber_Motorsports_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Barber Motorsports Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dale_Coyne", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dale Coyne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "General Motors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Beach,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Long Beach, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Long Beach, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Rope_Skipping/Clubs_and_Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Rope Skipping/Clubs and Teams", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure_Racing/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure Racing/Teams", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Education_and_Training/Team_Building", "label": "dmoz/Business/Education and Training/Team Building", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2024/04/25/PIND/73459628007-tim-cindric-ref-image-without-watermark-m-34836.jpg?auto=webp&crop=1079,607,x0,y0&format=pjpg&width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546108", "eventUri": "eng-9546108", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-25", "textStart": 2155, "textEnd": 2163}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-03-24", "textStart": 3165, "textEnd": 3173}], "sentiment": -0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 205, "relevance": 1}

The system is controlled by IndyCar and disabled on starts and restarts, when the extra boost of horsepower is illegal.\n\nIndyCar discovered it on the Penske cars in the morning warm-up at Long Beach when a glitch to the software knocked it out of all cars except the three Penske entries. IndyCar's investigation later showed that the software had been in place in the season-opening race and Newgarden used it to his advantage an admitted three times.\n\nScott McLaughlin said he used it once at St. Petersburg and Power never illegally used the software. IndyCar stripped Newgarden of the St. Pete win and McLaughlin of his third-place finish, while all three drivers were fined $25,000 and docked 10 points.\n\nPenske owns the race team, IndyCar and the Indianapolis Motor Speedway and has been in damage control since series officials discovered the manipulation late last month. Cindric said the software was inadvertently left on the cars since last August when it was installed to test IndyCar's upcoming hybrid engine.\n\nIndyCar has said it is working on its processes to determine how it wasn't found through inspection at the first three events to open the season.\n\nNewgarden, meanwhile, maintains he thought there had been a rule change and the P2P system was now legal on restarts. McLaughlin said he hit the button out of habit and gained no advantage from the horsepower boost that lasted less than 2 seconds.\n\nAP Motorsports: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Using the system is allowed only during a predetermined period of a race.\n\nJosef Newgarden and Scott McLaughlin were disqualified, while Will Power received a 10-point penalty from the Firestone Grand Prix of St. Petersburg. Newgarden initially won the race. McLaughlin finished third, while Power placed fourth at the season-opening March 10 event in St. Petersburg, Fla.\n\nOn Tuesday, Penske also suspended No. 2 race engineer Luke Mason, senior data engineer Robbie Atkinson and Team Penske managing director Ron Ruzewski, in addition to Cindric, for two races.\n\nIndyCar said it discovered Team Penske's \"possible rules violation\" during an April 21 warmup session for the Acura Grand Prix of Long Beach.\n\nIndyCar's extensive review from the St. Petersburg race also revealed that the team \"manipulated the overtake system\" so that the Nos. 2 (Newgarden), 3 (McLaughlin) and 12 (Power) could use the push-to-pass system on starts and restarts.\n\nThe review determined that Newgarden and McLaughlin \"gained a competitive advantage\" by using the system at starts and restarts, while Power did not. All three drivers were fined $25,000 and forfeited all prize money associated with the race.\n\nPato O'Ward was credited with the win, after it was stripped from Newgarden.\n\n\"The facts are extremely clear,\" Newgarden told reporters last month. \"There's no doubt that we were in breach of the rules at St. Petersburg. I used push-to-pass at an unauthorized time twice, on two different restarts. There's really nothing else to it other than that. Those are the rules, and we did not adhere to them.\"\n\nNewgarden said he \"knew exactly when\" he pushed the button, while McLaughlin said he had \"no recollection of hitting\" the button.\n\nMcLaughlin went on to win the Children's of Alabama Indy Grand Prix on April 28 in Birmingham, Ala. Power finished second, followed by Linus Lundqvist. Newgarden placed 16th.\n\nNewgarden finished second in the March 24 $1 Million Challenge All-Star Race and fourth at the April 21 Acura Grand Prix of Long Beach.\n\nThe reigning Indianapolis 500 champion will now be without several key team members for his title defense. Power, who won the 2018 Indianapolis 500, finished 12th in last year's event, while McLaughlin placed second.\n\nColton Herta, who placed inside the Top 3 in two of three championship events this season, leads the driver standings. He finished inside the Top 10 of each event.\n\nPower (100 points) sits in second place, one point behind Herta. McLaughlin (59) is in ninth place, while Newgarden (48) is 16th.\n\nThe Sonsio Grand Prix is the next race on the NTT IndyCar Series schedule. That event will be held at 3 p.m. EDT Saturday at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway and air on NBC.\n\nThe 108th Indianapolis 500 will be at 11 a.m. May 26 in Indianapolis and also air on NBC.",

The suspended parties include Team Penske president Tim Cindric, managing director Ron Ruzewski, No. 2 race engineer Luke Mason and assistant engineer Robbie Atkinson.\n\nPenske spoke to Racer.com's Marshall Pruett on Tuesday and detailed his feeling and the decision-making progress that led to the suspensions. Read that story for the full details but here is a summary of what he discussed:\n\nPenske says Newgarden wasn't suspended because he felt the disqualification was sufficient when factoring the points he lost via the disqualification and fine to his No. 2 team.\n\nHe says an internal investigation concluded the software was installed 'eight months ago' and was a 'process failure' from the teams and a 'communication' failure to the drivers.\n\nDuring a press conference at Barber Motorsports Park the week after the infractions were discovered at Long Beach, Newgarden said 'we convinced ourselves that there was a rule change to restarts specifically with overtake usage.' He said 'you can call me incompetent, call me an idiot, call me an asshole, call me stupid, whatever you want to call me but I'm not a liar.'\n\nHe said he recognized that the story was hard to believe.\n\n\"The story that I know, which is the truth, is almost too convenient to be believable. ... I didn't leave St. Pete thinking we pulled something over on somebody,\" Newgarden said. \"I didn't know that we did something wrong until this week.\"Then I've had to wrestle with the fact that, how do you explain a situation to people? I know what happened. I know why it happened. I don't think it's very believable, even when I try to tell the story back. I don't think any of us believe it will be believable to somebody. But it's the truth.\"\n\nThus, Penske said that a combination of an internal review and the one conducted by Chevrolet, produced evidence that 'Newgarden didn't understand what the rules were, and he has taken the penalty.'\n\nPenske said the four employees were suspended and not fired because 'there was no malicious intent by anyone from the standpoint of what took place.'\n\nOf note, Penske said he was in Europe at the time and that he was not even directly aware in real-time that the incident had transpired. And while he owns both the series and Indianapolis Motor Speedway and the Team Penske, he has attempted to divest himself from that conflict of interest while delegating leadership of the race team to Cindric.\n\nAlso, Penske says an outside and independent law firm was not hired to investigate the matter because of Penske's leadership divestment.\n\n\"I was not involved at all, no conversation - made the decision about the disqualification. And that's the job that the series does,\" Penske told RACER.\n\n\"We [Team Penske] did an internal investigation of the entire situation, with our chief legal counsel who interviewed the people who were involved, and as you know, the software was installed in the car eight months ago and there was no malicious intent by anyone based on our investigation, and the outcome and the actions we took, I think, were appropriate.\"\n\nPenske also says he took several weeks to speak publicly about the matter because he was in Europe, 'didn't have all the facts' and then had to be part of the process of determining penalties.\n\nLastly, Penske addressed concerns that a culture of malpractice has developed at Team Penske across NASCAR, IMSA and now IndyCar as the organization has been penalized this year across all three disciplines. That narrative runs counter to the 'Penske Perfect' mantra, doing things the right ways, and all the things that the company has worked to embody for decades.\n\nPenske said the IMSA violation was just '0.015 light' and only 'after the cars ran over curbs.'\n\n\"Again, no intent,\" Penske said.\n\nLogano said he was lectured by Penske in the aftermath of the NASCAR penalty.\n\n\"As far as the glove is concerned, Joey had a glove that was deemed not the right glove,\" Penske told RACER. \"NASCAR has a penalty system concerning many different penalties which happen from time to time within NASCAR. And he was he was made to make a drive-through and also a financial penalty. None of these things relate to what happened today.\"\n\nPenske closed the interview by saying any narrative that ties these incidents together or is a reflection of 'some process inside our company (as) systemic' would be incorrect.", "source": {"uri": "sportsnaut.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportsnaut.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matt_weaver@sportsnaut.com", "name": "Matt Weaver", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_Penske", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Team Penske"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_wrestling", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Professional wrestling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car_suspension", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Car suspension"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racer_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Racer (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Cindric", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tim Cindric"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INDYCAR", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "INDYCAR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barber_Motorsports_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Barber Motorsports Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_engineer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Race engineer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis_500", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis 500"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis_Motor_Speedway", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis Motor Speedway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chevrolet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Beach,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Long Beach, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Long Beach, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMSA", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "IMSA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASCAR", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NASCAR"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 72}], "image": "https://sportsnaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Syndication-The-Indianapolis-Star-20660966.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546108", "eventUri": "eng-9546108", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2156862745098039, "wgt": 200, "relevance": 1}

Faustino has helped engineer Power to 40 of his 41 wins. This weekend, he adds being the strategist of the No. 12 to his resume, filling in for Ron Ruzewski, who is also Team Penske's IndyCar managing director.\n\nThough not typical, Faustino holding the lead engineer and strategist roles on the No. 12 Chevy this weekend isn't unheard of. Arrow McLaren's Will Anderson has held both roles on Pato O'Ward's No. 5 Chevy entry since the start of 2023.\n\nIn place of Josef Newgarden's longtime strategist Tim Cindric, who also serves as president of Team Penske, Jon Bouslog, one of Penske's longest-serving team members, slides over from his day-to-day shop-based role as Team Penske's special projects manager to call the shots on the No. 2 Chevy. Bouslog has been part of more than a dozen of Team Penske's 19 Indy 500 victories and called strategy for Scott McLaughlin during his rookie IndyCar season in 2021. He also recently served as the general manager of Penske's IMSA program.\n\nTo replace its two benched engineers -- Newgarden's race engineer Luke Mason and Power's data engineer Robbie Atkinson -- Team Penske has dug into its deep pool of engineers to fill a pair of gaps this weekend. Mason's replacement, Raul Prados, serves as a lead race engineer for Penske's Porsche sportscar program -- both wings of which are active this weekend at Spa (WEC) and Laguna Seca (IMSA). In his seven years at Team Penske, along with previous IndyCar experience, he also won an IMSA DPi title with the No. 7 Team Penske Acura entry in 2020 and grabbed a Rolex 24 overall win with the No. 7 Porsche Penske GTP car earlier this year.\n\nPaulo Trentini Filho, the team's data engineer replacement for Atkinson this weekend, is more plug-and-play, having started this year in a lesser data engineer role on the No. 12 Chevy. He's been part of Team Penske's engineering corps for just over five years.\n\nRoger Penske: 'Proper investigation' led to 4 IndyCar team suspensions including Indy 500\n\nAtkinson and Mason were suspended for their roles in Team Penske's push-to-pass scandal uncovered last month that led to Newgarden and McLaughlin being disqualified retroactively by IndyCar from the St. Pete season-opener where the pair finished 1st and 3rd. All three Penske cars had illegal use of push-to-pass on starts and restarts because of a line of code that had been inserted into the drivers' setup profiles last August when hybrid testing ramped up.\n\nAccording to the team, that profile software didn't make its way into the software Team Penske uses for race weekends until just ahead of the St. Pete opener in March, when the coding that gave the team widespread use of push-to-pass for testing purposes was copy-and-pasted into the drivers' 2024 setup profiles. At St. Pete, Newgarden used overtake three times (for a total of 9 seconds) when the rest of the non-Penske field didn't have access to it. McLaughlin used it once for 1.9 seconds and Power didn't ever hit the button out of typical circumstances.\n\nAfter an internal review from Penske Corp.'s general counsel, Atkinson was found to have put the coding in the team's test software back in August and then forgot to make the switch to bring the cars up to legal standards. Though not entirely spelled out, it was implied Mason's shortcomings stemmed from Newgarden and others on the No. 2 car believing that push-to-pass rules on starts and restarts had changed in the offseason to allow drivers to hit the button any time the race was green. That belief then fueled Newgarden being unaware he'd broken any rules at St. Pete until the coding was discovered during the Sunday morning warmup at Long Beach. Others in the paddock have also implored that Mason, and perhaps other Penske and Chevy engineers, should've caught the abnormalities in Newgarden's data during or shortly after the St. Pete weekend.\n\nMore: Penske president Cindric allowed to cover NASCAR, IMSA, WEC duties during IndyCar suspension\n\nDuring their suspensions, which stretch through the checkered flag for the 500 May 26, the four Penske IndyCar team members are not permitted at the track or in Indianapolis and have been barred from any type of contact with team members while cars are on-track for practice, qualifying or racing. In separate conversations, Penske and a team spokesperson both declined to say that Cindric, Ruzewski, Mason and Atkinson would be barred from contact with the team of any kind, seemingly opening the door for them to continue participating in end-of-day debriefs and other team meetings.\n\nTheoretically, the pair of engineers may still be able to also work on projects for their respective IndyCar entries from afar, too, when they're off-track, though that has not been explicitly stated. A team spokesperson did say Cindric would be permitted to go on with his traditional duties as team president with Penske's NASCAR, IMSA and WEC programs -- including potentially attending any of those series' five total events between now and May 26.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Indianapolis Star: Team Penske names subs for suspended employees for Sonsio Grand Prix", "source":

Six weeks later, the series discovered that the three Penske cars were able to use a software system to get a horsepower boost on starts and restarts, which is against the rules.\n\nTim Cindric, who oversees all Team Penske operations and is the strategist for Newgarden, is the top name to receive the two-race suspension, which includes the showcase Indy 500 on Memorial Day weekend. Also suspended was team managing director Ron Ruzewski, Newgarden engineer Luke Mason and senior data engineer Robbie Atkinson.\n\nCindric and Ruzewski \"raised their hands as the team leaders\" to accept responsibility for the mess, Penske told AP.\n\n\"For Ron and I as leaders of this team, it's not about what we did, it's about what we didn't do. It is our responsibility to provide the team and all our drivers with the right processes to ensure something like this can't happen,\" Cindric said in a statement. \"For that, I apologize to Roger, our team and everyone that supports us. Our number one job is to protect and enhance the reputation of our brand and that of those that support us.\n\n\"In that regard, as the overall leader, I failed, and I must raise my hand and be accountable with the others. This is a team, and in my position, it's the right thing to do.\"\n\nRuzewski and Atkinson both work on Will Power's car -- Ruzewski is his strategist -- and Power was the only one of the three Penske drivers not accused of wrongdoing. Penske acknowledged that Power had done nothing wrong and said the suspensions to his crew members were based solely on their roles within the team. None of Scott McLaughlin's team members were punished; the driver was earlier stripped of his third-place finish at the March race.\n\n0 Comments Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nBe the first to

The team claims coding was added to the software last August at the outset of intensive manufacturer hybrid testing and then accidentally copy-and-pasted into the 2024 regular season setups, allowing Newgarden to use overtake three times during his resounding win from pole (for 9 seconds total) when his competitors only had typical horsepower at their disposal.\n\n'The god-honest truth': Cindric explains how IndyCar team ran afoul of rules -- by accident\n\nMcLaughlin hit the button once for 1.9 seconds, and Power was found not to have used it at all. Newgarden and McLaughlin, who finished third in the season-opener, were disqualified. Power was docked 10 points. The transgression, shrouded by multiple conflicting stories between team personnel and their drivers as to what led to the series' stiffest penalties in recent memory, was wholly accidental, Cindric told IndyStar a day after IndyCar announced the penalties.\n\n\"The difficulty with this whole situation is people expect we were trying to circumvent the rules with the software, and we honestly weren't,\" Cindric told IndyStar April 25. \"I know it sounds like we're making this up, but it's the truth.\n\n\"If we were trying to gain an advantage, why would we do it when the push-to-pass and RPM data is available for everyone to see, and why would we think no one would notice? These are things you can't hide, so to say we purposefully did this to gain an advantage, I don't know how you can come to that conclusion, unless that's what you want to believe.\"\n\n'You think we're all stupid?': IndyCar reacts to Team Penske's rules violations\n\nIn an emotional 25-minute press conference to kickoff the race weekend at Barber Motorsports Park, Newgarden claimed that personnel on his No. 2 car -- seemingly implicating not only him, but quite possibly Cindric as well, among others -- misunderstood rules around push-to-pass for the 2024 season. The 2023 Indy 500 winner stated they understood that overtake had been made legal on starts and restarts schedule-wide, rather than just for the $1 Million Challenge exhibition at The Thermal Club March 24. And so when he hit the overtake button those three times at St. Pete, and it worked, he thought nothing of it.\n\nFor good measure, Newgarden told reporters, he even asked for his team to remind him of the perceived rule change, further implicating his strategist. \"Whenever you get something new as a driver, it's like, 'Please remind me,'\" Newgarden said of his message to his team members. \"It's easy for me to forget this stuff with everything going on inside the car. I specifically asked for that, too. We all knew about that.\"\n\nHow one of the most meticulous drivers in the sport, driving for one of the most successful team officials the sport has seen -- for a team owned by Roger Penske, no less -- convinced themselves a rule change had happened when it hadn't, when Power and McLauglin both told reporters that no such change was ever discussed team-wide, is unclear. For what it's worth, Newgarden himself admitted the reasoning lacked believability and by no means should be seen as a worthwhile excuse.\n\n\"I know what happened. I know why it happened. I don't think it's very believable, even when I try to tell the story back. I don't think any of us believe it will be believable to somebody, but it's the truth,\" he said. \"The facts are that I used it illegally, and I can't change that. Whatever I say going forward will not change those facts.\n\n\"It kills me that it doesn't. I wish I could go back in time and somehow reverse all this, but I can't.\"\n\n'I don't think it's very believable': Newgarden responds to cheating allegations\n\nEntangled in this -- along with the fact McLaughlin claims not to have noticed the extra 50 horsepower boost his No. 3 Chevy received when he unknowingly hit the overtake button -- is the fact that no engineers, whether they be on Team Penske or Chevy/Ilmor's side, noticed any abnormality in either Newgarden or McLaughlin's data during traditional internal post-race reviews -- which handfuls of rival drivers and team officials told IndyStar should've been a simple catch. IndyCar's on-track officiating crew, spearheaded by series president Jay Frye, also admitted to not catching the coding advantage in the six weeks between the first and second points-paying races of the year, until race control noticed Team Penske drivers using push-to-pass during Sunday morning warmup at Long Beach when the capability had not been turned on for the field.\n\nIn a media scrum at Barber, both Frye and Penske Entertainment president and CEO Mark Miles told reporters that the series had combed back through all Team Penske's 2023 data and found no evidence of prolonged race infractions outside St. Pete this year. They deemed their investigation complete and the penalties set.\n\nThe bulk of the paddock believes something purposeful, or at minimum unethical, had gone on inside Team Penske. Whether Penske himself, who also owns the series and has, since his acquisition, pledged to have safeguards between he and the day-to-day competition side of his team, actively knew of the alleged cheating, paddock team leaders remain split. But few, if any, believe the story plainly to be one of accidents, oversights and misunderstandings.\n\n'I don't really believe the story': Ex-Penske employee on team's push to pass violations\n\n\"Roger's got to clean his own house up,\" Dale Coyne told IndyStar at Barber after Penske held a private meeting with representatives of the nine other teams to apologize and take responsibility for his team's gaffes.\n\nIn the wake of speculation as to whether its own engineers either actively and purposefully gave Team Penske drivers an advantage to start this season, or whether they uncovered it post-St. Pete and remained silent, General Motors president Mark Reuss announced last week that the company had hired a third-party law firm to \"conduct a thorough review\" of Chevy's culpability. They found no evidence of wrongdoing, Reuss said in a statement Friday.\n\n\"We respect the decision and actions of IndyCar, as well as Team Penske's commitment to improve their processes and controls,\" Reuss said in the release, noting that no Chevy employees \"had any knowledge of or involvement in the matter.\"\n\n\"Chevy looks forward to engaging with IndyCar and our partner race teams to assist in any enhancements that further support the integrity of IndyCar competition.\"\n\n'Roger's got to clean his house up': IndyCar owners meet with Penske over scandal\n\nEven without admission of purposeful wrongdoing, Tuesday's announcement of severe internal punishments at Team Penske marks a swift about-face after multiple team members talked of banding together and closing ranks in the wake of McLaughlin's win and Power's runner-up finish at Barber, where Ruzewski told IndyStar he and others couldn't entirely block out external chatter from their rivals implying Team Penske had engaged in purposeful cheating. Nonetheless, he said, there were no internal \"hidden agendas\" or \"lies\" that had to be covered up. \"Haters are always going to hate and always try to find something to bring you down, but one thing we won't do is let this tear us down,\" Ruzewski told IndyStar at Barber.\n\nHours after the scandal came to light, Cindric told IndyStar he was confident that no Team Penske members had knowingly skirted the rules, noting that if he or Penske had, \"you would've known who it was by now.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared on Indianapolis Star: Multiple Team Penske IndyCar officials suspended for Indy 500 after cheating scandal", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Push-to-pass", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Push-to-pass"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INDYCAR", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "INDYCAR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_Penske", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Team Penske"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_McLaughlin_(racing_driver)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scott McLaughlin (racing driver)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Power", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Will Power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josef_Newgarden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Josef Newgarden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Indianapolis_Star", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Indianapolis Star"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car_suspension", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Car suspension"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Cindric", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tim Cindric"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_engineer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Race engineer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis_Motor_Speedway", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis Motor Speedway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chevrolet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horsepower", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Horsepower"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hybrid electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barber_Motorsports_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Barber Motorsports Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis_500", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis 500"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dale_Coyne", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dale Coyne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "General Motors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Beach,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Long Beach, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Long Beach, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Airsoft/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Airsoft/Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Scenario", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Scenario", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure_Racing/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure Racing/Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/indystar-the-indianapolis-star/c6db91a5594f29d754919d8bd0a266af", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546108", "eventUri": "eng-9546108", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-25", "textStart": 2723, "textEnd": 2731}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-03-24", "textStart": 3733, "textEnd": 3741}], "sentiment": -0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

Six weeks later, the series discovered that the three Penske cars were able to use a software system to get a horsepower boost on starts and restarts, which is against the rules.\n\nTim Cindric, who oversees all Team Penske operations and is the strategist for Newgarden, is the top name to receive the two-race suspension, which includes the showcase Indy 500 on Memorial Day weekend. Also suspended was team managing director Ron Ruzewski, Newgarden engineer Luke Mason and senior data engineer Robbie Atkinson.\n\nCindric and Ruzewski \"raised their hands as the team leaders\" to accept responsibility for the mess, Penske told AP.\n\n\"For Ron and I as leaders of this team, it's not about what we did, it's about what we didn't do. It is our responsibility to provide the team and all our drivers with the right processes to ensure something like this can't happen,\" Cindric said in a statement. \"For that, I apologize to Roger, our team and everyone that supports us. Our number one job is to protect and enhance the reputation of our brand and that of those that support us.\n\n\"In that regard, as the overall leader, I failed, and I must raise my hand and be accountable with the others. This is a team, and in my position, it's the right thing to do.\"\n\nRuzewski and Atkinson both work on Will Power's car -- Ruzewski is his strategist -- and Power was the only one of the three Penske drivers not accused of wrongdoing. Penske acknowledged that Power had done nothing wrong and said the suspensions to his crew members were based solely on their roles within the team. None of Scott McLaughlin's team members were punished; the driver was earlier stripped of his third-place finish at the March race.\n\nTags Sports Business Trade The Economy Be the first to

I think we've got such a well-oiled machine that I think it will still be fine. I think it will still flow well.\n\n\"We have enough good people.\"\n\nFour top-level members of Team Penske were suspended by team owner Roger Penske including President Tim Cindric, Managing Director, IndyCar for the team Ruzewski, engineer Luke Mason and Atkinson, a senior data engineer for their role in the violation of push-to-pass regulations from the March 10 Firestone Grand Prix of St. Petersburg.\n\nAccording to Team Penske, none of the four suspended individuals will be at the track in Indianapolis during the next two race weekends for practice, qualifying or the race. In addition, none of the suspended individuals will be connected to the teams or drivers during any on track competition including practice, qualifying or the race.\n\nThey are allowed to return to the race shop in Mooresville, North Carolina.\n\nThe team is finalizing its plans on additional team members and crew personnel and their roles for each team from their \"deep bench\" and will \"finalize those plans in the coming days.\"\n\nCindric calls the race strategy for Newgarden, who won the Indianapolis 500 last year. Mason was Newgarden's engineer.\n\nBecause Ruzewski was in a position of oversight for the team's three-car effort, Penske held him and Cindric accountable for the violation that led to Newgarden's disqualification of his race victory at St. Petersburg. Team Penske driver Scott McLaughlin was also disqualified after finishing third in that race.\n\nPower's No. 12 Chevrolet had the same push-to-pass software, but he did not use it illegally in the race on starts and restarts. Because of that, Power's team was penalized, but the driver was not suspended.\n\n\"That's definitely a blow to my timing stand for sure,\" Power said. \"Ron Ruzewski is a big part of the success I've had. I've got a very strong engineer that's been with me for more than a decade. I think Dave Faustino (engineer) will have to take up that slack and call the races for me.\n\n\"But for me, just focusing forward, the month of May. I have an extremely strong crew, so we have a very strong group. We are certainly going to miss Ron Ruzewski and Robbie Atkinson, but I'm going to say that my group is very strong.\n\n\"I think we can win. I feel bad for Ron. He put all his effort into the IndyCar program.\"\n\nFor Penske to make such a decision before the Indianapolis 500 is proof the most successful team owner in Indianapolis 500 takes the violation seriously and needed to take serious action.\n\nPenske's 19 Indianapolis 500 wins are by far the most of any team owner in the long history of the race.\n\nPenske also purchased the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, IndyCar, and the Indianapolis 500 from the Hulman George Family on November 9, 2019. That ended 74 years of ownership by the family of Tony Hulman, who purchased the facility for Eddie Rickenbacker in November 1945.\n\nWhen Newgarden won last year's Indianapolis 500, it was the first time Penske won the race since he purchased the Speedway.\n\nThis year, it will be a bit more difficult. Cindric is considered perhaps the best race strategist on pit lane and Newgarden will try to defend his race victory without Cindric's guidance.\n\nMcLaughlin's timing stand remains intact as none of the four suspended team members worked for the No. 3 Chevrolet crew.\n\nPower lost two members but said when he arrives at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway on Thursday, he will be determined to triumph over the latest adversity.\n\n\"Absolutely,\" he said. \"It's going to be business as usual for me. I'm focused.\n\n\"I'm telling my guys, let's just head down. Look forward. Let's go. We've got good stuff. We've got good equipment. Let's, let's make the most of it.\n\n\"I still say that we, as a team have a great shot at winning the championship and winning an Indy 500 and that's with the Chevrolet engine.\n\n\"I think as a partnership we've had a lot of success together and I think this is obviously not the best thing best thing to have happened, but I think we'll move forward and have a lot of success this season so just one of those things that happened.\n\n\"I think we've got to move forward, and I think it'll be forgotten with after a few big couple of wins and the championship.\"\n\nPower heads into this weekend second in the IndyCar standings, just one point behind the leader, Andretti Global's Colton Herta.\n\n\"Yeah Man, I'm determined, I'm very determined,\" Power said. \"I'm feeling good feeling really good.\"", "source": {"uri": "nbcsports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_Penske", "type": "wiki", "score":

Sarah Kragthorpe, owner of Jitters, on moving the coffee shop\n\nThe scandal dates to the IndyCar season-opener in March won by Newgarden. Six weeks later, the series discovered that the three Penske cars were able to use a software system to get a horsepower boost on starts and restarts, which is against the rules.\n\nTim Cindric, who oversees all Team Penske operations and is the strategist for Newgarden, is the top name to receive the two-race suspension, which includes the showcase Indy 500 on Memorial Day weekend. Also suspended was team managing director Ron Ruzewski, Newgarden engineer Luke Mason and senior data engineer Robbie Atkinson.\n\nCindric and Ruzewski \"raised their hands as the team leaders\" to accept responsibility for the mess, Penske told AP.\n\n\"For Ron and I as leaders of this team, it's not about what we did, it's about what we didn't do. It is our responsibility to provide the team and all our drivers with the right processes to ensure something like this can't happen,\" Cindric said in a statement. \"For that, I apologize to Roger, our team and everyone that supports us. Our number one job is to protect and enhance the reputation of our brand and that of those that support us.\n\n\"In that regard, as the overall leader, I failed, and I must raise my hand and be accountable with the others. This is a team, and in my position, it's the right thing to do.\"\n\nRuzewski and Atkinson both work on Will Power's car -- Ruzewski is his strategist -- and Power was the only one of the three Penske drivers not accused of wrongdoing. Penske acknowledged that Power had done nothing wrong and said the suspensions to his crew members were based solely on their roles within the team. None of Scott McLaughlin's team members were punished; the driver was earlier stripped of his third-place finish at the March race.\n\n0 Comments Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nBe the first to

We've done that and we're going to move on. I am not trying to run a popularity contest.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...

Six weeks later, the series discovered that the three Penske cars were able to use a software system to get a horsepower boost on starts and restarts, which is against the rules.\n\nTim Cindric, who oversees all Team Penske operations and is the strategist for Newgarden, is the top name to receive the two-race suspension, which includes the showcase Indy 500 on Memorial Day weekend. Also suspended was team managing director Ron Ruzewski, Newgarden engineer Luke Mason and senior data engineer Robbie Atkinson.\n\nCindric and Ruzewski \"raised their hands as the team leaders\" to accept responsibility for the mess, Penske told AP.\n\n\"For Ron and I as leaders of this team, it's not about what we did, it's about what we didn't do. It is our responsibility to provide the team and all our drivers with the right processes to ensure something like this can't happen,\" Cindric said in a statement. \"For that, I apologize to Roger, our team and everyone that supports us. Our number one job is to protect and enhance the reputation of our brand and that of those that support us.\n\n\"In that regard, as the overall leader, I failed, and I must raise my hand and be accountable with the others. This is a team, and in my position, it's the right thing to do.\"\n\nRuzewski and Atkinson both work on Will Power's car -- Ruzewski is his strategist -- and Power was the only one of the three Penske drivers not accused of wrongdoing. Penske acknowledged that Power had done nothing wrong and said the suspensions to his crew members were based solely on their roles within the team. None of Scott McLaughlin's team members were punished; the driver was earlier stripped of his third-place finish at the March race.\n\nThe suspensions cover this weekend's race on the Indianapolis Motor Speedway road course and the Indy 500, which Penske is trying to win for a record-extending 20th time.\n\n\"That's a big deal, a significant impact to the team, to the individuals involved,\" Penske told the AP of the Indy 500 being included in the suspensions. \"I talked to all of them and the goal was, 'How can we move forward and be competitive and win? Win the next two races?' That was the feeling I had when I left the meeting.\"\n\nAsked how Newgarden moves forward and regains the respect of his competitors, Penske said: \"He's got to do it on the racetrack. I think he understands the gravity of this thing and I need to support him.\"\n\nHe said contract talks with Newgarden are ongoing but \"for sure I do\" want to re-sign him.\n\nThe push-to-pass function is controlled by IndyCar and disabled on starts and restarts, when the extra boost of horsepower is illegal. Two weeks ago at Long Beach, a glitch in the software knocked out the software on all cars except the three Penske entries. IndyCar's investigation later showed that the software had been in place in the season-opening race and Newgarden used it to his advantage an admitted three times.\n\nNewgarden said he thought there had been a rule change and the P2P system was now legal on restarts. McLaughlin said he hit the button out of habit and gained no advantage from the horsepower boost that lasted less than 2 seconds.\n\nMcLaughlin said he used it once at St. Petersburg and Power never illegally used it. Besides stripping Newgarden and McLaughlin of their podium finishes, IndyCar fined all three drivers $25,000 and docked them 10 points each.\n\nCindric said the software was inadvertently left on the cars since last August when it was installed to test IndyCar's upcoming hybrid engine but the scandal shook IndyCar, which had not had a disqualification in 29 years.\n\nPenske owns the race team, IndyCar and the Indianapolis Motor Speedway and has been in damage control\n\n\"I recognize the magnitude of what occurred and the impact it continues to have on the sport to which I've dedicated so many decades,\" Penske said in the statement when the punishments were announced. \"Everyone at Team Penske along with our fans and business partners should know that I apologize for the errors that were made and I deeply regret them.\"\n\nIndyCar has said it is trying to determine how the software wasn't found through inspection during the season's first three races.\n\nClose\n\nSan Diego Padres' Manny Machado falls after stopping a base hit by Arizona Diamondbacks' Lourdes Gurriel Jr. during the sixth inning of a baseball game, Saturday, May 4, 2024, in Phoenix.

The team won't have Cindric or Ruzewski on Newgarden and Power's radios for 500 race day.\n\n\"None of the suspended individuals will be connected to the teams or drivers during any on-track competition including practice, qualifying or the race,\" the spokesperson wrote in an email to IndyStar.\n\nRoger Penske: 'Proper investigation' led to 4 IndyCar team suspensions including Indy 500\n\nWhat is presently unclear is whether the four suspended Team Penske team members will be allowed to have contact with the team while cars aren't on-track. When IndyStar asked Penske about that possibility he said, \"I don't know at this point.\" The spokesperson did not address that question when asked.\n\nBoth as lead-in to on-track activity in the morning, as well as debrief on the day's activities, teams traditionally hold frequent team meetings for any race weekend -- particularly the 500. By not eliminating that loophole, Penske could still allow Cindric and Ruzewski to lead, manage and dole out input to the individual teams they call strategy for on race day, as well as the three-car team at-large before and after cars are on-track every day. Unless the team bars the four from all contact with members of the IndyCar program, Mason and Atkinson could also dive into setup work and data analysis while working remotely and just not have the ability to lend their expertise while cars are on-track -- an idea that falls short of what one might think of as a traditional 'suspension.'\n\n'Track and series are not for sale': Roger Penske won't sell IMS, IndyCar after scandal\n\nIn addition, Cindric will still be allowed to attend and provide his traditional level of input (both during the week and on race days) for Team Penske's IMSA, WEC and NASCAR programs -- which run a combined five events between now and May 26. All three are active this weekend -- WEC in the 6 Hours of Spa (in Belgium) on Saturday and IMSA at Laguna Seca and NASCAR at Darlington both on Sunday. Next weekend marks NASCAR's All-Star race weekend festivities at North Wilkesboro, followed by the Coca-Cola 600 at Charlotte Motor Speedway the evening of Indy 500 race day.\n\nAll four will be able to return to their traditional in-person roles for the Detroit Grand Prix, which immediately follows the 500 May 31-June 2.", "source": {"uri": "indystar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Indystar"}, "authors": [{"uri": "indianapolis_star@indystar.com", "name": "Indianapolis Star", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Cindric", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Cindric"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INDYCAR", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "INDYCAR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_Penske", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Team Penske"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Power", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Will Power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josef_Newgarden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Josef Newgarden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMSA", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "IMSA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Penske", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Roger Penske"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIA_World_Endurance_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "FIA World Endurance Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASCAR", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NASCAR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Indianapolis_Star", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Indianapolis Star"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_engineer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Race engineer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis_500", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis 500"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Petersburg,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "St. Petersburg, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "St. Petersburg, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IndyCar_Monterey_Grand_Prix", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "IndyCar Monterey Grand Prix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Grand_Prix_(IndyCar)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Detroit Grand Prix (IndyCar)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coca-Cola_600", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coca-Cola 600"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darlington_Raceway", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Darlington Raceway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte_Motor_Speedway", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charlotte Motor Speedway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis_Motor_Speedway", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis Motor Speedway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuit_de_Spa-Francorchamps", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure_Racing/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure Racing/Teams", "wgt": 32}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2024/04/25/PIND/73459631007-tim-cindric-ref-image-without-watermark-m-18145.jpg?auto=webp&crop=1079,607,x0,y0&format=pjpg&width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546108", "eventUri": "eng-9546108", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-31", "dateEnd": "2024-06-02", "textStart": 3338, "textEnd": 3351}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-26", "textStart": 2870, "textEnd": 2876}], "sentiment": -0.0980392156862745, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

Six weeks later, the series discovered that the three Penske cars were able to use a software system to get a horsepower boost on starts and restarts, which is against the rules.\n\nTim Cindric, who oversees all Team Penske operations and is the strategist for Newgarden, is the top name to receive the two-race suspension, which includes the showcase Indy 500 on Memorial Day weekend. Also suspended was team managing director Ron Ruzewski, Newgarden engineer Luke Mason and senior data engineer Robbie Atkinson.\n\nCindric and Ruzewski \"raised their hands as the team leaders\" to accept responsibility for the mess, Penske told AP.\n\n\"For Ron and I as leaders of this team, it's not about what we did, it's about what we didn't do. It is our responsibility to provide the team and all our drivers with the right processes to ensure something like this can't happen,\" Cindric said in a statement. \"For that, I apologize to Roger, our team and everyone that supports us. Our number one job is to protect and enhance the reputation of our brand and that of those that support us.\n\n\"In that regard, as the overall leader, I failed, and I must raise my hand and be accountable with the others. This is a team, and in my position, it's the right thing to do.\"\n\nRuzewski and Atkinson both work on Will Power's car -- Ruzewski is his strategist -- and Power was the only one of the three Penske drivers not accused of wrongdoing. Penske acknowledged that Power had done nothing wrong and said the suspensions to his crew members were based solely on their roles within the team. None of Scott McLaughlin's team members were punished; the driver was earlier stripped of his third-place finish at the March race.\n\nLove 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nTags Sports Business Trade

The team won't have Cindric or Ruzewski on Newgarden and Power's radios for 500 race day.\n\n\"None of the suspended individuals will be connected to the teams or drivers during any on-track competition including practice, qualifying or the race,\" the spokesperson wrote in an email to IndyStar.\n\nRoger Penske: 'Proper investigation' led to 4 IndyCar team suspensions including Indy 500\n\nWhat is presently unclear is whether the four suspended Team Penske team members will be allowed to have contact with the team while cars aren't on-track. When IndyStar asked Penske about that possibility he said, \"I don't know at this point.\" The spokesperson did not address that question when asked.\n\nBoth as lead-in to on-track activity in the morning, as well as debrief on the day's activities, teams traditionally hold frequent team meetings for any race weekend -- particularly the 500. By not eliminating that loophole, Penske could still allow Cindric and Ruzewski to lead, manage and dole out input to the individual teams they call strategy for on race day, as well as the three-car team at-large before and after cars are on-track every day. Unless the team bars the four from all contact with members of the IndyCar program, Mason and Atkinson could also dive into setup work and data analysis while working remotely and just not have the ability to lend their expertise while cars are on-track -- an idea that falls short of what one might think of as a traditional 'suspension.'\n\n'Track and series are not for sale': Roger Penske won't sell IMS, IndyCar after scandal\n\nIn addition, Cindric will still be allowed to attend and provide his traditional level of input (both during the week and on race days) for Team Penske's IMSA, WEC and NASCAR programs -- which run a combined five events between now and May 26. All three are active this weekend -- WEC in the 6 Hours of Spa (in Belgium) on Saturday and IMSA at Laguna Seca and NASCAR at Darlington both on Sunday. Next weekend marks NASCAR's All-Star race weekend festivities at North Wilkesboro, followed by the Coca-Cola 600 at Charlotte Motor Speedway the evening of Indy 500 race day.\n\nAll four will be able to return to their traditional in-person roles for the Detroit Grand Prix, which immediately follows the 500 May 31-June 2.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Indianapolis Star: Team Penske president Tim Cindric will continue NASCAR, IMSA duties during IndyCar suspension", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INDYCAR", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "INDYCAR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_Penske", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Team Penske"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Power", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Will Power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josef_Newgarden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Josef Newgarden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Penske", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Roger Penske"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis_500", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis 500"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Indianapolis_Star", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Indianapolis Star"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMSA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "IMSA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Cindric", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tim Cindric"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_engineer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Race engineer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIA_World_Endurance_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FIA World Endurance Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASCAR", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NASCAR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IndyCar_Monterey_Grand_Prix", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "IndyCar Monterey Grand Prix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Grand_Prix_(IndyCar)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Detroit Grand Prix (IndyCar)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coca-Cola_600", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coca-Cola 600"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darlington_Raceway", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Darlington Raceway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte_Motor_Speedway", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charlotte Motor Speedway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis_Motor_Speedway", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis Motor Speedway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuit_de_Spa-Francorchamps", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure_Racing/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure Racing/Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/indystar-the-indianapolis-star/b9faefad430c876735c05e78b3294fdd", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546108", "eventUri": "eng-9546108", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-31", "dateEnd": "2024-06-02", "textStart": 3231, "textEnd": 3244}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-26", "textStart": 2763, "textEnd": 2769}], "sentiment": -0.1686274509803921, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

None of Scott McLaughlin's team members were punished; the driver was earlier stripped of his third-place finish at the March race.\n\nTags Sports Business Trade The Economy Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.", "source": {"uri": "napavalleyregister.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Napa Valley Register"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INDYCAR", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "INDYCAR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_Penske", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Team Penske"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis_500", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis 500"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napa_County,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Napa County, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Napa County, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josef_Newgarden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Josef Newgarden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Penske", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Roger Penske"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Winery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstate_80", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Interstate 80"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoning", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Zoning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Engineer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convenience_store", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Convenience store"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horsepower", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Horsepower"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robbery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Robbery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_collision", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Traffic collision"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Canyon,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American Canyon, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "American Canyon, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car_suspension", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Car suspension"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Cindric", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tim Cindric"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Power", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Will Power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memorial_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Memorial Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Privacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Driving_and_Safety", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Driving and Safety", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure_Racing/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure Racing/Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/napavalleyregister.com/content/tncms/custom/image/f675bdee-c549-11ea-98b6-631770e8cea7.jpg?resize=600%2C315", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546108", "eventUri": "eng-9546108", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-03-10", "textStart": 540, "textEnd": 548}], "sentiment": -0.1058823529411764, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

Well, don't worry, that won't happen again. In the case of Team Penske, that might be a different story.\n\nTwo weeks after the team was stripped of its win in St. Petersburg, there's now a show of self-awareness, at least some, coming from the Captain's side of the table.\n\nTeam Penske announced this week that four senior members of the organization have been suspended for the NTT IndyCar Series' Month of May at Indianapolis as a result of an internal investigation following the double disqualification of Josef Newgarden and Scott McLaughlin from the season-opening race at St. Petersburg.\n\nNewgarden's side of the team faced half of the punishment as Team President Tim Cindric (who also doubles as Newgarden's race strategist) was one of the four suspended, as was Newgarden's race engineer Luke Mason. Managing Director Ron Ruzewski was also suspended as was senior data engineer Robbie Atkinson. Atkinson works on Will Power's car while Ruzewski also calls strategy for the No. 12 entry.\n\nThis is a bit unfair to Power, but Atkinson might have been the main party responsible for what happened, so that suspension makes sense.\n\nBack to the suspension announcement itself, though.\n\n\"After a full and comprehensive analysis of the information, Team Penske has determined that there were significant failures in our processes and internal communications.\"\n\nTeam Penske has had an image through the years of perfection, hence the wording of the announcement. But sometimes being more direct is more effective than hiding behind an image.\n\nAnd this is nothing against Penske's communications staff. Far from it. The professionals that work in that department are doing what they have been instructed to do since their first day on the job and they are very good at what they do.\n\nHowever, the tone of the release just reeks of soullessness and over-explanation that could be simplified by simply saying \"The team achieved a significant technical advantage outside of the IndyCar rulebook and were penalized for the rules breach by INDYCAR. As such, the people responsible will be suspended.\"\n\nThe suspensions themselves were the right move. There's no denying that. The team might have had a bit more good will from the paddock had they announced that suspensions would be forthcoming the day that IndyCar announced the disqualifications.\n\nThe disqualifications show that those responsible are taking accountability for their actions by not being involved in the biggest race of the IndyCar season on Memorial Day weekend. The punishment fits the crime committed. However, there must be transparency on how the crew members will be separated from communicating with the team during the race weekends.\n\nUnless Team Penske decides to temporarily reassign the suspended individuals to the NASCAR program during the Darlington, All Star and Charlotte race weekends, then there's no way that they'd have time to communicate with their coworkers in Indianapolis.\n\nThe practice broadcasts will address these suspensions at the start of each session, it's a near-certainty at this point. This story isn't going away yet, especially after Newgarden's press conference at Barber Motorsports Park.\n\nBut maybe with the suspensions, the story can start to slide into the background as we focus on cars on track at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway.", "source": {"uri": "frontstretch.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Frontstretch"}, "authors": [{"uri": "christopher_deharde@frontstretch.com", "name": "Christopher DeHarde", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_Penske", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Team Penske"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IndyCar_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "IndyCar Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Petersburg,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "St. Petersburg, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "St. Petersburg, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Cindric", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tim Cindric"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_McLaughlin_(racing_driver)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scott McLaughlin (racing driver)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis_500_traditions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis 500 traditions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josef_Newgarden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Josef Newgarden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_engineer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Race engineer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Power", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Will Power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INDYCAR", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "INDYCAR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barber_Motorsports_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Barber Motorsports Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darlington_Raceway", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Darlington Raceway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis_Motor_Speedway", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis Motor Speedway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASCAR", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NASCAR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memorial_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Memorial Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure_Racing/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure Racing/Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://frontstretch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Josef-Newgarden-and-Roger-Penske-INDYCAR-Testing-By_-Chris-Owens_Ref-Image-Without-Watermark_m99324-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546108", "eventUri": "eng-9546108", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

Penske said Tuesday in an interview with The Associated Press that a review done by his general counsel found no \"malicious intent by anyone\" and chalked up the incident as a breakdown in internal processes and miscommunication. He also said he remains committed to reigning Indianapolis 500 winner Josef Newgarden, who was stripped of his March 10 victory for the scandal, and is actively trying to sign the two-time IndyCar champion to a contract extension. \"We're the same company we have been for 50 years and I'm going to hold my head high,\" Penske told the AP. \"This is an unfortunate situation and when you're the leader, you have to take action. We've done that and we're going to move on. I am not trying to run a popularity contest.\" The scandal dates to the IndyCar season-opener in March won by Newgarden. Six weeks later, the series discovered that the three Penske cars were able to use a software system to get a horsepower boost on starts and restarts, which is against the rules. Tim Cindric, who oversees all Team Penske operations and is the strategist for Newgarden, is the top name to receive the two-race suspension, which includes the Indy 500 on Memorial Day weekend. Also suspended was team managing director Ron Ruzewski, Newgarden engineer Luke Mason and senior data engineer Robbie Atkinson. Cindric and Ruzewski \"raised their hands as the team leaders\" to accept responsibility for the mess, Penske told AP.\n\nBASKETBALL\n\nGobert named DPOY\n\nMinnesota Timberwolves center Rudy Gobert was announced Tuesday as the NBA's Defensive Player of the Year for a record-tying fourth time, joining Basketball Hall of Fame inductees Dikembe Mutombo and Ben Wallace. It's the ninth time in Gobert's 11 seasons that he has been seventh or better in the DPOY voting. He was second in 2017, third in 2020 and 2022, fifth in 2015 and seventh in 2016 -- and picked up this trophy one day after missing a playoff game for the birth of his son, Romeo. San Antonio rookie center Victor Wembanyama, announced Monday as the league's Rookie of the Year, was second in the voting and fell one spot short of being the first rookie to win the award. Miami center Bam Adebayo was third. This season, Gobert was second in rebounds per game and sixth in blocked shots per game -- a category where Wembanyama led the league. The Timberwolves led the NBA this season in fewest points allowed per game.\n\nMurray fined for toss\n\nDenver Nuggets guard Jamal Murray was fined $100,000 by the NBA but avoided a suspension for \"throwing multiple objects in the direction of a game official during live play,\" the league announced Tuesday. Murray tossed a towel and a heat pack onto the court late in the second quarter of Denver's 108-80 loss to Minnesota that gave the Timberwolves a 2-0 lead in the Western Conference semifinal series that shifts to Minneapolis this weekend. The Nuggets were frustrated by the officiating as they fell behind by 28 points shortly before halftime. The heat pack toss garnered the most attention as TNT replays showed Murray sitting at the end of Denver's bench and throwing it onto the court. It slid across the floor as players jockeyed in the lane just before Minnesota's Karl-Anthony Towns made a layup with 4:41 left in the second quarter. Nuggets guard Kentavious Caldwell-Pope retrieved the heat pack and tossed it aside.\n\nCharter flights for WNBA\n\nThe WNBA plans to commit $50 million over the next two years to provide full-time charter flight service for its teams during the season, the league's commissioner announced Tuesday in a move that addresses years of player safety concerns. Commissioner Cathy Engelbert said in a meeting with sports editors that the league will launch a charter program \"as soon as we can get planes in places.\" She said it's projected to cost around $25 million per year for the next two seasons. That means no more long security lines, bodyguards in public spaces, cramped legroom or layovers for the professional athletes who have been lobbying for better travel long before Caitlin Clark's celebrity brought newfound interest to the league. The league hadn't allowed teams to use charter flights except for when they had back-to-back games.\n\nHOCKEY\n\nBlues name coach\n\nDrew Bannister is returning as coach of the St. Louis Blues after getting the interim tag removed from his title and being named Tuesday to the full-time role. He signed a two-year contract. Bannister, 50, replaced Craig Berube when the 2019 Stanley Cup-winning coach was fired in December. The Blues went 30-19-5 after Bannister took over and finished six points out of an NHL playoff spot. This is Bannister's first head-coaching gig in the NHL. He previously coached the Springfield Thunderbirds of the American Hockey League, St. Louis' top affiliate, for two-plus seasons.\n\nFOOTBALL\n\n'Crush' coach dies\n\nJoe Collier, the former Buffalo Bills head coach and architect of the Denver Broncos' famed \"Orange Crush\" defense, has died. He was 91. The Broncos said Collier's family confirmed that he died at his home in Littleton, Colo., on Monday night. Collier spent 20 seasons on the Broncos' coaching staff from 1969-88, a tenure surpassed only by Mike Shanahan's 21 years. Collier helped Denver to a 168-132-7 record, 5 division titles and Super Bowl appearances after the 1977, 1986 and 1987 seasons. Led by Collier's defense, the Broncos made their first of eight Super Bowl appearances after the 1977 season, when they defeated the Pittsburgh Steelers and Oakland Raiders in the playoffs to win the AFC. The Broncos lost to Dallas in the Super Bowl. Collier was 13-16-1 at the helm of the Bills, leading them to the AFL Eastern Division title in 1966 with a 9-4-1 record.", "source": {"uri": "nwaonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Northwest

While the list of names taking a brief hiatus also included Team Penske President Tim Cindric, the other one that hurts Power is losing Robbie Atkinson, who serves as the senior data engineer on the No. 12 Chevrolet.\n\nIn wake of the situation, Dave Faustino, Power's race engineer, is adding to his workload by also taking on strategy duties. Meanwhile, Paulo Trentini Filho will handle things in replacement of Atkinson.\n\n\"(Faustino) has run a lot of tests and been on the radio,\" said Power, 43.\n\n\"It will be different, yeah. He's not used to counting me down to the box or sending me, so there will be a few things that we have to really, I guess, practice as much as we can. I think warmup is the only time we get to do that.\n\n\"But we've raced so long together, and I've been at it so long, I can almost do strategy from the car, and he's the one that basically does the strategy anyway, and Ron sort of calls the races.\n\n\"Not a massive change. It will suck not having Ron. I've really got used to him. He's very calming and good on the radio. That's a pity, but that's the way it is, and we have to do our best.\"\n\nThose changes come into play for Power, who currently sits second in the championship standings, at this weekend's round on the Indianapolis Motor Speedway's 2.439-mile, 14-turn road course circuit.\n\nHowever, the Aussie is mindful how it could impact things later in the month with the 108 Running of the Indianapolis 500.\n\n\"Yeah, it's not ideal losing someone off your stand, losing two people is definitely not ideal,\" Power said.\n\n\"We were better off with them. But I sat down with Dave and we just said we're going to do absolutely the best we can with what we've got. We've got very good people on the team. It is what it is. That's the way it is, and we will do our absolute best to make the most of it.\"\n\nDespite the fact that Power's data from St. Petersburg did not show any wrongful use of overtake, unlike team-mates Josef Newgarden and Scott McLaughlin, he deferred on feeling shocked over losing Ruzewski over the situation.\n\n\"Yeah, well, Ron is the manager of the IndyCar team, so he just happened to be on my stand,\" Power said.\n\n\"That's the call that Roger made, and nothing I can do about it.

Next week, IndyCar will move to the 2.5-mile oval for practice and qualifying in the 108th running of the Indianapolis 500.\n\nAfter several seasons of multiple races on the IMS road course, this will mark the series' only stop in 2024. Last year, it's where Alex Palou kicked off his dominant charge to a second championship. The Chip Ganassi Racing star won by more than 16 seconds over Pato O'Ward in first of four victories in five races and the Indy 500 pole.\n\nJosef Newgarden is the defending Indy 500 winner, but the two-time champion and Team Penske enter Indy under a cloud of fallout from the push-to-pass scandal. After the series disqualified Newgarden and teammate Scott McLaughlin from the season opener, team owner Roger Penske issued four suspensions for May. The punishment includes two key members of Newgarden's No. 2 Dallara-Chevrolet -- strategist Tim Cindric (also the team president) and engineer Luke Mason.\n\nAlso affected was Penske's Will Power, who lost strategist Ron Ruzewski and data engineer Robbie Atkinson. But Power, who enters with the momentum of having been runner-up to teammate Scott McLaughlin at Barber Motorsports Park, has a series-best five victories on this layout from 2015-21.\n\nHere are the details for the Sonsio Grand Prix at Indianapolis Motor Speedway race weekend (all times are ET):\n\nTV: Saturday, May 11, 3 p.m. ET on NBC and streaming on Peacock. Leigh Diffey is the announcer with analysts Townsend Bell and James Hinchcliffe. Marty Snider and Kevin Lee are the pit reporters. Peacock also will be the streaming broadcast for both practices and qualifying and Indy NXT races. (Click here for information on how to sign up for Peacock.)\n\nPOSTRACE SHOW ON PEACOCK: After the race's conclusion, an exclusive postrace show will air on Peacock with driver interviews, postrace analysis and the podium presentation. To watch the extended postrace show, click over to the special stream on Peacock after the race ends.\n\nINDYCAR RADIO NETWORK: The IndyCar and Indy Lights races and all practices and qualifying sessions will air live on network affiliates, SiriusXM 160, racecontrol.indycar.com and the IndyCar app.\n\nRACE DISTANCE: The race is 85 laps (207.3 miles) on a 14-turn, 2.39-mile road course at Indianapolis Motor Speedway\n\nTIRE ALLOTMENT: Five sets primary, four sets alternate to be used during the event weekend. Teams fielding a rookie driver may use one additional set of primary tires. Teams must use one set of primary and one set of new (sticker) alternate tires for at least two laps in the race. Indy NXT: Four new sets to be used during the doubleheader weekend.

Because you want to have the best possible people on the cars for the race and especially for it to be two race weekends.\n\n'That's a lie': What IndyCar drivers said about Josef Newgarden's St. Pete disqualification\n\nMany drivers don't feel much sympathy for the two-time series champion.\n\n\"Good for Roger because it is a hard thing to do, and that will affect them somewhat, At the very least, if they still have contact with the engineers, they don't have the strategists that they work with all the time, and guys that know the series really well. So obviously they're bringing in guys that have been in IndyCar in the past and know a lot about IndyCar, but there is still going to be an adjustment period for them. So, luckily, they'll have a month or basically, two weeks to kind of get up to speed before Indy, but still I think it surely affects them somehow.\"\n\nConsidered one of the best strategists in IndyCar, Cindric called Newgarden's 2023 Indy 500 win from the pit stand of the No. 2 Dallara-Chevrolet. Ruzewski handle strategy for two-time champion Will Power (the only Penske driver of the trio to escape disqualification because he didn't use push to pass illegally despite having access at St. Pete.\n\nTeam Penske also will prevent the suspended team members from communicating remotely with the team while cars are on track at the Brickyard this month (though they still would be permitted to communicate during debriefs and after hours).\n\nPenske suspends key personnel at Indy 500 for St. Pete scandal: 'I apologize for errors; deeply regret them'\n\nDefending winner Josef Newgarden will be without race strategist Tim Cindric.\n\n\"It shows that they're taking responsibility,\" 2022 Indy 500 winner Marcus Ericsson said. \"You can always discuss how harsh should you be or not. There's always different ways to see it, but I think it was a reasonable punishment that's definitely going to hurt them for the month of May.\n\n\"I think for sure you get pressure on you when you're also running the series and the speedway and a team, so I think for sure Roger felt like he had to do this to show how serious he takes it as well. It shows that it's very important for Roger and the integrity of the sport.\"\n\nSix-time IndyCar champion Scott Dixon of Chip Ganassi Racing was a little more skeptical of the suspensions' impact on Penske. \"We all did a pretty good job working remotely through COVID,\" he said with a wry grin.\n\nNoting that Ganassi \"would have fired someone\" in such a situation, Dixon said the scandal still left a stain on IndyCar.\n\n\"It's just not a good look,\" he said. \"That was the whole problem with the situation anyway like I've said before. When you've got a team that's owned by the person that owns the series that owns the engine that's supplied (Penske owns Ilmor, which builds the Chevy engines). Even if it was something smaller, it's just it's a tough situation to be in. I think they're doing the best that they can with what happened.\"\n\nEricsson said Andretti Global \"would feel that for sure\" if the team lost its top two competition executives as Penske did with Cindric and Ruzewski.\n\n\"They're two of the most senior figures of that team,\" Ericsson said. \"Even though they can put in structures, and I'm sure everyone in Team Penske knows exactly how things are supposed to be done. But it's still in any sport, the leaders are leading, and everyone is sort of following that. To take away Tim and Ron is probably the two biggest leaders in that team. So it would be tough for them.\n\nMichael Andretti blasts Team Penske response to push to pass scandal: 'None of the stories matched up'\n\nIn an interview with Kenny Wallace, the Andretti Global owner says he would have handled the controversy 'a lot differently.'\n\n\"Obviously, they have a lot of good guys. I'm sure there will be other people who would step up and do a great job. So it's not like 'Oh, Penske is not going to be there fighting.' I still see Penske as one of the main competitors for the 500. There's no doubt about that in my mind, but it's definitely tougher for them with this what Roger did.\"\n\nEchoing the sentiment of team owner Michael Andretti, Herta also said he thought Newgarden would have won at St. Pete even without having the illegally timed horsepower advantage.\n\n\"Even the cheating thing wasn't really that big of a deal to me,\" he said. \"The races that they were going to win, they were going to win regardless if they were doing that or not, so it didn't really affect things. I was just confused about their statements and how they were all very different.\n\n\"I never really had a problem with the cheating thing at all. It was what it was. Honestly, if I'm in that position, I'm pushing that button, too so it's kind of hard to say, but it was more about everybody contradicting themselves. That was like, 'Come on, guys.' \"", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INDYCAR", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "INDYCAR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_Penske", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Team Penske"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josef_Newgarden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Josef Newgarden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Penske", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Roger Penske"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis_Motor_Speedway", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis Motor Speedway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis_500", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis 500"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Cindric", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tim Cindric"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Prix_of_St._Petersburg", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grand Prix of St. Petersburg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colton_Herta", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colton Herta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_McLaughlin_(racing_driver)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scott McLaughlin (racing driver)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IndyCar_Grand_Prix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "IndyCar Grand Prix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Road racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_Sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBC Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Dixon", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scott Dixon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Power", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Will Power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Ericsson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marcus Ericsson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilmor", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ilmor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenny_Wallace", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kenny Wallace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Andretti", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Andretti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andretti_Autosport", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andretti Autosport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chip_Ganassi_Racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chip Ganassi Racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oval_track_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oval track racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chevrolet"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure_Racing/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure Racing/Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Ma.iMCVVH2n5qTDZ0pM.KA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/nbcsports.com/ac1ddcceba34ac2f4340e32e216457b9", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546108", "eventUri": "eng-9546108", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 452991609, "relevance": 2}], "totalResults": 90, "page": 1, "count": 1, "pages": 90}}}

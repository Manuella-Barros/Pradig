{"id": 237076530, "title": "Will getting preventative Botox in your 20s and 30s fight wrinkles or make your skin age faster? Here\u2019s what experts say", "text": "While the average patient starts Botox at age 40, Gillian, now 35, received her first Botox treatment at age 30. \u201cI knew I was interested in Botox by my late twenties, but I hesitated to get it before my wedding, at age 29, because of the advice not to do anything drastic to your appearance before the big day,\u201d she tells Fortune. \u201cNow I wish I would have gone for it. The Botox I get is very subtle and understated and really freshens up my face.\u201d According to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons, Botox procedures for people ages 20 through 29 have increased by 28% since 2010, perhaps due to the rise of social media and Zoom calls though there\u2019s been no definitive research in this area yet. Weighing the pros and cons of receiving Botox is an essential step for the four million Americans who receive these procedures each year. For Gillian, the potential side effects of the treatment and the cost were her two main concerns. \u201cI was nervous about drooping, but haven\u2019t experienced that and am told it\u2019s fairly rare,\u201d she says. A single unit of Botox costs $10 to $15, with the average treatment consisting of 30 to 40 units. Still, since receiving her first Botox treatment at age 30, Gillian has received three injections per year, only pausing her procedures during her two pregnancies. (The FDA recommends pausing Botox treatments while pregnant unless \u201cthe potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus,\u201d which include miscarriage, malformation, and, for the mother, botulism.) \u201cObviously, the cost is a downside I had to factor in, but ultimately it feels like it\u2019s worth it as an investment in keeping frown lines and crow\u2019s feet at bay,\u201d Gillian says. What is preventative botox? Botox is a neurotoxin that blocks the release of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, thereby decreasing the muscle\u2019s ability to contract. \u201cWhen done artfully, Botox can decrease the muscle\u2019s ability to contract rather than completely block or paralyze the muscle,\u201d explains Dr. Kenneth Mark, a cosmetic dermatologist with practices in New York and Colorado. This can reduce the appearance of wrinkles and lines, such as the ones that crop up on the forehead or around your smile. \u201cPreventative\u201d botox is a slippery term in the medical community, and many experts refuse to use it altogether. \u201cPreventative Botox involves using Botox injections before wrinkles and fine lines become deeply etched into the skin,\u201d explains New York- and California-based dermatologist Dr. Karyn Grossman. \u201cRegular Botox typically addresses existing lines and wrinkles. Preventative Botox can be advantageous as it helps to relax the facial muscles that cause these lines, potentially delaying their formation.\u201d Once dynamic wrinkles, or wrinkles caused by repetitive facial expressions, are formed, it can be difficult to reduce their appearance. That said, how old you are isn\u2019t always an indication of how many lines and wrinkles you have. \u201cRather than \u2018preventative\u2019 botox, I prefer to use Botox when it is most appropriate and not just considering age,\u201d says Mark. \u201cFor instance, you can have an 18-year-old who grew up in the sun and was constantly squinting their eyes and scrunching their eyebrows. In that case you can forget about \u2018preventative\u2019 Botox.\u201d On the other hand, he adds, you may have a 40-year-old patient with zero wrinkles. \u201cRather than preventative Botox,\u201d he notes, \u201cthe saying should be \u2018preventative and appropriate\u2019 Botox.\u201d In other words: The decision to get Botox should depend less on how old you are and more on the appearance of your skin and your feelings about how much it matters. Potential side effects of getting preventative Botox at a young age \u201cThere are no long-term health concerns with Botox, as it has been FDA-approved for cosmetic reasons for over 20 years,\u201d Mark says. No studies have indicated a long-term negative effect of Botox, though there are possible side effects to be aware of: Swelling, pain, and bruising at the injection site, headache and flu symptoms, droopy eyelids, crooked eyebrows, watery or dry eyes, and infections are all rare but potential side effects of Botox. It\u2019s also possible for the toxin to spread to unintended parts of the body, causing toxic botulism which could lead to vision problems, muscle weakness, breathing problems, trouble talking or swallowing, an allergic reaction, or bladder issues, according to the Mayo Clinic as well as Botox\u2019s own label insert. Also noted as risks on the product\u2019s label include anaphylaxis (allergic reaction), breathing or swallowing difficulties, corneal exposure or ulceration due to less blinking, and transmission of viral diseases from the ingredient albumin (extremely low risk). More research is needed to fully understand the long-term effects of these treatments. Is Botox right for you? First thing\u2019s first: You should always consult a medical doctor if you\u2019re considering receiving Botox. If you have the time and means, a second opinion may also be valuable. Mark recommends Botox to his patients when fine lines and wrinkles first start to appear. \u201cThe advantage of this is if you wait until it\u2019s too late then the wrinkles will be so deep that they cannot fully be corrected with Botox alone,\u201d he says. \u201cThen patients will need filler in addition to the Botox. However, when done consistently, which means every four months for about a year, a patient will experience the full effect or correction from it.\u201d Kim has a slightly different approach and doesn\u2019t recommend starting Botox when fine lines and wrinkles first appear. \u201cThe FDA indication for botulinum toxin is dynamic rhytides, aka wrinkles with movement,\u201d he says, meaning that the lines of your face disappear when you relax, but appear when you smile or squint. \u201cIf a patient comes in with zero movement, I wouldn\u2019t offer toxins. I don\u2019t believe in preventative botulinum toxin [Botox]. I would only treat the patient if they have deep lines and wrinkles with movement.\u201d These varying approaches to Botox make it important to have an ongoing dialogue with your dermatologist or plastic surgeon. Come to your intro appointment with questions, and remember: This is ultimately your decision. Just keep in mind that there is such a thing as too much, too soon when it comes to Botox. \u201cPreventative Botox should be used typically once per year, at low doses, to soften movements,\u201d says Grossman. \u201cIf you use it more than this, you may cause muscle atrophy, cause other lines or wrinkles to form, and risk developing tolerance to the toxins over time.\u201d Gillian\u2019s advice? \u201cI would say [whether or not to get Botox] depends on your priorities. If you don\u2019t care about wrinkles, that\u2019s great! If you\u2019re not a fan of needles, it might make sense to skip. It\u2019s definitely a personal decision,\u201d she says, adding that many of her friends have begun receiving treatments as well. \u201cI\u2019ve also been surprised how many girlfriends my age tell me they\u2019ve gotten it, too, or ask who I see if I share that I\u2019ve gotten it. I think the stigma is less than it used to be, and it\u2019s more normalized and understood that this is something a lot of people are integrating into their cosmetic routine earlier these days.\u201d More on skincare: Sunscreen myths, debunked by dermatologists It\u2019s natural for skin to thin with age.

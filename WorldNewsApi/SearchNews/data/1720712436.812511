I think it would be a lot of fun.\" BRYCE HARPER BUSTS OUT EURO-STYLE CELEBRATION AFTER LONG HOME RUN IN LONDON SERIES Mets outfielder Brandon Nimmo agreed, saying it was a \"great idea.\" \"Once you get acclimated to the time change, you might as well spend a couple of weeks over here and play in some different cities and go ahead and make a round-robin out of it. That would be fantastic,\" Nimmo said. \"I think the biggest part is that initial 24 hours and once you get past that then you\u2019re sitting in a lot better space physically and mentally. So I\u2019d love to see that, I think it would be good for the game and I think it would grow in a sportive way. So I think it\u2019s a great idea.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The NBA initiated an in-season tournament this past season, and it was a huge success, as ratings increased during said games, and the competition was certainly much better than normal.

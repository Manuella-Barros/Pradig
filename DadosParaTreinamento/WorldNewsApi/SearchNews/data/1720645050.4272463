During a speech in Phoenix, Arizona, on Thursday evening, Trump focused on the Biden administration\u2019s transformation of the United States-Mexico border into a European-style checkpoint where tens of thousands of migrants cross every couple of weeks, are briefly detained, and then released into the nation\u2019s interior. \u201cIn total, crooked Joe has imported more illegal aliens than the populations of 40 out of 50 states,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThis is unsustainable.\u201d The result, Trump said, is sky-high rents and housing costs for America\u2019s working and middle class who must compete with a growing number of foreign-born residents for limited apartments and affordable homes. \u201cHousing costs are skyrocketing, absolutely skyrocketing, because we have 15 million new migrants. We have no place to put them. We have no place to put them, and that number is growing so that we have absolutely no place,\u201d Trump said: If Joe Biden wins this election, he wants to turn every single illegal alien he let charge across our borders into a voting citizen. By contrast, I want to send Joe Biden\u2019s illegal aliens back home, where they belong \u2026 Biden wants an invasion \u2014 I want a deportation. [Emphasis added] Indeed, despite high interest rates, home prices have been out of reach for most Americans. The latest data from Realtor.com reveals that in the last five years, home prices have increased more than 52 percent. In New York City, where hundreds of thousands of migrants have resettled under Biden, home prices per square foot have increased almost 85 percent since 2019. Research from JPMorgan published in March directly tied mass immigration under Biden to a tightening housing market where limited supply and expanded demand have driven up costs. \u201cImmigration has added 3.3 million people to the U.S. population in 2023 and 2024,\u201d Business Insider reports. \u201c\u2026 [JPMorgan] notes that the immigration wave is also straining housing supply.\u201d Sen. J.D. Vance (R-OH), reportedly a top vice presidential contender for Trump, has been at the forefront of mass immigration\u2019s impact on housing prices for Americans. Last year, Vance testified at a Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee hearing that such record levels of immigration \u201cput incredible pressure\u201d on the nation\u2019s housing market. \u201cYou have way more buyers for way fewer homes, and that puts incredible pressure on home buyers and people who just want to live a good life,\u201d Vance said: I\u2019m a very strong believer that we should think about our immigration problem and our immigration crisis as an economic problem as much as a cultural or law and order problem. [Emphasis added] Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Trump\u2019s and Vance\u2019s assertions that high levels of immigration increase housing prices is widely accepted by the establishment media. New York Magazine, for example, reported last year that mass immigration is \u201cbad for housing prices\u201d while Axios reported that such levels of immigration under Biden have made the U.S. housing market \u201cworse.\u201d In 2013, a study by the Michael Bloomberg-funded New American Economy, which promotes mass immigration, explained how the importing of tens of millions of immigrants over decades had helped raise housing costs by $3.7 trillion for the next generation of homebuyers, but spun the figure as the creation of \u201chousing wealth.\u201d John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

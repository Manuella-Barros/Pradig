They\u2019ll launch a new Black voter outreach effort during a visit to the battleground state of Pennsylvania on Wednesday. The two will stop at Girard College, an independent boarding school in Philadelphia with a predominantly Black student body, and visit a small business to speak to members of the Black Chamber of Commerce. The Philadelphia stops are the start of what the campaign is describing as an eight-figure, summerlong effort to engage Black student organizations, community groups and faith centers. \u201cWe will continue to be aggressive, innovative, and thorough in our work to earn the support of the very voters who sent Joe Biden and Kamala Harris to the White House in 2020 and will do so again in 2024,\u201d said Quentin Fulks, Biden\u2019s principal deputy campaign manager. The push comes at a moment when Biden has seen his solid support among Black voters show signs of erosion. Among Black adults, Biden\u2019s approval has dropped from 94% when he started his term to just 55%, according to an Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll published in March. The economy has been a particular thorn in Biden\u2019s side since 2022, when inflation hit a 40-year high. But there have also been signs of discontent in the Black community more recently over Biden\u2019s handling of the seven-month Israel-Hamas war. Turning out Black voters could prove pivotal for Biden\u2019s chances in what are expected to be among the most closely contested states \u2014 Arizona, Georgia, Michigan Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Biden beat his predecessor and 2024 challenger, former President Donald Trump, in all six states in 2020, but he could face a more difficult climb this year. Trump, for his part, has been offering himself as a better president for Black voters than Biden. At a rally last week in the Bronx, he railed against Biden on immigration and said \u201cthe biggest negative impact\u201d of the influx of migrants in New York is \u201cagainst our Black population and our Hispanic population who are losing their jobs, losing their housing, losing everything they can lose.\u201d The Biden campaign says it hopes to use the new engagement effort in part to remind Black voters of some of the Democratic administration\u2019s achievements of his term. The Black unemployment rate sits at 5.6%, according to the latest federal government data, compared to the average of about 8% from 2016 to 2020 and 11% from 2000 to 2015. Black household wealth has surged, and Biden\u2019s effort to cancel billions in student loan debt has disproportionately impacted Black borrowers. Biden also points to his appointment of Ketanji Brown Jackson as the first Black female justice on the U.S. Supreme Court and his pick of Harris as the first Black woman to serve as vice president. The president\u2019s visit to Philadelphia follows on a series of engagements with Black community members in recent weeks, including hosting plaintiffs in the 1954 Supreme Court decision that struck down institutionalized racial segregation in public schools, a commencement address at Morehouse College in Atlanta, and a virtual address to the Rev. Al Sharpton\u2019s racial justice conference. \u2014 By AAMER MADHANI Associated Press", "summary": "<p>WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris are stepping up their reelection pitch to Black voters,&#8230; <a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https://www.thenationalherald.com/biden-harris-to-launch-black-voter-outreach-effort-amid-signs-of-diminished-support/\">Continue reading <span class=\"screen-reader-text\">Biden, Harris to Launch Black Voter Outreach Effort amid Signs of Diminished Support</span></a></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.thenationalherald.com/biden-harris-to-launch-black-voter-outreach-effort-amid-signs-of-diminished-support/\">Biden, Harris to Launch Black Voter Outreach Effort amid Signs of Diminished Support</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.thenationalherald.com\">The National Herald</a>.</p>", "url": "https://www.thenationalherald.com/biden-harris-to-launch-black-voter-outreach-effort-amid-signs-of-diminished-support/", "image": "https://www.thenationalherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/AP24148618603399-scaled.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 13:18:15", "author": "Achilleas Kouremenos", "authors": ["Achilleas Kouremenos"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.147}

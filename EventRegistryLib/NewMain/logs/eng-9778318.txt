This brings the company's total funding raised to $41.3 million. The company also made strategic additions to its leadership team across People, Go-to-Market (GTM), and Engineering, and plans to use the new capital to continue scaling amid rapidly growing global needs for responsible AI use and safety.\n\n\"Credo AI has successfully guided numerous organizations in aligning AI applications with industry-specific standards and regulations, ensuring swift and safe adoption.\"\n\nGlobal investment in AI is estimated to reach $200 billion by 2025, and with this boom comes a myriad of emerging regulations and laws at the international, federal, and local levels (including the EU AI Act, President Biden's Executive Order on AI safety, New York City Local Law No.144, and most recently the passing of comprehensive AI safety legislation in the U.S. state of Colorado), all aimed to ensure that these increasingly ubiquitous AI systems do not cause unintended harm.\n\nA global study by KPMG found that about 75 percent of consumers are concerned about the potential risks of AI, and McKinsey's recent research revealed that 63 percent of organizations view the implementation of generative AI as a top priority, yet 91 percent feel ill-prepared to navigate its challenges responsibly. In parallel, there has been an onslaught of headlines around the world about companies not putting proper safeguards in place, exposing the consequences that a lack of attention to and investment in AI governance can have on society.\n\n\"We are past the AI hype cycle and organizations now find themselves at a critical inflection point where they are expected to capitalize on AI systems, but don't feel equipped to address mounting fears about safety and a growing laundry list of emerging rules for them to comply with. Governance is the key that unlocks the full potential of generative AI,\" said Navrina Singh, CEO and Founder of Credo AI. \"Across the Credo AI customer base, we are seeing hundreds of AI use cases for functions ranging from risk management to customer engagement to marketing to search and beyond. As organizations race to harness AI's transformative power, they face mounting pressures to navigate a complex web of regulations and societal expectations. At Credo AI, we empower enterprises to not only manage AI risks effectively but also to foster innovation responsibly.\"\n\nSince its founding and pioneering of the AI Governance category in 2020, Credo AI has made massive leaps in its mission to ensure AI is always in service to humanity, with a relentless focus on advocating for humans where AI algorithms are used. Credo AI's robust growth underscores its pivotal role in shaping the future of AI governance. The company has tripled its revenue this year, and has grown its team by 3x including a new Head of Revenue and GTM, Mike Rogers, Head of People, Jessica Amato, and VP of Engineering, Benjamin Zamora.\n\nLeading AI enterprises including Mastercard, Northrop Grumman, Ruffalo Noel Levitz, and Booz Allen Hamilton trust Credo AI's software to provide both technical and non-technical stakeholders the ability to manage, monitor and measure AI risks. In 2024, Credo AI announced its partnership with Databricks, bringing together its AI governance platform with the Databricks Data Intelligence Platform, making it easier for customers to adopt responsible, compliant, and safe AI at scale. They also recently forged a partnership with McKinsey to empower their clients with tailored solutions to support AI risk management and governance. Credo AI was named to Fast Company's list of the world's 50 Most Innovative Companies for its leading AI governance platform.\n\n\"Organizations of all sizes, all over the world, want to embrace AI innovation while acting responsibly and maintaining compliance in a fast-evolving regulatory landscape,\" said Mohamed Nanabhay, Managing Partner at Mozilla Ventures. \"Using Credo AI, leaders at these organizations can implement compliance and safety measures across the entire AI product lifecycle. Beyond compliance, Credo AI provides a foundation for organizations to innovate while considering (and mitigating) the unintended consequences of new AI systems\".\n\n\"We are honored to support Credo AI in their mission to safeguard society amidst the rapid surge in AI investment and innovation,\" stated Yong Aik Gan, CEO of CrimsoNox Capital. \"As we stand on the brink of an era where AI's transformative potential knows no bounds, it is imperative that our dedication to safety and ethical considerations matches our zeal for progress. Ensuring that technological advancements benefit humanity without causing harm is a responsibility we embrace with conviction.\"\n\n\"The Responsible AI movement finds its strongest industry advocate in Credo AI, championing holistic governance that integrates multi-stakeholder oversight. Their remarkable progress underscores the urgency for enterprises to embark on their Responsible AI governance journey,\" said Scott Frederick, Managing Partner at Sands Capital. \"Credo AI has successfully guided numerous organizations in aligning AI applications with industry-specific standards and regulations, ensuring swift and safe adoption.\"\n\nAlso Read: AI and Big Data Governance: Challenges and Top Benefits\n\n\"We are seeing AI adopted across companies of all stages, and compliance and governance will be critical to the long-term success of these initiatives regardless of the vertical,\" said Jon Sakoda, Founding Partner at Decibel VC. \"Credo AI gives its customers the foundation for long-term success of their AI initiatives, leading the industry in responsible AI and setting the global standards for its safe and sustainable use.\"\n\n\"Everyone is talking about the business opportunities for AI, but for real-world implementation, accountability is key to realizing its full potential. Customers, boards, executives, and organizations need to trust the new AI systems they deploy and Credo AI gives them the accessibility and legality needed for critical needle-moving AI use cases,\" said Pegah Ebrahimi, Co-Founder and Managing Partner of FPV Ventures.\n\nIn addition to bolstering its leadership team, Credo AI will use the new funding to expand its strategic GTM efforts, intensify product innovation in governance intelligence, and enhance its capability to serve as the central hub for AI governance. This includes significant investments in purpose-built integrations aimed at automating governance processes across industry-leading MLops and LLMops tools, ensuring seamless alignment with evolving industry standards and regulatory frameworks. These initiatives will reinforce Credo AI's commitment to enabling organizations worldwide to adopt AI responsibly while driving AI innovation and operational efficiency.", "source": {"uri":

Sure, AI models can write funny poetry and make videos, but there's also the risk that the systems will produce a chatbot that says something wacky, untrue or potentially harmful -- not to mention the possibilities of falling afoul of AI regulations.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nOne small startup sees a market opportunity in that uncertainty. Credo AI is set to announce a $21 million funding round Tuesday for its work on risk and compliance issues around AI adoption. The funding round values the company at $101 million, about double its previous valuation it its last funding round in 2022.\n\nSingapore-based venture capital firm CrimsoNox Capital is leading the deal, with participation from new investors Mozilla Ventures and FPV Ventures. Existing backers Sands Capital, Decibel VC, Booz Allen Hamilton and AI Fund are also joining the round, bringing the company's total funding raised to $41.3 million.\n\nFounded in 2020, Credo AI helps companies make sure that they're following legal regulations and other standards around responsible AI use. The company -- whose customers include Mastercard Inc., Northrop Grumman Corp. and Booz Allen Hamilton -- says it has tripled its revenue and headcount in the past year, reflecting the demand from major companies to ensure they're in compliance with new regulations such as the EU AI Act and the US AI Executive Order.\n\n\"The innovation in generative AI has really caused not only excitement around what AI can do, but also a little bit of a step back in thinking about, 'How do we get this right?'\" said Credo AI founder and Chief Executive Officer Navrina Singh, who added that inbound customer demand had recently increased, mainly from Fortune 2000 companies. Singh said that AI governance is the \"boring but essential\" work, particularly as companies invest more on AI capabilities.\n\nSingh previously worked as a product director for Microsoft Corp. and Qualcomm Inc., and also has ties to the AI regulatory world. She serves on the Commerce Department's National AI Advisory Committee, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development's Expert Group on AI Risk and Accountability and the United Nations' High-Level Advisory Body on Artificial Intelligence.\n\n\"The truth of the matter is that there's far too many regulations and guidelines for a global enterprise to be able to follow on their own,\" said Sands Capital managing partner Scott Frederick, one of the company's investors. \"In order to leverage AI, you're going to need a governance platform that understands this regulatory lattice.\"\n\nIn addition to a patchwork of national regulation in the form of laws and guidance from agencies like the US Federal Trade Commission, firms have to worry about developing state and local regulations as well.\n\nCredo AI's business gives companies an assessment about the risks of AI tools they're using -- Singh says the company currently tracks around 430 distinct types of risks -- along with customized information on AI rules and regulations.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek", "source": {"uri": "ca.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

This is the first of its kind around the world, as other nations have not gone to this extent as of yet, and its created to manage how AI impacts different industries.\n\nThe AI Act affects all companies using AI technology, whether they are developing new systems or maintaining existing ones. As of the enforcement date, companies have set periods ranging from three to six months to align their operations with the new regulations, depending on the scale of AI usage in their day-to-day when working.\n\nThis legislation could really change how businesses use AI, with a focus on remaining compliant and ethical. About 85% of AI firms are placed under the \"minimal risk\" category, according to the EU, so the changes they see won't be too impactful. Those with higher risk categories, however, may have to prove the integrity of how they use and train their AI.\n\nAnd although some may argue that the new regulations may dampen innovation in the AI sector, EU officials reassure them that the Act is meant to support AI development while keeping user interests and security in mind in more proactive ways than before. Companies are encouraged to set up internal governance structures to review and manage their AI applications proactively.\n\nWe've gathered experts to share their view on how the Act will impact the region, across industries as a way to start conversations. These experts have shared their differing takes on what the Act will do for businesses, and more interesting insights:\n\n\"The EU AI Act will reshape how businesses operate, especially for UK companies engaging with the EU market. Compliance with the Act's requirements is not optional for businesses; it applies to any AI systems that affect EU citizens or markets.\n\n\"Businesses must prioritise transparency and ethical AI practices. For customer communications, this means clearly disclosing when AI is used and ensuring that targeting and personalisation strategies adhere to the Act's guidelines. The prohibitions on practices like biometric categorisation require a re-evaluation of existing AI strategies to align with ethical standards.\n\n\"Companies should ensure they conduct thorough audits of their AI systems, invest in staff training on AI ethics, and establish robust governance frameworks. While these steps can be challenging, compliance will improve customer trust and provide a competitive edge in the EU market.\n\n\"It's all about maintaining trust with EU customers, showing them that responsible AI development can go hand in hand with risk management, compliance, and ethical AI practices.\"\n\n\"The EU AI Act has established a framework of best practices to govern the use of AI systems. As the AI Act comes into force on 1 August 2024, experts have called for an international agreement on using copyright-protected content to train AI models, such as watermarking AI-generated content with significant human input, intellectual property (IP) protection of copyright-generated content, an enforced liability for infringements when creating content with Gen AI, and a remuneration scheme for rightsholders.\n\n\"The emergence of generative AI has raised concerns over copyright law in the EU and US. The EU AI Act, although not intended specifically for copyright law, provides a legal framework to assign and categorise responsibilities to providers and users of AI systems. These include publicly disclosing the use of copyright-protected training data.\n\n\"The EU AI Act includes a transparency requirement for \"publishing summaries of copyrighted data used in training.\" Some get-outs allow for data mining of copyrighted works in instances such as for use by research institutions. This is not considered a viable defense for AI companies with public and commercial generative AI systems. But while big tech puts pressure on governments to hold off on legislation, AI systems continue to train on copyrighted content.\n\n\"Many AI companies have assumed that they're allowed to use whatever content they want from the web and have hit out against governing policy as detrimental to growth and innovation. Mustafa Suleyman, CEO of Microsoft AI, said as much in an interview with CNBC at the Aspen Ideas Festival. To back this up, last month the Chamber of Progress, a tech industry coalition whose members include Apple, Meta, and Amazon, launched a campaign to defend the fair use of copyrighted works to train AI systems.\n\n\"The AI Act will introduce limited exceptions for text and data mining and recognise the importance of balancing copyright protection with promoting research and innovation. It acknowledges the need for proportionality in compliance requirements for startups and SMEs.\n\n\"The AI Act requires transparency from providers, ensuring accountability and enforcement of copyrights. AI companies will be required to provide comprehensive information about the datasets used.\n\n\"With the implementation of the AI Act, companies must develop a comprehensive AI policy that serves as a framework for responsible and transparent AI deployment. It is important to have an AI policy that ensures that the technology is used ethically, legally, and effectively.\"\n\n\"The act is a positive step towards improving safety around use of AI, but legislation isn't a standalone solution. Many of the act's provisions don't come into effect until 2026, and with this technology evolving so rapidly, legislation risks becoming outdated by the time it actually applies to AI developers.\n\n\"Notably, the act does not require AI model developers to provide attribution to the data sources used to build models, leaving many authors of original material unable to assert and monetise their rights on copywrite material. Alongside legislative reform, businesses need to focus on educating staff on how to safely use AI, where it should and shouldn't be deployed and identifying targeted use-cases where it can boost productivity.\"\n\n\"AI isn't a silver bullet for everything. Not every process needs to be overhauled by AI and in some cases, a simple automation process is the better option. All too often, firms are implementing AI solutions just because they want to jump on the bandwagon. Instead, they should think about what problems need to be solved, and how to do that in the most efficient way.\"\n\n\"Trying to regulate the technology right now is like trying to control the high seas or bring law and order to the Wild West. For an AI regulation to be effective, it would have to be global -- and such an agreement seems unlikely any time soon. If just one region regulates AI and establishes a \"safe framework,\" developers will just go elsewhere to continue their work. And that's before we consider those already based outside the EU. Would a global agreement stop state-sponsored or independent developers in countries like Russia, China, Iran, and South Korea?\n\n\"The birth of AI is second only to the foundation of the Internet in terms of its power to fundamentally alter our lives -- and some people even compare it to the discovery of fire. But hyperbole aside, AI is still in its infancy, and we have only scratched the surface of what it could achieve. So, right now, no one is in a position to legislate -- and even if they were, AI is developing at such a pace that the legislation wouldn't keep up.\"\n\n\"The EU AI Act is a welcome roadmap for the future of AI, putting guardrails in place to promote its safe and trustworthy development. This is especially true given the fast pace of its evolution during the past 18 months. AI has increasingly become a central part of business operations, automating tasks such as data analysis, forecasting and customer services, and giving businesses a competitive edge, but that cannot come at the expense of trust and safety.\n\n\"Additional safety measures on AI models and systems, particularly those deemed to be high risk, is crucial to protect businesses and their customers. Implementing robust business policies for the use of AI, alongside the guidance of the EU AI Act, will enable greater agility for organisations to react to market trends and serve customers more effectively.\"\n\n\"Our Digital Health Study highlighted that 46% of UK respondents wanted increased regulation from the Government to protect businesses from the threat of AI, so we also hope to see the UK promoting safety measures around AI and considering its own forms of localised safeguards.\"\n\n\"The legal countdown has started. The EU AI Act will come into force as of Thursday 1st August, and will be fully applicable within 24 months. From a compliance perspective, businesses need to move fast. Indeed, many organisations still need to educate AI and train these systems, but this is very much reliant on their own internal data architecture. Companies need to ensure all data is accurate and readily available, and that their current AI applications are compliant with the new regulation.\n\n\"The Act is characterised by a risk-based approach, which is also reflected in the structure of the transitional periods. It refers to any AI system within the EU that is 'on the market' and affects both AI providers (vendors) and deployers (the organisations using these systems). Some businesses initially concerned with the scope of the requirements labelled it as a 'minefield' that needs to be unravelled carefully.\n\n\"For example, the Act categorises different types of AI according to risk, which are split into four tiers: high, unacceptable, limited and minimal AI. Systems presenting only limited risk would be subject to 'very light transparency obligations', whereas high risk systems are subject to a set of requirements and 'obligations' to gain access to the EU market. Others have said that, whilst we need to reduce risks and be more transparent, there's a risk to stifling innovation through added complexity.\n\n\"Nevertheless, moving forwards, organisations will need to be scrupulous with their data management and ensure they have measures in place to comply with the new law and the evolving regulatory landscape. Given the pace at which this technology has evolved, it's likely that more regulatory shifts are on the horizon, especially as the political bodies continue to map out these laws and better understand the technology and its capabilities. As such, organisations should remain proactive, ensuring they meet current requirements while also in the best position to adapt to future legislation.\n\n\"There is no doubt that enterprises have big projects ahead of them. All businesses will have to review their operations to ensure all current and future AI applications are compliant. This will be particularly challenging for those organisations that have rushed their AI programmes and adopted multiple solutions across their business over the last year. The penalties for noncompliance are severe. Companies could face fines up to 30 million euros or seven percent of their global annual revenue, and different tiers apply depending on the violations as defined by the Act itself.\"\n\n\"With the EU AI Act starting this week, businesses need to understand their new obligations to remain compliant and avoid crippling fines. Compliance with copyright laws and transparency is crucial for both general-purpose AI systems, like chatbots, and generative AI models. Detailed technical documentation and clear summaries of training data, especially for GenAI models, will be necessary.\n\n\"To remain agile, companies need modular AI processes for easy updates - avoiding a complete overhaul. A dedicated team and budget for AI maintenance are essential here. As AI becomes increasingly integrated, it will impact all business areas. Investing in compliance infrastructure, enhancing documentation and transparency, and instilling robust cybersecurity measures will be imperative to mitigate financial risks and align with regulatory standards. Now, for the UK and Europe, this is the only way businesses can continue to leverage the benefits of AI while ensuring ethical standards are met.\n\n\"Lastly, given the pessimism around European's AI regulatory measures, regulators must strive to continuously evolve and collaborate with tech experts to ensure safe, equitable and innovative AI deployment so that the EU doesn't fall behind.\"\n\n\"The clock is now ticking for AI compliance. And while it will still take time for the codes of practice and guidelines that underpin the EU's AI Act to be released, businesses need to start planning and preparing now.\n\n\"The phased approach that the EU has favoured, gives most companies up to a year to ensure they have introduced mechanisms that ensure AI has been responsibly integrated into their business operations. However, many are still encountering roadblocks with the adoption of AI - 43% of UK businesses that have adapted AI say AI governance is the main obstacle, closely followed by AI ethics (42%).*\n\n\"It will take time to get the responsibility, guardrails, and controls around AI to the right place as its use evolves. But as a starting point, organisations should focus on protecting the integrity of AI systems by ensuring the foundations and controls for AI tools are robust. They need to have full transparency of the data used to train AI models.\u202fOrganisations need to measure, correct and report on the quality of data fed into AI models to ensure decisions are being made on trusted, well governed data. And they need to understand the decisions AI models are making and why.\"\n\n\"The EU's AI Act is another significant milestone in promoting the responsible, safe and secure adoption and implementation of AI across organisations and industries. It also emphasises the importance of data privacy in shaping the future of AI innovation.\n\n\"The US and EU have set a precedent for other regions to follow by laying the foundations for organisations to address risks, uphold privacy and prioritise security when using AI. In time, I hope to see more global collaboration, new frameworks emerge and greater support for Privacy Enhancing Technologies that will further enable organisations to safely and securely leverage AI to enable transformative business benefits and innovation, while safeguarding data privacy and security at the same time.\"\n\n\"AI is moving incredibly fast. To control how it's being used and implemented, legislation has to keep up with innovation, but up until now, it has lagged behind.\n\n\"The EU AI Act does a great job of thinking through best conduct in every specific scenario, but, I would have liked to have seen more high level regulation shared more quickly, as I think the industry required some broader guardrails following the release of ChatGPT, arguably the watershed moment in the current global AI race.\n\n\"It's a welcome development, but the industry can't determine if the EU AI Act has been a success just yet, as it hasn't yet been rolled out in real world applications. Inevitably, as businesses engage with the Act, they will push the boundaries of the regulation in ways lawmakers didn't expect. Therefore, it's only after it's been integrated into businesses that regulators can determine if they have successfully controlled the areas they set out to in practice or if the law is having unintended consequences, such as making some things harder.\n\n\"For example, GDPR entered into force in 2018, but it's only now that it's been imposed for a few years that we can look back and evaluate its overall success. It's likely with the EU AI Act, that there will also be a period of iteration after it comes into force, where organisations begin to understand what it actually means in practice.\n\n\"The task ahead of us is that AI is an incredibly powerful tool, and we need legislation in place which helps establish the infrastructure around it to take full advantage of its capabilities. Going forward, legislation and innovation will go hand in hand, because as AI develops, regulation will have to evolve alongside it.\"", "source": {"uri": "techround.co.uk", "dataType": "news",

The AI Act is designed to ensure that AI developed and used in the EU is trustworthy, with safeguards to protect people's fundamental rights. The regulation aims to establish a harmonised internal market for AI in the EU, encouraging the uptake of this technology and creating a supportive environment for innovation and investment.\n\nThe AI Act introduces a forward-looking definition of AI, based on a product safety and risk-based approach in the EU:\n\nMinimal risk: Most AI systems, such as AI-enabled recommender systems and spam filters, fall into this category. These systems face no obligations under the AI Act due to their minimal risk to citizens' rights and safety. Companies can voluntarily adopt additional codes of conduct.Specific transparency risk: AI systems like chatbots must clearly disclose to users that they are interacting with a machine. Certain AI-generated content, including deep fakes, must be labelled as such, and users need to be informed when biometric categorisation or emotion recognition systems are being used. In addition, providers will have to design systems in a way that synthetic audio, video, text and images content is marked in a machine-readable format, and detectable as artificially generated or manipulated. High risk: AI systems identified as high-risk will be required to comply with strict requirements, including risk-mitigation systems, high quality of data sets, logging of activity, detailed documentation, clear user information, human oversight, and a high level of robustness, accuracy, and cybersecurity. Regulatory sandboxes will facilitate responsible innovation and the development of compliant AI systems. Such high-risk AI systems include for example AI systems used for recruitment, or to assess whether somebody is entitled to get a loan, or to run autonomous robots. Unacceptable risk: AI systems considered a clear threat to the fundamental rights of people will be banned. This includes AI systems or applications that manipulate human behaviour to circumvent users' free will, such as toys using voice assistance encouraging dangerous behaviour of minors, systems that allow 'social scoring' by governments or companies, and certain applications of predictive policing. In addition, some uses of biometric systems will be prohibited, for example emotion recognition systems used at the workplace and some systems for categorising people or real time remote biometric identification for law enforcement purposes in publicly accessible spaces (with narrow exceptions).\n\nTo complement this system, the AI Act also introduces rules for so-called general-purpose AI models, which are highly capable AI models that are designed to perform a wide variety of tasks like generating human-like text. General-purpose AI models are increasingly used as components of AI applications. The AI Act will ensure transparency along the value chain and addresses possible systemic risks of the most capable models.\n\nApplication and enforcement of the AI rules\n\nMember States have until 2 August 2025 to designate national competent authorities, who will oversee the application of the rules for AI systems and carry out market surveillance activities. The Commission's AI Office will be the key implementation body for the AI Act at EU-level, as well as the enforcer for the rules for general-purpose AI models.\n\nThree advisory bodies will support the implementation of the rules. The European Artificial Intelligence Board will ensure a uniform application of the AI Act across EU Member States and will act as the main body for cooperation between the Commission and the Member States. A scientific panel of independent experts will offer technical advice and input on enforcement. In particular, this panel can issue alerts to the AI Office about risks associated to general-purpose AI models. The AI Office can also receive guidance from an advisory forum, composed of a diverse set of stakeholders.\n\nCompanies not complying with the rules will be fined. Fines could go up to 7% of the global annual turnover for violations of banned AI applications, up to 3% for violations of other obligations and up to 1.5% for supplying incorrect information.\n\nNext Steps\n\nThe majority of rules of the AI Act will start applying on 2 August 2026. However, prohibitions of AI systems deemed to present an unacceptable risk will already apply after six months, while the rules for so-called General-Purpose AI models will apply after 12 months.\n\nTo bridge the transitional period before full implementation, the Commission has launched the AI Pact. This initiative invites AI developers to voluntarily adopt key obligations of the AI Act ahead of the legal deadlines.\n\nThe Commission is also developing guidelines to define and detail how the AI Act should be implemented and facilitating co-regulatory instruments like standards and codes of practice. The Commission opened a call for expression of interest to participate in drawing-up the first general-purpose AI Code of Practice, as well as a multi-stakeholder consultation giving the opportunity to all stakeholders to have their say on the first Code of Practice under the AI Act.\n\nBackground\n\nOn 9 December 2023, the Commission welcomed the political agreement on the AI Act. On 24 January 2024 the Commission has launched a package of measures to support European startups and SMEs in the development of trustworthy AI. On 29 May 2024 the Commission unveiled the AI Office. On 9 July 2024 the amended EuroHPC JU Regulation entered into force, thus allowing the set-up of AI factories. This allows dedicated AI-supercomputers to be used for the training of General Purpose AI (GPAI) models.\n\nContinued independent, evidence-based research produced by the Joint Research Centre (JRC) has been fundamental in shaping the EU's AI policies and ensuring their effective implementation.\n\n/Public Release.

Here are things you need to know", "body": "The first time I used generative artificial intelligence, I felt like a kid at an amateur magic show. Is the card really floating in midair? The parents at this kind of show, of course, are less dumbstruck than the kids: The card is not floating but instead swinging on some string. It's not magic. Not even a particularly good illusion. You simply have to know where to look.\n\nThe same goes for generative artificial intelligence. Once you know where to look, even the most powerful AI stops looking like magic. No string here -- instead, look at the AI's training data.\n\nTraining data is the information used to construct an AI. After programmers feed an AI a massive diet of training data, the AI learns to identify patterns in it and then generates output. The more data you feed an AI, the more subtle the patterns it can recognize and generate. That's why ChatGPT can churn out travel itineraries, B-level college essays and social media marketing campaigns.\n\nIn all the hubbub around AI, it can be tempting to think that AI will eclipse us. That it will expand infinitely, until it can do all that a college-educated human can do -- and more. That it will take over not only the jobs of data crunchers and coders and copy editors, but also poets and artists and high-level managers.\n\nWe are probably right to worry about some of our jobs. But many predictions about AI are overblown. The technology faces crucial limitations.\n\nFirst limitation: AI is limited by the data on which it is trained. Even if you were to train an AI on the entire internet, the AI would miss out on a lot: thoughts jotted down on a napkin; late-night conversations with a college roommate; that week in 2018 you spent camping in the Rockies; and the feeling of seeing your grandma after a long time apart. None of that is part of the AI's world.\n\nSecond limitation: AI lacks critical thinking. Can an image-generating AI churn out several versions of a cat in a fedora painted in the style of Rembrandt? Yup. But can an AI discern which of the paintings is better than the others? No.\n\nYes, AI can generate incredible content. But it cannot evaluate the content it creates. At least not in the way you and I can.\n\nThere's a mistake many new AI users make. They assume it can simply replace entire swaths of human expertise -- such as creating art, writing code or penning essays. This is a misguided assumption. Will AI streamline tasks and eliminate some jobs? Likely, yes. Yet the most effective users of AI are those who are already experts in the relevant task.\n\nIn other words, AI can write code, craft text and generate images, but it is most effective if you already know what you are doing. For example, I have friends who write code, and they tell me that the code AI writes is good but needs to be consolidated and cleaned up by a human.\n\nLikewise, as a writer, I believe that AI can be a helpful tool. It can generate ideas, word choices and metaphors. But for an undergraduate churning out a last-minute essay, AI will be far less useful. The essay won't come together without someone to form it.\n\nSince I started writing about AI, I get asked a lot about the Terminator. Are cyborgs going to take over? No. Yet we should still worry about AI. It is poised to take over large swaths of human activity and, in doing so, erode our individual and shared humanity.\n\nThe truth is that generative AI is only the tip of the iceberg. The influence and potential dangers of the AI revolution go far beyond the flashy, generative versions.\n\nFor example, AI has been making a splash in health care. Applications can discern subtle differences in radiology scans and can be used to triage patients and complete physician's notes. They can be used to craft care plans for patients upon discharge. Used correctly, AI could deliver more effective health care. But used improperly, AI-powered health care could exacerbate problems in delivery, rob medicine of the human element and reduce our view of a person to a collection of data.\n\nAI is also in Big Retail. You've likely bought a book on the recommendation of Amazon's algorithm, viewed videos based on YouTube's suggestions and clicked on an ad for a product you never would have looked up on your own. In all these instances, AI predicts your preferences. Scarier still, the AI helps shape your preferences in the first place, creating a desire and then immediately offering the opportunity to satisfy it. In each of these interactions, we lose a sliver of our humanity. We cede our desires to the algorithms. We become more materialistic and less free.\n\nWe become, in a word, less human.\n\nAI does, indeed, threaten our humanity. Not in the form of a cyborg but with the promise of a funny YouTube video or a new pair of jeans.\n\nIn the early days of the internet, when it was slow-moving and quirky, we couldn't have imagined smartphones, streaming platforms and online banking becoming part of our daily lives.\n\nSimilarly, AI is finding its legs. Like the internet, AI is poised to infiltrate our lives in myriad and unexpected ways. We cannot predict precisely how or where AI will take up residence in 50 years.\n\nHow to prepare for this kind of infiltration? By reflecting carefully on AI now. By identifying those areas of lives we want to retain as human spaces and those we are comfortable ceding to the AI algorithms.

The regulation aims to establish a harmonised internal market for AI in the EU, encouraging the uptake of this technology and creating a supportive environment for innovation and investment.\n\nThe AI Act introduces a forward-looking definition of AI, based on a product safety and risk-based approach in the EU:\n\nMinimal risk: Most AI systems, such as AI-enabled recommender systems and spam filters, fall into this category. These systems face no obligations under the AI Act due to their minimal risk to citizens' rights and safety. Companies can voluntarily adopt additional codes of conduct.\n\nSpecific transparency risk: AI systems like chatbots must clearly disclose to users that they are interacting with a machine. Certain AI-generated content, including deep fakes, must be labelled as such, and users need to be informed when biometric categorisation or emotion recognition systems are being used. In addition, providers will have to design systems in a way that synthetic audio, video, text and images content is marked in a machine-readable format, and detectable as artificially generated or manipulated.\n\nHigh risk: AI systems identified as high-risk will be required to comply with strict requirements, including risk-mitigation systems, high quality of data sets, logging of activity, detailed documentation, clear user information, human oversight, and a high level of robustness, accuracy, and cybersecurity. Regulatory sandboxes will facilitate responsible innovation and the development of compliant AI systems. Such high-risk AI systems include for example AI systems used for recruitment, or to assess whether somebody is entitled to get a loan, or to run autonomous robots.\n\nUnacceptable risk: AI systems considered a clear threat to the fundamental rights of people will be banned. This includes AI systems or applications that manipulate human behaviour to circumvent users' free will, such as toys using voice assistance encouraging dangerous behaviour of minors, systems that allow 'social scoring' by governments or companies, and certain applications of predictive policing. In addition, some uses of biometric systems will be prohibited, for example emotion recognition systems used at the workplace and some systems for categorising people or real time remote biometric identification for law enforcement purposes in publicly accessible spaces (with narrow exceptions).\n\nTo complement this system, the AI Act also introduces rules for so-called general-purpose AI models, which are highly capable AI models that are designed to perform a wide variety of tasks like generating human-like text. General-purpose AI models are increasingly used as components of AI applications. The AI Act will ensure transparency along the value chain and addresses possible systemic risks of the most capable models.\n\nApplication and enforcement of the AI rules\n\nMember States have until 2 August 2025 to designate national competent authorities, who will oversee the application of the rules for AI systems and carry out market surveillance activities. The Commission's AI Office will be the key implementation body for the AI Act at EU-level, as well as the enforcer for the rules for general-purpose AI models.\n\nThree advisory bodies will support the implementation of the rules. The European Artificial Intelligence Board will ensure a uniform application of the AI Act across EU Member States and will act as the main body for cooperation between the Commission and the Member States. A scientific panel of independent experts will offer technical advice and input on enforcement. In particular, this panel can issue alerts to the AI Office about risks associated to general-purpose AI models. The AI Office can also receive guidance from an advisory forum, composed of a diverse set of stakeholders.\n\nCompanies not complying with the rules will be fined. Fines could go up to 7% of the global annual turnover for violations of banned AI applications, up to 3% for violations of other obligations and up to 1.5% for supplying incorrect information.\n\nNext Steps\n\nThe majority of rules of the AI Act will start applying on 2 August 2026. However, prohibitions of AI systems deemed to present an unacceptable risk will already apply after six months, while the rules for so-called General-Purpose AI models will apply after 12 months.\n\nTo bridge the transitional period before full implementation, the Commission has launched the AI Pact. This initiative invites AI developers to voluntarily adopt key obligations of the AI Act ahead of the legal deadlines.\n\nThe Commission is also developing guidelines to define and detail how the AI Act should be implemented and facilitating co-regulatory instruments like standards and codes of practice. The Commission opened a call for expression of interest to participate in drawing-up the first general-purpose AI Code of Practice, as well as a multi-stakeholder consultation giving the opportunity to all stakeholders to have their say on the first Code of Practice under the AI Act.", "source": {"uri": "finextra.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Finextra Research"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fundamental rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biometrics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Biometrics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deepfake", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Deepfake"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotion_recognition", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Emotion recognition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recommender_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Recommender system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_filtering", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Email filtering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparency_(behavior)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Transparency (behavior)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictive_policing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Predictive policing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applications_of_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Applications of artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandbox_(computer_security)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sandbox (computer security)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_robot", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Autonomous robot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Real-time computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minor (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_set", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Data set"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_will", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free will"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Computer security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_state_of_the_European_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Member state of the European Union"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Intrusion_Detection_Systems", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Intrusion Detection Systems", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Biometrics", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Biometrics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Companies", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Companies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Emergency_and_Safety", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Emergency and Safety", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Threads", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Threads", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://www.finextra.com/about/finextra-logo.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9778318", "eventUri": "eng-9778318", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

Over the past few decades, we have seen the evolution of AI from simple rule-based systems to sophisticated machine learning algorithms that can perform tasks previously thought to be the exclusive domain of humans. One of the latest developments in this field is generative AI, a subset of AI that can create new content, such as text, images, and music, by learning from existing data. This raises an intriguing question: Will generative AI replace traditional AI? In this article, we will explore the differences between generative AI and traditional AI, their applications, and whether generative AI has the potential to replace traditional AI.\n\nTraditional AI, often referred to as narrow AI or weak AI, encompasses systems designed to perform specific tasks using predefined rules and algorithms. These systems are highly specialized and excel in tasks such as speech recognition, image classification, and recommendation systems. Traditional AI relies on structured data and follows a deterministic approach, where the output is determined by the input and the programmed rules.\n\nOne of the most significant breakthroughs in traditional AI has been the development of machine learning algorithms, particularly deep learning. Deep learning models, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), have achieved remarkable success in tasks like image recognition and natural language processing. These models are trained on vast amounts of labeled data, allowing them to learn patterns and make predictions.\n\nHowever, traditional AI has its limitations. It requires extensive labeled data for training, and its performance is often constrained by the quality and quantity of the data. Additionally, traditional AI systems are typically task-specific and lack the flexibility to perform a wide range of functions. This is where generative AI comes into play.\n\nAI consultants play a crucial role in navigating the complexities of traditional AI. They help organizations implement AI solutions tailored to specific needs, ensuring optimal performance and alignment with business objectives. With their expertise, AI consultants can guide businesses in data collection, model selection, and deployment strategies, maximizing the benefits of traditional AI while mitigating its limitations. They are essential in bridging the gap between theoretical AI capabilities and practical, real-world applications.", "source": {"uri": "analyticsinsight.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Analytics Insight"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Machine learning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule-based_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rule-based system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Subset"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_vision", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Computer vision"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Evolution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labeled_data", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Labeled data"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterministic_algorithm", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Deterministic algorithm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrent_neural_network", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Recurrent neural network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Convolutional neural network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recommender_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Recommender system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_recognition", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Speech recognition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Deep learning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Algorithm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Natural language processing"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Life", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Life", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Machine_Learning", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Neural_Networks", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Neural Networks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 47}], "image": "https://media.assettype.com/analyticsinsight%2F2024-08%2Fa2d3f594-1178-478a-be70-e58b256ac657%2FWill-Generative-AI-Replace-Traditional-AI.jpg?w=1200&ar=40%3A21&auto=format%2Ccompress&ogImage=true&mode=crop&enlarge=true&overlay=false&overlay_position=bottom&overlay_width=100", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9778318", "eventUri": "eng-9778318", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

Yet BSI's International AI Maturity Model, which assesses and weighs a suite of measures, including organisational confidence and readiness, found countries at markedly different stages on their journeys.\n\nSouth Africa has witnessed a significant uptake in AI in recent years.[1] Many organisations have received significant funding ($20 billion+)[2] to support AI efforts in healthcare, education and finance[3] specifically. So how can South African business leaders continue to ensure it can be a force for good, changing lives, making a positive impact on society and accelerating progress towards a sustainable world? There are two critical components worth discussing: strategy and governance. Because AI is a tool to support and augment the human factor, both are critical for success.\n\nThinking strategically, whether you are creating AI tools or just leveraging them, might sound obvious. Yet according to BSI's research, under half of businesses globally have an AI strategy (44%). The reality is that success with AI will depend on answering the what and the why of introducing it to your business. This means understanding your individual organisation's needs and getting to grips with what AI can actually do, then working out how those two things align. That might direct you to hefty investment in tools, but that alone isn't a recipe for success, because before you invest, you need to know what you are aiming to do, what AI can solve or how it can enhance decision-making. Is your aim to free up skilled resources? What is it that you're trying to get AI to do and what's the desired impact? What's your expected return on investment, what are the risks and who will be managing the tools day to day? What external parties will now be involved with your business? What does it mean for your customers, workforce and supply chain?\n\nAI strategy is about wider business strategy and it's part of the conversation about where you want your business to go. Not only that, but strategy can't be stationary because AI is moving at a rapid pace. As the technology changes, the considerations evolve and the legislative and regulatory context shifts. So your business's AI strategy must be agile and responsive.\n\nEqually, putting effective governance in place is vital. AI is to some degree the great unknown. While it offers huge potential to be a force for good for society, there are many considerations for businesses at the vanguard. Regulation of AI in South Africa is still in its infancy; however, the country is well-positioned to ensure its safe and responsible use, as many organisations have started to put plans and processes in place to ensure the responsible use of AI. For example, the South African Reserve Bank's (SARB) Financial Technology unit that has been established for this.[4] With AI's capabilities developing fast,[i] having appropriate governance systems in place can enable us to make not just good, but great, use of AI in every area of life and society. This is addressed in the recently published AI management system framework (ISO/IEC 42001).\n\nBusiness leaders may not be responsible for creating the AI tools they use, but they will still be accountable for any impacts they have. And there are wider questions; is the AI being used in the way that is actually intended to be used and for its intended purpose? Having an independent, safe governance mechanism that understands the external factors influencing your use of AI, but sits separately from those managing the day-to-day use of AI, offers the best path to success. This can take many forms; it's not necessarily about having a dedicated AI board or even a chief AI officer, but having an independent function. Get the governance right and everything else will follow. It's important to follow the guidance within standards such as Data Quality (ISO 8000-1), where business data drives the AI algorithms. The international standards on data integrity can help provide adequate governance.\n\nThe importance of both a well-developed, agile strategy and the need for effective governance is well understood by most businesses. Yet BSI's research shows a gap between ambition and action when it comes to delivering the training and stakeholder engagement needed to build trust in AI.\n\nWhile AI is moving fast, we do have the chance to get this right, to learn from the introduction of past technologies and build an AI ecosystem in which businesses can act with confidence and responsibility, making AI a force for good across society in South Africa. BSI offers a range of on-demand training courses covering topics from fundamentals to industry-specific considerations to empower you in the AI-driven era.\n\n[1] Navigating Artificial Intelligence Adoption in South Africa (cm.com)", "source": {"uri": "itweb.co.za", "dataType": "news", "title": "ITWeb"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision-making", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Decision-making"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Technological change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return_on_investment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Return on investment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supply chain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Strategic management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fintech", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fintech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_integrity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Data integrity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSI_Group", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BSI Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_standard", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International standard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Organization_for_Standardization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International Organization for Standardization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stakeholder_(corporate)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stakeholder (corporate)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Algorithm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Electrotechnical_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International Electrotechnical Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecosystem", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ecosystem"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Self-Help", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Self-Help", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Philanthropy", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Philanthropy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/In_Daily_Life", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/In Daily Life", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.itweb.co.za/static/pictures/2024/07/BSI-01Aug2024.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9778318", "eventUri": "eng-9778318", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3647058823529412, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

This hot technology could help companies gain in efficiency and in some cases develop a product that may transform lives -- such as a better-performing medical device or drug.\n\nAnalysts predict that today's $200 billion AI market could roar higher in the coming years and reach beyond $1 trillion by the end of the decade. It's no surprise, then, to see AI giants such as Nvidia or Super Micro Computer soaring to record levels and generating billions of dollars in revenue. Nvidia dominates the AI chip market, while Super Micro sells the servers and full rack scale systems used in AI data centers.\n\nAnd it's also no surprise to see investors piling into AI stocks and winning big. But, in recent times, some economists have started to warn about a market bubble set to burst. And certain analysts question AI's transformative potential, calling into question the future of this technology. If these experts are right, a portfolio heavily exposed to AI stocks may greatly suffer in the near term or down the road. But this doesn't mean you shouldn't invest in this area, which still may deliver significant growth. Here's how to build a portfolio that could soar in an AI boom and withstand an AI crash...\n\nFirst, though, a quick look at two different perspectives on AI, and we can find them both at Goldman Sachs. Senior global economist Joseph Briggs predicts generative AI will automate 25% of work tasks and become more cost effective over time. But head of global equity research Jim Covello says AI is too costly to become a disruptive technology -- even over time -- and questions the ability of AI to eventually boost a company's revenue.\n\nRight now, it's too early to say which prediction will become a reality. It's possible that both Goldman experts will be right on some points -- and AI will be successful to a certain degree but won't reach the market's expectations. All of this means it's also impossible to predict with 100% accuracy the path of AI stocks down the road. They could soar, offer decent gains, or crash at a particular point.\n\nNow here's how to construct a portfolio that will help you navigate these uncertain waters and potentially sail on to an investment victory over time.\n\nBefore all else, it's important to consider your comfort with risk. If you're very cautious and the thought of a crash keeps you up at night, you'll want to limit your AI exposure to a small portion of your portfolio (and fill the rest with a broad range of quality companies, with a focus on safer investments such as healthcare stocks and dividend stocks.) And when investing in AI, you should favor companies that built a solid business prior to the emergence of this technology and don't rely heavily on it for their revenues.\n\nA good example is Amazon (AMZN 2.90%). This e-commerce and cloud computing powerhouse has invested heavily in AI, and this is already bearing some fruit. Amazon has been using AI to speed up its fulfillment process, and this has helped the company lower its cost to serve. In the area of cloud, Amazon Web Services (AWS) has reached a $100 billion annual revenue run rate thanks to the broad range of AI services it offers to customers.\n\nBut if AI turns out to be less of a game-changer than expected, Amazon still should continue generating growth over time through its e-commerce and cloud businesses.\n\nAnother potential investment for the cautious investor is an AI exchange-traded fund such as the Roundhill Generative AI & Technology ETF (CHAT 4.92%). This ETF invests in more than 50 companies involved in AI, offering you exposure to many AI players -- so one small investment offers you multiple chances to win, and you don't have to do the heavy lifting of selecting each individual stock.\n\nIf you're a middle-of-the-road investor, comfortable with some risk and looking for growth, you might invest in tech giants with broad businesses like Amazon, but it's also a great idea to add a couple of AI market leaders to your portfolio, such as Nvidia and Super Micro. And if you're an aggressive investor, you may add these leaders and bet on players in a new potential area of AI growth too, such as AI software.\n\nOf course, even if you're an aggressive investor, you'll want to make sure you diversify your portfolio enough so that if you're highly focused AI bets crash, other stocks may compensate. You can do this by selecting strong stocks across other industries such as healthcare and consumer goods -- and even some dividend-paying stocks to offer you passive income.\n\nOn top of this, to ensure your portfolio scores a win for you, remember not to panic during a downturn, and if your stocks' long-term prospects look bright, hold on to them. Crashes happen, but history shows us the market has always gone on to gain. This means that, whether the AI boom lasts or not, a well-though-out portfolio could off you top returns over the long term.", "source": {"uri": "fool.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Motley Fool"}, "authors": [{"uri": "adria_cimino@fool.com", "name": "Adria Cimino", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_center", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Data center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Server (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_device", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Medical device"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Telephone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disruptive_innovation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Disruptive innovation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-commerce", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "E-commerce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange-traded_fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Exchange-traded fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldman_Sachs", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Goldman Sachs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dividend", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dividend"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Web_Services", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amazon Web Services"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_good", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Final good"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/785122/gettyimages-1253877215.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9778318", "eventUri": "eng-9778318", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3411764705882352, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

We may make money when you click on links to our partners. Learn More.\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) has improved to the point that machines can now perform tasks once limited to humans. AI can produce art, engage in intelligent conversations, recognize objects, learn from experience, and make autonomous decisions, making it useful for personalized recommendations, social media content creation, healthcare decisions, screening job candidates, self-driving cars, and facial recognition. The relationship between AI and ethics is of growing importance -- while the technology is new and exciting, with the potential to benefit businesses and humanity as a whole, it also creates many unique ethical challenges that need to be understood, addressed, and regulated.\n\nThe role of ethics in AI is to create frameworks and guardrails that ensure that organizations develop and use AI in ways that put privacy and safety first. This includes making sure AI treats all groups fairly, without bias; preserving people's privacy through responsible data usage; and holding companies responsible for the behavior of artificial intelligence they've developed or deployed.\n\nFor AI to be considered trustworthy, companies must be transparent about what training data is used, how it is used, and what processes AI systems use to make decisions. In addition, AI must be built to be secure -- particularly in sectors like healthcare, where patient privacy is paramount. Ultimately, humans establish moral and ethical criteria for AI to ensure that it acts according to our values and ideals.\n\nEthical AI helps organizations create trust and loyalty with their users. It also helps companies comply with regulations, reduce their legal risk, and improve their reputations. Ethical behaviors promote innovation and progress, resulting in new opportunities, and establishing the safety and reliability of AI can reduce harm and increase confidence in its applications.\n\nOverall, ethical AI fosters an equal society by preserving human rights and contributing to larger societal benefits, indirectly helping economic success and providing users with fair, dependable, and respectful AI systems.\n\nFollowing ethical principles can help ensure that AI systems are trustworthy, safe, fair, and respectful of user rights, letting AI developers create a technology that helps as many people as possible while minimizing potential risks.\n\nTransparency in AI refers to being clear and open about how AI systems work, including how decisions are made and what data is used. This transparency fosters trust by making it easier for users to understand AI behaviors, and accountability ensures that there are defined responsibilities for AI system outputs, allowing faults to be identified and corrected. This concept means that AI creators and users are held accountable for any undesirable consequences.\n\nFairness in AI means treating everyone equally and avoiding favoritism for any group. AI algorithms must be free of biases that might lead to unjust treatment. Non-discrimination indicates that AI should not base its choices on biased or unfair factors. Together, these principles make certain that AI systems are reasonable and equitable, treating all humans equally regardless of background.\n\nIn AI, privacy refers to the need to keep personal information confidential and secure and verifying that data is used in ways that respect users' privacy. Data protection entails protecting data from abuse or theft, installing robust security measures to prevent cyberattacks and guaranteeing that it is only used for its intended purposes. These principles promote trust by promising users that their data is handled ethically and securely.\n\nSafety in AI attests that systems do not hurt people, property, or the environment, which requires extensive testing to avoid harmful malfunctions or unexpected incidents. Reliability implies that AI systems continuously perform their intended functions successfully under a variety of contexts, including managing unforeseen events. These principles make certain that AI systems are reliable and pose no threat to users or society.\n\nDespite widespread public concern about AI ethics, many businesses have yet to fully address these issues. A survey conducted by Conversica reported that 86 percent of organizations that have adopted AI agree on the need to have clearly stated guidelines for its appropriate use. However, just 6 percent of companies have guidelines in place to ensure the responsible use of AI. Companies using AI reported that the major issues were lack of transparency, the risk of false information, and the accuracy of data models.\n\nBecause humans created AI, and AI relies on data provided by humans, some human bias will make its way into AI systems. In a very public example, the AI criminal justice tool database COMPAS (Correctional Offender Management Profiling for Alternative Sanctions) tended to discriminate against certain groups.\n\nDesigned to predict a defendant's risk of committing another crime, courts and probation and parole officials used the system to determine appropriate criminal sentences and which offenders were eligible for probation or parole. But ProPublica reported that COMPAS was 45 percent more likely to assign higher risk scores to Black defendants than white defendants. In reality, Black and white defendants reoffend at about the same rate -- 59 percent -- but Black defendants were receiving longer sentences and were less likely to receive probation or parole because of AI bias.\n\nWhile some bias may be inevitable, steps should be taken to mitigate it. Difficult questions remain concerning to what degree bias must be eliminated before an AI can be used to make decisions. Is it sufficient to create an AI system that is less biased than humans, or should we require that the system is closer to having no biases?\n\nOur digital lives mean we leave a trail of data that can be exploited by businesses and governments. Even when done legally, this collection and use of personal data is ethically dubious, and people are often unaware of the extent to which this is going on -- and would likely be troubled by it if they were better informed.\n\nAI exacerbates all these issues by making it easier to collect personal data and use it to manipulate people. In some instances, that manipulation is fairly benign -- such as steering viewers to movies and TV programs that they might like because they have watched something similar -- but the lines get blurrier when the AI is using personal data to manipulate customers into buying products. In other cases, algorithms might be using personal data to sway people's political beliefs or even convince them to believe things that aren't true.\n\nAdditionally, AI facial recognition software makes it possible to gather extensive information about people by scanning photos of them. Governments are wrestling with the question of when people have the right to expect privacy when they are out in public. A few countries have decided that it is acceptable to perform widespread facial recognition, while some others outlaw it in all cases. Most draw the lines somewhere in the middle.\n\nPrivacy and surveillance concerns present obvious ethical challenges for which there is no easy solution. At a minimum, organizations need to make sure that they are complying with all relevant legislation and upholding industry standards. But leaders also need to make sure that they are doing some introspection and considering whether they might be violating people's privacy with their AI tools.\n\nRead our article on the history of artificial intelligence to learn more about the evolution of this dynamic technology.\n\nAI systems often help make important choices that affect people's lives, including hiring, medical, and criminal justice decisions. Because the stakes are so high, people should be able to understand why a particular AI system came to the conclusion that it did. However, the rationale for determinations made by AI is often hidden from the people who are affected.\n\nThe reason for this is that algorithms that AI systems use to make decisions are often kept secret by vendors to protect them from competitors. Also, AI algorithms can sometimes be too complicated for non-experts to easily understand. AI decisions are often not transparent to anyone, not even the people who designed them. Deep learning, in particular, can result in models that only machines can understand.\n\nOrganizational leaders need to ask themselves whether they are comfortable with \"black box\" systems having such a large role in important decisions. Increasingly, the public is growing uncomfortable with opaque AI systems and demanding more transparency. As a result, many organizations are looking for ways to bring more traceability and governance to their artificial intelligence tools.\n\nThe fact that AI systems are capable of acting autonomously raises important liability and accountability issues about who should be held responsible when something goes wrong. For example, this issue arises when autonomous vehicles cause accidents or even deaths.\n\nIn most cases, when a defect causes an accident, the manufacturer is held responsible for the accident and required to pay the appropriate legal penalty. However, in the case of autonomous systems like self-driving cars, legal systems have significant gaps. It is unclear when the manufacturer is to be held responsible in such cases.\n\nSimilar difficulties arise when AI is used to make healthcare recommendations. If the AI makes the wrong recommendation, should its manufacturer be held responsible? Or does the practitioner bear some responsibility for double-checking that the AI is correct? Legislatures and courts are still working out the answers to many questions like these.\n\nSome experts say that AI could someday achieve self-awareness. This could potentially imply that an AI system would have rights and moral standing similar to humans.\n\nThis may seem farfetched, but it's a goal for AI scientists, and at the pace that AI technology is progressing, it is a real possibility. AI has already become able to do things that were once thought impossible.\n\nIf this were to happen, humans could have significant ethical obligations regarding the way they treat AI. Would it be wrong to force an AI to accomplish the tasks that it was designed to do? Would we be obligated to give an AI a choice about whether or how it was going to execute a command? And could we ever potentially be in danger from an AI?\n\nLearn more about how AI is altering software development with AI augmentation.\n\nAI is transforming a number of industries, providing significant benefits while posing ethical challenges in such fields as healthcare, criminal justice, finance, and autonomous vehicles.\n\nIn diagnostic imaging, AI algorithms are used to evaluate medical images for early detection of diseases like cancer. These computers can occasionally outperform human radiologists, but their use can raise ethical concerns about patient privacy, data security, and potentially biased results if the training data is not representative. The ethical considerations include obtaining informed consent for data use, maintaining transparency in AI decision-making, correcting biases in training data, and protecting patient privacy.\n\nCriminal law addresses the most harmful actions in society, minimizing crime and apprehending and punishing perpetrators. AI technologies provide new opportunities to drastically reduce crime and deal with criminals more fairly and efficiently by forecasting where crimes will occur and recording them as they happen. It can also assess the likelihood of reoffending, assisting judges in imposing suitable sentences to keep communication safe.\n\nHowever, the application of AI in criminal justice creates ethical considerations, including bias, privacy infringements, and the need for transparency and accountability in AI-driven decisions. The ethical use of AI factors careful consideration of these concerns as well as strong legal and regulatory structures to prevent misuse.\n\nOne interesting use of ethical AI in finance is loan application evaluation. Financial organizations can use AI to analyze loan applications more comprehensively and fairly. Ethical AI models can assess an applicant's financial health by analyzing a broader set of data points over time, such as payment history, income stability, and spending habits. This technique helps to avoid biases that can develop from standard credit scoring systems which frequently rely on limited data points such as credit scores. By assuring openness and fairness in decision-making, ethical AI can promote financial inclusion and enable fairer access to finance for underrepresented communities.\n\nThe implementation of emergency decision-making algorithms in autonomous vehicles is a compelling use case for ethical AI. These algorithms are intended to handle situations in which a collision is unavoidable and the AI must determine how to minimize damage. For example, if an autonomous vehicle is faced with the choice of hitting a pedestrian lane or swerving and perhaps endangering the passengers, the AI will use ethical frameworks to make the decision.\n\nIn such circumstances, the AI weighs a variety of parameters, including the number of lives at stake, the severity of potential damage, and the possibility of different outcomes. The ethical considerations underlying this decision-making process include reducing harm and guaranteeing fairness.\n\nGovernment regulation and policies on AI ethics range widely, with each region developing distinct strategies based on political, economic, and social contexts. These approaches influence how AI is developed, deployed, and governed with varying priorities such as innovation, ethics, privacy, and security.\n\nChina leads in AI regulation, having implemented guidelines for recommendation algorithms in 2021, deep synthesis content such as deepfakes in 2022, and generative AI including chatbots in 2023. These standards impose transparency, prevent price discrimination, safeguard worker rights, and demand algorithm registration and security assessment. National standards such as the \"Governance Principles for the New Generation Artificial Intelligence\" (2019) and \"Ethical Norms for the New Generation Artificial Intelligence\" (2021) emphasize ethical AI development. China's strategy values information management, transparency, and ethical consideration, influencing AI deployment both domestically and globally.\n\nThe U.S. lacks comprehensive AI legislation and instead relies on sector-specific regulations governing privacy, discrimination, and safety. Several institutions -- notably the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) -- have issued guidelines for AI governance. However, there is a continuing discussion over the need for more centralized AI governance to address the rapid advancements in ethical concerns related to AI technologies.\n\nThe European Union (EU) prioritizes ethical AI development and human rights protection. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) significantly affects how AI systems manage data, requiring transparency and responsibility. In addition, the proposed AI Act seeks to better regulate AI systems by ensuring transparency, accountability, and safety, reaffirming the EU's commitment to ethical AI practices.\n\nCanada's rules and legislation aim to promote AI ethics and transparency. The Canadian AI strategy promotes responsible AI research and development while highlighting ethical considerations. The Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) oversees data privacy in AI applications, requiring that personal information be handled responsibly and transparently.\n\nIn Asia, countries like Japan, South Korea, and Singapore prioritize innovation, research, and collaboration in their AI strategies. While regulations vary amongst these countries, ethical concerns are important to their AI policies. These nations try to strike a balance between innovation and ethical standards to support responsible AI development and deployment.\n\nFrameworks and guidelines for ethical AI provide safety and security for organizations and its users. Many governments have begun to impose ethical standards that must be followed to avoid potential issues.\n\nThe Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers' (IEEE) Global Initiative on Ethics of Autonomous and Intelligent Systems seeks to guarantee that all parties participating in the design and development of autonomous and intelligent systems address ethical considerations. Their purpose is to advance these technologies for the good of humanity using the following approaches:\n\nThe integration of responsible AI practices and corporate responsibility demonstrates how important ethical considerations are for effective AI implementation in business. Adopting a sustainable and ethical strategy is important, not only for moral reasons but also as a strategic imperative in today's technologically driven society. As organizations deploy AI, upholding ethical norms will determine the future of technology and solidify their status as responsible, forward-thinking companies. This commitment helps them to capitalize on AI's promise while positively benefiting society, ensuring technology's role as a force for good.\n\nThe ethical challenges surrounding AI are tremendously difficult and complex, and will not be solved overnight. However, organizations can take several practical steps toward implementing and improving their organization's AI ethics:\n\nAI promises significant improvements in productivity and efficiency, but this full potential can only be realized if organizations are committed to ethical principles. Without rigorous monitoring, AI can undermine trust and accountability. Companies need to develop and adhere to ethical frameworks and guidelines to ensure that ethical best practices are followed to protect customer data, privacy, and company reputations.", "source": {"uri": "eweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "eWEEK"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kathryn_timonera@eweek.com", "name": "Kathryn Timonera", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COMPAS_(software)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "COMPAS (software)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_data", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Personal data"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facial_recognition_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Facial recognition system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparency_(behavior)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Transparency (behavior)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Probation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Algorithm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bias"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ethics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Privacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parole", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Parole"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-driving_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Self-driving car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accountability", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Accountability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Criminal justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision-making", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Decision-making"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberattack", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cyberattack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicular_automation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vehicular automation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Theft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holding_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Holding company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Singapore"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Singapore"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Self-Help", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Self-Help", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Birth_Control", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Birth Control", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 77}], "image": "https://assets.eweek.com/uploads/2024/07/ew_20240731-ai-ethics.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9778318", "eventUri": "eng-9778318", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5450980392156863, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

Credo AI is set to announce a $21 million funding round Tuesday for its work on risk and compliance issues around AI adoption.

Whether deeply entrenched in technology or casually reading the news, you will likely come across headlines and stories about the latest companies and developments in the AI space. These stories talk about all the great things that AI can do locally and globally, for individuals and businesses, as well as the world's anxieties about adopting AI systems in their homes or workplaces.\n\nHowever, what is not talked about as often is who is making money in the AI industry.\n\nGoogle's (NASDAQ: GOOGL) latest earnings call brought this issue to the surface when the company revealed that its Q2 expenditure reached $13 billion, with most of that spending going toward data centers and services that support AI capabilities.\n\nDuring the call, many analysts questioned whether the company's multi-billion dollar investments in AI would turn a profit anytime soon. Google CEO Sundar Pichai said that AI is a long-term investment and that it is better to overinvest in AI now than to underinvest and fall behind. However, it is unclear when Google will begin to profit from its significant investment in AI -- and they aren't the only company in that boat.\n\nOpenAI posted $540 million in losses the year it developed ChatGPT, attributing those losses to the spending required to train and develop GPT. Now, the company is allegedly on track to lose as much as $5 billion due to the costs associated with running the AI products it offers.\n\nThe high cost of AI: OpenAI's financial breakdown\n\nIn OpenAI's case, $4 billion has been earmarked for servers that maintain ChatGPT and the large-language models that power the chatbot. Another $3 billion is needed to cover the cost of training its AI models with new data, and $1.5 billion goes toward operations and the 1,500+ employees OpenAI has on staff.\n\nBoth small and large companies end up spending in these same areas -- data centers, servers, and talent -- when it comes to their AI operations. However, despite the large spending, these companies' revenue is nowhere close to the costs they incur.\n\nFor example, OpenAI is estimated to generate around $3.4 billion in revenue, but that is nowhere near the ~$8.5 billion it spends to make its products possible.\n\nAI industry's biggest winners: How chipmakers and cloud providers benefit from AI spending\n\nSo where does all the money go that these tech giants are spending to get their AI products and infrastructure up and running? It goes to chipmakers, data centers, and cloud service providers. Every company in the AI industry needs at least one of these three items to run the AI arm of their business successfully. Very few companies can produce all of these elements in-house, and even if they can, the technology and bandwidth needed are ever-evolving, requiring the company to invest in the latest tech and infrastructure so they can grow, scale, and provide better products and services.\n\nWhen it comes to chips, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is the dominant player in that industry, with roughly 80% of the market share in the GPU space. AI companies need GPUs to train and run their models, and data centers need to accumulate GPUs so they can train and run AI models on behalf of their customers. This is why chipmakers have been the biggest winners in the AI industry so far.\n\nWhen ChatGPT was released in November 2022, followed by a significant increase in competition in the AI industry, the price of Nvidia shares increased by over 500% in that two-year period. In the last year alone, Nvidia is estimated to have sold $34.5 billion in AI chips.\n\nSimultaneously, data centers/cloud service providers such as AWS experienced significant growth in the sales of their cloud computing services, citing that their clients, especially those with businesses that had generative AI components, were a factor in Amazon's (NASDAQ: AMZN) 17% year-over-year growth in its cloud computing service.\n\nAI industry's profit dilemma: High spending, low returns, and trouble on the horizon\n\nIt's no surprise that infrastructure and ancillary services have been the biggest winners so far from a financial perspective. If a company is not fully vertically integrated, it must rely on third-party hardware, infrastructure, and service providers to deliver its goods or services. Relying on these providers isn't unusual, but what's giving investors in AI product providers concern is that it doesn't look like the companies making these products will turn their big investments and expenditures into profit anytime soon.\n\nNot only are most of the AI ventures of these companies currently not profitable, but the path to profitability remains unclear for many of them. These companies need to aggressively invest to stay competitive, pouring money into better hardware and server space so they can continue to train and run their AI models. Still, these products aren't providing the revenue that exceeds the cost of bringing these products to life.\n\nWhat is likely to make it even more difficult for many of these tech giants, who operate in silos and walled gardens, are the open-source offerings on the market, such as Meta's (NASDAQ: META) Llama 3.1.\n\nIn an industry where many participants are not profitable yet, and the players in that industry are price-sensitive due to the high cost of operating and competing, a household name like Meta offering a high-quality free product (AI model) is likely to suppress prices further and lengthen the amount of time it takes for product providers to become profitable as players in the industry begin opting for Meta's free, high-performing AI model to reduce their own costs and bring themselves closer to profitability.\n\nAll of this begs the question -- is AI in a bubble?\n\nThe AI industry has experienced a meteoric rise in the last two years, and investment dollars have flowed into the space at a rate that does not appear to be sustainable. At the end of the day, investors want a return on their investment, and that return is nowhere in sight for most AI companies.\n\nAI undoubtedly adds value to the world, improving business operations, leading to breakthroughs in math and science, and automating numerous workflows for individuals, freeing up time for them to focus on things that cannot be automated. However, only a few companies drive innovation in this highly saturated industry.\n\nIf these tech giants do not emerge with a clear revenue path in the AI industry, we are likely to see the industry's rapid growth slow down and maybe even deflate to a level that reflects the real value these companies are delivering in the global economy.\n\nIn order for artificial intelligence (AI) to work right within the law and thrive in the face of growing challenges, it needs to integrate an enterprise blockchain system that ensures data input quality and ownership -- allowing it to keep data safe while also guaranteeing the immutability of data.

The EU AI Act sorts artificial intelligence systems into categories based on their risk levels, affecting the degree of regulatory attention each receives.\n\nThese are systems that are considered too dangerous to be allowed. These might involve technologies that manipulate decision-making or profile people in ways that lead to harmful consequences, like unauthorised use of biometric data in public places.\n\nThese require careful oversight due to their profound effects on individual rights and public safety. This group includes AI used in sensitive areas such as healthcare, law enforcement, and employment, where AI decisions have a major impact. Regulations are there to make sure that these systems are transparent and their operations are well-documented to prevent abuses.\n\nRisks that are subject to less stringent regulations, focusing primarily on transparency. Technologies in this category, like chatbots and AI-generated media, need to clearly inform users that they are interacting with AI to prevent deception.\n\nThese are subject to minimal regulatory oversight. These generally safe applications, such as AI in video games or spam filters, have little direct effect on users' rights or safety.\n\nBusinesses need to make sure that their AI systems comply with the Act, and this involves taking a few measures...\n\nIdentifying AI Applications is the first way to go. Companies must review their technologies to see which ones fit the AI definitions under the Act. This includes systems that autonomously analyse data to make decisions or create outputs.\n\nUsing the Compliance Checker is an effective way for businesses to evaluate their AI systems against legal standards. This tool asks pertinent questions about the AI's functionality and usage, helping to highlight any areas of non-compliance.\n\nReviewing Compliance Measures is another one, especially for AI systems identified as high-risk. Businesses must check that these systems have effective risk management and data governance frameworks in place. Maintaining detailed records that demonstrate compliance is also essential.\n\nFinally, Keeping Up-to-Date and Adhering to Local Regulations is so important. Staying up to date with changes and updates, regular consultations with legal experts and participation in relevant forums, are some ways to make sure you're staying compliant with AI regulations.\n\nMore experts have shared their views on the Act and its impact on the different industries:\n\n\"We are in the early stages of the AI journey, and as with every technological advancement, legislation tends to lag behind. The initial steps taken by the EU AI Act are commendable, but we must recognise that the rapid advancements in AI require equally swift and iterative evolution of our laws.\n\n\"Ideally, this should be done through global collaboration, similar to the recent OECD initiative that established a 15% minimum tax bracket.\n\nAs Uncle Ben from 'Spider-Man' famously said, 'With great power comes great responsibility.'\n\nConsequently, laws and regulations must address the following key areas:\n\nPolicy compliance: Implementing and auditing regulations efficiently and seamlessly. The necessity for smooth and efficient processes in this area cannot be overstated.\n\nRisk management: Proactively detecting and mitigating risks, including fairness issues, bias, drift, hallucinations, IP and copyright infringement, jurisdictional requirements, and data privacy regulations. The potential risks in AI are vast, underscoring the complexity of this challenge.\n\nLifecycle governance: Effectively managing, monitoring, and governing AI models throughout their lifespan.\n\nAccessibility and fair competition: Ensuring AI development isn't limited to large corporations and multinationals but remains accessible to a diverse range of entities.\"\n\n\"As the AI Act comes into force, the main business challenges will be uncertainty in its first years. Various institutions, including the AI office, courts, and other regulatory bodies, will need time to adjust their positions and interpret the letter of the law. During this period, businesses will have to operate in a partial unknown, lacking clear answers if the compliance measures, they put in place are solid enough.\n\n\"One business compliance risk that is not being discussed lies in the fact that the AI Act will affect not only firms that directly deal with AI technologies but the wider tech community as well.\n\n\"Currently, the AI Act lays down explicit requirements and limitations that target providers (i.e., developers), deployers (i.e., users), importers, and distributors of artificial intelligence systems and applications. However, some of these provisions might also bring indirect liability to the third parties participating in the AI supply chain, such as data collection companies.\n\n\"Most AI systems today are based on machine learning models that require an abundance of data for training to ensure that the model has an adequate contextual understanding, is not outrightly biased, and does not hallucinate its outputs.\n\n\"Today, AI developers are looking for ways to scrape as much publicly available web data as possible. Although the AI Act does not target data-as-a-service (DaaS) companies and web scraping providers, these firms might indirectly inherit certain ethical and legal obligations.\n\n\"A prime example is web scraping companies based in the EU who will have to ensure they do not supply data to firms developing prohibited AI systems. If a company willingly cooperates with an AI firm that, under EU regulation, is breaking the law, such cooperation might bring legal liability.\n\n\"Moreover, web scraping providers will need to install robust know-your-customer (KYC) procedures to ensure their infrastructure is used ethically and lawfully, ensuring an AI firm is collecting only the data they are allowed to collect, not copyright-protected information.\n\n\"Another broad compliance-related risk that I can foresee comes from the decision to grant some exemptions under the AI Act for systems based on free and open-source licences\n\n\"There is no consolidated, single definition of \"open-source AI\"; and it is unclear how the widely defined open-source model might be applied to AI. This situation has already resulted in companies falsely branding their systems as \"open-source AI\" for marketing purposes. Without clear definitions, even bigger risks will manifest if businesses start abusing the term to win legal exemptions.\n\n\"The AI Act has the potential to establish trust across the industry but may also be detrimental to innovation across the technology industry. Organisations must be on their toes, as they may face penalties in the millions for severe violations involving high-risk AI systems.\"\n\n\"The EU AI Act places human oversight, explainability, and data governance centre stage. This is critical, both in terms of mitigating bias and discrimination in AI outputs and decision making, and also as a cornerstone of public trust.\n\n\"The Global AI Index shows the UK lagging when it comes to its AI 'operating environment' - including the public's opinion on artificial intelligence. There is much work to be done to educate the public on AI and its usage, and further regulation can help build public trust.\n\n\"Transparency and ethics in AI also matter hugely. People should be aware when they're interacting with artificial, not human, intelligence, for example.\n\n\"Abuses like manipulating user preferences or utilising AI for harmful purposes like social mobilisation or creating illegal content must be actively discouraged.\n\nA strong example here is the way companies frequently fall into a data protection blind spot by mistakenly assuming 'personal data' only applies to their customers - leaving employee data dangerously exposed to damaging data breaches.\n\n\"Important employee data, from home addresses, bank account details, IP addresses to even more sensitive details like political opinions or genetic data could potentially be accessed by unauthorised bad actors.\"\n\n\"Today marks the EU AI Act officially coming into force and given its extraterritorial application many UK businesses will be preparing to comply with the new rules in order to continue operations within the EU.\n\n\"As one of the most comprehensive pieces of AI regulation to be passed to date, preparing for compliance is both a step into the unknown as well as an interesting bellwether as to what might be to come in terms of AI-specific regulatory obligations across the globe.\n\n\"With the countdown now starting until the regulation fully applies, there are a number of steps UK businesses should be taking over the next 18 or so months to ensure they are prepared.\n\n\"First, UK businesses should take stock of their AI assets and review what AI systems are operationalised within Europe. Once businesses have a full overview of where their AI assets are and where they are operating, they should move on to qualifying these assets.\n\n\"As a step towards EU AI Act compliance readiness, businesses should extend their understanding of where they are deploying AI systems to the intended purpose of these systems, the technologies used (e.g. generative AI), and where these systems fall in terms of the risk tiering established in the EU AI Act.\n\n\"Determining exposure to future compliance obligations will enable businesses to begin taking action to mitigate the risk of non-compliance and avoid disruptions to business operations whether through fines or pulling operational systems from the market.\"\n\n\"The EU AI Act will significantly impact how AI is used right now within the financial sector but to realise positive impacts, organisations first need to overcome some hurdles. The financial sector is already using AI extensively which is positive, as organisations can explore different applications of AI within their business.\n\n\"However, there are major concerns that the Act may stifle innovation. With the Act in place, it's important we ensure that there is still a level-playing field for global firms to invest in AI and maintain the momentum within the sector.\n\n\"Additionally, the EU AI Act poses some challenging questions relating to what data should be collected and made available to the supply chain. Within this debate, organisations must consider how they can demonstrate transparency in the way data is used to train and inform AI models.\n\n\"For example, where financial institutions are developing additional AI-based creditworthiness processes, which are classified as high-risk AI use cases under the EU AI Act, they will need to not only address heightened requirements but also focus on the communication of privacy and safety to consumers.\n\n\"On the other end of the spectrum, the Act could also make a great positive impact. For instance, it can help firms manage risk in critical areas such as fraud and financial crime, the avoidance of discrimination and in delivering transparency to stakeholders.\n\n\"It can also positively impact the advancement of AI literacy among financial services workers by helping to develop a code of practice. It's important that we have regulation within the industry, and as long as negative impacts are negotiated carefully, the positives will far outweigh them.\"\n\n\"My concern about the EU AI Act is with the 'high' risk category. By saying all high-risk AI systems need to be assessed before going to market, as well as throughout their lifecycle, we create a number of additional hoops for companies in the AI ecosystem to jump through. High-risk AI systems will also be subject to public complaints to national authorities.\n\n\"Regulating AI is no mean feat, and I applaud all global efforts to encourage the governance of AI that will ultimately support public buy-in. But I fear this regulation, in practice, will unintentionally stifle innovation and hinder AI deployment and adoption.\n\n\"Of course we need the correct safeguards in place when dealing with any technology, but by taking an overly stringent approach and applying unnecessary red tape when the AI technology is in its nascent stage we will collectively lose out on the transformational capabilities of AI that has to benefit all corners of society.\n\n\"I have no doubt that other regions will shortly follow in the EU's footsteps, the global impact of this legislation should not be overlooked. I'm also intrigued to see if other regions, particularly the UK, will be bold enough to challenge this regulation in favour of a more pro-innovation approach.\n\n\"I wonder too whether the Act will lead to the creation of low-regulation hotspots where companies will put down roots, thereby creating 'AI hubs'.\"\n\n\"Now that GenAI has broken into the mainstream, businesses across industries are rushing to implement these solutions and get ahead of the competition. However, firms can only implement a GenAI tool if they are sure it is safe and reliable.\n\n\"The EU's AI act adds another layer of complexity for business leaders with concerns about the safety of their models. The majority of GenAI solutions will fall into the first tier of regulation, where organisations must prove that the data the model is grounded in can be relied upon.\n\n\"The impact of the bill is likely to permeate beyond the EU, with other nations and governing bodies sure to follow suit if the legislation is a success. As a result, it's crucial that companies developing GenAI models consider how they can better align with any upcoming regulatory changes.\n\n\"Satisfying the requirements of the EU AI act is dependent upon three key pillars: trust, security, and accuracy. The easiest way to comply with the legislation is by deploying a solution that operates within reliable internal data.\n\n\"A question all companies should ask themselves, is do they trust their data? If so, they can count on the results their GenAI tool produces.\n\n\"Correctly implementing an approach driven by internal data means businesses can act with certainty on their AI outputs, improving productivity by equipping knowledge workers with tools to quickly search for, access and analyse the information they need.\n\n\"When a model is given time to adapt to the data it is built upon and learn more about the requirements of the individual employees it services, it will grow in intelligence and intuition and further support the needs of its users.\n\n\"Trust, security, and accuracy are all intrinsically linked, and companies looking to embed a GenAI strategy that complies with the EU AI act should begin by organising data across all operations.\n\n\"In doing so, they can lay the foundation for a GenAI tool that protects their customers while delivering vital work automation that will increase efficiency and streamline processes for employees.\"\n\n\"With nearly 80% of UK adults now believing AI needs to be heavily regulated, the introduction of the EU's AI Act is something that businesses have been long-waiting for. We know that AI is shaping the future, but companies will only be able to reap the rewards if they have the confidence to rethink existing processes and break away from entrenched structures.\n\n\"Like any new technology, AI could potentially cause more problems, faster if used in the wrong way. While the EU Act isn't perfect, and needs to be assessed in relation to other global regulation, having a clear framework and guidance on AI from one of the world's major economies will help encourage those who remain on the fence to tap into the AI revolution, ensuring it has a safe, positive ongoing influence for all organisations operating across the EU, which can only be a promising step forwards for the industry.\"\n\n\"Looking at the EU AI Act, I am immediately reminded of NIS2. They are very much alike. And that actually makes sense, because as always, laws are running behind on technological developments.\n\n\"Even though the law provides some guidelines, it is mostly about classifying AI models based on the risk they pose. Which means that a lot of the legislation will require an explanation of terms that are not very well known in the judiciary system.\n\nFor example, systems considered a threat to people will be banned. This may seem like a clear directive to follow, but it is immediately obfuscated by examples that talk about privacy, discrimination, and the use of biometrics, as there are many cases where exceptions for law enforcement exist in these areas.\n\n\"Many of the guidelines are based on old-fashioned product safety regulations which are hard to translate into regulations for something that's evolving. A screwdriver does not turn into a chainsaw overnight, whereas a friendly AI-driven chatbot turned into a bad-tempered racist in just a few hours.\n\n\"Meaning it is hard to judge a book by its cover, or in this case even by the early versions. And that's fine when we're talking about AI models that are specifically designed for one goal. But the much more general-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) are a lot harder to classify, let alone the open-source models that can be adapted by users to fit their own purposes.\n\nPersonally, I think it's good that legislators have thought about the issue, as it provides law enforcement with some tools to keep it under control, but it will always be subject to changes that develop along with the new trends and features that become available.\"\n\n\"The greatest problem facing AI developers is not regulation, but a lack of trust in AI. For an AI system to reach its full potential, it needs to be trusted by the people who use it. Internally, we have worked hard to build this trust using rigorous testing regimes, continuous monitoring of live systems, and thorough knowledge-sharing sessions with end users to ensure they understand where, when, and to what extent each system can be trusted.\n\n\"Externally, though, I see regulatory frameworks like the EU AI Act as an essential component to building trust in AI. The strict rules and punishing fines will deter careless developers and help customers feel more confident in trusting and using AI systems.\n\n\"The Act itself is mostly concerned with regulating high-risk systems and foundational models. However, many of the requirements already align with data science best practices, such as risk management, testing procedures, and thorough documentation. Ensuring that all AI developers adhere to these standards is to everyone's benefit.\n\n\"Similar to GDPR, any UK business that sells into the EU market will need to concern themselves with the EU AI Act. However, even those that don't can't ignore it. Certain parts of the AI Act, particularly those in relation to AI as a safety component in consumer goods, might also apply in Northern Ireland automatically as a consequence of the Windsor Framework.\n\n\"The UK government is moving to regulate AI as well, and a whitepaper released by the government last month highlighted the importance of interoperability with EU (and US) AI regulation. UK companies aligning themselves to the EU AI Act will not only maintain access to the EU market, but hopefully get ahead of the curve for the upcoming UK regulation.\n\n\"From software licensing to data privacy regulations, UK businesses are already used to having to deal with EU regulatory frameworks. Many of the obligations laid out in the act are simply data science best practices and things companies should already be doing. There are some additional obligations around registration and certification, which will probably lead to some friction.\n\n\"Small companies and start-ups will experience issues more strongly; the regulation acknowledges this and has included provisions for sandboxes to foster AI innovation for these smaller businesses. However, these sandboxes are to be set up on the national level by individual member states, and so UK businesses may not have access.\"\n\n\"The EU AI Act is a historic piece of legislation for responsible AI regulation, balancing the prevention of harmful AI use with clear guidelines for acceptable applications.\n\n\"Indeed, there is such a breadth of AI technology and varying applications of Large Language Models - from general purpose chatbots to highly specialised domain-specific AI. A one-size-fits-all approach to AI regulation risks being rigid, and given the pace of AI development, quickly outdated.\n\n\"With the passing of the Act, all eyes are now on the new Labour government to signpost the UK's intentions for regulation in this crucial sector. Implementing a flexible, adaptive regulatory system will be key, and this involves close collaboration with leading AI companies of all sizes.\n\n\"Only by striking the right balance between innovation, regulation and collaboration can the UK maintain its long heritage of technological brilliance and achieve the type of AI-driven growth that the Labour Party is promising.\"", "source": {"uri": "techround.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "TechRound"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Web scraping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision-making", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Decision-making"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_governance", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Data governance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparency_(behavior)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Transparency (behavior)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Open-source software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Risk management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bias"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ethics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallucination", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hallucination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indirect_liability", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indirect liability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OECD", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "OECD"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_collection", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Data collection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_filtering", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Email filtering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deception", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Deception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_property", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Intellectual property"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supply chain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Machine learning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multinational_corporation", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Multinational corporation"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Labour Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Government of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Economic_Area", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "European Economic Area"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Whistleblowing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Whistleblowing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://techround.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Header-Images-4.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9778318", "eventUri": "eng-9778318", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

It emphasises and shares foundational learnings and value, especially to those companies wanting to benchmark their own trajectory against the wider industry.\n\nIn its conclusion, the report also notes the transformative impact AI can have across the entire advertising value chain - from strategy and ideation to production, media execution, and regulatory compliance. It notes that: \"By thoughtfully combining human and AI, as a form of co-intelligence, we can reshape what is possible in creativity, business impact, and social good.\"\n\nBeyond the report, taskforce members have expressed an interest in bringing together thought leadership on the impact of AI on the advertising industry, public attitudes to AI, and addressing the skills gap.\n\nRelated

Here's How.", "body": "Artificial intelligence (AI) promises to join the list of technology game-changers -- from the telephone all the way back in the 1870s to, much more recently, the Internet. This is because AI has wide-reaching potential to save companies and individuals time and money. This hot technology could help companies gain in efficiency and in some cases develop a product that may transform lives -- such as a better-performing medical device or drug.\n\nAnalysts predict that today's $200 billion AI market could roar higher in the coming years and reach beyond $1 trillion by the end of the decade. It's no surprise, then, to see AI giants such as Nvidia or Super Micro Computer soaring to record levels and generating billions of dollars in revenue. Nvidia dominates the AI chip market, while Super Micro sells the servers and full rack scale systems used in AI data centers.\n\nAnd it's also no surprise to see investors piling into AI stocks and winning big. But, in recent times, some economists have started to warn about a market bubble set to burst. And certain analysts question AI's transformative potential, calling into question the future of this technology. If these experts are right, a portfolio heavily exposed to AI stocks may greatly suffer in the near term or down the road. But this doesn't mean you shouldn't invest in this area, which still may deliver significant growth. Here's how to build a portfolio that could soar in an AI boom and withstand an AI crash...\n\nFirst, though, a quick look at two different perspectives on AI, and we can find them both at Goldman Sachs. Senior global economist Joseph Briggs predicts generative AI will automate 25% of work tasks and become more cost effective over time. But head of global equity research Jim Covello says AI is too costly to become a disruptive technology -- even over time -- and questions the ability of AI to eventually boost a company's revenue.\n\nRight now, it's too early to say which prediction will become a reality. It's possible that both Goldman experts will be right on some points -- and AI will be successful to a certain degree but won't reach the market's expectations. All of this means it's also impossible to predict with 100% accuracy the path of AI stocks down the road. They could soar, offer decent gains, or crash at a particular point.\n\nNow here's how to construct a portfolio that will help you navigate these uncertain waters and potentially sail on to an investment victory over time.\n\nBefore all else, it's important to consider your comfort with risk. If you're very cautious and the thought of a crash keeps you up at night, you'll want to limit your AI exposure to a small portion of your portfolio (and fill the rest with a broad range of quality companies, with a focus on safer investments such as healthcare stocks and dividend stocks.) And when investing in AI, you should favor companies that built a solid business prior to the emergence of this technology and don't rely heavily on it for their revenues.\n\nAmazon's AI successes\n\nA good example is Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN). This e-commerce and cloud computing powerhouse has invested heavily in AI, and this is already bearing some fruit. Amazon has been using AI to speed up its fulfillment process, and this has helped the company lower its cost to serve. In the area of cloud, Amazon Web Services (AWS) has reached a $100 billion annual revenue run rate thanks to the broad range of AI services it offers to customers.\n\nBut if AI turns out to be less of a game-changer than expected, Amazon still should continue generating growth over time through its e-commerce and cloud businesses.\n\nAnother potential investment for the cautious investor is an AI exchange-traded fund such as the Roundhill Generative AI & Technology ETF (NYSEMKT: CHAT). This ETF invests in more than 50 companies involved in AI, offering you exposure to many AI players -- so one small investment offers you multiple chances to win, and you don't have to do the heavy lifting of selecting each individual stock.\n\nMiddle-of-the road and aggressive investors\n\nIf you're a middle-of-the-road investor, comfortable with some risk and looking for growth, you might invest in tech giants with broad businesses like Amazon, but it's also a great idea to add a couple of AI market leaders to your portfolio, such as Nvidia and Super Micro. And if you're an aggressive investor, you may add these leaders and bet on players in a new potential area of AI growth too, such as AI software.\n\nOf course, even if you're an aggressive investor, you'll want to make sure you diversify your portfolio enough so that if you're highly focused AI bets crash, other stocks may compensate. You can do this by selecting strong stocks across other industries such as healthcare and consumer goods -- and even some dividend-paying stocks to offer you passive income.\n\nOn top of this, to ensure your portfolio scores a win for you, remember not to panic during a downturn, and if your stocks' long-term prospects look bright, hold on to them. Crashes happen, but history shows us the market has always gone on to gain. This means that, whether the AI boom lasts or not, a well-though-out portfolio could off you top returns over the long term.\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Amazon wasn't one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you'd have $635,614!*\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

It concludes with a 12 point checklist for responsible AI adoption, which encompasses key priorities around transparency, compliance and ethics.\n\nAlex Dalman, managing partner and head of social & innovation, VCCP London, said, \"In 2023 VCCP launched its generative AI agency, faith, based on the founding principle that we have faith that AI, used responsibly, will be an unparallelled accelerator of human creativity and imagination. We hope our work with the Advertising Association's AI Taskforce and this report will help with a more widespread and responsible adoption of AI - and hopefully inspire others embarking on their AI journey.\"\n\nYves Schwarzbart, advertising industry relations manager, Google EMEA, said, \"Advertising as a whole has not only been an early adopter of many of the advances made by AI, but also been a clear leader in applying the technology. Generative AI's ability to let everyone tap into its hugely promising creative potential has perhaps been its most dramatic impact on the advertising industry to date and this report highlights some great work in this space.\"\n\nWith over 15 contributors from across the advertising industry, the new report provides a clear picture of the challenges and opportunities AI brings and how these are being addressed. Given the fast-moving nature of AI, this report is a snapshot in time of industry developments. It emphasises and shares foundational learnings and value, especially to those companies wanting to benchmark their own trajectory against the wider industry.\n\nIn its conclusion, the report also notes the transformative impact AI can have across the entire advertising value chain - from strategy and ideation to production, media execution, and regulatory compliance. It notes that: \"By thoughtfully combining human and AI, as a form of co-intelligence, we can reshape what is possible in creativity, business impact, and social good.\"\n\nBeyond the report, Taskforce members have expressed an interest in bringing together thought leadership on the impact of AI on the advertising industry, public attitudes to AI, and addressing the skills gap.", "source": {"uri": "lbbonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "lbbonline.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_study", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Case study"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chime_Communications_Limited", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chime Communications Limited"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ethics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Action game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FIFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oxygen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonald's", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "McDonald's"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belvita", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Belvita"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Advertising industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industry_self-regulation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Industry self-regulation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Advertising campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparency_(behavior)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Transparency (behavior)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_social_responsibility", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Corporate social responsibility"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Public policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sustainability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nazi Germany"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_planning", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Strategic planning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideation_(creative_process)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ideation (creative process)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benchmarking", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Benchmarking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_good", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Common good"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/In_Daily_Life", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/In Daily Life", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 60}], "image": "https://d3bzyjrsc4233l.cloudfront.net/news/Advertising_Association_opfoiiz.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9778318", "eventUri": "eng-9778318", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2862745098039217, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

Here's How.", "body": "Artificial intelligence (AI) promises to join the list of technology game-changers -- from the telephone all the way back in the 1870s to, much more recently, the Internet. This is because AI has wide-reaching potential to save companies and individuals time and money. This hot technology could help companies gain in efficiency and in some cases develop a product that may transform lives -- such as a better-performing medical device or drug.\n\nAnalysts predict that today's $200 billion AI market could roar higher in the coming years and reach beyond $1 trillion by the end of the decade. It's no surprise, then, to see AI giants such as Nvidia or Super Micro Computer soaring to record levels and generating billions of dollars in revenue. Nvidia dominates the AI chip market, while Super Micro sells the servers and full rack scale systems used in AI data centers.\n\nAnd it's also no surprise to see investors piling into AI stocks and winning big. But, in recent times, some economists have started to warn about a market bubble set to burst. And certain analysts question AI's transformative potential, calling into question the future of this technology. If these experts are right, a portfolio heavily exposed to AI stocks may greatly suffer in the near term or down the road. But this doesn't mean you shouldn't invest in this area, which still may deliver significant growth. Here's how to build a portfolio that could soar in an AI boom and withstand an AI crash...\n\nFirst, though, a quick look at two different perspectives on AI, and we can find them both at Goldman Sachs. Senior global economist Joseph Briggs predicts generative AI will automate 25% of work tasks and become more cost effective over time. But head of global equity research Jim Covello says AI is too costly to become a disruptive technology -- even over time -- and questions the ability of AI to eventually boost a company's revenue.\n\nRight now, it's too early to say which prediction will become a reality. It's possible that both Goldman experts will be right on some points -- and AI will be successful to a certain degree but won't reach the market's expectations. All of this means it's also impossible to predict with 100% accuracy the path of AI stocks down the road. They could soar, offer decent gains, or crash at a particular point.\n\nNow here's how to construct a portfolio that will help you navigate these uncertain waters and potentially sail on to an investment victory over time.\n\nBefore all else, it's important to consider your comfort with risk. If you're very cautious and the thought of a crash keeps you up at night, you'll want to limit your AI exposure to a small portion of your portfolio (and fill the rest with a broad range of quality companies, with a focus on safer investments such as healthcare stocks and dividend stocks.) And when investing in AI, you should favor companies that built a solid business prior to the emergence of this technology and don't rely heavily on it for their revenues.\n\nA good example is Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN). This e-commerce and cloud computing powerhouse has invested heavily in AI, and this is already bearing some fruit. Amazon has been using AI to speed up its fulfillment process, and this has helped the company lower its cost to serve. In the area of cloud, Amazon Web Services (AWS) has reached a $100 billion annual revenue run rate thanks to the broad range of AI services it offers to customers.\n\nBut if AI turns out to be less of a game-changer than expected, Amazon still should continue generating growth over time through its e-commerce and cloud businesses.\n\nAnother potential investment for the cautious investor is an AI exchange-traded fund such as the Roundhill Generative AI & Technology ETF (NYSEMKT: CHAT). This ETF invests in more than 50 companies involved in AI, offering you exposure to many AI players -- so one small investment offers you multiple chances to win, and you don't have to do the heavy lifting of selecting each individual stock.\n\nIf you're a middle-of-the-road investor, comfortable with some risk and looking for growth, you might invest in tech giants with broad businesses like Amazon, but it's also a great idea to add a couple of AI market leaders to your portfolio, such as Nvidia and Super Micro. And if you're an aggressive investor, you may add these leaders and bet on players in a new potential area of AI growth too, such as AI software.\n\nOf course, even if you're an aggressive investor, you'll want to make sure you diversify your portfolio enough so that if you're highly focused AI bets crash, other stocks may compensate. You can do this by selecting strong stocks across other industries such as healthcare and consumer goods -- and even some dividend-paying stocks to offer you passive income.\n\nOn top of this, to ensure your portfolio scores a win for you, remember not to panic during a downturn, and if your stocks' long-term prospects look bright, hold on to them. Crashes happen, but history shows us the market has always gone on to gain. This means that, whether the AI boom lasts or not, a well-though-out portfolio could off you top returns over the long term.\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Amazon wasn't one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you'd have $635,614!*\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

That includes those that manipulate a user's decision-making or expand facial recognition databases through internet scraping.\n\nOther AI systems that are determined high-risk, like AIs that collect biometrics and AI used for critical infrastructure or employment decisions, will have the strictest regulations to follow.\n\nThese companies will have to show their AI training datasets and provide proof of human oversight among other requirements.\n\nAbout 85 per cent of AI companies fall under the third category of \"minimal risk\" with very little regulation required, according to Thomas Regnier, a spokesperson for the European Commission.\n\nBetween 3-6 months for companies to comply\n\nHeather Dawe, head of responsible AI at the consulting firm UST, is already working with international clients to bring their AI use in line with the new act.\n\nDawe's international clients are \"okay\" with the law's new requirements because there's a recognition that AI regulation is necessary.\n\nShe said it could take between three to six months depending on the company's size and how much AI plays a role in their workflow to get them into compliance with the new law.\n\n\"There's a clear set of guidelines about what you have to do,\" Dawe said. \"Any complications are due to not starting the process fast enough.\"\n\nCompanies could consider putting in place internal AI governance boards, Dawe continued, with legal, tech and security experts to do a full audit of what technologies are being used and how they need to adhere to the new law.\n\nIf a company is found not in compliance with the AI Act by the various deadlines, they could face a fine of up to seven per cent of their global annual turnover, Regnier with the Commission said.\n\nHow the Commission is preparing\n\nThe Commission's AI Office will supervise how the rules for general-purpose AI models are being followed.\n\nSixty internal Commission staff will be redirected to this office and 80 more external candidates will be hired in the next year, Regnier said.\n\nAn AI Board made up of high-level delegates from all 27 EU member states \"set the groundwork\" for the Act's implementation in their first June meeting, according to a press release.\n\nThe board will work with the AI office to make sure that the application of the act is harmonised across the EU, Regnier added.\n\nOver 700 companies say they will sign on to an AI Pact: a commitment to comply early with the law.\n\nEU states have until next August to put in place national competent authorities that will oversee the application of the rules in their country.\n\nThe Commission is also preparing to rev up its AI investments, with a \u20ac1 billion injection in 2024 and up to \u20ac20 billion by 2030.\n\n\"What you hear everywhere is that what the EU does is purely regulation (...) and that this will block innovation. This is not correct,\" Regnier said. \"The legislation is not there to push companies back from launching their systems - it's the opposite.\n\n\"We want them to operate in the EU but want to protect our citizens and protect our businesses.\"\n\nFor the Commission, one of the main challenges is regulating future AI technologies, Regnier said, but he believes the risk-based system means they can quickly regulate any new systems.\n\nMore revisions needed\n\nRisto Uuk, the EU Research Lead at the Future of Life Institute, believes there is still some clarification that the European Commission needs to give about how risky specific technologies are.\n\nFor example, Uuk said using a drone to take photos around a water supply that needs repairs \"doesn't seem super risky,\" despite falling into the legislation's high-risk category.\n\n\"When you read it right now, it's quite general,\" Uuk said. \"We have this guidance on a more general level and that is helpful, because companies can then ask the question about whether a specific system is high risk.\"\n\nUuk believes that, as the implementation gets underway, the Commission will be able to give more specific feedback.\n\nWhere the act could go further, according to Uuk, is giving more restrictions and bigger fines to the Big Tech companies that are operating generative AI (GenAI) in the EU.\n\nMajor AI companies like OpenAI and DeepMind are considered \"general-use AI\" and are in the minimal risk category.\n\nCompanies developing general-use AI need to prove how they are complying with copyright laws, publish a training data summary and prove how they're protecting cybersecurity.\n\nOther areas to improve is on human rights, according to European Digital Rights, a collective of NGOs.\n\n\"We regret that the final Act contains several big loopholes for biometrics, policing and national security, and we call on lawmakers to close these gaps,\" a spokesperson said in a statement provided to Euronews Next.", "source":

Within the next five years, 41% of executives anticipate a complete overhaul of business processes, rebuilding them from scratch with AI at the core, according to a recent report by Microsoft and LinkedIn.\n\nA significant portion (42%) foresee the need to train and develop teams of AI-powered bots, as well as ensure the responsible and ethical implementation of AI (47%).\n\nBusinesses across diverse sectors, like healthcare, finance, marketing, e-commerce and manufacturing, are increasingly adopting AI technologies to drive innovation, increase productivity, automate tasks and gain insights from big data.\n\nHowever, more than half of the business leaders surveyed (55%) expressed worry about their ability to find sufficient talent to fill positions within the next year. Employers have aggressively sought out technical AI talent, resulting in a 323% increase in hiring over the past eight years. They are also expanding their search, looking to acquire non-technical talent that possesses AI skills.\n\nAn aptitude for AI is becoming increasingly essential for workers to stay competitive and relevant in a rapidly transforming job market. The high demand for AI professionals, coupled with a shortage of qualified talent, is making AI expertise a valuable asset and can even enhance your career prospects.\n\n\"Learning basic AI skills -- such as prompt engineering, machine learning or data literacy -- is the best insurance to shortcut your competitiveness against people who might have more experience,\" Aneesh Raman, the chief economic opportunity officer at LinkedIn, told CNBC Make It.\n\nThe 2024 Work Trend Index Annual Report by Microsoft and LinkedIn indicates that AI skills may become as important as job experience in the hiring process.\n\nThe research shows that the majority of business leaders (66%) will not consider hiring a candidate who does not possess AI skills. In fact, 71% of executives say they prefer to hire a candidate with AI skills, even if they have less experience, over a more experienced candidate who lacks an aptitude for AI.\n\nWithin the past year, job board site Indeed noted a \"tenfold increase\" in job postings related to generative AI. From April 2022 to April 2024, the platform witnessed an astonishing 75-fold surge in these job listings, Fast Company reported. In the United States, AI-related positions make up about 2% of all postings.\n\nFor workers, this demand may lead to increased salaries in a sector where the average pay is already considerably higher than in many other professions. A survey by Biz Report revealed that AI-related roles offer compensation that exceed those in other fields by more than 77%.\n\nAdditionally, while core software engineering skills will always be valuable, AI adds a new dimension. Therefore, just having coding skills may not be enough to compete in the evolving tech landscape.\n\nWorkers are urgently trying to retrain and acquire AI skills as companies are assessing their hiring needs and rapidly shifting their focus. The competition and urgency for AI skills is being driven by workers' fears that their jobs could become obsolete if they don't gain expertise in this game-changing technology.\n\nPeople are taking courses, adding AI buzzwords to their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s and competing fiercely for the AI job openings available. Seventy-six percent of workers recognize that they need AI skills to stand out in today's labor market. Moreover, 69% of individuals believe that AI can accelerate their chances of promotion, while an even larger percentage (79%) assert that possessing AI skills will expand their job prospects.\n\nThe number of non-technical professionals utilizing LinkedIn Learning courses aimed at enhancing AI skills has surged by 160%, particularly among roles such as project managers, architects and administrative assistants who are eager to improve their AI aptitude.\n\nData shows a 142x increase in LinkedIn members adding AI skills, like ChatGPT and Copilot, to their profiles in the past year, as they try to make career pivots into AI.\n\nWhile employers look to fill their AI-related positions, job seekers are up for the challenge.

It opened the door to leveraging generative AI into various applications for individuals and organizations. Nevertheless, as with everything in technology, this comes with a cost: security.\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) technologies have introduced radical changes to how different business tasks are performed, enhancing efficiency and cost-effectiveness. However, on the dark side, this technology can be used to facilitate executing various types of cyberattacks against anything dependent on digital technology, and critical infrastructure is the most prominent example.\n\nIn April 2024, the U.S. government's cybersecurity agency (CISA) issued official guidelines to enforce critical infrastructure safety and security against AI-related threats. This article will cover the main points mentioned in this guide. However, before we start, let's discuss some examples of how AI technologies can be leveraged in the context of cybersecurity, according to the new CISA guidelines.\n\nCISA is grouping AI risks against critical infrastructure into three main types:\n\nIn this type, adversaries leverage AI technology to execute attacks against critical infrastructure. AI could be used to directly execute the attack, plan it, or enhance its effectiveness. Here are some examples:\n\nThese attacks are executed directly against the AI systems that power or manage critical infrastructure, like power grids, water supply facilities, or transportation systems. It is worth noting that these attacks may not always be a direct assault on the AI system itself, as they could target the datasets used to train the AI system or against the input system used to feed information into AI.\n\nThe primary attacks targeting AI systems include:\n\nData poisoning attacks\n\nData poisoning attacks aim to manipulate the training datasets used to train AI and ML models. Attackers aim to affect the output of these systems, leading them to produce biased or incorrect results. When it comes to critical infrastructure, such as water supply facilities, a data poisoning attack could have severe consequences for millions.\n\nFor example, consider a water supply facility powered by an AI system that balances the amount and volume of chemical ingredients needed to clean the water. A misconfiguration in the AI system, caused by data poisoning, could result in unsafe chemical levels, which will result in poisoning the water supplies of millions of people.\n\nEvasion attacks\n\nIn an evasion attack, adversaries feed malicious samples to confuse the AI system classifier to affect its performance. In the context of critical infrastructure, this means attackers use sophisticated methods to surpass defenses that rely on AI for detecting threats. As a result, malicious activities can get past defenses without being noticed.\n\nFor example, a power plant uses an industrial control system (ICS) to manage its operations. This ICS is protected by an AI-powered antivirus program designed to detect and block malware. Threat actors use advanced malware created using AI technology to change its behavior and signature according to the target environment to prevent the AI-powered antivirus tool from detecting it.\n\nInterruption of service attack\n\nThese attacks are designed to disrupt the normal functioning of AI systems responsible for critical infrastructure operations. The goal of these attacks is to render the AI systems nonfunctional. This will leave the infrastructure unprotected and vulnerable to other types of attacks. This disruption can be executed via various methods, including:\n\nThis refers to any weaknesses or flaws in any phase of the AI system development and deployment process, which includes planning, structure, implementation, or execution. Any deficiencies in any of these phases can hinder the AI system's effectiveness, reliability, and security, making it susceptible to numerous cyberthreats.\n\nThese vulnerabilities can appear in various ways. For instance, failure to consider potential attack vectors (such as input injection) during the planning phase can expose the AI system. In the structure phase, insecure design patterns might introduce weaknesses. In the implementation phase, any flaws in coding, using outdated libraries, or insufficient input validation will introduce security gaps. Finally, in the execution phase, misconfigurations or improper access controls can allow unauthorized access to the AI system and, consequently, to the underlying systems it manages or protects.\n\nAccording to the CISA guidelines, the AI risk management framework is composed of the following four functions:\n\nGovern: Establish an organizational culture of AI risk management\n\nCritical infrastructure owners and operators should create policies, business processes, and procedures that can predict, address, and manage the various benefits and risks of leveraging AI technology throughout its entire lifecycle. This ensures security is inherent, beginning from the design phase and ending with the deployment and usage of the AI system.\n\nDifferent tasks are required to foster a culture of AI risk management in critical infrastructure. Here are the most prominent ones:\n\nMap: Understand your individual AI use context and risk profile\n\nThe guidelines in this section point to the fundamental concepts that critical infrastructure owners and operators can use to understand the context of AI risks in their organizations. For instance, to tackle AI risks in critical infrastructure, we must delve into AI deployment specifics. We can ask these questions to understand our current organization context:\n\nHow: Is the AI making decisions or just processing data we feed into it?\n\nWhere: What is the criticality of the infrastructure it is operating in? For example, is the AI system responsible for managing a nuclear facility or an anti-spam solution?\n\nWhy: What is the purpose of using AI here? For example, is it for management, processing data, or facilitating user communication?\n\nMeasure: Develop systems to assess, analyze, and track AI risks\n\nThe guidelines in this section help critical infrastructure owners and operators create robust ways to assess AI risks throughout the life of the AI system. They can make informed decisions about how AI systems will behave under different conditions by developing their own testing, evaluation, verification, and validation (TEVV) processes.\n\nFor example, a water treatment facility might execute regular simulations to test its AI system decision-making under various scenarios, such as how it will behave under a distributed denial of service attack (DDoS).\n\nManage: Prioritize and act upon AI risks to safety and security\n\nThe guidelines in this section list the key controls and practices for effectively managing AI systems in critical infrastructure. It focuses on maximizing benefits while minimizing safety and security risks. To manage AI risks effectively, organizations need to consistently dedicate resources and apply mitigations based on their established work processes.\n\nFor example, an intelligent city traffic management system powered by AI technology might implement regular software updates to patch vulnerabilities, perform regular audits of AI decision-making processes, and maintain human oversight for critical decisions -- such as preventing traffic on some roads in emergency conditions.\n\nThe guidelines in the CISA document should not be viewed as mere recommendations for tackling AI risks that could mess with critical infrastructure safety and security. Critical infrastructure owners and operators need to see this as a set of mandatory procedures or a roadmap to secure their AI systems and mitigate the different types of cyberthreats they may face.", "source": {"uri": "blog.barracuda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Journey Notes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybersecurity_and_Infrastructure_Security_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_infrastructure", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Critical infrastructure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Computer security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_supply", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Water supply"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_control_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Industrial control system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberattack", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cyberattack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Generative model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_grid", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electrical grid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Risk management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Machine learning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malware", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Malware"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lever", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antivirus_software", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Antivirus software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Information technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threat_actor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Threat actor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vector space"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_classification", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Statistical classification"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Safety_Engineering", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Safety Engineering", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Intrusion_Detection_Systems", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Intrusion Detection Systems", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Honeypots_and_Honeynets", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Honeypots and Honeynets", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Companies", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Companies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://blog.barracuda.com/content/dam/barracuda-blog/images/2024/07/cisa-critical-infrastructure.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9778318", "eventUri": "eng-9778318", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

AI research scientists advance AI technology by conducting academic research at both a practical and theoretical level. They pioneer new techniques, develop new technologies, design experiments, test models, and publish their research. This process of rigorous scientific research pushes the bounds of what was previously thought to be possible. Since they operate at the cutting edge of the field, AI research scientists usually have a PhD in AI, computer science, or a related field and have prior experience conducting research. Between 2022 and 2032 the US Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts that the employment of AI and other computer science researchers will grow by 23%.\n\nWithout question, artificial intelligence is the hottest technology of the moment.\n\nAccording to the market researchers at Gartner, spending on AI software is growing 19.1% per year and will likely hit $297.9 billion by 2027. Statista takes an even rosier view, predicting that the market will climb from $184.04 billion in 2024 to $415.61 billion in 2027 and a whopping $826.73 billion in 2030.\n\nThe primary reason for this dramatic growth? The rise in generative AI.\n\nAccording to Forrester, generative AI is growing even faster than AI as a whole -- 36% per year. By 2030, more than half (55%) of the AI market will be related to GenAI. In fact, that prediction might even be low, given that more than 90% of decision makers already have plans to deploy GenAI.\n\n\"GenAI isn't a fleeting trend. Its capacity to generate entirely new content, across various mediums, such as images, videos, code, and marketing materials, promises substantial efficiency gains and paves the way for innovative creative opportunities, granting a competitive advantage,\" says IDC's Vinayaka Venkatesh. \"A significant portion of organizations have either already adopted Generative AI or are in the initial stages of experimenting with models.\"\n\nBut to do that experimenting, companies need professionals with AI expertise.\n\nNot surprisingly, AI hiring is skyrocketing. At the time of writing, Indeed.com had listings for 14,188 AI jobs. And pay is also on the rise as organizations compete for the best talent.\n\nWhere is the competition the fiercest?\n\nThe following slides highlight 10 roles with plenty of jobs available and high salaries.

In what feels like a flash, tools of all kinds, from Google's search function to Firefly in Adobe, have embedded some type of AI. But as more images touched by AI, in which a person has a suspicious amount of fingers, for example, appear on social media, tech giants are setting up some guardrails before things get too out of control.\n\nMarketers, however, are more hesitant to see \"Made with AI\" labels slapped across their creative campaigns. Mostly because that label paints with too broad of a brush, executives say, as it labels content generated by AI or in which AI tools were used during the creation process in the same way -- despite the fact that those are two different things.\n\n\"Because at the end of the day, with the brand clients, what they care about is the perception of the brand and the implications to brand perception,\" said Cristina Lawrence, evp of consumer and content experience at Razorfish. \"It's a perception worry.\"\n\nAnd, perhaps, rightfully so. Generative AI-based images have a reputation of quantity over quality, due to those notable examples of AI-generated images where people who look human have too many fingers, misplaced ligaments or an excessive amount of teeth. Ultimately, per Lawrence, marketers are apprehensive about AI labels implying that content is inauthentic or misleading.\n\nIt's not that marketers don't see the value in labeling AI as such, but there's a negative perception around AI-generated images, and brands don't want to be associated with AI in that way, Lawrence said. AI labels as they currently exist imply that an entire image was generated solely through AI, as opposed to something created with human oversight using AI-powered tools.\n\nNotably, the AI hype cycle has hit a rough patch. The latest wave of marketing for AI isn't landing with people as some had expected it to. The most recent example is the Olympics-themed ad for Google's Gemini AI chatbot, in which Google's Gemini chatbot is tasked with generating a letter from a young athlete to American Olympic track star Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone. The ad didn't go over well, and sparked criticism about Big Tech replacing a child's creativity with AI-generated text.\n\nAcross the industry, momentum has been building behind better labeling and identifying AI-generated or altered content and putting safeguards in place to mitigate and prevent AI fraud. In an effort to set industry standards, some companies have teamed up through the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA), which was founded in 2021 to certify online media's provenance (or, to put it in plain terms, how an image came to be and traveled online). Tech giants like Microsoft, Intel, Sony and Adobe are current members of the group, which also includes camera companies, media firms and holding companies like Publicis Groupe.\n\nLast October, Adobe debuted a new \"Content Credentials\" icon in an effort to improve transparency around videos and images that were either created or edited using AI. In February, Meta made a similar announcement, rolling out \"AI Info\" content labels so users know AI was used to either generate or alter content.\n\nIt's a valiant effort, but it could cause ripple effects in the industry's approach to labeling AI content, said Elav Horwitz, evp and global head of applied innovation at McCann Worldgroup.\n\n\"Gmail is becoming better with predictive generative AI,\" she said. \"So what? We would need to start saying on our emails 'Made with AI' now that it's embedded in everything we do?\"\n\nTo Horwitz, the idea of labeling content as being made or tweaked using AI is good in theory. But in practice, it's a slippery slope. As it stands now, the practice is to label everything as AI, whether it was genuinely AI-generated or the production process involved AI-powered tools. This calls into question what is AI and what is not, she said. Which, perhaps, further muddies the water in favor of AI companies.\n\nFor example, it may make more sense to label a campaign using an AI-generated model as \"Made with AI.\" However, agency execs argue that that same labeling shouldn't apply to a campaign featuring a human model's photo that was lightly retouched using AI-powered tools. (A different agency exec told Digiday about a similar experience in the latest edition of our Confessions series.)\n\nAt one point, there were industry grumblings about a framework with rating levels, according to one executive who spoke on background. For example, level five would mean the image was generated completely by artificial intelligence. Level one would mean no AI was used. Again, this points to a slippery slope in which differentiating minimal intervention using AI tools versus significant intervention would be a challenge, the exec added.\n\nWhat's clear is that the AI train has already left the station and there's no sending it back, per the anonymous exec.\n\n\"AI is a bit of a Pandora's box. It's already out so we can't put it back in the box,\" they said. \"All this to say that the landscape is evolving pretty rapidly. I don't think we know the full guardrails of everything. That's what we're living through.\"\n\nAs it stands, the U.S. doesn't have any federal regulations around AI. Instead, oversight is managed by a hodgepodge of players, including government entities, corporations and organizations like C2PA. Earlier this month, Digiday reported that Senators were set to propose new regulations for privacy, transparency and copyright protections regarding AI.\n\nBut generative AI is just the industry's latest shiny object. Meaning, as content labeling continues to be adopted and refined across the industry, clients will eventually get to a point where their apprehension subsides, Razorfish's Lawrence said.\n\n\"As we continue to refine the content labeling and that provenance piece, I think we will get to a point eventually where that apprehension will subside,\" she said.", "source": {"uri": "digiday.com",

The event will also be the first instalment of the quadrennial sportsfest since the International Olympic Committee (IOC) unveiled its Olympic AI Agenda.\n\nYou might be wondering why the Olympics - founded in 1896 in imitation of the famous athletic contest of ancient Greece - needs an \"AI agenda\". What can computers do to help the human body's quest to reach higher, faster and stronger?\n\nThe answer, according to the IOC, is quite a lot.\n\nThe committee's far-reaching agenda envisions a world in which AI systems aid athletes in reaching their peak performance, help to ensure fair play, optimise event operations, and transform the spectator experience. The goal, according to IOC President Thomas Bach, is \"to set the course for the AI future of sport with responsible leadership by embracing the change while preserving the Olympic values\".\n\nMost of what the IOC has in mind is quite specific to sport, but some of it is the kind of AI applications that could be used by organisations in many fields.\n\nChief among sport-focused uses of AI are those that focus on individual athletes. By evaluating huge data sets based on performance, physical traits, and skills, AI systems can make it easier to spot talent. These systems could operate on a large scale and might identify people who are currently being missed.\n\nAI could also play a role in helping talented individuals become world-class athletes. We are already seeing AI systems designed to support coaches by providing personalised training plans.\n\nOptimising training and uncovering hidden patterns in the behaviour of individuals or groups of athletes is another promising application of AI models. Coaches can use these models to adapt training strategies continuously through feedback.\n\nAI training systems can be more affordable and accessible than traditional coaching. There are also AI tools that can analyse video of movements such as a tennis swing in real-time and provide feedback - and some need no more equipment than a smartphone.\n\nOrganisations such as Swimming Australia are already using AI tools to interpret athlete data using natural language.\n\nAI-powered tools are also changing injury prevention and rehabilitation. By analysing biomechanical data, training logs and medical records, AI can identify injury risk factors and provide personalised recommendations to avoid them.\n\nFor instance, AI models can analyse an athlete's movement patterns to detect imbalances, suggesting targeted exercises and corrective techniques to reduce injury risk and enhance recovery. Research also shows AI technologies can identify knee injuries with accuracy comparable to physicians, potentially reducing the need for specialised medical practitioners.\n\nThe IOC also believes another key use for AI is to help make sport more fair.", "source": {"uri": "dailymaverick.co.za", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Maverick"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Olympic_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Olympic Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakdancing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Breakdancing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greece", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ancient Greece"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Summer Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sportsmanship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sportsmanship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_International_Olympic_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "President of the International Olympic Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Bach", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Bach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_Australia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Swimming Australia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Real-time computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomechanics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Biomechanics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Natural language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Physical therapy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coach_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coach (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Physician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Strength_Sports/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Strength Sports/Training", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Organizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 60}], "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-2163653116-scaled.jpg?fit=1280%2C821&quality=89&ssl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9778318", "eventUri": "eng-9778318", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-26", "textStart": 166, "textEnd": 173}], "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

Artificial intelligence can be used in stock trading to analyse historical market and stock data, generate investment ideas, form portfolios, and automatically buy and sell stocks. AI is able to quickly process huge amounts of data and make informed trading decisions. AI-based trading strategies can be used to identify patterns and trends in real time.\n\nThis FXOpen article explores the process of using artificial intelligence in stock trading and highlights the pros and cons of AI automated trading.\n\nHow Does Trading with AI Work?\n\nUsing AI for trading stocks is a relatively new practice. AI analyses markets with accuracy and efficiency and makes forecasts that help traders mitigate risks and provide higher potential returns. Here's an overview of how AI stock trading works.\n\nThe first stage needed for an AI model to function properly is robust data collection and preprocessing. This stage is akin to gathering raw materials to create a final product.\n\nDuring the second stage, specialists load historical data and algorithms into the model, which serve as the basis for identifying trends and price fluctuations that took place in the past. This way, the model obtains the information it will then analyse and learns how to analyse it.\n\nDuring the third stage, the model uses real-time data from various sources, such as financial news and economic indicators, to make forecasts. As new data becomes available, the models can be adjusted and refined. The best AI stock trading software can only be created using cleaned, structured, and prepared data.\n\nThe final stage includes making trading decisions, such as when to buy or sell stocks, based on the processed data. AI systems can execute trades automatically. AI can also manage investment portfolios by adjusting the allocation of assets depending on market conditions.\n\nWhat to Look Out for When Using AI in Trading\n\nWhen creating an AI system for trading, choosing the most appropriate algorithm is of paramount importance. There's a wide range of algorithms; for example, support vector machines (SVMs) are well suited for classification tasks and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for sequence prediction.\n\nThe choice of algorithms depends on trading goals and the type of data a trader will be working with. It's a good idea to look at performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to determine which algorithm is the best fit for your trading strategy.\n\nIf you decide to implement AI in stock market trading, you'll need to pay attention to a few things that will allow you to minimise risks.\n\nRisk Management and Control\n\nAlthough AI offers many benefits in trading, it creates a new set of risks, in particular, the risk of automated decision-making. It's important to have human oversight to ensure that the AI is making informed decisions. Human expertise helps identify potential risks and adjust the AI model as needed. Traders can take precautions, such as setting stop-loss and take-profit levels, to make sure that AI algorithms do not cause excessive losses.\n\nData Quality\n\nPoor-quality data can lead to inaccurate predictions and incorrect trades. It's important that the data uploaded to the system is accurate, relevant, and up-to-date and that the AI stock market trading software provider is trustworthy and reliable.\n\nIdeally, an AI system will continuously analyse incoming data and adapt to changing market conditions. For example, if an unexpected economic event occurs, the AI model must be capable of adjusting its strategies in real time.\n\nRegulatory Compliance\n\nThe adoption of AI in trading also brings forth regulatory challenges. When using AI, it is critical to comply with financial regulations to avoid legal issues. This includes ensuring that the AI model is transparent and explainable and that it does not engage in illegal activities such as insider trading. AI trading strategies should comply with all relevant laws.\n\nCase Studies and Examples\n\nOne real-life example of successful AI adoption in trading is the case of the hedge fund Renaissance Technologies, which uses proprietary trading algorithms based on artificial intelligence. The New York-based hedge fund has a reputation as one of the most successful investment companies in the world using AI.\n\nBridgewater Associates, also one of the world's largest hedge funds, uses AI to analyse market data and make trading decisions. The fund has been successful in using AI to identify patterns and trends in market data.\n\nThe third example is the use of AI in high-frequency trading. High-frequency trading involves using algorithms to execute trades at high speed. AI makes it possible to execute trades with speed and accuracy that exceeds human capabilities.\n\nBenefits and Challenges of AI Trading\n\nThe new technology has both advantages and pitfalls. Here's a table summarising the benefits and challenges of using AI algorithmic trading.\n\nBenefits\n\n- Increased efficiency\n\n- Improved accuracy\n\n- Effective risk management\n\n- Real-time analysis\n\n- Diversified trading strategies\n\n- Enhanced liquidity management and execution of large orders\n\n- Improved decision-making\n\nChallenges\n\n- Low-quality data\n\n- Overfitting\n\n- Limited human oversight\n\n- Compliance with financial regulations\n\n- Cost\n\n- Potential for increased complexity\n\n- Potential for reduced transparency\n\nUsing AI can result in increased efficiency, improved accuracy, effective risk management, and much more. Of course, there are other ways to analyse the market. For example, on the TickTrader trading platform, you can trade using advanced tools for analysing and assessing risks.\n\nData quality issues, model overfitting, and limited human oversight are the potential risks that can hinder the effectiveness of trading. To mitigate these challenges, consider validating data, testing the model, and adapting to evolving market conditions.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nAI allows traders to analyse vast amounts of data, identify patterns, and make informed decisions quickly. However, it's important to manage and control the risks associated with the use of AI in trading. Carefully consider the challenges and limitations and endeavour to take steps to mitigate them. You can open an FXOpen account to start trading, and as you gain experience, consider implementing advanced technologies, including AI.\n\nThis article represents the opinion of the Companies operating under the FXOpen brand only.

In the UK, Prime Minister Keir Starmer's Labour government has secured strong parliamentary support. In the EU, President Ursula von der Leyen has won a second term, backed by a broad political coalition. And this comes at a time when artificial intelligence is transforming societies, putting tech policy at the centre of strategic agendas to boost economic growth, protect national security interests and improve public-sector service delivery. Political leaders on both sides of the Channel should seize this unique opportunity to seek greater strategic alignment on AI policy.\n\nThere is a strong economic imperative for closer EU-UK collaboration on AI research and governance. The EU and the UK lag behind the United States in terms of growth.[_] While the US has experienced an 8.6 per cent increase in GDP since 2019, the Eurozone has grown by just 3.4 per cent and the UK by a mere 1.8 per cent. Accelerated AI adoption can strengthen Europe's competitiveness by improving efficiency and enabling new solutions to complex problems. But realising this potential requires strategic cooperation. AI development is a capital- and energy-intensive endeavour, and increased resource sharing would help both the EU and the UK overcome critical bottlenecks, for example relating to compute, data and talent. Moreover, businesses fear regulatory fragmentation. Harmonising AI standards would create a more favourable business environment, particularly for SMEs and startups. In short, closer EU-UK collaboration on AI would save costs, unlock economic growth and improve public-sector service delivery.\n\nImproving how the EU and UK work together on AI would also create significant geopolitical advantages. Today, AI research is dominated by the US and China: the two countries house almost 80 per cent of the world's most powerful AI models.[_] By combining their complementary strengths, the UK and the EU could achieve greater success in AI research and strengthen their positions to influence global AI policy debates. Furthermore, the EU and the UK have struggled to engage constructively since Brexit. While rejecting any possibility of rejoining the EU in the near term, Starmer's new Labour government has made it a priority to improve relations with Brussels.[_] Yet doing so takes more than warm words. Improving relations requires pragmatic actions in specific policy areas that help rebuild trust and ties.[_] Strategic collaboration on AI could thus create a bridgehead for the EU and the UK to work together in other areas of mutual interest without reopening divisive debates about a closer political union.\n\nIn this paper we delve deeper into four key areas of potential collaboration that we believe should be at the top of a joint EU-UK AI policy agenda. These include investments in compute infrastructure, harmonised AI standards, closer institutional coordination and multilateral cooperation on questions concerning emerging technologies and international trade.\n\nChapter 1\n\nTowards Closer Collaboration on AI Research and Policy\n\nSeveral recent initiatives have demonstrated a willingness on both sides to jointly explore collaboration on tech policy in general, and AI research and policy in particular. For example, in November 2023, Ursula von der Leyen attended the Global AI Safety Summit in London,[_] and in February 2024, the UK and France announced joint funding for global AI safety.[_] Although moving in the right direction, such efforts have hitherto suffered from a lack of overarching political coordination. A more structured framework to implement a strategic agenda is needed to realise the economic, social and geopolitical benefits of closer EU-UK collaboration on AI.\n\nIt is worth remembering that the AI policy ecosystems of the UK and the EU have only recently begun to take shape. The EU AI Act comes into force on 1 August 2024, making it the first comprehensive AI regulation adopted by any major economy.[_] The European AI Office, which will oversee and implement the act, is also fully established. Across the Channel, the UK government published an AI regulation white paper in March 2023 that was notably pro-innovation and pro-safety.[_] The UK's Department for Science, Innovation and Technology (DSIT) has since set up a Central Monitoring Function to drive coherence in its regulatory approach across government. It has also established the AI Safety Institute to advance best practices for identifying, monitoring and addressing emerging AI risks.[_]\n\nThe EU and UK have so far taken different approaches to AI regulation.[_] Employing a risk-based approach, the EU AI Act introduces new obligations for developers. In contrast, the UK has deployed a principles-based framework for existing regulators to interpret and apply within their own sectors. But AI research is advancing rapidly and regulatory debates are still evolving in both jurisdictions. For example, the UK's new Labour government has signalled in its manifesto an openness towards considering binding regulations for the most powerful AI models.[_] At the same time, there is widespread concern among businesses and startups that the EU AI Act is heavy-handed and opaque, threatening Europe's economic competitiveness. Closer collaboration does not mean straitjacketing either side. It means realising synergies while allowing for divergent political priorities. It also means learning what works in different contexts and continuously improving policies.\n\nBeyond regulation, the EU and the UK have much to gain from closer strategic alignment by jointly leveraging the combined strengths of their respective AI ecosystems. The EU's market size allows it to shape global policy debates and influence regulatory developments. As a case in point, Meta obtains around 23 per cent of its revenue from Europe, making it the tech giant's second-biggest market after the US.[_] This economic heft has led to the so-called Brussels effect, whereby multinational organisations voluntarily align their internal standards with EU policies because it is economically rational. Together with the US, the EU is also a global leader in building powerful supercomputers - with Finland, Italy and Spain hosting three of the world's top-ten supercomputers.[_] In addition, earlier this year the EU launched JUPITER, its first exascale supercomputer, which will be housed in Germany.\n\nThe UK brings its own strengths to the table, including a robust AI-innovation ecosystem. For example, the UK is home to more than 3,000 AI companies, which collectively generated more than \u00a310.6 billion in revenue in 2021-22.[_] These startups are clustered around world-leading universities in Oxford, Cambridge and London. The UK is also a leader in AI safety: it was the first country to establish an AI Safety Institute, with the US, Japan and Singapore following suit. The UK AI Safety Institute remains the most well-funded in the global network of emerging safety institutes. Its technical expertise in evaluating frontier AI models, combined with the UK's traditional prowess in service industries such as auditing, insurance and finance, uniquely positions the country to excel in the burgeoning AI assurance industry.\n\nGiven the complementary strengths of their respective regulatory approaches and AI ecosystems, closer collaboration between the EU and the UK can only be mutually beneficial. Despite post-Brexit regulatory divergences, there are significant low-hanging fruits in relation to AI research and governance that the EU and the UK should seize. We have identified four areas where opportunities to partner are especially ripe.\n\nChapter 2\n\nA Four-Point Agenda for EU-UK Collaboration on AI\n\nIn a previous paper, Moving Forward: The Path to a Better Post-Brexit Relationship Between the UK and the EU, the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change (TBI) outlined a general agenda for a special collaboration between the UK and the EU. In this paper, we focus specifically on the benefits of closer collaboration in the field of AI. The overarching aim is for the EU and the UK to foster innovation, promote responsible practices and ensure digital competitiveness by coordinating responses to joint challenges in a fragmented global landscape. To achieve this, political leaders in the EU and the UK should act on the following opportunities without delay.\n\n1. Invest in Shared Compute Infrastructure Through the High-Performance Computing Joint Undertaking (EuroHPC JU)\n\nDigital infrastructure and compute capacity are fundamental enablers for AI research and innovation. Recognising that, the EU has established the EuroHPC JU, a public-private collaboration with a budget of approximately \u20ac7 billion, to enhance its supercomputing capabilities.[_] The UK joined the EuroHPC JU in May 2024.[_] For UK scientists, this has meant getting access to the EU's cutting-edge compute infrastructure and the opportunity to bid for EuroHPC grants. This is a good first step; it provides UK researchers and businesses with critical tools to deliver breakthroughs across disciplines, from health care to energy. But the EU and the UK can and should go further. Promisingly, the UK's new Labour government is expected to coordinate with EU partners to optimise common compute resources and jointly develop next-generation exascale computing. This would be a welcome move that brings benefits to both sides. For the UK, expanded access to supercomputing capabilities and increased international collaboration would accelerate scientific discovery and unlock economic growth. At the same time, the UK's longstanding expertise in supercomputing will contribute to the EU's objective of becoming a global leader in high-performance and quantum computing.[_]\n\n2. Harmonise AI Standards\n\nStandards are critical enablers for accelerating innovation, facilitating international trade and implementing technology policies. The development of uniform definitions, practices and metrics is especially important in the field of AI, which is marked by technical and regulatory fragmentation. Most pressingly, the adoption and enforcement of comprehensive AI policies across multiple jurisdictions will require detailed technical standards. Against this backdrop, the British Standards Institution (BSI) and the European Standards Organisations (CEN, CENELEC, ETSI and ENISA) should work closely together to harmonise AI standards. Specifically, the aim should be to establish a common terminology, improve interoperability, set uniform measurements and facilitate cooperation between regulatory agencies. This would streamline compliance, reduce costs, promote the adoption of trustworthy AI systems and strengthen digital competitiveness by lowering barriers for AI developers. An aligned approach to AI standardisation would spur innovation and create synergies between the EU and UK AI ecosystems, while still allowing for some divergence in regulatory approaches.\n\n3. Establish a Close Working Relationship Between the European AI Office and the UK's AI Safety Institute\n\nAI policies are only as strong as the institutions enforcing them. The key institutions responsible for AI governance in the UK and the EU are the UK's AI Safety Institute and the European AI Office. Establishing a close working relationship between these two relatively new agencies would strengthen their respective capabilities and impact. Promising avenues for collaboration include joint research on AI safety as well as the specialisation of model-testing and evaluation capabilities to avoid duplication of work. For example, we recommend that Unit A.2 of the European AI Office partners with the UK's Central AI Risk Function within the DSIT to jointly develop risk-assessment methodologies and risk-mitigation strategies.[_] Similarly, Unit A.3 of the European AI Office should work closely with the UK's AI Safety Institute on model-evaluation and monitoring protocols, ensuring a more standardised approach across both jurisdictions. Both institutions would also gain insights from regular information exchanges on key model and stakeholder risks. This would see the European AI Office benefitting from the extensive resources of the AI Safety Institute which would, in turn, benefit from the EU's reputation and extensive regulatory influence on the creation of safer AI systems.\n\n4. Expand Cooperation on AI Through a Renewed Trade and Technology Council\n\nMultilateral trade collaborations are central vehicles for coordinating AI research and governance. In 2021, the EU and the US established the Trade and Technology Council (TTC) to boost alignment on regulatory approaches to key technologies, including AI.[_] Until now, neither the EU nor the US have shown enthusiasm for letting the UK join the TTC, but the idea of a trilateral UK-US-EU forum to discuss technology regulation might look more attractive given uncertainty around the current TTC's impact and longevity should the political leadership change in the US. Recasting the TTC as a more multilateral and technocratic forum with a sharper focus on AI governance could strengthen both its influence and impact. The UK should therefore seek to expand multilateral cooperation on AI regulation and governance through a reformed TTC. In the long term, this body could serve as a lever for the UK, EU and US to jointly address AI governance challenges in a world that, in geopolitical terms, is becoming increasingly fragmented.\n\nChapter 3\n\nPutting the Agenda in Motion\n\nOur recommended four-point agenda charts a path towards capitalising on the UK and EU's complementary strengths. However, implementing this agenda in practice will only be possible if political leaders on both sides of the Channel act decisively. In this section, we outline some of the barriers to successful EU-UK collaboration on AI - as well as how they can be overcome.\n\nTo begin with, putting our four-point agenda in motion will require the EU and the UK to establish formal channels for collaboration on AI policy at a ministerial level. Currently, the EU and UK remain fragmented on major AI-related policy questions; a joined-up approach would allow both to wield greater influence in global regulatory debates. Although the UK's previous government generally rebuffed the EU's efforts for formal collaboration on global policy issues, the new government will likely be more pragmatic and open to working together. Encouragingly, the existing governance provisions of the EU and UK's Trade and Cooperation Agreement are flexible enough to accommodate formal cooperation to align approaches to AI over time.\n\nImplementing our four-point agenda will also require closer coordination between academic institutions and private research centres. Thanks to joining the EuroHPC JU, the UK can collaborate with European partners to develop effective compute governance measures that promote responsible practices in exchange for access to public compute infrastructure.[_] As part of this process, the UK must ensure that its expanding compute infrastructure, in particular Bristol's National AI Research Resource, is both scalable and fully interoperable with European high-performance computing systems.[_] This will help ensure the efficient sharing of compute resources to promote innovation while maintaining high ethical standards.\n\nFunding schemes constitute another key enabler for our four-point agenda. In recent TBI papers, the State of Compute Access: How to Bridge the New Digital Divide and The UK's AI Startup Roadmap (the latter co-authored with the Startup Coalition and Onward), we called for the UK to invest in public compute infrastructure and improve access for startups and the public sector. Being part of the EuroHPC JU presents several opportunities: for example, the UK can leverage Fortissimo Plus, a key initiative of EuroHPC JU, which aims to increase the uptake of high-performance computing by SMEs and startups by offering them the necessary knowledge, as well as financial and technical support.\n\nAs part of a wider \"compute diplomacy\" strategy, the UK and the EU should be proactive in supporting future experimental resource-swap schemes, along the lines of the EuroHPC JU's pioneering new collaboration with Japan.[_] The scheme, called HANAMI (HPC AlliaNce for Applications and SupercoMputing Innovation), will give European scientists working in areas such as climate modelling and material sciences access to Japan's Fugaku supercomputer, currently ranked number four in the TOP500 global supercomputers list.[_] Such experimental schemes critically enable the transfer, testing and evaluation of scientific applications in different computational architectures.\n\nPotential roadblocks remain, but they can be overcome. One point of tension is that standards play different roles in the EU and UK's regulatory frameworks. The European Commission sees standards as a regulatory tool, giving bodies such as the CEN/CENELEC the mandate to develop harmonised standards under Article 40 of the EU AI Act. In contrast, the UK largely views standards as voluntary tools that organisations can employ to ensure good AI governance. There is also divergence among AI standards-setters themselves. For example, the CEN/CENELEC's perspective on adopting the ISO/IEC 42001 standard (the world's first standard on the procedural management of AI systems) for the EU AI Act differs from the BSI's perspective. But there are promising signs of alignment. In a recent technical report by the EU's Joint Research Centre, the proposed ISO/IEC 42005 standard (on AI system impact assessments) offers fit-for-purpose guidance on conducting AI impact assessments under the EU AI Act, a view shared by the BSI.[_]\n\nIn addition to technical considerations, political roadblocks may also arise. At the moment there are promising signs of closer multilateral cooperation; for example, in July 2024 the competition authorities of the US, EU and UK published a joint statement on competition law relating to generative AI models and other AI products.[_] But the future remains uncertain. The impact of Brexit has made it harder for EU and UK officials to engage constructively. Further, the elections for the European Parliament in June resulted in gains for party groups on the right that pursue more isolationist policies. Finally, a change in the US administration may constrain support for multilateral agreements such as the TTC. Attempts to downsize government capabilities might also render the US AI Safety Institute and President Joe Biden's Executive Order on AI ineffective. However, the fact that such challenges loom on the horizon should only motivate the UK and the EU to establish a more robust bilateral collaboration.\n\nThe UK has already taken meaningful steps forward to foster global cooperation on AI safety. Last year it hosted the first AI Safety Summit, with the participation of 28 countries that are leading AI developments. All parties at the summit agreed to the Bletchley Declaration - a commitment to share responsibility for mitigating the risks of frontier AI, collaborate on safety and research, and promote AI's potential as a force for good.[_] Following the summit, the UK commissioned Yoshua Bengio, the founder and scientific director of research institute Mila, to produce the State of the Science report on the capabilities and risks of frontier AI.[_] Professor Bengio will be advised by an expert advisory panel from representative countries (including EU member states). This year's AI Safety Summit was co-hosted with the Republic of Korea.[_] The 2025 summit - which will be hosted in France - presents a timely opportunity to nurture further cooperation between the UK and its neighbours in the EU.[_]\n\nTo summarise, several key components required to implement our four-point agenda for closer EU-UK collaboration on AI are already in place. For example, the European AI Office has a formal dialogue with the US AI Safety Institute,[_] and the UK's AI Safety Institute has collaborations with its counterparts in the US, France and Singapore. Yet more structured collaboration would bring numerous benefits. The UK's AI Safety Institute has twice the budget of the European AI Office, so the EU has much to gain from encouraging the sharing of data and expertise.[_] For the UK, cooperation with the EU would mean participating in dialogue on regulatory activities, such as the drafting of the EU AI Act's Codes of Practice, which will likely influence the business practices of AI firms around the world. Putting our four-point agenda in motion would thus also reinforce the existing EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement, which envisages the sharing of best practices on cyber issues and the exchange of information relevant to the development of digital trade more broadly.\n\nChapter 4\n\nConclusion\n\nStrategic alignment between the UK and the EU on AI presents a significant opportunity for both parties to realise economic and geopolitical benefits. The four-point agenda outlined in this paper is both feasible and timely, given the current political landscape, and the EU and UK's shared commitment to the responsible advancement of AI technologies.\n\nThe economic benefits of closer collaboration are clear: the EU's substantial market influence and the UK's robust AI sector can create a synergy to drive innovation and competitiveness on a global scale. Geopolitically, a united approach to AI regulation and development will enhance the standing of London and Brussels in the global tech arena, ensuring they remain leaders in a rapidly evolving field. These proposals can be implemented through regular dialogue, joint task forces and shared initiatives, many of which are already in place, such as the Global AI Safety Summit and joint funding for AI safety research. This collaboration will ensure that both the UK and the EU leverage their unique strengths while mitigating the risks associated with AI.\n\nNow is a unique window of opportunity: recent elections and new parliamentary majorities have provided fresh political momentum, leaving both sides in a good position to enhance their relationship. The establishment of bodies like the European AI Office and the UK's AI Safety Institute demonstrates a mutual commitment to responsible AI governance, laying a strong foundation for future cooperation in this field. Strategic collaboration on AI could also pave the way for a stronger post-Brexit EU-UK relationship. In a fragmenting geopolitical landscape, working together on AI allows both parties to not only accelerate innovation and address pressing regulatory issues but also signal a broader commitment to shared values and joint progress. It's a win-win situation.\n\nChapter 5\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nWe would like to extend our thanks to the following peer reviewers, who offered their advice and guidance in the development of this

The AI Act is a set of rules and regulations designed to protect European citizens from the perils of artificial intelligence.\n\nThe full text of the AI Act is available online, but the gist of it is this: it sorts AI applications into several risk categories, with some, such as government-run social scoring, being deemed unacceptable. High-risk AI systems, including those used in critical infrastructure and law enforcement, are regulated, with providers having to follow a strict set of rules on risk management, incident tracking, and more. Providers of AI systems designated as limited risk, including chatbots and deepfakes, are obligated to inform users they're interacting with AI.\n\nIn contrast, the Biden administration has issued a set of AI-related safeguards, with numerous, large tech companies on board, but the rules are non-binding, and there's no penalty if they're not followed.\n\nWhile Europe's AI rules aren't really becoming effective until February 2025, with some of the provisions applying as late as August 2026, the practical outcome for users right now is that the U.S. tech giants are extremely wary of offering AI features to European users.\n\nIn June, Apple introduced a set of AI features (dubbed Apple Intelligence), which should go live sometime in the fall, alongside the public launch of iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia. And while the AI features will seemingly arrive a little later than expected, some of them have just gone live in Apple's latest batch of developer betas -- unless you're in Europe, that is.\n\nIn fact, Apple has already officially delayed its AI features in Europe due to regulatory concerns, likely until 2025.\n\nThere have been instances in the past of Europe not getting certain features due to the EU's regulators being a tad more stringent on certain matters than those in the U.S.; Meta's social network Threads arrived in Europe months after launching overseas, for example.\n\nBut the implications of AI features being delayed in Europe could be far more significant.\n\nIn its announcement of Apple Intelligence, Apple said the AI features are \"deeply integrated into iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia.\" They're certainly important enough to warrant an entire introductory web page on Apple's website. Apple is not alone in this; if you've seen a tech keynote in the past year or two - any keynote - you've likely heard the word \"artificial intelligence\" hundreds of times.\n\nIndividual features, such as Meta's recently launched AI Studio, or ChatGPT's Memory, which are also not available in Europe, are one thing. But Apple touts AI as a key element of the new iPhone, one of the most popular phones in Europe and the world. When the new iPhone 16 arrives in Europe without any of the promised AI features, it's a bigger deal.\n\nIt's not just about creating a fun Genmoji image, or Safari summarizing an article for you. Upcoming AI features on the iPhone also include smarter search and editing in Photos, AI-powered spelling and grammar checks, and a significantly smarter Siri, among other key upgrades. A brand new iPhone without any of these (for a couple of months at least) sounds like a very different deal than one with all these features enabled.\n\nTech giants such as Apple and Meta certainly won't simply give up on AI in Europe. When it announced its AI features will arrive late in Europe, Apple said it will try to find a way to \"deliver these features to our EU customers without compromising their safety,\" and the AI stuff will certainly come in one form or another. But this is just the beginning; as AI becomes more deeply integrated with the devices we use and rely on, it might get increasingly difficult to make them work similarly in the U.S. and Europe, given the different rulesets.\n\nAs someone who has lived in Europe most of my life, I'm used to certain features not being available -- or being offered in a slightly different form than they are in the U.S. -- and I do think that regulating the way big tech uses AI is necessary, and not just in a pinky-swear-not-to-do-bad-things type of way. But I also wonder just how big this rift is going to become now that the EU AI Act is in place.", "source": {"uri": "me.mashable.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mashable ME"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPadOS", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "IPadOS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deepfake", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Deepfake"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applications_of_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Applications of artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "MacOS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequoia_Capital", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sequoia Capital"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "IOS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "IPhone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Software release life cycle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_network", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Big Tech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siri", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Siri"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safari_(web_browser)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Safari (web browser)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual_Property", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual Property", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://sm.mashable.com/t/mashable_me/article/e/europe-now/europe-now-has-a-huge-ai-gap-for-better-or-for-worse_8rk4.1200.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9778318", "eventUri": "eng-9778318", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-01", "textStart": 237, "textEnd": 243}], "sentiment": -0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

The ability to analyze large datasets and extract valuable insights is transforming how sales teams operate. But what do sales professionals really think about this development? What opportunities and challenges does AI bring?\n\nOptimization Through Data: AI Transforms the Sales Process\n\nThe world of sales is being revolutionized by AI. By optimizing customer interactions and using predictive analytics to identify trends early, AI offers immense benefits. According to a study by Bain & Company, customer management remains crucial for sales success. An AI-driven sales strategy enables detailed and real-time tracking of the customer journey, well beyond the point of sale, opening new dimensions of efficiency and precision in sales.\n\nHuman Relationships Remain Irreplaceable\n\nDespite these impressive advantages, building and maintaining human relationships remains irreplaceable. Value-based selling and social skills are essential to recognize and respond to customer needs. These irreplaceable social and technical skills secure long-term success in sales. This showcases the balance between technology and humanity that characterizes modern sales.\n\nMerging of Marketing and Sales: A Seamless Process\n\nA significant trend emerging in sales is the increasing merging of marketing and sales. The boundary between these two areas is fading. Digital technologies and interfaces between CRM, marketing automation, and sales software create a seamless process. This enables smooth collaboration and more efficient workflows that optimize the entire sales process.\n\nMobility in Sales: Real-Time Customer Care as the New Standard\n\nMobility is another critical factor in modern sales. Sales professionals are increasingly responding to customer inquiries on the go and in real time. The use of CRM systems and agile sales software on mobile devices enables rapid and efficient customer care. Especially progressive web apps (PWAs) play a significant role, as they are discoverable by search engines and offer high usability.\n\nPersonalization: Tailored Experiences Through AI\n\nThe personalization of websites and ads is another trend driven by AI. Customers expect tailored experiences that cater to their individual needs. Companies like Google and Amazon set standards and shape user expectations. Thanks to AI-powered programs, personalization is becoming increasingly simple and effective.\n\nChallenges in Integrating AI Technical Hurdles: Integration into Existing Systems\n\nIntegrating AI in sales also presents challenges. Integration into existing systems can be difficult due to compatibility issues. Older CRM systems may need to be updated or replaced with new platforms designed for AI integration.\n\nData Quality: The Foundation of Success\n\nThe success of AI in sales strongly depends on the quality and availability of data. Companies must ensure their data is complete and accurate to enable precise predictions and analyses.\n\nUser Acceptance: Overcoming Resistance\n\nAnother obstacle is user acceptance. Skepticism and resistance to new technologies can impair user acceptance of AI. Tailored training and continuous coaching are necessary to demonstrate the benefits and usability of AI and facilitate the transition.\n\nData Protection: Securing Sensitive Data\n\nHandling sensitive customer data poses an additional challenge. AI systems must comply with data protection regulations such as the GDPR. Companies should conduct regular data protection audits and be transparent about their data protection measures.\n\nSuccessful Integration of AI in Sales Processes\n\nRealistic Expectations: Understanding Potentials and Limits\n\nTo successfully integrate AI in sales processes, it's crucial to set realistic expectations. Companies should set achievable goals and understand the potential of AI. AI is not a solution to all problems, but its strengths can be leveraged to improve processes and boost efficiency.\n\nQuick Wins: Building Trust in AI\n\nQuick wins, such as implementing AI chatbots to reduce response times and improve customer satisfaction, can build trust in the benefits of AI and pave the way for more complex integrations.\n\nTailored Solutions: Adapting AI to Specific Needs\n\nAI should be adapted to the specific needs of the sales team. For example, using AI for lead qualification can help solve urgent problems and increase efficiency. Despite the many advantages of AI in sales, the human factor remains crucial. The combination of technology and human empathy will secure future success in sales.\n\nThe Future of Sales: A Hybrid Vision\n\nThe introduction of AI in sales offers numerous opportunities but requires careful planning and execution. A solid strategy that integrates content management, automation, customer engagement, training, and strategy is crucial for success. The future of sales lies in the intelligent combination of AI and human expertise. Companies must ensure they maintain ethical standards and design AI integration to complement rather than replace human interaction.\n\nWith AI in sales, new dimensions of efficiency and precision open up. The future of sales is hybrid: An intelligent combination of AI and human expertise will shape the industry and set new standards. It is essential to harness the benefits of AI without neglecting the human values and skills that have long characterized sales.\n\nAuthor: Erik Simon, CEO - Managing Director, Enhanced Consulting Solutions Ltd.\n\nFarmers Future is an innovative project that has set itself the task of combining sustainability and profitability in agriculture.

As federal agencies are seeking to ramp up their purchase and use of AI systems, there is a pressing need to set standards and safeguards that will ensure the adoption of safe, secure and trustworthy AI to serve the American public. The legislation requires agencies to assess and address the risks of their AI uses prior to buying and deploying the technology. Additionally, the bill ensures the federal government reaps the benefits of this technology through the creation of pilot programs to test more flexible, competitive purchasing practices. This landmark legislation builds on requirements in the Advancing American AI Act, led by Peters, which became law in 2022. The bill was approved by the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, where Peters serves as Chair. It now moves to the full Senate for consideration.\n\n\"While AI has the capacity to greatly enhance federal services, we must be vigilant about its deployment,\" said Senator Peters. \"These new measures will guide agencies in adopting AI technologies responsibly, ensuring that taxpayer-funded systems are not only effective but also trustworthy.\"\n\nThe federal government is already using AI to interact with and make decisions about the public, and use of the technology is only expected to grow. While AI technology can help improve government efficiency, it can also pose risks if deployed improperly. The bipartisan Promoting Responsible Evaluation and Procurement to Advance Readiness for Enterprise-wide Deployment (PREPARED) for AI Act will guide the federal government's activities, personnel and processes to effectively and responsibly procure and use AI. The bill requires agencies to determine whether their AI uses are high risk, with a focus on protecting the public's rights and safety. The bill will require government contracts for high risk AI to include safety and security terms for data ownership, civil rights, civil liberties and privacy, adverse outcome reporting and other key areas. It also requires agencies to identify, test, and monitor potential risks before, during, and after they buy AI for high risk uses - including through ongoing testing and evaluation to mitigate potential risks. The bill also requires agencies to establish AI governance structures, including through Chief AI Officers, to lead and coordinate these efforts. The legislation would also establish pilot programs to better enable agencies to purchase technology including AI, which would bolster innovative adoption. Finally, the bill includes key provisions to encourage transparency of the government's use of AI systems through public disclosures and reporting.\n\nThe PREPARED For AI Act is supported by the Center for Democracy and Technology, Transparency Coalition, the AI Procurement Lab, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE-USA), and the U.S. Federal Market for IBM Technology. Below are statements in support of the legislation:\n\n\"As agencies consider incorporating AI into government services and other processes, they must do so responsibly - working to protect people's rights and ensure the responsible use of taxpayer dollars,\" said Alexandra Reeve Givens, President & CEO of the Center for Democracy & Technology. \"The bipartisan PREPARED for AI Act lays a strong foundation by codifying transparency, risk evaluation, and other safeguards that will help agencies make smarter and more informed procurement decisions. We look forward to working with Senators Peters and Tillis to advance best practices and accountability in the government's use and procurement of AI.\"\n\n\"The Transparency Coalition.Al writes to express our firm support of the proposed PREPARED for Al Act, which will provide much needed guidance for Federal Government agencies using Artificial Intelligence (AI) as part of their operations. The PREPARED for Al Act deftly addresses the need for transparency around inputs, protecting data privacy while encouraging innovation, growth, and competition within this rapidly emerging industry,\" said Rob Eleveld, TCAI Chairman.\n\n\"The U.S. must ensure that innovation does not come at the expense of its citizens. Historical values that procurement promotes -- price, competition, and innovation -- do not adequately address the transparency, expertise, and oversight needed to manage AI risk. The PREPARED for AI Act helps to address these government challenges,\" said Gisele Waters, Ph.D., and Dr. Cari Miller Co-Founders of the AI Procurement Lab.\n\n\"While AI can promote innovative societal and economic benefits, it must be acquired and used within risk-mitigating frameworks that prevent potential harms such as critical failures and even loss of life. The requirements set forth in this bill provide the best path forward to help mitigate those harms,\" said Keith Moore, Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE-USA) President. \"We believe that the PREPARED for AI Act, which recognizes the role that standards play in providing necessary best practices, will provide federal agencies with the AI governance framework they need.\"\n\n\"AI can enhance government service delivery, improve efficiency, and accelerate decision making. Strong governance is critical for responsible adoption of AI by federal agencies and to allow for proper accountability and transparency on how AI is being used,\" said Susan Wedge, managing partner, and Vanessa Hunt, general manager, U.S. Federal Market for IBM Technology. \"It's in this vein that IBM is proud to support the bipartisan Promoting Responsible Evaluation and Procurement to Advance Readiness for Enterprise-wide Deployment (PREPARED) for AI Act, as it takes a risk-based approach to governance and gives federal agencies a clear framework for holding AI creators and users accountable for taking steps to protect against potential harms. The federal government's purchasing power can set the bar for adopting trustworthy AI.\"", "source": {"uri": "foreignaffairs.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "foreignaffairs.co.nz"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mil_osi_publisher@foreignaffairs.co.nz", "name": "Mil-Osi Publisher", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Peters", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gary Peters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipartisanship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bipartisanship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_Committee_on_Homeland_Security_and_Governmental_Affairs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparency_(behavior)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Transparency (behavior)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_for_Democracy_and_Technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Center for Democracy and Technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_of_Electrical_and_Electronics_Engineers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_liberties", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Civil liberties"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procurement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Procurement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_and_political_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Civil and political rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Privacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chairperson", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chairperson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision-making", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Decision-making"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Philosophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Doctor of Philosophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "IBM"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accountability", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Accountability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Information privacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Whistleblowing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Whistleblowing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 62}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9778318", "eventUri": "eng-9778318", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3333333333333333, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

Firstly, applications considered to pose an unacceptable risk, such as those resembling China's government-operated social scoring systems, are banned.\n\nSecondly, high-risk AI applications, such as automated CV-screening tools used in hiring processes, are subjected to stringent legal requirements. AI applications not categorised as high-risk or banned are subject to lighter-touch regulation, allowing for innovation while ensuring compliance with fundamental rights and safety standards.\n\nAI-enabled businesses must now navigate a compliance landscape that demands transparency, accountability, and risk management. For example, companies developing or deploying General Purpose AI (GPAI) models, particularly those surpassing certain computational thresholds, are obligated to adhere to specific guidelines. These include providing comprehensive technical documentation, disclosing training data summaries, and implementing robust cybersecurity measures.\n\nThe implementation of the EU AI Act unfolds in phases, affording companies a period of adaptation. Initial compliance deadlines range from three to six months, depending on the complexity of AI integration within each organisation. Over the next three years, further regulatory requirements will be phased in, aligning with the gradual development of harmonised European standards aimed at operationalising the Act's provisions.\n\nSimilar to the EU's landmark General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the EU AI Act is poised to set a global standard for AI governance. Already, international jurisdictions, including Brazil, have begun mirroring aspects of the EU's regulatory approach. This alignment reflects a growing consensus on the necessity of ethical AI frameworks to mitigate potential harms and promote responsible innovation worldwide.\n\nAs AI continues to permeate various facets of daily life, from personalised advertising to healthcare diagnostics, the EU AI Act stands as a pivotal safeguard against misuse and ensures that AI technologies serve the public interest. By setting clear boundaries and fostering a culture of compliance and accountability, the EU aims to harness the transformative potential of AI while safeguarding fundamental rights and societal values.", "source": {"uri": "openaccessgovernment.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Open Access Government"}, "authors": [{"uri": "harriet_belderbos@openaccessgovernment.org", "name": "Harriet Belderbos", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparency_(behavior)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Transparency (behavior)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fundamental rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Risk management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accountability", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Accountability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Computer security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "General Data Protection Regulation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_interest", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Public interest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Medical diagnosis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurisdiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jurisdiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ethics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/E-Commerce/Standards_and_Protocols", "label": "dmoz/Business/E-Commerce/Standards and Protocols", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Impact_Assessment", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Impact Assessment", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 53}], "image": "https://www.openaccessgovernment.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/iStock-1667561542-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9778318", "eventUri": "eng-9778318", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

From search engines and productivity tools to freelance marketplaces, AI is becoming a key differentiator and revenue driver. This trend is reshaping business models and consumer interactions while also raising questions about the future of work and the implications of AI deployment.\n\n\"Companies are increasingly focusing their AI spending on developing lightweight and compressed models, which are crucial for efficient deployment in resource-constrained environments,\" Jiahao Sun, CEO at Flock.io, told PYMNTS.\n\nGoogle has been integrating AI capabilities into its search engine through initiatives like Search Generative Experience (SGE). Google CEO Sundar Pichai has emphasized, \"AI is the most profound technology we are working on today.\"\n\nNot to be outdone, Microsoft has launched Copilot, an AI assistant embedded across its Office suite, charging enterprise users $30 per person per month. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella noted, \"Copilot is already improving productivity for more than 40% of the Fortune 100 who participated in our early access program.\"\n\nAmazon leverages AI for personalized product recommendations and search results. In a shareholder letter, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy stated, \"We're investing heavily in large language models and generative AI across our businesses.\"\n\n\"Generative AI will significantly impact how people discover topics on the internet, such as asking ChatGPT for recommendations rather than browsing through search rankings and reviews,\" Brad Null, head of AI at Reputation, told PYMNTS. He added, \"AI will consume all of the information out there about a business to make such recommendations, so brands will need to stay on top of those advancements, especially when it comes to their search strategy.\"\n\nIndustry experts are expressing optimism about AI's potential in the commerce sector while warning of hurdles in its implementation. Their insights paint a picture of an industry on the cusp of major change, grappling with both excitement and caution.\n\nSun highlighted AI's capabilities. \"Advancements in AI, particularly in large language models [LLMs] and machine learning [ML], are poised to revolutionize the commerce sector by automating a wide range of processes,\" he stated. This automation, Sun suggested, could streamline operations across the board, from inventory management to customer service.\n\nAI could enhance customer insights. Null said, \"For years, we have had tools that mine customer feedback data to surface insights about brands. With new advancements in AI, these tools are getting increasingly more powerful, helping us more quickly aggregate feedback, discover emerging themes, and surface more actionable insights.\" This improved ability to understand and respond to customer needs could give businesses a competitive edge.\n\nHowever, both experts quickly pointed out that the road to AI integration is fraught with challenges. Sun highlighted the financial barriers, stating, \"There are high API fees associated with using centralized AI services, which can quickly escalate as usage scales.\"\n\nHe added, \"Companies must frequently upgrade their hardware, particularly GPUs, to keep up with the latest AI developments and model requirements.\" These costs could prove prohibitive for smaller businesses or those operating on tight margins.\n\nData management remains a critical issue, even as AI capabilities advance. \"The biggest challenge today is the same as what it was five years ago, getting the most useful, actionable data and positioning it so that you can maximize value from that data,\" Null said. This sentiment underscores the importance of not just having data but also having it in a format that AI can effectively use.\n\nHe elaborated on this point, saying, \"If you don't already have the data you need, and have it formatted in a way that it is easy to leverage -- meaning, if you haven't already applied AI and ML to your data -- then you probably have a lot of work to do to gather and position this data before using it to find consumer insights.\" This suggests that many businesses face a preparatory phase before leveraging AI's capabilities.", "source": {"uri": "pymnts.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PYMNTS.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Search engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Microsystems", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sun Microsystems"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Productivity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Large language model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_assistant", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Virtual assistant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sundar_Pichai", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sundar Pichai"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freelancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Freelancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_experience", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "User experience"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Business model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Jassy", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andy Jassy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity_software", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Productivity software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satya_Nadella", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Satya Nadella"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortune_500", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fortune 500"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Machine learning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Customer service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Web browser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "API"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Data management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Automation"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Spreadsheets", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Spreadsheets", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Information_Technology/Outsourcing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Information Technology/Outsourcing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 69}], "image": "https://www.pymnts.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Google-AI-overviews-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9778318", "eventUri": "eng-9778318", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2941176470588236, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

Credit: BlackJack3D/Getty Images\n\nWhen it comes to tech, Europe has been on a slightly separate track from the U.S. for a while, but the paths are about to diverge big time.\n\nAs of today, Aug. 1, the European Union's AI Act is entering into force. The AI Act is a set of rules and regulations designed to protect European citizens from the perils of artificial intelligence.\n\nThe full text of the AI Act is available online, but the gist of it is this: it sorts AI applications into several risk categories, with some, such as government-run social scoring, being deemed unacceptable. High-risk AI systems, including those used in critical infrastructure and law enforcement, are regulated, with providers having to follow a strict set of rules on risk management, incident tracking, and more. Providers of AI systems designated as limited risk, including chatbots and deepfakes, are obligated to inform users they're interacting with AI.\n\nIn contrast, the Biden administration has issued a set of AI-related safeguards, with numerous, large tech companies on board, but the rules are non-binding, and there's no penalty if they're not followed.\n\nWhile Europe's AI rules aren't really becoming effective until February 2025, with some of the provisions applying as late as August 2026, the practical outcome for users right now is that the U.S. tech giants are extremely wary of offering AI features to European users.\n\nIn June, Apple introduced a set of AI features (dubbed Apple Intelligence), which should go live sometime in the fall, alongside the public launch of iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia. And while the AI features will seemingly arrive a little later than expected, some of them have just gone live in Apple's latest batch of developer betas -- unless you're in Europe, that is.\n\nIn fact, Apple has already officially delayed its AI features in Europe due to regulatory concerns, likely until 2025.\n\nThere have been instances in the past of Europe not getting certain features due to the EU's regulators being a tad more stringent on certain matters than those in the U.S.; Meta's social network Threads arrived in Europe months after launching overseas, for example.\n\nBut the implications of AI features being delayed in Europe could be far more significant.\n\nIn its announcement of Apple Intelligence, Apple said the AI features are \"deeply integrated into iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia.\" They're certainly important enough to warrant an entire introductory web page on Apple's website. Apple is not alone in this; if you've seen a tech keynote in the past year or two - any keynote - you've likely heard the word \"artificial intelligence\" hundreds of times.\n\nIndividual features, such as Meta's recently launched AI Studio, or ChatGPT's Memory, which are also not available in Europe, are one thing. But Apple touts AI as a key element of the new iPhone, one of the most popular phones in Europe and the world. When the new iPhone 16 arrives in Europe without any of the promised AI features, it's a bigger deal.\n\nIt's not just about creating a fun Genmoji image, or Safari summarizing an article for you. Upcoming AI features on the iPhone also include smarter search and editing in Photos, AI-powered spelling and grammar checks, and a significantly smarter Siri, among other key upgrades. A brand new iPhone without any of these (for a couple of months at least) sounds like a very different deal than one with all these features enabled.\n\nTech giants such as Apple and Meta certainly won't simply give up on AI in Europe. When it announced its AI features will arrive late in Europe, Apple said it will try to find a way to \"deliver these features to our EU customers without compromising their safety,\" and the AI stuff will certainly come in one form or another. But this is just the beginning; as AI becomes more deeply integrated with the devices we use and rely on, it might get increasingly difficult to make them work similarly in the U.S. and Europe, given the different rulesets.\n\nAs someone who has lived in Europe most of my life, I'm used to certain features not being available -- or being offered in a slightly different form than they are in the U.S. -- and I do think that regulating the way big tech uses AI is necessary, and not just in a pinky-swear-not-to-do-bad-things type of way. But I also wonder just how big this rift is going to become now that the EU AI Act is in place.", "source": {"uri": "mashable.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mashable"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPadOS", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "IPadOS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deepfake", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Deepfake"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applications_of_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Applications of artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "MacOS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequoia_Capital", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sequoia Capital"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "IOS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getty_Images", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Getty Images"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Software release life cycle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "IPhone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_network", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Big Tech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siri", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Siri"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safari_(web_browser)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Safari (web browser)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual_Property", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual Property", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Lifestyle", "label": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Lifestyle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/00MIaamEqC6uvVzTHZBZj1m/hero-image.fill.size_1200x675.v1722427110.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9778318", "eventUri": "eng-9778318", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-01", "textStart": 311, "textEnd": 317}], "sentiment": -0.2, "wgt": 152, "relevance": 1}

NVDA itself is already up more than 130% year-to-date - even amid the worst tech selloff since the AI bull market began in early 2023.!\n\nBut we believe the AI industry is rapidly approaching a critical inflection point. And soon, a different kind of stock will reign supreme.\n\nMove aside, chip stocks. It's time for the software stock boom.\n\nFor nearly two years, AI chip stocks have been the market's biggest winners because they provide the industry's 'picks and shovels.' That is, in order for companies across the globe to develop AI models, they first need chips to build those models on.\n\nIt was the AI Revolution's 'first derivative,' if you will - the first phase.\n\nBut we think that trend has mostly played out. Companies spent billions on a chip buying spree in 2023 and 2024. So, what will they do now?\n\nThanks to the chip-buying frenzy of 2023/24, companies are fully equipped to build and deploy next-generation AI models and applications in 2024/25.\n\nWe'll likely see hundreds of new applications emerge over the next 12 months. Those applications will proliferate throughout society. And by the end of 2025, we'll be drowning in AI software.\n\nOver the next 12 months, AI software will eat the world.\n\nWe're already starting to see early signs of this.\n\nC3.ai reported exceptional quarterly earnings in late May, with revenues surging 20% year-over-year and projected to increase by 23% in the following quarter. The company's management emphasized the intensifying demand for Enterprise AI, describing the interest in their applications as \"staggering.\"\n\nAmong its key achievements, C3.ai secured 13 C3 Generative AI pilots with big corporations such as ExxonMobil (XOM). It also improved its gen-AI capabilities, fine-tuning its large language models (LLMs) to be more accurate and efficient, support more than 130 languages, and introduced a visual interface to improve data integration.\n\nThese advancements demonstrate C3.ai's commitment to innovation and its ability to meet the growing demand for enterprise AI solutions.\n\nFellow AI software provider Palantir (PLTR) recently echoed the same sentiment, saying that demand for its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) software is very strong.\n\nAnd just last week, Alphabet (GOOGL) reported strengthening growth in its core cloud business due to accelerating demand for its infrastructure and generative AI solutions.\n\nThe company also reported that its core Search business is benefitting from new features like AI Overviews, which is proving very popular among younger users.\n\nWhat's more, management mentioned AI about 100 times on the quarterly conference call, with CEO Sundar Pichai emphasizing that currently, the risk of Alphabet underinvesting in AI is far bigger than the risk of overinvesting.\n\nOur takeaway? One of the world's largest tech companies is going all-in with AI - and has no intention of slowing down anytime soon.\n\nIt seems pretty clear to us that the AI software boom is kicking off.\n\nWe think this boom will give rise to some huge stock winners.\n\nAfter all, the Dot-Com Boom - which we view as a great parallel for the AI Boom - also played out in two phases: an infrastructure boom followed by a software boom.\n\nThe infrastructure boom occurred throughout the 1990s, as the telecom infrastructure necessary to power the internet was built out. Internet hardware stocks like Qualcomm (QCOM) soared during this era.\n\nThis was followed by the software boom of the 2000s and 2010s. Internet applications and services were built atop the infrastructure that was established in the 1990s. And during this era, internet software stocks like Amazon (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX), and Microsoft (MSFT) soared.\n\nA year ago, I teamed up with investing experts Louis Navellier and Eric Fry to talk about how AI would impact every aspect of the economy and markets. Fast-forward to today, and everything we've predicted is playing out.\n\nAlthough AI continues to dominate the financial news and stock market, millions of investors remain in the dark about a new AI breakthrough. New research shows thousands of stocks could soon be impacted by this new breakthrough...\n\nThe AI revolution is entering a new phase, shifting focus from hardware to software. Companies like Nvidia have already seen significant gains in this second phase... but the real opportunity lies in identifying the next Amazon, Netflix, or Microsoft of the AI era.\n\nThis transition presents us with a unique investment opportunity -- one that's about to send shockwaves through the stock market. And we want to make sure you know about it.\n\nThat's why, last Friday, I teamed up with Louis and Eric to hold an urgent AI discussion about this crucial shift where AI software stocks will outperform chipmakers and developers.\n\nWe revealed the immediate steps to protect yourself from impending destruction while potentially multiplying your investment tenfold as the AI revolution enters \"Phase 2.\"", "source": {"uri": "investorplace.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "InvestorPlace"}, "authors": [{"uri": "eric_fry@investorplace.com", "name": "Eric Fry", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C3.ai", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "C3.ai"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Derivative (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_trend", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Market trend"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fine-tuning_(machine_learning)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fine-tuning (machine learning)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Large language model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alphabet Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_Enterprise", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Star Trek: Enterprise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palantir_Technologies", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palantir Technologies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_integration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Data integration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fellow", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fellow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ExxonMobil", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ExxonMobil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunications", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Telecommunications"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sundar_Pichai", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sundar Pichai"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dot-com bubble"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Qualcomm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stock market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research_and_Analysis", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research and Analysis", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Business", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Companies", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Companies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Software", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Software", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Strategy_and_Forecasting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Strategy and Forecasting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 70}], "image": "https://investorplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ai-stock-in-hand.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9778318", "eventUri": "eng-9778318", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 151, "relevance": 1}

This practice involves refining textual inputs to ensure precise responses from AI models.\n\nBy strategically crafting prompts, professionals aim to guide AI systems towards more accurate and contextually relevant outputs. It has significantly enhanced AI applications across industries, facilitating better customer interactions, content generation and data analysis.\n\nHowever, recent discussions raise concerns about its long-term viability amid the rapidly-evolving landscape of AI development.\n\nTo optimise AI's performance and relevance, prompt engineering customises textual inputs using linguistic finesse and deep knowledge of specific AI tools. While pivotal for current AI applications, its future faces intrinsic challenges:\n\nTechnological advancements: New AI models increasingly autonomously generate prompts with higher accuracy and relevance. This progress suggests a future where AI systems may require less human intervention in generating textual inputs, potentially reducing the need for specialised prompt engineering skills.\n\nDependency on AI models: The effectiveness of prompt engineering varies across different AI platforms and versions due to unique response patterns and language nuances. This diversity necessitates tailored approaches that may not generalise well across diverse AI environments.\n\nSustainability concerns: Discussions highlight the sustainability of prompt engineering as AI technologies advance. The rise of autonomous prompt creation in newer AI models challenges the ongoing relevance of human-engineered prompts, signalling a potential shift in AI interaction paradigms.\n\nIn contrast to the fleeting character of prompt engineering, problem formulation emerges as a core ability that brings with it an enduring significance in the period that is driven by AI.\n\nIn order to properly define and delineate difficulties, and in addition to establishing the framework for meaningful engagements with AI and novel solutions, problem formulation is required.\n\nWhen prompt engineering is contrasted with problem formulation, the difference between the two becomes abundantly evident. The primary objective of prompt engineering is to improve the relevance of AI replies by optimising textual inputs. In order to construct prompts that effectively elicit desired outputs, this skill requires verbal dexterity, as well as a profound mastery of specific information technology tools.\n\nProblem formulation, on the other hand, focuses on determining the core problem or purpose that AI is intended to handle. To guarantee that interactions with AI are in line with strategic objectives and obstacles that are encountered in the real world, it is necessary to conduct a comprehensive analysis and to frame problems within their proper contexts. Professionals are able to direct AI platforms towards more impactful and specialised solutions by specifying the appropriate problem parameters. As a result, problem formulation is an essential ability for efficiently navigating the intricacies of AI applications.\n\nProfessionals can cultivate proficiency in problem formulation using key strategies informed by industry insights:\n\nProblem diagnosis: Involves employing methodologies such as the \"Five Whys\" to uncover root causes and establish primary objectives for AI-driven solutions. The \"Five Whys\" technique is a problem-solving approach aimed at getting to the core of an issue by repeatedly asking \"why\" until the fundamental cause of a problem is identified. Each \"why\" helps peel back layers of symptoms to reveal deeper underlying factors contributing to the issue.\n\nProblem decomposition: Break down complex challenges into manageable sub-problems, facilitating clarity and targeted solution development in AI interactions.\n\nProblem reframing: Explore alternate perspectives and interpretations of problems to broaden solution horizons and overcome creative bottlenecks.\n\nProblem constraint design: Define boundaries and criteria for exploring AI solutions, aligning efforts with specific contexts and desired outcomes.\n\nWhile prompt engineering meets current needs for optimising AI interactions, its sustainability amidst rapid technological advancements remains debated. Investing in problem formulation equips professionals with the agility and foresight needed to navigate the evolving AI landscape effectively.\n\nWhile prompt engineering remains a critical component of current AI systems, its reliance on specific models and methodologies raises concerns about its long-term viability. As the landscape of AI continues to evolve rapidly, there is a growing realisation that placing a stronger emphasis on problem formulation as a core competency is essential.\n\nMastering problem formulation is increasingly recognised as pivotal for driving innovation, achieving strategic objectives, and fully harnessing the transformative potential of AI. In today's dynamic environment, where AI technologies are reshaping industries and societal norms, the ability to define and analyse problems with precision is crucial. It allows individuals and organisations not only to adapt to technological advancements but also to proactively shape the future of AI applications.\n\nBy prioritising problem formulation, stakeholders can navigate uncertainties effectively and steer AI initiatives towards solutions that are not only technically sound but also strategically aligned with real-world challenges. This approach ensures that AI efforts are focused on addressing root causes rather than just symptoms, thereby enhancing their relevance and impact over time.\n\nAs AI becomes increasingly integrated into business operations and everyday life, the ability to master problem formulation emerges as a cornerstone skill for sustainable innovation and strategic success in the AI-driven era.", "source": {"uri": "itweb.co.za", "dataType": "news", "title": "ITWeb"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prompt_engineering", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prompt engineering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applications_of_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Applications of artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sustainability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_analysis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Data analysis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Natural language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_whys", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Five whys"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradigm", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paradigm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Information technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Medical diagnosis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_solving", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Problem solving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stakeholder_(corporate)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stakeholder (corporate)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Mechanical_Engineering", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Mechanical Engineering", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Chemical_Engineering", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Chemical Engineering", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Engineering", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Engineering", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Reliability_Engineering", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Reliability Engineering", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.itweb.co.za/static/pictures/2023/09/Johan-Steyn-IIN-2023.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9778318", "eventUri": "eng-9778318", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 150, "relevance": 1}

She noted that these multilateral discussions help identify safety and security risks that may occur differently in different parts of the world and provide local and regional context to translate data better.\n\nShe added that Singapore has conversations with China on AI governance and policies, and works closely with the US government across the AI ecosystem.\n\n\"It is important to invest in international collaborations because the more we understand what is at stake, and know we have friends and partners to guide us through the journey, we'll be better off for it,\" Phua said.\n\nThis might prove particularly valuable as generative AI (gen AI) is used increasingly in cyber attacks.\n\nAlso: Generative AI advancements will force companies to think big and move fast\n\nIn Singapore, for example, 13% of phishing emails analyzed last year were found to contain AI-generated content, according to the latest Singapore Cyber Landscape 2023 report released this week by the Cyber Security Agency (CSA).\n\nThe government agency responsible for the country's cybersecurity operations said 4,100 phishing attempts were reported to the Singapore Cyber Emergency Response Team (SingCERT) last year -- down 52% from the 8,500 cases in 2022. The 2023 figure, however, is still 30% higher than 2021, CSA noted.\n\nAlso: AI is changing cybersecurity and businesses must wake up to the threat\n\n\"This decline bucked a global trend of sharp increases, which were likely fueled by the usage of gen AI chatbots like ChatGPT to facilitate the production of phishing content at scale,\" it detailed.\n\nIt also warned that cybersecurity researchers have predicted a rise in the scale and sophistication of phishing attacks, including AI-assisted or -generated phishing email messages that are tailored to the victim and contain additional content, such as deep fake voice messages.\n\n\"The use of Gen AI has brought a new dimension to cyber threats. As AI becomes more accessible and sophisticated, threat actors will also become better at exploiting it,\" said CSA's chief executive and Commissioner of Cybersecurity David Koh.\n\n\"As it is, AI already poses a formidable challenge for governments around the world [and] cybersecurity professionals would know that we are merely scratching the surface of gen AI's potential, both for legitimate applications and malicious uses,\" Koh said. He pointed to reports of AI-generated content, including deepfakes in video clips and memes, that have been used to sow discord and influence the outcome of national elections.\n\nAlso: Cyberdefense will need AI capabilities to safeguard digital borders\n\nAt the same time, there are new opportunities for AI to be tapped to enhance cyber resilience and defense, he said. More specifically, the technology has shown potential in detecting abnormal behavioral patterns and ingesting large volumes of data logs and threat intel, he noted.\n\n\"[This] can enhance incident response and enable us to thwart cyber threats more swiftly and accurately while alleviating the load on our analysts,\" Koh said.\n\nHe added that the Singapore government also is working on various efforts to ensure AI is trustworthy, safe, and secure.", "source": {"uri": "zdnet.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ZDNet"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Singapore"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Singapore"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Phishing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Computer security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Risk management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Digital economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberattack", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cyberattack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Space_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Canadian Space Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecosystem", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ecosystem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Government agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deepfake", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Deepfake"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incident_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Incident management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Singapore", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Government of Singapore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_meme", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internet meme"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Email"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Rethinking_Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Rethinking Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/b9260b45228f80192702c2532ac1305426c2e353/2024/07/31/2e628136-942e-48aa-a8dd-8d8f59f790bf/software-globe-adventtr072024.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9778318", "eventUri": "eng-9778318", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3333333333333333, "wgt": 148, "relevance": 1}

The inaugural report, The 2024 Retail AI Index, was developed by Lily AI, a technology platform specializing in AI solutions for retailers and brands, in partnership with global analytics and strategy consultancy, Radii Group. The Retail AI Index is a quantitative meta-analysis of the adoption of AI technologies that benchmarked retailers in the apparel, footwear, beauty, and home segments.\n\n\"AI continues to empower retail leaders to reshape and modernize the customer experience, and it's critical for all retailers to understand where they stand,\" said Purva Gupta, Co-founder and CEO, Lily AI. \"AI is becoming table stakes for retailers who want to stay competitive. Not surprisingly, the biggest of the bigs--Amazon and Walmart--have the resources to invest in AI extensively. But, as we found, even relatively smaller companies, such as Poshmark and Revolve, are taking highly innovative approaches and reaping the benefits.\"\n\nThe top 10 retailers and brands in the AI index include:\n\nAmazonWalmartStitch FixeBayWayfairSam's ClubTargetThe Home DepotMacy'sNike\n\nLily's investigation delved deeper than financial investments to uncover which retailers had thoroughly embedded AI throughout their operations. The index revealed that numerous companies leverage a diverse array of AI technologies, including computer vision and generative AI, to enhance operational efficiency. These leading retailers and brands are also harnessing AI to bolster decision-making, boost sales through improved customer experiences, and optimize marketing initiatives. This multifaceted approach demonstrates how AI has become integral to various aspects of modern retail, from back-end processes to customer-facing interactions.\n\nKey findings include:\n\nWhile the index's top performing retailers' revenues exceed $10 billion, the variance in the ranking -- from #1 Amazon to #46, BJ's Wholesale Club, shows the differing public-facing priorities of AI. Both Amazon and Walmart (#2) lead in AI adoption and continue to leverage substantial financial resources to invest in advanced AI technologies and talent.No clear correlation exists between a retailer's index rank and overall revenue, suggesting retail is still in nascent stages of AI integration and it is too early to see the full financial impact.Stitch Fix, a retailer with $1.6 billion in revenue in 2023, is ranked number 3. Stitch Fix stands out because they leverage several AI-based technologies to deliver personalized shopping, building on their original business model of tailored/recommended clothing bundles. Stitch Fix illustrates how mid-size companies can move toward significant AI adoption with focused investments that drive revenue and advance their mission while building on existing data and models.Some companies with a higher AI adoption rankings have acquired or joined in strategic partnerships with AI firms, such as Wayfair's (#5) acquisition of LLM startup ThirdAI and IKEA's (#20) investment in Waaabi, a generative AI autonomous truck company.Poshmark, another retailer with revenues of under $1 billion, came in at #18. They recently introduced an AI-powered tool called Promoted Closet which uses machine learning to match shoppers' search terms with promoted listings. Not only does Promoted Closet contribute to a more enjoyable customer journey, but it also increases visibility and sales potential for sellers.Another retailer with revenues around the billion dollar mark at $1.1 billion, Revolve, came in at number 19. Through their innovative partnership with AI Fashion Week, Revolve sold AI-designed clothing on their website. They showcased three winning collections created using AI image generators such as Midjourney and Stable Diffusion.\n\nTo learn more and to download a full copy of the index, please visit lily.ai\n\nMethodology\n\nRetailers selected based upon criteria including revenue size, category focus, and geographic focus.Benchmarking parameters included an evaluation of each retailer across four dimensions:Talent/Operations -- measuring internal capabilities through the number of employees, the proportion of AI talent relative to total employees, and AI-related job roles and postings.Company/Financial -- gauging historical and future investments in AI by analyzing financial documents and earnings calls for mentions of AI-related terms.Technical -- evaluated the implementation of AI technologies on retailer websites, categorizing applications into levels of AI adoption including automation, analytical AI, personalization, and generative AI.News/Media -- assessed AI-related marketing initiatives and media presence the analysis of media mentions and press releases.The Retail AI Index combines thousands of publicly-available data points from first-party and third-party sources, including public filings, earnings calls, investor presentations, LinkedIn, Meltwater, Indeed, and BuiltWith.\n\nAbout Lily AI\n\nLily AI is a female-founded retail technology company empowering retailers and brands by bridging the gap between merchant-speak and customer-speak.

It could lead to overall economic expansion, creating new jobs in entirely new sectors\n\nAI will revolutionise the economy and bring about enormous changes, but the unemployment issue still exists. This is challenged by a recent statement made by Kunal Shah from CRED, who believes that India might have overstated the threat AI posed to jobs.\n\n\"We are underestimating the second order impact of just a 10% productivity increase across a population with AI and overestimating AI's impact on job displacement,\" said Shah.\n\nShah contends that the loss of jobs shouldn't be the only issue. He highlights how AI has the ability to significantly increase productivity.\n\nImagine a 10% increase in productivity across the Indian workforce. might lead to a larger than 10% economic growth due to factors like increased innovation and new business creation.\n\nThis increased productivity wouldn't be confined to individual companies. It could lead to overall economic expansion, creating new jobs in entirely new sectors, just as the Industrial Revolution gave rise to new professions.\n\nThis is similar to what AIM said earlier about there being jobs for ten times the developers. Contrary to popular belief, the tech job market is booming with a high demand for specific skills. All developers have to do is move beyond being \"generic software engineers.\"\n\nThis is applicable for every field. With the help of AI, people will be able to do multiple jobs at once and even become overemployed. This isn't uncommon as several employees already moonlight in addition to their regular day jobs. But in the future, it will constitute a major part of the economy.\n\nSadly, most conversations focus on how AI is going to take over jobs, missing the broader potential for AI to enhance productivity and create new opportunities.\n\nAs per a report by RIS, 83 per cent of the executives of large organisations surveyed said that AI has created new job roles and 67 percent of such new jobs were created at the level of manager or above.\n\nEven Meta chief scientist Yaan LeCun has said, \"AI won't take your job. But it will transform it and create new ones.\"\n\nLinus Torvalds, the creator of the Linux operating system also supported the sentiment. In a recent interview, he said that it is premature to worry about the potential disappearance of jobs due to AI advancements.\n\n\"We should wait and see what happens in the next 10 years before we start worrying about the imminent disappearance of jobs,\" Torvalds stated.\n\nThis largely supports what Shah is saying. Instead of fearing AI replacing us, we should view it as a tool that will transform our jobs. After all, the World Economic Forum predicted that AI would not only replace 85 million jobs by 2025, but also create 97 million jobs at the same time.\n\nAI has increased the overall standard or expectation for skills in various professions. While some tasks might become automated, others will evolve, and new ones will emerge. The key lies in adaptation and continuous learning.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with AIM, Tech Mahindra's former CEO C P Gurnani also said, \"The industry is changing very fast. Do not assume that your degree is sufficient to keep you employed or successful. Stay up to date with the fundamentals and keep adapting to the changes.\"\n\nAccording to a recent IBM survey, executives believe 40% of their workforce will need to reskill over the next three years due to AI and automation initiatives.\n\n\"That translates to 1.4 billion of the 3.4 billion people in the global workforce, according to World Bank statistics,\" the study's authors stated.\n\nSo, it's no surprise that IBM's AI chief, Matthew Candy, stated that people may no longer need a computer science degree to work in the tech field.\n\nCandy believes that in the age of AI, 'soft talents' such as creativity, problem-solving, and adaptability would be more valuable than the technical ones.\n\nUltimately, AI presents an exciting opportunity for India. By fostering a culture of continuous learning and adaptation, India can navigate the AI revolution and unlock its vast potential for economic growth, innovation, and job creation.

Brands need to ensure AI tools offer relevant and useful solutions that will actually resolve customers' inquiries.\n\nCX is experiencing a shift of historic proportions.\n\nThe way customers have historically interacted with brands has been largely one-dimensional, dictated by the brand rather than the customer. Whether someone is returning a product, asking a question, or seeking other customer assistance, personalization and flexibility are often lacking or entirely non-existent in the process.\n\nBut now we're seeing a reversal of the paradigm. Brands are tailoring experiences to meet the individual preferences of customers, and adopting agile communication modalities that prioritize customization, convenience, and accessibility.\n\nThe shift to a customer-first experience from traditionally static models is fueled by the integration of advanced AI technologies, particularly in customer service functions, that empower brands to better anticipate and meet customer needs. But for brands to successfully navigate this transition, they will need to leverage AI tools not just as a technological shift but as a strategic realignment toward customer-focused experiences.\n\nThe limitations of CX chatbots\n\nSix in 10 retailers currently use AI to improve customer interactions, with most focused on automating customer service and improving knowledge management through the use of scripted chatbots. But as brands increasingly prioritize AI-enhanced CX, they have found that simplistic, generic chatbots are falling short.\n\nIn fact, 90% of customers still prefer customer service from a human rather than a chatbot; more than half say that humans understand their needs better, provide more thorough explanations, and offer less frustrating experiences compared to a standard chatbot. As AI tools grow more sophisticated and convenient, that experience is bound to change.\n\nHow can brands integrate AI tools that provide greater value and better experiences for customers? There are two core challenges they must first address: The performance of AI-enhanced CX tools, and their dependability.\n\nTo start, AI tools should provide accurate results and responses that are aligned with the brand's policies and practices. Brands need to ensure AI tools offer relevant and useful solutions that will actually resolve customers' inquiries.\n\nIn addition, AI results must be accurate, consistent, and dependable. While variability can enrich the customer experience with more personalized and engaging interactions, it requires careful oversight to ensure responses don't deviate from expected standards or produce harmful, misleading, and inappropriate information. When this oversight is missing, cars get sold for $1 and managers are illegally advised to take a cut of their employees' tips.\n\nChatbots can't solve these complex challenges without human assistance, coaching, and guidance; they don't have capabilities advanced enough to handle the wide array of unique customer interactions. Instead, brands need sophisticated AI tools that can tailor experiences to the unique context and preferences of each customer.\n\nHow retailers can leverage AI agents to enhance CX\n\nAs brands look to develop customer-first experiences, many retailers are making the switch from simple, scripted chatbots to advanced AI agents, intelligent and adaptive AI interfaces that enable more responsive and personalized interactions with customers through their preferred channels, modalities, and languages.\n\nBy leveraging AI agents, you can bring your CX to a new level. The following best practices can help you get started.\n\n1. Onboard AI like a new employee\n\nUnlike previous generations of scripted chatbots, which offer predictable and static responses, AI agents are sophisticated, autonomous systems capable of learning, making decisions, and adapting to complex information -- eliciting unique responses based on context and interpretation that mirror human conversation. That's why it's crucial to treat AI agents like new employees, with AI managers onboarding, guiding, and managing AI agents similar to humans. You should start with rigorous onboarding that provides AI systems with a detailed understanding of your brand's identity, organizational values, and customer service practices. Similar to other onboarding processes, make sure your organizational knowledge base is up to date,well-organized, and accessible, with prepared documents and APIs in place to provide AI tools with seamless integration into your systems.\n\nLikewise, AI managers should develop a clear understanding of AI capabilities to determine whether systems can manage complex tasks, such as handling multiple queries simultaneously, providing personalized recommendations for customers, and offering consistent, contextually appropriate responses.\n\n2. Concentrate on one channel, then promote\n\nThe ideal CX supports continuous conversation between customers and your brand across messaging, voice, email, and other customer touchpoints. That should be your end goal, but it doesn't need to be your starting point.\n\nInstead, start by concentrating on a single channel and refining your AI capabilities before promoting your AI agent to other channels. This approach allows AI agents to adapt to various scenarios, communication styles, and customer preferences, paving the way for a more cohesive customer service experience across channels.\n\n3. Continuously train and test systems\n\nAI systems are only as good as the data that fuels them. That's why AI agents need continuous coaching based on the latest data, customer feedback, and evolving market trends to ensure they continue to meet industry-specific customer service needs. In doing so, it's most effective to use your own data and metrics to refine AI agents based on your brand's identity, customer base, and the various scenarios in which the AI will operate.\n\nLikewise, it's crucial to rigorously test and monitor systems to assess how they are performing and ensure they meet predefined standards of performance safety and alignment with brand values. While companies have traditionally focused on measuring containment -- the number of AI interactions that lead to a reduction in direct customer service interactions with a human representative -- you should instead target metrics to gauge whether your AI agent is helping customers and resolving their inquiries.\n\nBy implementing ongoing coaching and robust performance testing, brands can ensure their AI tools deliver high-quality interactions that offer effective service solutions while complying with policies and practices.\n\nCommitting to the customer-first experience\n\nIn retail and elsewhere, customers' needs and expectations now dictate the flow of conversation and shape of communication: Seven in 10 customers expect personalized interactions from companies, and more than three-quarters get upset when that's not the case.\n\nIt's up to brands to ensure their AI tools and practices provide the level of flexibility, personalization, and scalability that customers now expect.\n\nBy committing to a customer-first mentality, brands can revolutionize their customer service into a more adaptive, responsive, and personalized function -- and follow the lead of customers wherever they might head in the future.", "source": {"uri": "retailcustomerexperience.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Retail Customer Experience"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Customer service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leverage_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Leverage (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Knowledge management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradigm_shift", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paradigm shift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradigm", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paradigm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accessibility", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Accessibility"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_robot", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Autonomous robot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_practice", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Best practice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Personalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_experience", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Customer experience"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "API"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_base", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Knowledge base"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalability", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scalability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Email"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Customer_Management", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Customer Management", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Branding", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Branding", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Customer_Service/Software", "label": "dmoz/Business/Customer Service/Software", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Customer_Service/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Customer Service/Consulting", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 48}], "image": "https://nmgprod.s3.amazonaws.com/media/file/45/c0/8c7058f0890e04b1b14008b8b440/cover_image__mPyth1w7__aichat.jpeg.760x400_q85_crop_upscale.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9778318", "eventUri": "eng-9778318", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 145, "relevance": 1}

However, this rapid advancement brings along vast considerations regarding data protection.\n\nAI tools are becoming indispensable in modern workplaces. Co-Pilot can help find your documents, automate repetitive tasks, debug etc. AI assistants can transcribe meetings, summarise key points and even schedule follow-up actions. These tools help save time and ensure that information is captured and distributed, enhancing productivity and collaboration within teams.\n\nThe Data Protection (Jersey) Law 2018 sets out precise requirements for how personal data sets are processed, emphasising principles such as lawfulness, fairness and transparency. These tools handle vast amounts of data and therefore compliance with DPJL is essential to ensure that personal data is protected. Using AI within the workplace must be balanced with responsible data management, as complying with the principles of DPJL is not just a legal obligation but also a fundamental aspect of ethical business practices.\n\nThere are numerous benefits, but over-reliance on AI can pose significant risks. One primary concern is the accuracy of AI-generated outputs. AI systems are only as good as the data they are trained on. The transcripts produced by AI assistants may be inaccurate or misleading.\n\nData minimisation is a crucial principle; only necessary personal data should be processed. AI tools must be used in a manner that aligns with this principle. Organisations should regularly audit their AI systems to ensure they are not collecting or processing excessive personal data.\n\nConsider an AI meeting assistant that records and transcribes meeting conversations. This tool collects personal data from all attendees, such as voices and potentially sensitive information discussed during the meeting.\n\nUnder the DPJL, the organisation must inform attendees about the recording prior to processing any data. Before a meeting begins, the organisation should notify all participants about the use of the AI assistant. Participants should be given the option to opt out of the recording.\n\nMoreover, the organisation must have processes in place to manage any requests for data access, correction or deletion related to the meeting recordings. If an attendee requests that their speech be deleted from the transcription, the organisation must be able to comply with this request promptly unless they can show a legal obligation to retain it.\n\nTraining employees on the importance of data protection and the correct use of AI tools is equally vital.\n\nConclusion\n\nAI is undoubtedly transforming the workplace, bringing about unprecedented efficiencies and capabilities. However, with great power comes great responsibility. As AI continues to evolve, so too must our approaches to data protection and compliance.\n\nAdhering to the principles of DPJL, organisations can harvest AI's benefits while ensuring the integrity and security of personal data.\n\nPropelfwd offers expert guidance and support. From conducting data protection impact assessments to implementing comprehensive data protection strategies, Propelfwd can help ensure your AI integrations comply with the DPJL.

However, these AI algorithms often require extensive training times and struggle to pinpoint specific components in an anomalous state. Furthermore, AI's decision-making processes are frequently opaque, leading to concerns about trust and accountability.\n\nTo help combat this, the team brought in a number of measures to boost efficiency including:\n\nEnhanced Anomaly Detection: Researchers employed two cutting-edge anomaly detection algorithms with significantly shorter training times and faster detection capabilities, while maintaining comparable efficiency rates. These algorithms were tested using a dataset from the operational water treatment testbed, SWaT, at the Singapore University of Technology and Design.Explainable AI (XAI) Integration: To enhance transparency and trust, the team integrated eXplainable AI (XAI) models with the anomaly detectors. This approach allows for better interpretation of AI decisions, enabling human operators to understand and verify AI recommendations before making critical decisions. The effectiveness of various XAI models was also evaluated, providing insights into which models best aid human understanding.Human-Centric Decision Making: The research emphasizes the importance of human oversight in AI-driven decision-making processes. By explaining AI recommendations to human operators, the team aims to ensure that AI acts as a decision-support tool rather than an unquestioned oracle. This methodology introduces accountability, as human operators make the final decisions based on AI insights, policy, rules, and regulations.Scoring System Development: A meaningful scoring system is being developed to measure the perceived correctness and confidence of the AI's explanations. This score aims to assist human operators in gauging the reliability of AI-driven insights.\n\nThese advancements not only improve the efficiency and reliability of AI systems in CNIs but also ensure that human operators remain integral to the decision-making process, enhancing overall accountability and trust.\n\nDr Sarad Venugopalan, co-author of the study, explained: \"Humans learn by repetition over a longer period of time and work for shorter hours without being error prone. This is why, in some cases, we use machines that can carry out the same tasks in a fraction of the time and at a reduced error rate.\n\n\"However, this automation, involving cyber and physical components, and subsequent use of AI to solve some of the issues brought by the automation, is treated as a black box. This is detrimental because it is the personnel using the AI recommendation that is held accountable for the decisions made by them, and not the AI itself.\n\n\"In our work, we use explainable AI, to increase transparency and trust, so the personnel using the AI is informed why the AI made the recommendation (for our domain use case) before a decision is made.\"\n\nThis research is part of the MSc thesis of Mathuros Kornkamon, under the supervision of Dr Sridhar Adepu.\n\nDr Adepu added: \"This work discovers how WaXAI is revolutionizing anomaly detection in industrial systems with explainable AI. By integrating XAI, human operators gain clear insights and enhanced confidence to handle security incidents in critical infrastructure.\"\n\n/Public Release.

Still, any pullbacks in these stocks present a buying opportunity. We are in the early innings of a new technological era that could continue for decades.\n\nNvidia's (NASDAQ:NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang calls this ongoing shift to accelerating computing the next industrial revolution. Bloomberg Intelligence research shows that generative AI will grow at a 42% compounded annual growth rate over the next 10 years. As AI proliferates through industries such as education, gaming and life sciences, it will spur an investment cycle in AI training and inference.\n\nThese three AI stocks are at the forefront of the generative AI infrastructure buildout. One is a key supplier enabling the buildout of AI data centers. The other two provide the semiconductors and networking infrastructure needed to accelerate computing for generative AI training and inference.\n\nAs cloud service providers (CSPs) build out AI data centers to support large language model training and inference, Vertiv (NYSE:VRT) is well-positioned to benefit. It sells the entire critical infrastructure for data centers and has 50 years of experience in the industry.\n\nVertiv's advantages are clear: instead of offering one-point products, it provides a comprehensive end-to-end solution. First, it offers thermal management solutions that include liquid cooling technologies. Secondly, its portfolio includes data center power management products like transformers, distribution units, busways and microgrid integration capabilities. These solutions, plus its IT systems, offer an integrated end-to-end solution for CSPs.\n\nAfter declining by over 15% over the past three months, Vertiv has become one of the interesting AI stocks to consider. After all, Q2 results highlighted the continued demand momentum across the business. Notably, this was another beat and raise quarter for Vertiv, as organic orders rose by 57% and organic net sales grew 14%.\n\nIn the quarter, adjusted operating margins hit 19.6%, a 510-basis points margin expansion. In response, the company raised its profit and free cash flow guidance for 2024. Now, management expects adjusted EPS between $2.47 - $2.53. Thus, using the low-end guidance, it trades at 31 times EPS, a fair multiple given the AI tailwinds ahead.\n\nToday, most of the investment in AI is happening in the enabling layer - chip design, semiconductors and data centers. A significant portion is going towards building data centers powered by Nvidia chips. Nvidia is in a one-horse race because its Hopper and new Blackwell chips have a huge performance advantage.\n\nShifting the trillion-dollar installed base of traditional data centers to AI ones spells a multi-year tailwind for Nvidia. That's why Bank of America doubled down on shares with a $150 price target. Analyst Vivek Arya notes that generative AI deployments are in the second year of a potential 3-5-year investment cycle.\n\nIts new Blackwell chips are already in production and will be on the market later this year. This increases Nvidia's revenue visibility into next year. Moreover, the company is combining its Grace CPU, Blackwell GPUs, NVLink, Quantum, Spectrum, mix and switches, high-speed interconnects and CUDA ecosystem to offer a complete solution to customers.\n\nAs of this writing, NVDA stock is one of the bargain AI stocks after pulling back from $140 to $113. At a forward non-GAAP price-to-earnings of 41, NVDA is trading below its 5-year average of 47. That's too cheap for a stock expected to grow revenues by 97% this fiscal year.\n\nToday, Broadcom counts Google as its largest customer, producing their TPUs. Besides, it's already working with Microsoft and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) on custom AI chips. Considering Broadcom is the leader in custom silicon, this is a massive tailwind.\n\nAt the same time, its AI networking revenues are soaring. In Q2 2024, the company saw strong demand from AI data center clusters for its switches, network interface cards and optical interconnects. The combined demand for AI networking and custom accelerators drove a 280% YOY surge in AI revenues to $3.1 billion.\n\nConsidering this acceleration in AI revenues, Broadcom is one of the best AI stocks. In FY2022, AI revenues were 10% of semiconductor revenues or about $2.5 billion. In FY2024, management expects this percentage to exceed 30% with AI sales of $11 billion, a quadruple from FY2022. This revenue momentum will continue into FY2025, making AVGO stock a buy.\n\nOn the date of publication, Charles Munyi did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

This isn't a dream but a reality that AI voice agents might very soon offer.\n\nOne of the common questions that leadership teams, business owners and CEOs ask us at Iffort is how they can get started with their AI voice agent journey. This guide draws on some of our lessons and provides a road map to leveraging AI voice technology effectively.\n\nSome of the questions clients and potential clients have asked us include:\n\n* Why should I even care about AI voice technology?\n\n* What business problems can an AI voice agent fix for me?\n\n* AI voice agents sound great, but how do I make sure they're as good as a real person?\n\n* What happens if someone asks the AI voice agent something it doesn't know?\n\n* I'm ready to try an AI voice agent, but where do I even start?\n\nLet's explore the answers to these questions.\n\nWhether you're in the B2B industry, dealing with complex client interactions, or in the B2C industry, managing high volumes of customer inquiries, AI voice agents can be a game changer. If you're in real estate, imagine an AI agent qualitatively assessing potential home buyers' needs, or if you're in retail, imagine an AI agent handling customer queries with near-human charm -- that's the potential you can tap into.\n\nThe first step is to pinpoint where your current business challenges lie. Then, you can look into tailoring an AI voice agent to meet these specific needs.\n\nTraining your AI voice agent isn't just about feeding it data; it's about crafting responses that reflect your brand's ethos. For some businesses, this might mean training it on industry-specific scenarios, whereas for others, it's about breadth -- covering as many potential customer interactions as possible. Both require rigorous testing to fine-tune the AI's responses, making sure it's ready to face your clients just like any well-prepared human agent would.\n\nEven after the initial training process, you must regularly update your AI agent's knowledge base to ensure it continually evolves and adapts to your business needs.\n\nLarge language models are pre-trained and hence an AI voice agent comes with built-in intelligence. When you further train the agent on your knowledge base, you make its contextual knowledge better. This takes away the frustration of chatting with a bot-like support system that generates the same repetitive responses.\n\nHowever, there are scenarios where your AI agent will encounter questions it can't answer. You can train it to use several strategies to keep the conversation productive:\n\n* Acknowledge. Example response: \"I apologize, but I don't have that information right now.\" This acknowledges the gap in knowledge while maintaining a courteous and respectful tone.\n\n* Redirect to relevant resources. Example response: \"I don't have that information, but I can direct you to our help center where you might find the answer.\"\n\n* Offer to follow up. Example response: \"I don't know the answer right now, but I can find out and get back to you.\" This is a proactive approach, showing that you value the user's query and demonstrating a commitment to providing an answer.\n\n* Escalate to human support. Example response: \"I can't answer that question, but let me connect you with a human support representative who can help.\"\n\nFirst, think about where you want to deploy the AI voice agent. Should it be on your website, your phone or both?\n\nIntegrating AI voice agents into CRM systems can improve your sales qualification process, and using them in customer-facing platforms like mobile apps ensures your consumers always have assistance anytime they need it.\n\nIntegrate AI voice agents into the channels where your customers and staff interact most frequently.\n\nThink about the entire customer journey and which parts of the support function are repetitive. If your website offers both online chat and phone calls, then it might make sense to have both AI-enabled chat and AI-enabled phone call experiences. Automating one over the other would just solve one part of the problem.\n\nAudit your customer interaction touchpoints to choose the right mix of conversational AI tools.\n\nAs with any technology handling sensitive data, securing AI voice agents is nonnegotiable. This means encrypting data transfers, ensuring compliance with privacy regulations and safeguarding customer information. Some of the privacy regulations you have may to comply with are industry-specific, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). It is relevant to businesses handling protected health information in the United States. Then there are state-specific laws such as the California Consumer Privacy Act for businesses that collect personal information from California residents.\n\nPlan to regularly update and monitor your security guardrails and conduct thorough compliance checks.\n\nThe long-term savings AI voice agents generate can offset the initial setup cost, but there are variable costs to consider, such as API calls to large language models and text-to-speech services. Keep a tab on these variables to control your costs.\n\nContinuous monitoring and reporting are as important as the initial training. You can track response accuracy, the content of call summaries and the adaptability of the agent in different scenarios. Each of these metrics offers insights into how well your AI voice agent is performing. Set up your performance metrics and schedule review meetings to keep your AI voice agent in check.\n\nAs you begin your journey with AI voice agents, remember that the goal isn't to replace the human touch but to enrich the customer experience. So, are you ready to integrate AI voice into your business workflow?\n\nForbes Agency Council is an invitation-only community for executives in successful public relations, media strategy, creative and advertising agencies.

If a satellite operator is trying to achieve a specific goal, it must consider a satellite's physical capabilities as well as available onboard resources.\n\n\"How do I leverage AI to give me courses of action that are informed by the physics under the hood?\" asked Belinda Marchand, Slingshot chief science officer.\n\nSimilarly, can AI suggest evasive or defensive actions a satellite operator may want to take when confronted with a potential threat? And is it possible to expand the puzzle to cover multiple space-based and ground-based assets?\n\n\"Multiple courses of action might be available and the trades for each one might be provided by AI,\" Marchand said.\n\nFor now, a human being remains in the loop.\n\n\"I don't believe that we're at the point that AI will completely drive those responses,\" Marchand said. \"It can certainly inform the responses.\"\n\nAnother potential AI application is helping operators manage the generation, storage and consumption of power onboard a satellite.\n\n\"It's quite complex,\" said Al Tadros, Redwire Space chief technology officer. \"Oftentimes, you either need to have large margins or you have a constraint on operations.\"\n\nParticularly near the end of a satellite's mission, there may be constraints on when and how often a specific payload can function.\n\n\"I think AI has a lot of potential in squeezing out more performance than we would traditionally have gotten out of systems,\" Tadros said.\n\nStill, panelists cited their AI-related concerns.\n\nAI models are only as good as the training data that feeds them. And information on various satellites and their capabilities is often proprietary or classified.\n\n\"AI is going to respond based on the information that you use to train it,\" Marchand said. \"If that information is incomplete or does not accurately represent the system, capabilities and constraints,\" it isn't very useful. As the saying goes, \"garbage in, garbage out.\"\n\nAnother potential problem is widespread use of AI tools by people not trained to use them.\n\n\"Do they understand where the AI is best suited to help enable them in some way?\" Salvagnini asked. \"Do they understand how to responsibly use the AI tool be able to get the outcome that they're seeking? And then, of course, there's a responsibility that's incumbent upon the person who is using the AI to fact check.\"\n\nAdditional impediments to space-based applications of AI are limited datasets. While it may seem like there are many images of objects in space, AI training requires much more data.\n\nRedwire is working with Stanford University's Center for AEroSpace Autonomy Research (CAESAR)

It found that global businesses are being held back from implementing their AI plans in full due to skills shortages and governance challenges.\n\nIt comes after Expereo had commissioned IDC research in June that revealed that chief information officers (CIOs) admitting that AI is an investment priority, just ahead of security and the cloud.\n\nAI obstacles\n\nHowever this latest IDC/Expereo research surveyed 650 CIOs from the world's largest businesses, with over $500 million revenue, across the USA, UK, Singapore, Hong Kong, Japan, Germany, and France.\n\nIt found that over one third (35 percent) of global enterprises are struggling to retain or attract crucial skills in AI, data and automation, which is threatening their optimistic AI ambitions.\n\nThis is despite AI being considered the biggest priority across the world.\n\nAnd it seems that CIOs cannot just opt to utilise external third-party suppliers or partner to help in this matter, as the research revealed that 29 percent of global CIOs have stated that their current external technology partners do not have the right capabilities in place to support AI initiatives.\n\nAnd location is also playing a part, with 28 percent of global respondents feeling regional variations in ability to implement AI initiatives is a key challenge.\n\nThe other leading obstacle to fulfilling AI ambitions include navigating AI governance and ethics (36 percent), the IDC/Expereo research found. This refers to ongoing challenges such as regulation, trust and data protection when it comes to using AI tools in a business setting.\n\nThis concern about AI regulation is backed up other recent research that found that more than a third (35 percent) of CIOs feel that a lack of clarity around regulation is the biggest obstacle they face to adopting AI.\n\nKey challenges\n\nMeanwhile this week's IDC/Expereo survey also found that 42 percent of CIOs also believe that training for new ways of working, a result of AI, is one of the biggest IT challenges in supporting remote and hybrid workers, and 39 percent said that understanding how employees use AI is now a concern.\n\nNetwork performance and flexibility are additionally among the key factors preventing companies from implementing AI at scale.\n\nWhen asked what prevents or limits their organisation's networks from supporting large data or AI projects, 38 percent of global respondents said network performance, such as application responsiveness or latency, and 38 percent of global respondents also said their networks' inability to scale flexibly on demand.\n\nIn addition, networking talent was cited as the second hardest area to recruit for, with 36 percent of global respondents citing it as a key challenge.\n\nIn fact, networking talent was even harder to recruit for than data, AI and automation, suggesting that it is more than just AI talent that organisations are struggling to onboard, it is the core infrastructure talent too.\n\nGoing forward\n\nDespite of these AI obstacles the IDC/Expereo research found that 32 percent of CIOs are moving forward with caution with AI implementation, and indeed 44 percent are excited and ready to take on AI initiatives.\n\nJust less than one in 10 global enterprises (8 percent) are not ready to take on AI at all.\n\nWhen asked how long it will be until their organisation implement AI initiatives, more than a quarter of global respondents (36 percent) expect to implement cybersecurity AI initiatives within the next 12 months.\n\n\"CIOs need to keep pace with market innovations, customer expectations and fierce competition when it comes to AI, while ensuring they are adopting the technology responsibly and effectively, without cutting corners,\" noted Ben Elms, CEO at Expereo.\n\n\"This is a difficult act to balance, and without the necessary skills in place, driven by competition for AI and core networking talent, CIOs should look to outsource crucial expertise, and partner with the right technology providers that can offer the local expertise and growth initiatives that work for them,\" said Elms.\n\n\"Networking technology, data strategies and wider tech infrastructure are all key areas which run adjacent to AI initiatives, which must also not be ignored,\" Elms concluded.\n\nRead also : UK Investigates Alphabet Partnership With AI Firm Anthropic", "source": {"uri": "silicon.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Silicon

On a good day, agency work is creative, innovative, and boundary-pushing. On a bad day, it's chaotic, stressful, even downright painful.\n\nDiscussing these challenges in a recent webinar with The Drum, in partnership with Slack, Atomic's chief executive officer Stephen Quinn, described it like \"air traffic control\", only more complicated. Every day campaigns are taking off, changing direction, going one way and then another.\n\nEvery brand and every agency wants to guide those campaigns and projects through a smooth take off and land them cleanly at the right destination. At a time when marketing budgets have dropped 15% in just one year, maximizing the good days is business-critical for agencies - it can make the difference between winning new briefs and losing essential clients.\n\nWhile this is easier said than done, progress has been made. Tools have emerged to make the lives of agencies and the brands they work with simpler and more agile.\n\nCommunication and collaboration platforms have been central to this, connecting global teams made up of agencies and in-house experts, in real-time, across time zones or hybrid offices. Meanwhile, integrating other apps - like creative tools for designers or customer relationship management platforms for sales - has meant seamless cross-functional work.\n\nToday we're on the cusp of taking this a step further, with AI emerging as the next essential for agencies and their brand partners everywhere. Marketers are ready to embrace it - with most believing generative AI will transform their role and save them time.\n\nTime is of the essence\n\nThere's always a deadline looming, a product launch approaching, or a quarter closing. More time means more space to do what we love: finding new and creative ways of making our brands standout.\n\nFirst let's be honest about why we are so time poor. Today our time isn't spent as well as it could be. We invest far too much into areas that don't drive value for us, our agencies, or our brands.\n\nThat might be repetitive administrative work like processing invoices, trying to catch up on a sea of emails after a holiday, or chasing up an approval. It's here that AI can bring some order to the chaos.\n\nI've seen this impact first hand. Recently, I coordinated Salesforce World Tour London, a huge technology conference involving thousands of different moving parts. For me, oversight was crucial. At the same time, it would have been impossible to keep up with every action taken across every team and agency involved. Enter AI.\n\nUsing Slack's recap and thread summary tools - built on AI - I received a daily update that recapped key insights, essential decisions, and next steps across the entire project.\n\nIt meant I knew exactly what was happening without having to dig into all the communication that took place. Likewise, I didn't need to ask an agency to lose their own precious time pulling together a recap for me. They could focus on delivering, and I never had to pump the brakes to ask for a status update.\n\nAcross this one project, Slack AI estimated it saved me 373 minutes in reading time by providing these summaries. That's over six hours of my time which went back into delivering an incredible event. And that's just me. Scale those time savings across all the teams and agencies involved and you see just how transformative AI can be for marketers.\n\nKeeping it human\n\nClearly, AI has a role to play in enabling marketers to do more. Equally, we need to be thoughtful about that role. Sam Pepper, group creative director at Wasserman described AI as \"the enemy of the mundane\". That's because it's those repetitive, unenjoyable tasks that AI is suited to. In contrast, it's not here to replace creativity.\n\nCreativity is a human quality - it's an area we can partner with AI, but if we simply try to offload it fully, we'll enter the age of mediocrity for campaigns. Creativity relies on another human quality - making mistakes. We shouldn't see AI as a way to cut creative corners, deliver an instant hyper-polished campaign for us, or even remove all the messiness of marketing.\n\nIt's in brainstorms full of good (and bad) ideas, working together on reviews or edits, in the push and pull of different opinions, that great creative work is born between brands and agencies. Let's focus on using AI to give us more time for that journey to creative success.\n\nJumping into the AI era\n\nMarketers are used to embracing change, from the rise of television last century to the internet and social media in this one. However, when it comes to AI many brands and agencies are unsure how to start.\n\nMy advice is to jump in. Identify a few use cases and start experimenting. It doesn't have to be a big shift - many tools, including the AI recap feature I use in Slack, require zero setup.\n\nAt the same time, think about the data AI can draw on. Having a central command center like Slack that brings everything, from your tools to your people, together, is essential for giving AI the insights it needs to deliver real value.\n\nThere will always be intensity between agencies and brands but with the help of AI we can transform that intensity into value. It can cut administrative tasks and busy diaries, and enable us to refocus our time. And it can tip the balance away from those bad days of stress and chaos, and toward the good ones of creative brilliance.", "source": {"uri": "thedrum.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Drum"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slack_(software)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Slack (software)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hybrid vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Real-time computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_traffic_control", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Air traffic control"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Productivity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_conferencing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Web conferencing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salesforce", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Salesforce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_relationship_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Customer relationship management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_director", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Creative director"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creativity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Creativity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Branding", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Branding", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/By_Ethnic_or_Cultural_Focus", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/By Ethnic or Cultural Focus", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Philosophy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Philosophy", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 57}], "image": "https://thedrum-media.imgix.net//thedrum-prod/s3/news/353347/image_54.png?w=1280&ar=default&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9778318", "eventUri": "eng-9778318", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 134, "relevance": 1}

Some schools have banned chatbot programs from being used on their networks, while others have set up policies for how it can and cannot be used.\n\n\"What we need to figure out is how we deploy it for good,\" Amo said, noting that when he was high school it was CliffsNotes -- which summarized books so you didn't have to read them -- that was plaguing teachers.\n\nHe argued the curriculum should become a regular part of K-12 education, with age-appropriate lessons teaching the \"safe, responsible and thoughtful use\" of AI and also what to avoid.\n\nThere can be confusion and misunderstanding about what AI tools can do, according to Suresh Venkatasubramanian, the director of the Center for Technological Responsibility at Brown University. He previously worked on a blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights for the White House.\n\n\"I think it's important that we train people to be more aware, more thoughtful, and in some ways critical around AI,\" Venkatasubramanian told the Globe. \"I think it's clearly important that we build a citizenry that has the sophistication and understanding of what these AI tools do, and often do not do.\"\n\nHe said banning ChatGPT and other generative AI tools in schools is an \"understandable reflex.\" But instead, schools could help students engage with the tools and see how they can \"fool\" the technology -- \"kids love to break things,\" he joked -- and discover the technology's abilities and limits.\n\n\"These tools aren't going away,\" he said, noting that teachers should have a say in how it's used in the classroom. \"The most ironic application I've heard of is the one where we use AI systems to detect the use of AI-generated content.\"\n\nRhode Island leaders have started to dip their toes into studying AI.

Before that can happen, lawyers and their clients need to develop trust in legal AI in the same way they trust an experienced associate.\n\nNearly 4 in 10 senior lawyers (37%) say their firms already use AI tools, but just 25% state they trust the technology to handle legal work, according to the LexisNexis Investing in Legal Innovation Survey.\n\nTo close this trust gap, law firms need to take some basic steps to build their lawyers' and their clients' confidence in Legal AI tools -- once rolled out, this technology can create amazing new operational efficiencies and open new revenue streams. The first step is to understand what drives trust with the introduction of new technologies.\n\nTesting new tools can help boost trust in Legal AI\n\nViews on how quickly to embrace Legal AI are still very much in flux, with the vast majority of lawyers trying to carefully gauge how to proceed. Our survey found that only one in 10 lawyers have strong opinions on AI adoption either way. This caution has led some firms to take a wait-and-see approach.\n\nBut many industry leaders are issuing a warning: Innovation is advancing so rapidly that law firms better find a way to not be left behind. Greg Lambert, chief knowledge services officer at Jackson Walker, likens the current environment to a boat that is leaving the dock -- the longer a firm waits to get on board, the further it will be out to sea and the harder it will be to catch it before it disappears.\n\nHow do firms start to close the trust gap so they can jump on board the AI boat? According to the recent Gen AI report, Gen AI in Law: A Guide to Building Trust , simply testing out new Gen AI tools can help to drive confidence among lawyers.\n\n\"We are knee-deep in testing Gen AI tools,\" said Peter Geovanes, chief innovation and AI officer at McGuire Woods. \"My favorite catchphrase that we tell our clients is we're going to do this with 'REM', which stands for a responsible, ethical and measured approach. We have success criteria, we have use cases, we're engaging with the attorneys, and we're collecting metrics and feedback. We're in a trust but verify mode -- that's how we build trust with the tool.\"\n\nBuilding trust must be central theme\n\nOne certain explanation for the trust gap, discussed in the Gen AI report, is the small number of cases in which Gen AI technology has produced inaccurate responses to queries and the lawyers involved failed to check the work output before using the AI-generated content in a court filing.\n\n\"There have been plenty of reports in the news and elsewhere as to the various ways that lawyers and law firms have gotten themselves into trouble by using generative AI without completely understanding the risks associated with it,\" said Neil Posner, a principal at Chicago law firm Much Shelist. He notes that these headlines have also created significant skepticism among judges, who in some cases are now requiring lawyers to certify either that they are not using Gen AI or they have read everything that they have cited.\n\nIt seems that the key to building trust in the technology is to increase the exposure of legal practitioners and courts to Gen AI tools. Our innovation survey uncovered that senior lawyers were more than twice as likely to trust Gen AI for legal work if they had already used it in a non-professional capacity.\n\n\"The change management process is aided mostly by getting hands-on experience with using the tools,\" said Jeff Pfeifer, chief product officer at LexisNexis. \"The more a lawyer has access to the tools, the more confident and comfortable they get interacting with the underlying capabilities.\"\n\nPfeifer notes, however, that \"there is a genuine risk in using tools that are not tuned and tailored for the legal market use cases.\"\n\nLaw firms appear to be confident the trust gap will close in time and are anticipating steadily rising adoption of Legal AI tools. Nine in 10 lawyers (90%) responding to our survey said their firms will increase Gen AI investment over the next five years.\n\nREPORT: Gen AI in Law: A Guide to Building Trust\n\nWe interviewed a variety of AI leaders from the legal profession to explore how law firms and corporations that embrace Legal AI are building trust in the use of this new technology.

A data scientist and entrepreneur with a background in finance and physics.\n\nFrom fluctuating markets and geopolitical tensions to rapid technological advancements and shifting consumer behaviors, the need for agile and informed decision making has never been greater. In the age of business consumer-friendly AI, decision intelligence tools are helping business leaders navigate the ever-changing landscape more effectively.\n\nThe wealth of data that organizations sit on is too vast to analyze without AI, yet many business leaders hesitate to use innovations like AI-powered analytics because of a lack of trust in and technical expertise with this technology. That hesitation can hold back entire organizations unless leaders find a way to truly partner with AI.\n\nAI Is A Critical -- But Challenging -- Business Partner Traditional data analysis methods are often too slow and cumbersome to keep up with the rapid pace of change in business. On the other hand, AI can process vast amounts of data in real time. This capability is crucial for making informed decisions swiftly and accurately.\n\nDespite this, 61% of people are still wary about trusting AI systems, according to a 2023 KPMG global study on the shifting public perceptions of AI. One significant hurdle in overcoming this distrust is the \"black box\" nature of many AI technologies, which makes it difficult for analysts to interpret how it arrives at certain results or recommendations. This lack of transparency leads to a reluctance to fully embrace AI-driven insights, particularly among business decision makers who are not technically inclined.\n\nOthers might be tempted to just take an actionable insight delivered by the AI and run with it, which also introduces risk. Decision makers have much more to gain with a deeper understanding of why that result creates value for the business. With clear explanations, organizations are more likely to adopt AI technologies in their data analysis, interrogate results rather than taking them at face value and then make smarter decisions.\n\nInterestingly, achieving trust in AI actually means putting your trust in another form of AI -- explainable AI (XAI), to be exact.\n\nUnlike traditional AI, which can be opaque and difficult to interpret, XAI provides clear, understandable insights into how results are determined. It does this by leveraging natural language processing (NLP) and generative AI, which enable XAI systems to present results in the form of a narrative featuring simple language and relevant charts that are generated automatically. Additionally, XAI systems generate explanations suitable for different audience,s so users won't need a data expert to help interpret them.\n\nBy breaking down complex models into understandable terms, the black box around AI is lifted, and anyone can feel empowered to use AI accurately and in alignment with business goals and values. So, what does this look like in practice?\n\nGlobal supply chain disruptions have had a significant impact on businesses and consumers over the last five years, leading to delays, increased costs and shortages. By optimizing processes and identifying inefficiencies, XAI helps businesses streamline operations and reduce costs. Clear explanations of optimization decisions ensure that all team members understand and support process improvements that can help the organization weather current disruptions.\n\nFurthermore, XAI can provide predictive analytics that forecast market trends, consumer behavior and other critical factors and provide mitigation strategies in a conversational tone, so it seems more like an advisor is instructing you rather than a machine. By explaining the next steps in the form of a narrative, analysts and non-technical users have a simpler time navigating analyses and reports.\n\nBringing on the right AI vendors is essential to succeeding in the face of uncertainty. Their track record will give you the best idea of what challenges they've helped similar organizations solve with their technology and the kind of impact this resulted in.\n\nDuring discussions with vendors, make sure you also get a good sense of their capabilities and the architecture of their platform. A good experience is just as important in helping users trust the AI's recommendations as the accuracy and explainability of the AI itself. It's always a good idea to get a proof of concept so you can see firsthand how the platform will add value to your organization. This will help you get a feel for the platform's ease of use and speed, any personalization that helps users work more efficiently and other features that will provide a best-in-class user experience.\n\nIt should be noted that not all AI vendors offer XAI capabilities. One of the challenges is that sometimes the output can be hard for humans to interpret, especially something complex like neural networks. Vendors need to get creative in the way their platform explains why the AI reached the conclusion it reached. Don't be afraid to push vendors to provide you with more information on how their XAI works and whether it fits all your use cases.\n\nExplaining data in an approachable manner is critical for improving decision-making across your company, especially when the business environment suddenly changes or a crisis arises.

The tool, called Vidu, is able to generate clips from Chinese and English text prompts.\n\nWhile text-to-video was pioneered by Sora, the three Chinese tech firms have been able to put their AI video tools in the hands of global users. In comparison, San Francisco-based start-up OpenAI, which was the first to demonstrate the function, has yet to make its tools widely available.\n\nChinese firms are also contributing to global AI development by launching open source LLMs so anyone can build their own AI systems.\n\nAlibaba Group Holding launched its Qwen2 open-source LLM family in June, which was ranked No 1 at the time by Hugging Face, a developer community for open-source AI models. Alibaba owns the South China Morning Post.\n\n\u201cQwen 72B is the king and Chinese open models are dominating overall,\u201d Hugging Face co-founder and CEO Clement Delangue said in a post on social media platform X.\n\nAnalysts partly attribute China\u2019s rapid progress in AI to its ability to work around the chip restrictions to develop the intelligent computing power required to train local LLMs.\n\nSince the US placed export restrictions on Nvidia\u2019s A100 and H100 chips \u2013 considered the gold standard for training sophisticated AI systems \u2013 in mid-2022 and later included the less powerful A800 and H800 chips, Beijing and some of the nation\u2019s tech champions have managed to build a large reservoir of intelligent computing power, thanks in part to locally developed solutions.\n\n\u201cLooking at the numbers, domestic computing power has been racking up rapidly, as many state-owned-enterprises and regional [governments] are tasked with [developing] intelligent computing power,\u201d said Li Yangwei, a Beijing-based technical consultant working in the field.\n\nLi added that chips developed by local firms, such as Huawei Technologies, have gained popularity, and that Huawei\u2019s Ascend solution is China\u2019s best shot in developing a home-grown AI infrastructure.\n\nHuawei\u2019s Ascend 910B AI chip has been found in some tests to deliver between 80 per cent and 120 per cent of the performance of Nvidia\u2019s A100 when training LLMs, Wang Tao, chief operating officer of Jiangsu Kunpeng Ecosystem Innovation Centre, said on the sidelines of the Nanjing World Semiconductor Conference in June.\n\nZhang Yi, founder and chief analyst at technology consultancy iiMedia, said the buildout of computing resources infrastructure by the state has also helped alleviate anxiety over the lack of advanced chips.\n\nWhen compared with other nations, China\u2019s vast market size and public sector demand for AI and its applications are advantageous to further AI progress in the country, according to Zhang.\n\n\u201cChina has a comprehensive and complete manufacturing industrial production system \u2026 [and] many entities are in dire need of improving their efficiency, so that\u2019s where AI could be tapped,\u201d he said.", "source": {"uri": "scmp.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "South China Morning Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Altogether this is one of the most transformative changes to how people work that we've seen in decades. As we move from proof of concepts to enterprise-wide rollouts, it's increasingly important that companies ensure these tools add value and don't create additional problems.\n\nThis is something we understand at Synechron. I'm currently working with teams helping thousands of people across financial services to set up and work alongside AI assistants. And this is a huge adjustment - you can't expect people to adapt to this level of change overnight. We've found that organization-wide training - led by a team of AI experts embedded with business teams - is critical to ensuring that people understand exactly what these tools can and cannot do to add value and remain safe. This is also why so many organizations are using trusted third-party providers, as this expertise just doesn't exist in-house.\n\nA comprehensive security framework must go beyond the basic disclaimers at the bottom of AI assistant searches. Companies need to establish what information is reliable. This means we have to educate employees on the differences between secure internal datasets and open internet sources. Also, they need to know about fact-checking to mitigate the risks of model hallucination and be aware of ethical and regulatory issues. For financial firms, it's also vital that they work inside controlled environments, especially when dealing with private or sensitive data.\n\nFrom a security and privacy point of view, there are valid concerns about using generative AI tools at work. As with the adoption of cloud services, we must ensure data remains secure in transit and at rest. Companies must know precisely where their data is going - is it a secured cloud environment or an open public system like ChatGPT? The lack of transparency around how data gets ingested, processed and used by these AI 'black box' models is a big concern for some organizations.\n\nCertain tools simply aren't suited to enterprise use cases that involve sensitive information. ChatGPT is designed for public consumption and may not prioritize the same security and privacy guardrails as an enterprise-grade system. Meanwhile, offerings like GitHub Copilot generate code directly in the IDE, based on user prompts, which could inadvertently introduce vulnerabilities if that code runs without review.\n\nLooking ahead, the integration of AI into operating systems and productivity tools will likely exacerbate these challenges. Microsoft's new feature, Recall, captures screenshots of everything you do and creates a searchable timeline, raising concerns about surveillance overreach and data misuse by malicious actors. Compliance departments must compare - and then align - these technology features with regulatory requirements around reporting and data collection.\n\nAs AI capabilities expand and become more autonomous, we risk ceding critical decisions that impact user privacy and rights to these systems. The good news is that established cloud providers like Azure, AWS, and GCP offer secure, isolated environments in which to deploy AI models integrated with enterprise authentication safely. Companies can also choose to run large language models (LLMs) on-premises, behind their firewalls, and can use open source models to clearly understand the data used in training the model.\n\nUltimately, AI model transparency is crucial for building trust and adoption. Users deserve clear information on how their data gets handled and processed and opt-in/opt-out choices. Privacy needs to be a core design principle from day one, not an afterthought. Robust AI governance with rigorous model validation is also critical for ensuring these systems remain secure and effective as the technology rapidly evolves.\n\nFinally, organizations need to have performance check-ins - just as they would with any human employee. If your AI assistant is seen as another colleague, it needs to be clear that they're adding value in line with (or exceeding) their training and ongoing operational costs. It's easy to forget that simply \"integrating AI\" across a company is not, in itself, actually valuable.\n\nWe believe that these are tools are vital. They will be a part of almost everyone's lives in the near future. What's important is that companies don't think they can simply enable access to the tools and then walk away; that this is something that can be announced to shareholders and then be fully operational within a quarter. Education and training will be an ongoing process, and getting security, privacy, and compliance measures right is key in order that we can take full advantage of these capabilities in a way that instills confidence and guarantees safety.\n\nWe list the best online cybersecurity courses.", "source": {"uri": "techradar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TechRadar"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_services", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Financial services"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Privacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub_Copilot", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "GitHub Copilot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_box", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Black box"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_assistant", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Virtual assistant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Integrated development environment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparency_(behavior)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Transparency (behavior)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screenshot", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Screenshot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Productivity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulnerability_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vulnerability (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Operating system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ethics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Large language model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Open source model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Azure", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Azure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Web_Services", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amazon Web Services"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DVffQnnibMWmNpx2Wfb5Se-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9778318", "eventUri": "eng-9778318", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3333333333333333, "wgt": 129, "relevance": 1}

The race to develop the best large language models and large multimodal models has seen the likes of OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta, and other emerging players put out services that make us rethink how we do knowledge work. However, these fast-paced developments also stoke fears of technological displacement, as AI moves into cognitive domains previously reserved for humans.\n\nAmid this polarized discourse, it is easy for us to assume that AI must be inherently disruptive - that for something new to rise, something old must fall. Silicon Valley tech startups tend to embrace disruptive innovation as a sort of holy grail, as if the only way to create and capture immense value is to \"move fast and break things.\" But this is a false dichotomy. This reflects a zero-sum mindset that frames industries as jungles, where only the efficiently productive survive.\n\nIf we are to prove that business can indeed be a force for good, we must chart a path for the use of AI to be truly human-centered - an approach that dignifies people and contributes to the flourishing of our collective well-being. Thus, we must steer the use of AI towards complementing and empowering humans rather than replacing us. We can pursue symbiosis, not substitution.\n\nInstead of disruptive innovation, perhaps we can pursue an alternative - \"nondisruptive creation\" - a new framework from the 2023 book Beyond Disruption authored by W. Chan Kim and Ren\u00e9e Mauborgne. Nondisruptive creation is different from disruptive innovation and blue ocean strategy - this alternate approach seeks to generate growth by addressing brand new problems or opportunities, not by disrupting existing industries.\n\nIn my view, if we expand our perspective, generative AI is more particularly suited for nondisruptive creation rather than disruptive innovation. Imagine: for the first time, we have tools that can generate human-like content across text, images, audio, video, and more. The potential to democratize creativity and augment human capabilities is immense. But if we subscribe to the mainstream paradigm of disruptive innovation, we risk job displacements and incurring great social costs. Wouldn't it be such a disservice for a great technology to stunt societal growth rather than contributing to our collective flourishing?\n\nTo steer generative AI towards nondisruptive creation, we need a new playbook.\n\nFirst, we must focus on augmentation, not on human-displacing automation. Instead of asking \"how can we cut costs?\", we should ask \"how can we create value for all?\". The goal should be to enhance human capabilities, not just drive efficiencies and productivity without regard for human well-being. When we free up the need for workers to do mundane tasks due to automation, instead of displacing them, wouldn't it be more valuable to upskill them and make them focus on more creative, meaningful, and insightful activities?\n\nSecond, we need to look for opportunities outside the boundaries of existing jobs and industries. This means deeply understanding the unmet needs and untapped potential of knowledge workers across domains. It requires imagining new possibilities for human-AI collaboration, not just optimizing existing workflows. Business organizations and schools should develop think tanks or task forces that can help imagine new and meaningful ways of working.\n\nThird, we must challenge the assumption that AI will necessarily replace humans. Even the most advanced AI today lacks the general intelligence and adaptability of humans. AI should be a tool to enhance our creativity, not a replacement for it.\n\nTo make this vision a reality, organizations need both advanced AI capabilities and deep interdisciplinary expertise spanning technology, business, psychology, design, ethics, and the like. We need to tap into diverse pools of knowledge, both internally and externally. And we need to adopt a mindset of creating new possibilities, not just driving efficiencies.\n\nWhen generative AI is pursued in this nondisruptive way, everyone benefits. Companies can drive innovation and growth without the pain of mass layoffs. Workers can harness the power of AI without fearing for their jobs. And society can enjoy the fruits of technological progress without the disruption of technologically-driven unemployment.\n\nIf we want a future like this, we must engage in active choices and responsible stewardship from those building and deploying generative AI. We need managers and business educators who are willing to live in the adjacent possible - anticipating the risks and benefits of generative AI and putting stakeholders into a position of flourishing. We need technologists to not be limited by a narrow view of automation and instead pursue AI-augmented creative thinking. We need business leaders to prioritize value creation over cost reduction. And we need policymakers to foster an environment that incentivizes augmentation over displacement.\n\nThe rise of generative AI presents a pivotal opportunity to shape the future of work and creativity. By embracing the principles of nondisruptive creation, we can steer this powerful technology towards empowering people, growing the economic pie or even creating new ones, and painting a future where humans and AI work together in harmony.\n\nTo disrupt or not?

Today, with the market valued at $9.7 billion, artificial intelligence has become essential, driving efficiency and innovation across the sector. In this article, Michel Spruijt, president of autonomous technology company Brain Corp International explores how AI is redefining the industry, addresses challenges in data privacy and security, and highlights key trends that will shape its future.\n\nFive years ago, AI was considered a 'nice to have' in the food and beverage industry. Early adopters experimented with basic applications in quality control, sorting and supply chain management to improve operational efficiency. Today, the landscape has changed dramatically.\n\nAI's usage in the food and beverage market has grown substantially, reaching a $9.7 billion valuation in 2024 - up $4 billion since 2019. The technology is now deeply integrated across the entire value chain, from manufacturing to logistics, operations and customer experience. What was once a promising innovation is now an essential tool for driving competitiveness and progress in the sector.\n\nYet, many food and beverage leaders struggle with implementing an AI strategy effectively. Barriers such as reluctance to change, unclear ROI and a shortage of skilled workers hinder its full adoption.\n\nOne of the biggest concerns? Data privacy and security. According to a survey by Retail Economics, 46.9% of food retailers identified legal and regulatory issues as a major barrier to investing in AI.\n\nThe benefits of using AI are clear: greater data integration for improved decision-making, more sophisticated applications that delight customers and enhanced efficiency across the whole supply chain. But without a strategy to navigate evolving data safety issues, many leaders may find themselves sitting on the sidelines, or worse - fumbling their way through a complex landmine of legal and customer compliance.\n\nLeaders need to take the time to investigate the best way forward, as the gap between organisations choosing to leverage AI and those who don't, is only growing wider.\n\nThree key areas where AI is significantly reshaping how food and beverage companies operate are inventory management, logistics and in-store operations. In each case, the old ways have been dramatically disrupted, and the new ways require careful consideration of data capture and management.\n\nFor example, AI-powered autonomous cleaning robots have significantly changed how retail store managers can approach facility management. Rather than struggling with a lack of available workers, staff churn and limited abilities to track productivity, AI-powered robots are enabling trackable cleaning at any time of day or night. This helps retailers consistently maintain clear stores and free up workers to do more valuable tasks.\n\nThe same goes for inventory management. The impact of improving accuracy here is significant. Data from NeilsenIQ shows that out-of-stock items cost retailers $82 billion in 2021 alone. Rather than having staff manually verify stock, pricing and product placements, AI-powered robots can also perform the same actions with more speed, accuracy and reliability, whether operating in a warehouse or retail environment.\n\nWhile these innovations create massive returns in efficiency over time, teams also need a plan to manage their data and be compliant in the face of strict data privacy laws that vary by country.\n\nAs companies start to collect and analyse vast amounts of customer and operational data with AI tech, teams need to stay on top of the risks and implications that come alongside the opportunity.\n\nGDPR plays an important role if you're operating in the EU, as does identity data laws that vary by country. Ensuring compliance with various data protection laws across different regions can be complex, but these protocols are fixed - signalling opportunities for ambitious leaders who choose to work through technology-specific implications and arrive at a solution to create a competitive edge.\n\nMaintaining consumer trust while collecting data for AI applications is also key, as is developing a policy regarding how you interact with suppliers, distributors and any other third parties while maintaining confidentiality.\n\nAcross all these issues, what can leaders do to move forward in the face of uncertainty?\n\nStart by putting protocols in place that satisfy GDPR rules relating to personal data. This includes creating a clear data strategy and outlining how data is collected, stored, used and protected throughout the supply chain.\n\nMake sure to evaluate all third-party vendors with a set of criteria so you can confidently move forward with trusted, reliable partners that can help you navigate the data landscape.\n\nAnother key is to invest in employee training. You need to educate your staff about data privacy, security best practices and the responsible use of AI technologies.\n\nAs your team experiments with new AI approaches, you want everyone on the same page around standards for data anonymisation, encryption, and vendor integration to protect sensitive information while getting the benefit of AI capabilities.\n\nA good rule of thumb is to practice 'data minimisation' - meaning, only collect and retain the data necessary for powering your AI applications, reducing your risk of exposure.\n\nBy addressing challenges proactively and putting robust data management protocols in place, late adopters can begin to dip their toes into AI implementation in a way that appropriately manages the risks.\n\nAs AI continues to reshape the food and beverage industry, several key trends are emerging that will likely come to define the future of the sector.\n\nHyper-personalisation will continue to drive purchases for consumers. AI is enabling unprecedented levels of personalisation in its ability to analyse vast amounts of consumer data. This includes dietary preferences, as well as past purchase behaviour.\n\nThis ability has implications for demand forecasting, inventory management and product development. Food and beverage companies that invest in AI-powered intelligence here will be able to create highly tailored products and experiences for customers.\n\nAutonomous operations is another large trend that I believe we will only continue to see more of. From fully autonomous manufacturing to inventory management and cleaning, AI-powered robots will be able to handle the day-to-day tasks that previously required a large workforce.\n\nWith minimal human intervention required for repetitive tasks, I expect we will see more jobs created that centre around 'co-botics' - positions where humans and robots work together in defined roles.\n\nThe food and beverage industry is at a pivotal point where AI innovation and data responsibility must coexist. Leaders who successfully strike this delicate balance will reap significant rewards: improved efficiency, business intelligence and a competitive edge.", "source": {"uri": "foodbev.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FoodBev Media"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Information privacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Logistics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retail", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Retail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Robot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_inventory_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Field inventory management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision-making", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Decision-making"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Technology company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_adopter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Early adopter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_integration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Data integration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_control", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quality control"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return_on_investment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Return on investment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supply chain management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supply chain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valuation_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Valuation (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_experience", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Customer experience"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_chain", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Value chain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_placement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Product placement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "General Data Protection Regulation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Master_Data_Management", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Master Data Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/E-Commerce/Standards_and_Protocols", "label": "dmoz/Business/E-Commerce/Standards and Protocols", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Cost_Management", "label": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Cost Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Business_Transformation", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Business Transformation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Telecommuting", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Telecommuting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 74}], "image": "https://static.wixstatic.com/media/281327_60cef3888502488a858ea8d6c331b623~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_800,h_533,al_c,q_85/281327_60cef3888502488a858ea8d6c331b623~mv2.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9778318", "eventUri": "eng-9778318", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4274509803921569, "wgt": 128, "relevance": 1}

Yes, And No", "body": "On June 7 last year, Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, was asked this question when he was in India: Can Indian entrepreneurs compete with OpenAI, or should they even try? His answer, a blunt and definitive \"No\", was jarring to most of us. Altman followed with an even more fundamental question of his own: was India even a player in this massive technological shift.?\n\nWhile Altman may have a point, he is wrong in assessing the depth of talent that India has and the potential it holds to contribute to the AI revolution. India is a country with more than 5,000 years of sustained human history, which has witnessed massive wars, famines, occupations and diversity. It holds the civilisational knowledge and accumulated thought processes that can and will play a critical part in building a safe and sustainable future for a man-machine society. India can act as a crucial counterbalance to an AI framework developed in the echo chambers of San Francisco.\n\nSilicon Valley's Flawed AI Playbook\n\nIn typical Silicon Valley fashion of moving fast and breaking things, OpenAI has chosen to open up the AI revolution to everyone. ChatGPT was developed by training AI on the vast and free human knowledge available on the internet. We have Elon Musk unleashing his bots developed on Twitter data, and humanoids on the shop floors of Tesla. Mark Zuckerberg is unloading billions on AI development and computing, while releasing large open-source models. Amazon is buying power utilities in gigawatts as the Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) race gets real.\n\nThe GPU-guzzling, greed-driven AI boom is already scary, and adding fuel to this are the geopolitical dynamics between the US and China. The world is set to witness an unprecedented \"Intelligence explosion\". And we as a society probably aren't ready for such a rapid transition shaped purely by the Silicon Valley playbook.\n\nPersonal Stake In AI's Future\n\nAs a parent of two young kids, I think selfishly. While I have been dabbling with AI for more than 15 years, I want my kids to grow up in a world that is truly open to exploring human potential. It was a rainy afternoon in Bengaluru in 2008 when I came across an article by Ray Curzweil, which said that the sum total of all AI would be more than human intelligence by 2029. The claim shook me; I realised that this would be a game-changing moment for humanity, primarily because we are unsure of what lies beyond that point - a 'Singularity' - and the shape society would take after that. Soon after, I made the crazy decision to resign from my well-paying job at Wipro to start India's first AI chatbot company, 'Vimagino', with three friends and fellow IIT Kanpur alumni. Some remnants of this chatbot demo can still be found on YouTube.\n\nMind you, this was two years before OpenAI was born (even before the pre-deep-learning era), and it was all done in India. We even went live on two websites, Indiatimeshopping.com and Yatra.com. Unfortunately, we couldn't grow because not many back then practised risk-funding that could back such companies in India. Perhaps we were a little too early (or were we).\n\nI eventually ended up co-founding pi Ventures, an early-stage venture fund, with Manish Singhal. The idea was to back risky AI bets in India, one of which is tracking well today and is on its way to becoming a revenue-making AI unicorn - a rarity in this GenAI era. However, I can see that while these AI companies from India could do well, eventually, for-profit companies would have to optimise functions like revenue and, of course, profit. It rankled me that if for-profit businesses made their way to AGI, the pursuit of profit might lead to AI ignoring humanity. We could end up being just dressed-up animals in a cage, well-fed with a universal basic income, but, in all actuality, complete non-players in the grand scheme of things. That is a very depressing scenario. So, I stepped back from pi and helped co-found ARTPARK (AI & Robotics Technology Park), a not-for-profit organisation whose motto is to make AI work for humanity.\n\nLanguages, 'Shruti', And 'Smruti'\n\nARTPAR, supported by a Rs 230 crore seed grant from the Department of Science & Technology and the government of Karnataka, is a unique effort incubated by the Indian Institute of Science (IISc). The organisation recently released 16,000 hours of spontaneous speech from 80 districts under project Vaani, open-sourced under Bhashini. Such initiatives can help in the development of geographically anchored models in a country like India, which is packed with diverse languages and local dialects that sometimes change in a matter of a few kilometres.\n\nThese languages are rivers of knowledge, overflowing with rich human intelligence and enriched by centuries of usage, feedback, and historical chronicling of local events. This longitudinal data of human effort spanning thousands of years, trying to describe the world around, is a living, thriving body of human, annotated knowledge.\n\nThere's another unique thing about India: a lot of its collective knowledge exists in \"shruti\"(in voice) and \"smruti\"(in memory) as centuries of invaders destroyed its written knowledge and manuscripts. This method even allowed the Upanishads to survive over time. For centuries, this knowledge has been practised as living traditions, weaved into the daily lives of billions. The physicist Ervin Schr\u00f6dinger, who worked on the nature of reality and is known for his Schr\u00f6dinger's cat experiment, reportedly carried a translation of the Upanishads and revered its core insights about the nature of apparent duality. Indeed, its unique views on self-knowledge, the nature of reality and consciousness can help chart a new way of thinking about safe AI as we race towards the so-called 'AGI'.\n\nThe 3 Stages Of AI Development\n\nThere are three stages that mark the learning and development of AI.\n\nStage 1 is learning from freely available data on the internet, which resulted in ChatGPT and other such systems powered by LLMs. It has become useful in creating text and solving other problems, though it's still not alarmingly influential. Stage 2 is about creating AI agents, that research, co-work with and co-learn from human feedback. It's here that India, with a population of 1.4 billion brought up on a rich diversity of thought and action, can play a big role. We are expected to get to some aspects of AGI at this stage. Stage 3 is all about learning and augmenting from the physical and digital world. This is going to be tricky and critical, and we will have to be careful about what AI ends up learning, because it will soon power 40-50% of the workflow in real-life situations. It's this stage that will truly power a man-machine society of 7.5 billion humans working with more than 30 billion intelligent machines. Unlike human beings, biases in AI technology can grow exponentially, and in a much shorter span of time, humbling creators if they are not careful. India Must Take The Lead\n\nThe US, with its powerful internet and social media giants driven by profits, may end up creating a path to AI that puts profit ahead of humanity. China, which is prone to imprinting its central leader's thinking onto algorithms to exact control, may power a future where AI might rule over human beings. Both scenarios are not sustainable. On the other hand, India, with its rich, sustainable, civilisational history, has the potential to shape a future where humans can realise their full potential, together with AI.\n\nSam Altman might have been wrong about India's potential contribution, but he was spot-on about the inadequate resources we are putting into becoming an AI force to reckon with at a global level.\n\nThe India AI mission is a great start, but we need to double down with a sizable private capital pool and AI compute resources that can support our talented technologists and researchers. We need to enable them at warp speed to digitize and mine the rich civilizational knowledge India possesses for building AI.\n\nOtherwise, our kids may not like the 'Matrix' future we may leave for them. Maybe it's time for India to take the 'Red Pill' and pull up its socks.\n\nPromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com\n\n[Umakant Soni is chairman of AIfoundry, co-founder of ARTPARK (AI

It is now a mandatory drill to undergo such training, one can even call it a mania.\n\nBecause back in 2017, Mark Cuban, the famous American businessman, said \"Artificial Intelligence, deep learning, machine learning -- whatever you're doing if you don't understand it -- learn it. Because otherwise you're going to be a dinosaur within 3 years.\"\n\nThis hasn't changed. Almost an entire generation is studying for jobs that won't exist. And when it comes to the Indian IT industry, if you are educated, you won't get a job that pays you well enough. But if you are not that upskilled and do not demand higher salaries, you might be in a better position to land a job.\n\nA Reddit user wrote, \"I am 25 with a bachelor in CS and masters in AI. With zero YOE [Years of experience], I found it tough to land a job after college and had to settle with a generic SDE [Software Development Engineer] role at a small company.\" Many fresh graduates shared similar concerns on forums like Reddit.\n\nSource: Reddit\n\nThis sentiment reflects a broader issue faced by many new entrants into the tech industry. Aspiring software engineers/developers consider several strategies to stand out and secure desirable positions.\n\nIndian IT companies have all recently highlighted their commitment to integrate generative AI into their operations. Top firms like TCS, Infosys, and Wipro have been leveraging technology-enabled training for their employees.\n\nWipro's foundational training for over 2,25,000 employees, coupled with advanced AI training for an additional 30,000, highlights their approach to AI education within their workforce.\n\nSimilarly, Accenture has been expanding its data and AI workforce, reaching approximately 55,000 skilled practitioners. With a goal to double this number to 80,000 by the end of FY2026.\n\nFurther, HCL plans to train and upskill around 20,000 employees in generative AI every quarter. It aims to reach 100,000 employees by the end of FY25, reflecting its strategic focus on AI proficiency.\n\nTCS is taking a similar approach, training over 150,000 employees in collaboration with tech giants. TCS aims to build the largest AI-ready workforce in the world through organic reskilling efforts.\n\nMilind Lakkad, TCS' executive vice president and global head of human resources, noted that the company now has over 100,000 GenAI-ready employees and is investing in further deepening their expertise.\n\nInfosys has trained around 250,000 employees in GenAI capabilities, focusing on enhancing their service offerings through this technology.\n\nWhile Capgemini has scaled its capabilities significantly by training over 120,000 employees on generative AI tools.\n\nAccenture has announced over $900 million in new bookings for generative AI, reaching a total of $2 billion fiscal year-to-date during its Q3 FY24 earnings report.\n\n\"We have achieved two significant milestones this quarter -- with $2 billion in generative AI sales year-to-date and $500 million in revenue year-to-date -- demonstrating our early lead in this critical technology,\" the company said in a statement.\n\nMeanwhile, Indian IT majors like TCS have doubled up on their AI game. The IT giant announced that it is doubling its AI pipeline to $1.5 billion this quarter, from the $900 million pipeline reported in the previous one.\n\nTCS is now also working on around 270 AI projects worldwide. Moreover, in Q1 FY25, it applied for 154 patents and was granted 277, as revealed by TCS chief K Krithivasan.\n\nComing to Wipro, it is driving innovation and enhancing productivity through investments in the Lab 45 AI platform and Wipro Enterprise GenAI Studio, incorporating various GenAI tools into the software development lifecycle.\n\nFurther, HCL's AI-led engagements include implementing a GenAI-based solution for a global technology major, automating gaming review analysis, which resulted in significant workload reduction and a 119% increase in game reviews.\n\nAdditionally, they are transforming the client's content lifecycle management with GenAI features.\n\nWhile Capgemini is currently engaged in over 350 new projects, with more than 2,000 deals in the pipeline. The company has also scaled its capabilities by training over 120,000 employees on generative AI tools and continues to invest in related tools, assets, and platforms.\n\nSeems like Indian IT giants have taken up the herculean task of upskilling the Indian techies with generative AI and also not keeping them unemployed.", "source": {"uri": "analyticsindiamag.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Analytics India Magazine"}, "authors": [{"uri": "vidyashree_srinivas@analyticsindiamag.com", "name": "Vidyashree Srinivas", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tata_Consultancy_Services", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tata Consultancy Services"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reddit", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Reddit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Information technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Cuban", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mark Cuban"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accenture", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Accenture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology_in_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Information technology in India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infosys", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Infosys"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Deep learning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Software development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Machine learning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Computer science"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor's_degree", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bachelor's degree"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Email"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wipro", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wipro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_engineering", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Software engineering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_resources", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Human resources"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development_process", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Software development process"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capgemini", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Capgemini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Productivity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_transport", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pipeline transport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Patent"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Salesmanship", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Salesmanship", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Education_and_Training/Business_Development", "label": "dmoz/Business/Education and Training/Business Development", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://analyticsindiamag.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Mohits-Banners-30.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9778318", "eventUri": "eng-9778318", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 125, "relevance": 1}

However, these AI algorithms often require extensive training times and struggle to pinpoint specific components in an anomalous state. Furthermore, AI's decision-making processes are frequently opaque, leading to concerns about trust and accountability.\n\nTo help combat this, the team brought in a number of measures to boost efficiency including:\n\nThese advancements not only improve the efficiency and reliability of AI systems in CNIs but also ensure that human operators remain integral to the decision-making process, enhancing overall accountability and trust.\n\nDr Sarad Venugopalan, co-author of the study, explained: \"Humans learn by repetition over a longer period of time and work for shorter hours without being error prone.

AI has emerged as a potential -- and powerful -- answer to these challenges. If AI can speed up key tasks like network detection anomaly, customer consulting, marketing and more, telcos can save time and cut costs, all while improving network performance and customer satisfaction.\n\nLike its fellow operators, South Korea Telecom (SKT) is actively looking to incorporate AI into its operations, but the company is also positioning itself as an AI vendor in the rapidly expanding artificial intelligence ecosystem with the launch of its telco-specific large language model (LLM) and middle layer platform. At the recent Digital Transformation World -- Ignite event in Copenhagen, the company's MNO AI Transformation Strategy Team Member Jaeyoung Sohn detailed how this solution is getting a boost from several of Dell's AI enterprise offerings.\n\nSKT's LLM is designed to help telcos improve their customer interactions via digital human-like assistants and chatbots that SKT calls AI Chat Agent, which Sohn revealed is on track for commercialization by the end of the year. However, even as advanced AI tools such as these continue to hit the market, many telcos are still struggling with the \"what and how\" of AI integration.\n\nCue a compelling TM Forum catalyst project called Total AI Solution that Sohn said \"integrate[s] the SK Telecom telco-specific LLM with existing BSS using a middle layer platform\" to make it easier and faster for telcos to use AI as an effective and reliable customer-facing tool. The Total AI solution is made all the more formidable by the partnership between SKT and Dell in which the former is leveraging the latter's on-premise cloud platform for more \"secure and cost-effective operations.\"\n\nVikas Kumar, Dell's Global Enterprise Architect, jumped in here to offer a broader characterization of the company's work with SKT, saying simply: \"We were trying to bring in the best of the ecosystem.\" He added that this \"best\" includes several of Dell's enterprise solutions like the AI Factory and Infrastructure Block.\n\nThe debut of commercialized generative AI (gen AI) has sent nearly every industry into a tailspin as everyone scrambled to find the best and flashiest ways to put it to use. The telecommunications industry is no exception.

Instead, entertainment professionals are facing incredible friction as they attempt to experiment with generative AI or AI in general.\n\nSo why are the biggest brands in entertainment not aggressively embracing AI? And how can you turn that into an opportunity?\n\nMost turnkey AI solutions available on the market have not been developed with professional purposes in mind and may show poor peak signal-to-noise (PSNR) values. In layman's terms: the number of falsely recognised images and words is too high for the technology to be used in this way. Post-editing to correct the results sometimes takes more time than manually working with the transcription in the first place.\n\nA na\u00efve approach to implementing AI is to use bare-metal algorithms for image recognition or automatic speech transcription. Even the best possible Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) engines available today will make errors, due to the simple fact that natural language is constantly evolving (when new concepts and words are born, engines need to be trained before these will be recognised), and because natural language is subject to synonymity and homonymity. And things tend to get worse and more complicated when using image recognition.\n\nMore specifically, the problem with most turnkey AI solutions today is that they deliver results that are both inaccurate and incomplete. This issue is particularly painful for journalists and documentary makers requiring high precision because the output frequently lacks the necessary detail and accuracy. A poor overall peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) means that the desired output is obscured by significant amounts of false positives, leading to an overload of non-relevant search results and poor search efficiency. If any relevant results show up in the first place. As a result, journalists and edit producers (in a documentary context) have to spend hours of manual work trying to find the right relevant shots.\n\nThe root cause of this problem lies in the fact that AI systems were not specifically designed with the rigorous demands of media production in mind. Consequently, they lack the robustness and fine-tuned accuracy needed for such specialised tasks. While more and better training of AI models is certainly necessary to improve performance, this is not a complete solution. AI will remain inherently prone to errors regardless of advancements in training techniques due to the complex and unpredictable nature of real-world data. A more intelligent approach that includes highly specific training, contextual understanding, and error correction mechanisms, is essential to achieve the reliability and precision needed in high-stakes environments.\n\nWhen trying to solve the problems associated with AI, the best advice is 'don't try to boil the ocean'. The bigger the data set of potential targets (images or words), the more likely you will find false positives in the result set. It's therefore better to try to restrict the set of potential targets (when using face recognition, animal detection by classification, language recognition, and so on). Consider the smallest possible dataset of possible targets by using any available pre-existing data from production, e.g. lists of actors or people that you may extract from the screenplay, any production briefings or call sheets.\n\nWhen it comes to image recognition, one should consider that any (!) media production process will contain lots of valuable and rich information in the form of production documents coming from planning or pre-production, logging data, or production reports. Aligning these with the images to create an accurate representation of who is in the image is cheaper and more accurate than using AI to retrofit these data.\n\nIf you implement a process where you recycle any available data from (pre-)production, parse these by your data model in the form of one or more lists of allowed values or thesauri, and use this data set as input for speech or image recognition, the recognition rate or completeness of the result will be much higher. By subsequently weeding out items with lower confidence scores, the number of false positives will be close to zero.\n\nWe propose to reconcile the results on a single timeline and set up multi-modal indexing. Rather than just indexing a selection of words, make sure to distinguish speakers, faces, places, subject references, etc. and organise these on a single timeline lined up according to scene changes or shot cuts. The result becomes visible as a search engine to support the editorial decision-making process with unprecedented efficiency.\n\nEvery media production environment contains plenty of freely accessible information that can be used to improve the quality of an AI system's output. Think of production documents (scripts or screenplays, call sheets, production briefings, production reports, etc.) that contain key names and phrases. In scripted entertainment, including film, TV series and continuous drama, the scripts, by definition, contain all important references. In an appropriate implementation of AI, this pre-existing information is used as input for the AI system, and it will preferentially look for said key names and phrases. Moreover, it is key to consider the user's intentions and to use this information to filter and reconcile the output of the AI system. As a result, the output can be tuned to be 100 per cent complete and accurate at the same time.\n\nThis approach lets you set up an iterative method to systematically further increase the relevance and usability of your results. Here is where the concept thesauri plays a pivotal role. By fine-tuning your naming conventions (in your capacity as archivists, edit producers, subtitlers, or similar) you are creating a mind map or an ontology which is expanded in its simplest form as a taxonomy or a thesaurus. This in turn will be used in a first stage to filter the output produced by AI, by operating the search engine (e.g. using labels to define an advanced search query), by the user interface to enable navigation of content, and/or to create grouping of content in your library.\n\nAppropriate use of AI for media production (or 'media intelligence') has two key advantages.\n\nRather than rendering their roles obsolete, appropriate use of AI actually gives knowledge workers a palpable competitive edge. This assumes a trustful implementation, reliable output, and overall usability of the results.", "source": {"uri": "tvbeurope.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TVBEurope"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peak_signal-to-noise_ratio", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Peak signal-to-noise ratio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_vision", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Computer vision"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_positives_and_false_negatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "False positives and false negatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(linguistics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Transcription (linguistics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_recognition", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Speech recognition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Natural language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Documentary film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Friction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Algorithm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Entertainment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robustness_(computer_science)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Robustness (computer science)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facial_recognition_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Facial recognition system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_set", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Data set"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_detection_and_correction", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Error detection and correction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Search engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Completeness_(logic)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Completeness (logic)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision-making", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Decision-making"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterative_method", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iterative method"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Birth_Control", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Birth Control", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Threads", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Threads", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://www.tvbeurope.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Limecraft_SVT-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9778318", "eventUri": "eng-9778318", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 120, "relevance": 1}

The WHO also estimates that global health expenditures for fighting and treating diabetes will rise from US$966 billion in 2021 to US$1054 billion by 2045.\n\nHealthcare sectors put therefore high hopes on Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI), which is AI capable of generating text, video, and images, as a catalyst for faster and more efficient treatment of patients. HRV Global LifeSciences has identified the following fields of how AI is making a disruptive difference in the fields of healthcare, whilst hospitals and medical colleges have to adapt:\n\nDiagnostics and Imaging:\n\nMedical Imaging Analysis: AI algorithms can analyze medical images (like X-rays, MRIs, and CT scans) with high precision, often identifying abnormalities that may be missed by human eyes. This aids in early diagnosis and better treatment planning.\n\nPersonalized Medicine:\n\nTreatment Plans: AI helps in creating personalized treatment plans by analyzing a patient's genetic information, lifestyle, and other health data. Drug Response: It can predict how different patients (depending on gender, age, allergies,...) will respond to specific drugs, leading to more effective and individualized treatment strategies. A large focus is being placed on Orphan drugs and region specific medications, especially with support of AI models/algorithms. Patient Management and Monitoring: Remote Monitoring: AI-powered wearable devices and apps can continuously monitor patients' vital signs and alert healthcare providers to potential issues before they become critical. Chatbots and Virtual Assistants: These tools provide patients with immediate information, help schedule appointments, and offer reminders for medication, improving patient engagement and adherence.\n\nPharmacy\n\nDrug Discovery and Development:\n\nPredictive Modeling: AI accelerates drug discovery by predicting which compounds are likely to be effective against specific diseases, reducing the time and cost of bringing new drugs to market. Clinical Trials: AI is able identify suitable candidates for clinical trials, design more efficient trials, and analyze trial data more rapidly. Medication Management: Adherence Monitoring: AI tools track patient medication adherence and provide reminders, which can improve treatment outcomes such as treating diabetes. Drug Interaction Checking: AI systems help in identifying potential drug interactions, ensuring safer medication regimens depending on the individual patient's health profile.\n\nPharmacy Operations:\n\nInventory Management: AI optimizes inventory levels by predicting demand and automating restocking processes, reducing waste and ensuring the availability of essential medications. Personalized Recommendations: AI can analyze patient data to recommend specific medications and dosages tailored to individual needs. Pharmacovigilance: Adverse Event Detection: AI systems monitor and analyze data from various sources (like electronic health records and social media) to detect and report adverse drug reactions more effectively.\n\nChereddi: \"AI enhances the precision, efficiency, and personalization of healthcare, drug delivery and pharmacy services. It enables faster and more accurate diagnoses, improves medication management, streamlines administrative tasks, and accelerates drug development.\"\n\nChereddi adds: \"At HRV Global LifeSciences, we put increased emphasis on hiring experts who have been in touch with GenAi, the Internet of Things (IoT), and robotics during their education. Universities, research organisations must, and medical colleges must quickly adapt to the fast rise of AI in order to cope with market needs in relation to human resources.\"\n\nWhile challenges like data privacy and integration remain, the potential benefits of AI in these fields are substantial and continue to grow. However, the ethical parameters of healthcare shall never be neglected.\n\n\"Whether in the laboratories of pharmaceutical producers or in the special clinic's operation theater, AI is here to stay, but researchers and medics shall never lose control over the last decision on how to treat patients. In order to fight health disinformation, e. g., policy makers, the pharma industry and hospitals must work hand in hand together to set standards and control mechanisms, \" says Chereddi.\n\n-Ends-\n\nAbout HRV Global Life Sciences & NewHorizon Global Pharma\n\nTo empower our customers everywhere by working with and for them and deliver to them a unique combination of

However, there's a promising equaliser on the horizon: artificial intelligence (AI). While AI isn't a magic bullet, it offers powerful tools to enhance learning, customise education, and prepare rural students for success in the 21st century.\n\nAI can significantly support and empower teachers in rural areas. With AI-powered tools, educators can access extensive educational materials to create customised lesson plans that align with curriculum standards, giving them more time for one-on-one student engagement. Additionally, AI can automate time-consuming tasks like grading essays, improving overall efficiency.\n\nAI also plays a crucial role in analysing student performance data to identify areas where students struggle. This allows teachers to adapt their teaching strategies and provide extra help where needed. AI-driven platforms can generate personalised worksheets and tasks that cater to each student's unique learning preferences, enabling continuous skill enhancement and comprehension evaluation. By handling administrative tasks and providing versatile resources, AI allows teachers to focus on inspiring and guiding their students, creating a more dynamic and responsive educational environment suited to rural needs.\n\nALSO READ: Meta AI Studio Will Help Creators Bring To Life Digital Companions To Drive Engagement. Indian Users Won't Be Able To Access It Yet\n\nRural schools often struggle to access diverse educational resources. AI can bridge this gap by enhancing virtual classrooms and online courses. These platforms connect rural students with qualified educators worldwide, offering specialised courses and subjects not available locally. AI can also translate educational materials into local languages, promoting inclusivity and ensuring all students can access quality resources.\n\nAI's ability to cater to individual learning styles and paces is a game-changer for rural classrooms. AI-powered adaptive learning platforms can tailor education to each student, ensuring no child falls behind. For example, an AI tutor can identify a student's struggle with fractions and provide interactive exercises and explanations suited to their understanding, fostering a deeper comprehension and retention of knowledge.\n\nRural areas often lack extensive educational facilities like libraries and laboratories. AI can help overcome this by providing digital resources accessible through smartphones and other devices. AI-powered educational apps offer interactive materials, including videos, simulations, and quizzes, enhancing the learning process's effectiveness and appeal. This\n\nequitable distribution of resources can significantly reduce the educational disparity between rural and urban students, ensuring rural students have access to similar opportunities and personalised learning experiences as their urban peers.\n\nALSO READ: How AI Can Simplify Managing Your Monthly Budget: Top Tools For Beginners\n\nAI-driven platforms can provide rural educators with the latest instructional strategies and best practices from around the world. By tailoring training modules to teachers' current skills and knowledge, these platforms help educators improve their teaching methods and stay updated with educational developments. Additionally, AI can facilitate knowledge sharing and collaboration among teachers, fostering a supportive environment for ongoing professional growth and reducing feelings of isolation.\n\nAI can also address infrastructure challenges by offering solutions that don't rely heavily on traditional infrastructure. For instance, AI-powered offline learning platforms can deliver educational content even in areas with unreliable electricity and limited internet connectivity. These platforms synchronise data and updates whenever an internet connection is available, ensuring uninterrupted learning. This adaptability is crucial for consistent education delivery in rural settings.\n\nAI can introduce students to coding, robotics, and other STEM activities, sparking an early interest in these critical fields. By making STEM education more accessible and engaging, AI can help develop a generation of students ready to pursue careers in science and technology, benefiting their communities. Early exposure to these fields can lead to lasting advantages, promoting innovation and economic growth in rural areas.\n\nAI also provides valuable insights through data analysis, helping educators and policymakers make informed decisions. By examining data on student performance, attendance, and other factors, AI can identify trends and areas needing attention. This data-driven approach allows for targeted interventions, ensuring resources are used effectively to improve educational outcomes.\n\nAI isn't intended to replace teachers but to enhance their capabilities, ensuring every student, regardless of location, has the opportunity to excel.\n\nIntegrating AI into rural education will not only create an equitable education system but also democratise learning by providing personalised learning experiences, bridging resource gaps, and enabling access to quality education for all. Embracing AI's potential can bridge the educational gap and empower rural students to achieve their full potential, levelling the playing field for the future workforce and creating a generation of capable, knowledgeable individuals ready to make a positive impact on society.\n\n(The authors are the Co-Founders and Trustees at eVidyaloka)", "source": {"uri": "news.abplive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "english"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_(supernatural)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Magic (supernatural)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science,_technology,_engineering,_and_mathematics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Horizon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curriculum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Curriculum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Robotics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_area", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Urban area"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rural_area", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rural area"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_AI", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Meta AI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_learning", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Adaptive learning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_styles", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Learning styles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Educational_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Educational technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distance_education", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Distance education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridge", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bridge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_access", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Internet access"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quiz", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quiz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Library"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_analysis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Data analysis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electricity"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 70}], "image": "https://feeds.abplive.com/onecms/images/uploaded-images/2024/08/01/3f75a0110a403cff4df65341df3896561722509038826402_original.jpg?impolicy=abp_cdn&imwidth=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9778318", "eventUri": "eng-9778318", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3411764705882352, "wgt": 115, "relevance": 1}

Leverage hyper-personalized content, interactive ad formats, and dynamic experiences to engage your audience like never before. Dive in to discover strategies for fuelling growth across key touchpoints on mobile, while ensuring responsible AI usage.\n\nJust a few years ago, generating text, images, and full-length videos at the tap of a button seemed like a distant dream. But today, thanks to rapid advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), this is only a drop in the ocean. Think smart chatbots that do not just respond, but also engage, and browsers that act as intuitive companions on your digital journey.\n\nIn Southeast Asia, the AI revolution is gaining steam, with a market growth rate of 40.8% annually between 2021 and 2026. Brands and marketers are tapping into its potential to connect with diverse audiences, and the smartphone stands at the center of this transformation. The combination of AI and smartphones is reshaping digital marketing, opening up a world of opportunities. Here, we explore how to leverage this power duo across key touchpoints on mobile to fuel growth in the current digital era.\n\nThe lock screen is where it all begins. It is the gateway to the mobile experience, making it a prime real estate for advertisers. Wondering how you can craft AI-led experiences here? An AI-powered lock screen like the Glance smart lock screen can enable app-less content discovery for users, with a single tap.\n\nBelow, we let you in on its powerful possibilities.\n\nHarness the power of AI to analyze audience preferences and behaviors, enabling hyper-personalized content without the need to unlock the phone. What your audience gets: experiences that are tailored just for them and resonate on a deeper level. What is in it for you? Hyper-engaged consumers, top-of-mind awareness, and strong brand connections.\n\nAI can significantly uplift engagement, ultimately boosting brand connections. Craft interactive ad formats that encourage audience participation, such as a single tap to reveal special offers. Or quizzes where AI picks facts and generates questions and answers, selects images, validates them, and inspires action.\n\nTailor experiences to your audience's current context, such as the time of day, location, or weather conditions, and utilize AI to generate seasonal or holiday-themed content. For example, a coffee brand's ad might appear in the morning when users are most likely to crave a cup, whereas a fashion retailer can showcase winter clothing during colder months. This will help make the content timely and relevant, driving higher engagement.\n\nLeverage AI-powered recommender systems that create dynamic content pools by transforming existing content into new, engaging formats. These are based on past consumer preferences and improve overall content liquidity to cater to a large set of audiences.\n\nWhile your audience navigates through various apps, seize the opportunity to powerfully introduce your product or brand using AI. Here is how you can take your in-app ads to the next level.\n\nCrafting high-quality visuals at scale can be daunting. AI-generated image assets provide a game-changing solution, enabling brands to produce diverse, stunning visuals effortlessly. Elevate your campaigns with imagery that stands out and speaks to your audience.\n\nMusic is not just background noise; it is a powerful emotion-evoking tool that leaves a lasting impression. AI-generated music offers customizable, dynamic soundtracks tailored to your campaigns and target audiences. Set the perfect tone and make your brand unforgettable.\n\nRevolutionize interactions with AI chatbots: Customer support is a cornerstone of consumer experience. AI chatbots are transforming brand interactions by providing instant, personalized responses. Deploy them in your ad campaigns to engage your audience in real-time, enhance their experience, and build lasting relationships.\n\nWhile it holds true that consumers now crave tailored experiences made easier by AI, there is a non-negotiable for every holistic marketing strategy: data privacy. 92% of Southeast Asians surveyed by IAB SEA+India said they fully understand, or think they understand what data privacy means.\n\nNavigating the AI landscape while maintaining transparency and trust is essential for building lasting relationships and faith.\n\nHow can you ensure privacy-first marketing?\n\nAs AI intertwines with every facet of marketing, from content creation to adaptive strategies, marketers are empowered to stay agile in the face of rapidly changing trends.\n\nThe future of mobile advertising is here, and it is powered by AI. We, marketers, have only just begun to scratch the surface.", "source": {"uri": "thedrum.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Drum"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lock_screen", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lock screen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Digital marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leverage_(American_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Leverage (American TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeast_Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Southeast Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Web browser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leverage_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Leverage (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_Age", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Information Age"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_estate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Real estate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coffee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audience", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Audience"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retail", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Retail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_Advertising_Bureau", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Interactive Advertising Bureau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recommender_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Recommender system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_creation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Content creation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mobile advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Real-time computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Advertising campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Lifestyle", "label": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Lifestyle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 64}], "image": "https://thedrum-media.imgix.net//thedrum-user-assets-prod/s3/images/original/shutterstock-2328930031.jpg?w=1280&ar=default&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9778318", "eventUri": "eng-9778318", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4666666666666666, "wgt": 112, "relevance": 1}
{"uri": "8254095787", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2024-08-01", "time": "11:20:03", "dateTime": "2024-08-01T11:20:03Z", "dateTimePub": "2024-08-01T11:19:27Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.4196078479290009, "url": "https://analyticsindiamag.com/ai-trends-future/neurosymbolic-ai/", "title": "Can Neurosymbolic AI Save LLM Bubble from Exploding?", "body": "Generative AI, particularly exemplified by chatbots like OpenAI's ChatGPT, Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Google's Gemini, have captured widespread attention and fascination.\n\nHowever, the notion that generative AI might soon wane in popularity is gaining traction. In a recent podcast, tech critic Ed Zitron claimed that language models will soon run out of data to train on, and therefore stop getting better. \"LLMs just cannot create 'new' knowledge,\" he added.\n\nOn similar lines, a study by Google DeepMind proved that LLMs lack genuine understanding, and as a result, cannot self-correct or adjust their responses on command.\n\nAndrej Karpathy is also going through similar tussle, and calls this \"Jagged Intelligence\", which he describes as the inconsistent performance of SOTA LLMs that excel at complex tasks, yet fail at simple ones, such as incorrectly determining that 9.11 is larger than 9.9.\n\nThis has led to a fear that there is very limited application of current AI systems in the real world. In an exclusive interaction with AIM, Meta AI chief Yann LeCun said that systems in their current form are just for entertainment, and do not lead to anything useful. \"I don't think these systems in their current state can be fixed or called intelligent in ways that we want and expect them to be,\" said LeCun.\n\nMeanwhile, Atlantic CEO Nicholas Thompson also gave an interesting example for this. \"If you ask an AI how do you get a man and a cabbage across a river you will potentially get an insane (and hilarious) answer that very clearly shows the weakness of building word-prediction engines that act like they are thinking,\" he said.\n\nA research paper by researchers including the creator of GAN, Ian Goodfellow, titled, 'Explaining and Harnessing Adversarial Examples' demonstrated that even state-of-the-art deep learning networks are often unable to learn how to recognise images in a manner convincing enough to be generalised for different tasks.\n\nEven machines that are adept at playing games, which use deep reinforcement learning, aren't known to follow generally-applicable principles that can then help them play many other games.\n\nAI analyst, and critic, Gary Marcus argued that the solution is neurosymbolic AI. As per Marcus, neurosymbolic AI combines neural networks, which are adept at quick pattern recognition, with symbolic systems that utilise formal logic and structured reasoning.\n\nBy integrating these two methodologies, neurosymbolic AI aims to leverage the strengths of both approaches.\n\nRecent advancements by Google DeepMind illustrate the potential of neurosymbolic systems. GDM's AlphaProof and AlphaGeometry represent sophisticated hybrids of neural and symbolic techniques.\n\nAlphaGeometry, for example, integrates a neural language model with a symbolic deduction engine to solve complex geometry problems. Similarly, AlphaProof combines neural and symbolic elements to achieve impressive results in mathematical theorem proving.\n\nThe conversation around neurosymbolic AI isn't new. For decades, making a machine fully capable of learning by observing its environment has been the biggest dream for many researchers.\n\nEven deep learning, the branch of ML that is fashionable now, can be traced back to 1943. Likewise, a section of scientists had long anticipated the potential in adopting neurosymbolic AI systems so machines can reach human-levels of comprehension.\n\nIBM is using neurosymbolic AI to explore how to make AI systems learn like humans. A notable collaboration on neurosymbolic AI involves IBM, MIT, Harvard, and Stanford, supported by DARPA funding. Their project aims to reverse-engineer cognitive capabilities observed in infants, such as object permanence and basic reasoning.\n\nIn short, the research involves using probabilistic programming and game engine design principles to develop AI systems that can simulate and understand real-world dynamics, much like how infants learn from their environment.\n\nAs per David Cox, Director of MIT-IBM Watson AI lab, Symbolic AI systems rely on pre-coded concepts and rules, which can make them brittle and unable to handle unexpected or novel situations.\n\nAdditionally, these systems also struggle with problems that require learning from data, as they are not as adept at extracting patterns and generalising from examples. \"It's time to reinvent artificial intelligence\", Cox said. And, according to him, neurosymbolic AI is the answer.\n\nNeurosymbolic models are emerging as an effort towards AGI by both exploring an alternative to just increasing datasets' and models' sizes and combining learning over the data distribution, reasoning on prior and learned knowledge, and by symbiotically using them.\n\nDemis Hassabis, CEO of DeepMind, has also suggested that the ultimate goal of AI is to create AGI systems that can learn and reason like humans. In an interview, Hassabis stated that \"the path to AGI will likely involve a combination of deep learning with other techniques like reasoning and planning.\"\n\nLeCun has a similar vision for autonomous machine intelligence. In his paper, LeCun proposed several solutions and architectures that can be combined and implemented to build self-supervised autonomous machines.\n\nThe approach has even found its way into very recent models like CICERO, an agent announced by Meta AI. CICERO was the first AI to reach human-level performance at Diplomacy, a strategy-based board game.\n\nMarcus, admitted that, while it wasn't clear how generalisable Cicero was, \"some aspects of Cicero use a neurosymbolic approach to AI, such as the association of messages in language with symbolic representation of actions, the built-in (innate) understanding of dialogue structure, the nature of lying as a phenomenon that modifies.\"\n\nIn a paper published in December last year titled, 'A Semantic Framework for Neural-Symbolic Computing,' authors Simon Odense and Artur d'Avila Garcez refer to how integrating a semantic framework can help neurosymbolic AI further.\n\nAll of this is to just say that neurosymbolic AI is worth more than one shot to smoothen the road to AGI.",

The allure of GenAI lies in its ability to generate novel content, automate decision-making, and unearth insights from vast swathes of data, thus offering a competitive edge in a saturated marketplace. Companies are already witnessing the impact of GenAI, with a staggering 92% of Fortune 500 companies deploying Open AI products, and 70% of US organizations exploring its capabilities. However, the journey from exploration to meaningful transformation is fraught with strategic complexities. It demands a nuanced understanding of the technology's capabilities, a clear alignment with business objectives, and a vigilant approach to the inherent risks and challenges.\n\nBefore embarking on the GenAI journey, it is crucial to evaluate your organisation's readiness. This initial step transcends technical considerations, urging a reflection on strategic objectives. The alignment of human and financial investments in GenAI with overarching business goals cannot be overstated. It is imperative to establish clear roles and responsibilities to ensure a seamless integration of GenAI into the business fabric. Many companies hesitate, citing a dearth of talent adept in both AI and domain-specific expertise. A thorough assessment of your organisation's capabilities and needs is vital to discern whether GenAI, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, or other technological solutions best fit the problem at hand.\n\nThe adage 'garbage in, garbage out' is particularly pertinent to GenAI. High-quality data is the linchpin of quality output, making a data-oriented culture an indispensable part of AI adoption. Many organisations encounter data quality as a stumbling block in their AI journey. However, GenAI is catalysing a shift towards data mindfulness, as businesses recognise the critical role of data in value creation. Investing in robust data governance and quality assurance strategies is not just a short-term win; it's a long-term investment. Establishing a well-defined Data Strategy, complete with stringent processes, control points, and strong data privacy practices, is essential. Such a strategy will not only enhance decision-making processes but also amplify the value GenAI brings to your organisation.\n\nThe potential economic impact of GenAI is monumental, with expectations to match the GDP of major economies. To harness this value, pinpointing problems that merit solving within your unique business context is essential. Prioritising genuine business needs and fostering a collaborative, customised approach over generic solutions is key. This involves transparent, ethical standards and continuous communication, which are vital for stakeholder engagement. By inviting employee feedback and input, you create a dynamic environment that encourages the emergence of relevant use cases. Such a grassroots approach ensures that the GenAI applications developed are not only technically sound but also intimately aligned with the specific challenges and opportunities your organisation faces, thereby maximising business impact.\n\nScaling GenAI implementation is pivotal for extracting maximum value from chosen use cases. Despite its potential, a mere 5% of market leaders have implemented GenAI at scale. Unlike its predecessors, GenAI can affect a majority of employees, making its scalable implementation a conduit for enhanced productivity, quality, and creativity. Rapid and broad rollout post-successful pilot projects is essential to capitalise on market momentum and maximise return on investment. Flexibility is another cornerstone of success; use cases must evolve through continuous refinement and adaptation. Effective change management strategies are crucial to maintain engagement and support employees through this transformative journey, ensuring that the organisation's GenAI initiatives are not just technologically advanced but also deeply integrated into the operational workflow.\n\nIn the realm of GenAI, navigating regulatory landscapes is as crucial as technological innovation. With AI's rapid advancement, frameworks like NIST's AI RMF in the US and the EU's AI Act have become benchmarks for compliance, underscoring the non-negotiable nature of regulatory adherence. The burgeoning field of AI also brings heightened cybersecurity threats, exposing organisations to new vulnerabilities. A proactive 'security by design' approach, incorporating cyber audits, red team penetration testing, and vulnerability scans, is imperative for early risk identification and mitigation. Integrating these practices into a comprehensive cybersecurity strategy ensures that GenAI implementations are not only cutting-edge but also secure, safeguarding the organisation against the multifaceted risks that accompany this transformative technology.\n\nFor GenAI success, start with specific value hypotheses tailored to your organization. Ensure AI readiness, foster a data-centric culture, and build customized use cases. Scale thoughtfully, and protect against risks with robust security measures. These foundational elements are non-negotiable for a strategic and successful GenAI deployment, ensuring your business harnesses the full potential of this transformative technology.", "source": {"uri": "clickz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClickZ"}, "authors": [{"uri": "priscilla_soedarpo@clickz.com", "name": "Priscilla Soedarpo", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision-making", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Decision-making"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketplace", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marketplace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Technological change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortune_500", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fortune 500"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_planning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Strategic planning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textile", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Textile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_in,_garbage_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Garbage in, garbage out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_programming", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Imperative programming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_quality", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Data quality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindfulness", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mindfulness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_governance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Data governance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use_case", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Use case"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Deep learning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stakeholder_(corporate)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stakeholder (corporate)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Machine learning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_assurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quality assurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ethics"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/E-Commerce/Standards_and_Protocols", "label": "dmoz/Business/E-Commerce/Standards and Protocols", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Business_Transformation", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Business Transformation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Telecommuting", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Telecommuting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Organizational_Change", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Organizational Change", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://www.clickz.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/iStock-1491185503.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9603026", "eventUri": "eng-9603026", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 210, "relevance": 1}

In an interview with Sameer Ranjan Bakshi, Beena Parmar and Surabhi Agarwal, he spoke of his plans to prepare the $18.6-billion software services giant through its Topaz platform for the GenAI-led transformation that will take root as global macro-economic concerns ease.\n\nFor now, as clients postpone such large projects amid uncertain demand for technology services, Infosys will choose profitability over growth. The 59-year-old Parekh said his spare time these days is devoted to experimenting with different AI tools. Edited excerpts.\n\nRecovery was expected this financial year. How has it been so far?\n\nWe are not seeing discretionary spends and (return) of large digital programs. Financial services was looking a little better at the end of the fourth quarter (of FY24 and) that continues.\n\nWhile GenAI is currently very small in terms of revenue, the good part is that there is a lot of activity. It's a way to manufacture new intelligence - whether through tokens, assistants or agents. We are using them in different places - software engineering, customer service or sales and marketing. And we are seeing new elements coming from generative AI, as well as some cost efficiency and productivity. As the inflation, interest rate and macro-economic environment changes, we will see some digital programs start to come back. Then, GenAI will also start to scale up. It is a multi-year project.\n\nAre clients taking big bets on GenAI projects yet?\n\nThere are (ongoing) generative AI projects, but those are not what we call enterprise-wide. They are like a division or a particular area of a company. More of that will come as the economic environment changes. In addition to digital transformation, there will be a push to 'GenAI transformation,' with changes to how customer connect is built and how operations are run more efficiently.\n\nWhy do revenue forecasts remain conservative across top-tier companies despite large deals?\n\nLast financial year, Infosys secured deals over $17 billion TCV (total contract value), one of the largest we've had. Most of those deals are in cost, efficiency, automation and consolidation. But large digital transformation programs and discretionary projects are not in the market today. These large programmes -- discretionary and cost takeout (where clients are looking to drive efficiencies and reduce cost) deals -- have given us overall growth momentum over the years. Since a part of that is not happening, and most of the (current growth) is coming on the back of (efficiency-driven) deals, we've given a growth guidance of 1-3% for this financial year, on a constant currency basis.Even this quarter, the pipeline is similar to what we shared at the start of the quarter. There are a lot of vendor consolidation deals, which we're betting on and benefiting from.\n\nIn this competitive market, we hear companies are ready to sign contracts on zero percent margins. What is your approach?\n\nWe are a high-margin company, and our aspiration is high margins. There are changes in the environment and what we're seeing in terms of large deals. What we are doing with generative AI is very strong, and 1-3% organic growth guidance is one of the strongest in the industry today.Our margin for large deals is about the same as what we had seen in the previous quarter. There's always price intensity in this industry. Every one or two years, there's some entity that certainly becomes unusually price-focused, but that keeps changing. It doesn't look any different right now. Having said that, we have a very strong margin program (Maximus) we put in place about a year ago, which is giving us very good outcomes. In the past financial year, we saw some early benefits.\n\nDo you see the full-time employment model changing with the GenAI disruption? Do you anticipate IT companies hiring fewer people, going forward?\n\nThere are two aspects to it. One is the macro situation -- such as inflation, high interest rates and so on -- playing out. That, essentially, is where we see reduced discretionary and digital transformation spending (by clients) and that is one of reasons we have seen headcount reduction. In the GenAI piece, there are two parts -- revenue growth and productivity. Both combined, GenAI activity is quite strong. It's not (having an) effect at the company level in stats, but we are getting ready for GenAI (as) the overall business of the future. As the macro environment starts to change, we will start to see changes.The way we look at it is, technology is a huge driver for the world. If you look at large organisations, they still have Cobol (programming language). Today, we have GenAI, (and) that's a gap of 40 years. Every technology in between still exists. We are good with large organisations to work across a range of technologies to improve their businesses in whichever way it is -- growth, costs, etc. As the economic environment changes, we also feel the outlook in the longer term is hugely favourable to (a company) like Infosys.\n\nWith Infosys pivoting as a GenAI company, how are you readying talent? Many existing roles will not be needed, and some will evolve.\n\nClose to 80% of employees are already trained in GenAI. We feel the talent we can access with the Infosys brand is incredible. Generally, we look after our employees; even in a difficult macro-environment, we look for their best and so, we have no constraints on the quality and number of people we can get. In the AI-first approach, we build our own capabilities, and we are ready to train even more people as we bring them on board. That is the biggest advantage that Infosys has and that a country like India has -- the kind of talent that can support transformation of the world into the new GenAI era.\n\nDo you see India losing the talent edge with the kind of roles getting automated?\n\nWhat we see and experience with GenAI today is that it is more helpful to individuals. When we start to work for large organisations, there is a need for enormous capability to drive business.Yes, generative AI will have benefits, but we also need to make sure it works across all areas for large organisations. There are different types of skills that services companies like Infosys and others will develop over time, (the number of) which will continue to expand. Technology talent is a key differentiator around the world, and we are fortunate to have a lot of it in India and within Infosys. That's going to be critical.\n\nWhat kind of work are you doing on GenAI?\n\nThe one we are working on is for large organisations, where we take a large language model and train it with specific data from that organisation. We call it a narrow transformer approach.\n\nWhat kind of inputs do you get from chairman Nandan Nilekani and founder NR Narayana Murthy?\n\nNandan (Nilekani) gives strong inputs, has clear vision, and spends a lot of time with me and the team that is working on GenAI.

Some believe it's a passing fad or a threat to human creativity. For young professionals, it's the source of a unique dilemma: Do you \"buy into the hype\" of AI and use it as a guidepost for your professional development and ambitions? Or do you stick to the beaten path, focusing on building more traditional skills and pursuing more conventional trajectories? History has shown us that you can gain a competitive advantage if you develop a balanced perspective about new technologies (like we saw with the internet). For instance, if you think LLMs are overhyped and underperforming, it's probably not because of what you use them for, but because of how you use them. GenAI is certainly not a panacea, and shouldn't be blindly trusted or relied on -- but equally importantly, it shouldn't be feared or avoided based on limiting beliefs.\n\nDespite the immense publicity surrounding generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) over the past 18 months (or maybe partly because of it), many people continue to harbor misconceptions about its capabilities, usefulness, and potential impact. Some believe it's a passing fad or an imminent threat to human creativity. For young professionals, it's the source of a unique dilemma: Do you \"buy into the hype\" of AI and use it as a guidepost for your professional development and ambitions? Or do you stick to the beaten path, and focus on building more traditional skills and pursuing conventional trajectories?\n\nSomething similar happened in the 1990s, when the rise of the internet gave professionals a new set of cutting-edge tools. Barriers to communication crumbled, and marketing reach exploded. Entirely new types of businesses were born -- not to mention working methods. At a time, when opinions about the internet were deeply divided, those starting their careers had to decide whether to lean into the vast opportunities and uncertainties of a potentially revolutionary technology.\n\nThe internet revolution showed that, despite potential pitfalls, early adoption has its advantages. With GenAI, the landscape is even more complex and rapidly evolving. It's natural (and perfectly okay) to have your apprehensions and doubts about its adoption in professional and personal settings. But as a tech entrepreneur who now advises startups on leveraging GenAI for efficiency gains, I've seen firsthand how transformative this technology can be.\n\nYes, there can be risks (becoming overdependent on GenAI or feeding it private data that's supposed to stay protected). Overall, however, the benefits provide more than enough reason to use GenAI anyway (heightened productivity and creative inspiration, among others).\n\nJust as history has shown us, you can gain a competitive advantage if you develop a balanced perspective that capitalizes on these benefits -- especially early in your career. To do this, you need to move past five limiting mindsets.\n\nHere's how.\n\nFrom the early days of ChatGPT's release, most of us were exposed to two clashing narratives; either large language models (LLMs) are utterly amazing or are problematic plagiarizers. What comes to mind is the old axiom about judging the intelligence of a fish by how well it can climb a tree, because many negative opinions about LLMs are based on misguided expectations.\n\nThe reality: If \"unimpressed\" is your overall take on LLMs, it's probably not because of what you use them for, but how you use them. LLMs work on prompts and allow you to input a variety of these to generate text, videos, and even images. While the ability to leverage \"zero-shot\" techniques (in which no context is given along with your prompt) is an incredible feature that differentiates these models from other types of AI, their true utility is unlocked through refinement and iteration.\n\nBottom line: To get great responses from an LLM like ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini, you need to go deeper than singular prompts. Instead, treat prompting like a skill, and expect your results to get better and better over time as you learn about what works and what doesn't. For example, a simple prompt like \"Write me a cover letter for a software engineer position at Google\" will get generic results. The real magic starts to happen when you realize that you can upload your CV and ask AI to cross-reference it to a role by providing a link to the job description. The more personalized your prompt is, the better result you'll get.\n\nHallucination, bias, and a lack of \"real\" understanding -- these are all valid concerns regarding GenAI. In most cases, you can't, and shouldn't, trust it with fact-checking (LLMs lack real intelligence and can't \"know\" if their own outputs are actually true, although there is promise of improvement in this area), up-to-date research, or even simple math (LLMs are notoriously bad at counting).\n\nThe reality: Despite being fact-based, the belief that GenAI is entirely untrustworthy is limiting. After all, few if any sources or tools can be trusted indiscriminately, and that goes for everything from Wikipedia to the highest-impact academic journals -- even our own minds. But to the varied extent that these things are useful to us, we develop a working relationship with them -- trusting or not -- to leverage their utility while maintaining certain safeguards.\n\nBottom line: Learning to trust GenAI isn't the direction you should take. Instead, learn to use it for your benefit despite the fact that it's untrustworthy. Understand that it may treat untrue information as true, or reflect biases present in its training data. Just like with a colleague or classmate, you need to check its work if you're the one presenting it. For example, you could verify the author and source or check how recently published or researched the material is. You can even employ fact-checking tools like Google Fact Check Explorer to make sure the output you've got is credible and true. Even though it has limitations, GenAI is an extremely valuable tool when used with these things in mind.\n\nSpeaking of using it effectively, you may not recognize where GenAI can be useful to you personally. If you've only engaged with LLMs sparingly (such as drafting a cover letter or an email), you might still be under the impression that they're only good for basic tasks like writing or proofreading.\n\nThe reality: In my daily meetings with senior executives across industries like healthcare, defense, education, and technology, I consistently hear about the significant efficiency gains LLMs provide in their work. But these benefits aren't limited to executive roles -- early career professionals can also leverage GenAI to streamline tasks, enhance their output, and stand out in their field. Some of the easiest and most efficient use cases include using GenAI for drafting emails, reports, strategizing and developing presentations; conducting research and summarizing findings; brainstorming ideas; and even preparing for meetings or interviews. Understand that by leveraging GenAI strategically, you can free up time for higher-value work, accelerate your skill development in those areas, and position yourself as forward-thinking leader in the job market. GenAI is one of the most versatile technologies of our time.\n\nBottom line: Even if you don't need GenAI outputs or their associated efficiency gains in your job today, that's likely to change. As AI improves and becomes ubiquitous -- and as you progress in your career to roles with added responsibility and competition -- you can count on needing it to meet the evolving standards of business and productivity.\n\nCreative professionals may be among the most likely to fall into this category, whether it's in writing, design, marketing, or strategy. The more you see AI as threatening -- to your own work, to your field, or to your long-term prospects -- the more you want to keep it at a distance.\n\nThe reality: Since the hype around LLMs first started, there's been a prevalence of zero-sum thinking that sees GenAI as a replacement for human skills, but this misses the point. Instead, it complements our skills, serving as a kind of productivity multiplier while helping to eliminate mundane and tedious tasks that people typically don't want to spend time on in the first place. In a survey of 4,000 marketing and creative leaders conducted by Canva, 70% said GenAI is helping their teams in a creative capacity, and 28% said that they save up to five hours a week thanks to AI-driven efficiency boosts.\n\nBottom line: Frankly, not using GenAI is probably a bigger threat to many careers than using it. Developing skills that are complementary to AI (such as critical thinking and problem solving) will arm you with a competency that will be increasingly sought after in the workplace. The emerging paradigm continues to emphasize that GenAI isn't coming for your job, but someone who uses it effectively probably will come for your job, now or in the near future.\n\nWhy tether yourself to a future where AI matters, if you don't know that's the case? It's a fair question. And when you see comparisons between GenAI and, for example, cryptocurrency and NFTs, \"wait and see\" does seem like a logical approach.\n\nThe reality: Early adopters in fields like marketing, software engineering, and even law are already gaining a significant competitive edge by leveraging AI for increased efficiency and productivity -- whether that's in tasks related to coding, research, content development, or one of the many other fields being impacted by GenAI. Additionally, highly-respected individuals in academia, business, and government all around the world have made their view clear -- AI is evolving to be an indispensable tool, not just in business but in society.\n\nBottom line: Whether concerning AI or any other aspect of the professional journey, those who proactively embrace uncertainty experience a range of personal and psychological benefits. An added variable in this case is the fact that AI's progression is currently exponential, meaning that the gap will only widen between those who embrace it now and those who wait.\n\nThis is a pivotal moment for young professionals. If you can cut through the noise and develop a nuanced understanding and appreciation for this new breed of technology, you'll have a powerful tool at your disposal.\n\nGenAI is certainly not a panacea, and shouldn't be blindly trusted or relied on -- but equally importantly, it shouldn't be feared or avoided based on limiting beliefs like those described here.

For enterprises, strategically capitalizing on AI has become an imperative for reinvigorating competitiveness.\n\nWhile many companies have initiated AI pilot projects and limited use cases, haphazard and siloed efforts will not suffice. Boards must aspire for more -- catalyzing an enterprise-wide embrace of AI to reinvent their core business and uncover game-changing innovations.\n\nRealizing this vision requires AI leadership to extend from corporate strategy to ethical governance. It is a multi-dimensional undertaking spanning AI application mastery, data excellence, human-AI symbiosis, and a culture of agility and intelligent process automation.\n\nA Playbook for Digital Growth and Reinvention\n\nFor boards to position their companies as AI leaders propelling digital business growth and industry model change, they must champion a holistic strategy encompassing:\n\nWhile AI is a powerful general-purpose technology, its ability to unlock unique competitive advantages will often hinge on how adeptly it is harnessed for an enterprise's particular industry dynamics, business domains and use cases.\n\nBoard of Director members must ensure their companies capitalize on this opportunity by developing tailored AI strategies aligning with their specific industry or sector playbook.\n\nThe emergence of advanced Generative AI (GenAI) tools has become a special catalyst for this industry-focused approach to digital business innovation. It's a key to rapid progress.\n\nUnlike previous AI models confined to narrow applications, Large Language Models (LLMs) and other GenAI capabilities can be instructed and fine-tuned to practically any complex domain requiring human-like reasoning, analysis, and content generation capabilities.\n\nFor example, a consumer products company could leverage GenAI models to design innovative new product concepts ideated for their brand's distinct customer segments and global market positioning.\n\nSimultaneously, those same AI assistants could create compelling marketing content at scale customized for diverse buyers and digital channels. On the operations side, GenAI could be employed for automated supply chain optimization through third-party data streams, historical insights, and predictive analytics.\n\nSimilarly, a financial services firm could use GenAI to create tailored portfolio analyses, recommendations and financial plans specifically modeling their clients' personal contexts and institutional guidelines.\n\nThose same AI capabilities could streamline client communications by automating natural language interfaces and understanding finance-specific terminology. Regulatory oversight functions could harness GenAI's reasoning abilities to scan for financial compliance risks and suggest mitigating actions based on the latest rules.\n\nAcross teams, the transformative potential is immense when companies develop GenAI capabilities closely aligned with their core industry expertise and proprietary data assets.\n\nThis fusing of GenAI tools with deep domain specialization enables operational optimization, product and service innovation, and customer intelligence capabilities -- all key sources of strategic competitive advantage.\n\nRealizing these unique opportunities will require boards to cultivate GenAI skills, data repositories, and strategic vendor partnerships. They will need to actively govern GenAI model development and use case identification while prioritizing industry- and domain-specific applications.\n\nFurthermore, creating an entrepreneurial corporate innovation engine continuously ideating and piloting promising industry domain-focused GenAI solutions will be critical to success.\n\nBy combining the power of GenAI tools with focused proprietary data mastery, boards can catalyze their enterprises' transformation into sector-disrupting digital business leaders.\n\nNew AI-conceived products, automated knowledge work paradigms, and customer engagement models will reshape many industries. Through diligent oversight ensuring responsible practices, boards can ensure these GenAI-enabled innovations benefit all stakeholders while fortifying their companies' market prominence.\n\nDecisive Action: A GenAI Window of Opportunity\n\nWhile formidable, proactively transforming into a GenAI-driven enterprise will be imperative for any company seeking to remain relevant and prosperous in the decades ahead. The competitive advantages and growth opportunities are simply too compelling to delay.\n\nTherefore, savvy board directors must make haste to provide visionary leadership catalyzing an enterprising and responsible GenAI renaissance for their company.\n\nAs a seasoned management advisor, I can partner with your board to craft a customized sales and marketing GenAI adoption strategy optimized for your unique corporate context.\n\nTogether, we will collaboratively design transformative GenAI app solutions, implement agile engineering and innovation practices, cultivate human-centered workforce competencies, and implement ethical governance guardrails.\n\nWorking with C-suite executives toward a shared goal, we can position your enterprise to thrive by harnessing GenAI's full potential as a strategic growth catalyst.\n\nNow is the time to courageously reinvent your company as a GenAI-fueled industry disruptor capturing all the digital business growth benefits.

From the rise of ChatGPT to the many tools that followed in its wake, companies of all sizes have joined the race to cultivate GenAI technology and applications. GenAI will continue to evolve in 2024 as its use accelerates, with important implications for cybersecurity - attackers and defenders alike.\n\nThreat intelligence was among the first domains to welcome and integrate the new GenAI technology. Threat intelligence is fundamentally all about data and the ability to process, contextualize and enrich data points, with the final goal of understanding threats so we can proactively work to mitigate them. GenAI promises to be a great asset to this end. However, we are still in the early stages of this adoption, and the marriage between GenAI applications and threat intelligence will be one of the most intriguing to watch. Here are five important trends that I believe we will see in 2024 in the field of threat intelligence:\n\nSince GenAI is data-driven, it's no wonder that the first trend is the application of its capabilities to data analytics tasks. Hours-long processes can shrink to minutes with GenAI, freeing analysts' time and creating a near real-time response to cyberthreats.\n\nA good example of this is ransomware data leak analysis. When a third-party vendor of a company is attacked and its data is leaked, it is the threat intelligence analyst's job to learn what company data is in the third-party vendor leak. Analyzing 500GB of someone else's data is no easy task, especially when the data includes many data points spread across various file formats (such as PDF reports, photographs of receipts and huge Excel sheets), all stored in different folders and with naming conventions sometimes understood only by the creators themselves. Sifting through such a trove of data can be time-consuming and ineffective. GenAI technology, which can understand natural language and analyze data in various formats, is a perfect solution to perform such activities.\n\nImagine you're contending with the following threat assessments:\n\nThese are examples of the day-to-day data points a threat analyst needs to quickly filter through, separating and prioritizing the real and/or imminent threats from the more benign everyday events. GenAI solutions capable of understanding the context while overcoming the language barrier will become an obvious choice to classify and explain the possible threat, focusing the analyst on the important threats that must be dealt with urgently.\n\nEvery intelligence analyst will tell you that having the intelligence itself is not enough. Once the intelligence is acquired, the next stage is to disseminate it to the relevant parties to take action.\n\nHowever, this isn't always as simple as it sounds. Surprisingly, there is not a 100% match between the ability to understand cyber-related content and threats and the ability to explain these threats to a non-tech-savvy person. Furthermore, the language can sometimes be a barrier as we move toward using remote workforces. On top of that, a threat intelligence industry undergoing a shift from service-based to software-based solutions is discovering that a high-quality and meaningful report is not as simple a task to automate as we might have thought. For these reasons, using GenAI capabilities on top of \"old-fashioned\" automation will expand widely and become a vital part of every threat intelligence solution.\n\nGenAI is a power multiplier not only for security teams but also for attackers. In 2023, we saw several illicit usages of this technology with prominent examples of WormGPT and FraudGPT. Both are offshoots of OpenGPT with the intent of fostering GenAI applications without any ethics or limitations, and both can be used for hacking activities that will only grow in sophistication.\n\nThat being said, GenAI capabilities can also be used to detect these attacks. The flexibility of GenAI tools can help to analyze different aspects of an event to quickly understand if it is a threat. For example, looking into both the header and content of an email while simultaneously comparing it to past email conversations can help detect scam and business email compromise (BEC) attacks. GenAI could also be deployed to analyze the code, the content, the look and feel of a website and the Whois details to determine if a website is a phishing website, almost in real-time.\n\nOne of the untold secrets in the threat intelligence field is that human interaction skills are sometimes as important as technical analysis skills. The ability to understand the different stages of attacks, analyze malware and make sense of network traffic is important in its own right.\n\nBut no threat intelligence program is complete without the ability to access the data at its source: the attackers. This requires human interaction. Underground hacking forums, Telegram groups and Discord channels have proven to be valuable again and again for interfacing with threat actors. While this data is usually shared for free, mostly it requires human interaction to extract. The level of human interaction needed can vary from source to source, from answering questions to gaining access to forums - or even sustaining conversations with an attacker over several days. Many of these tasks, if not all, can be operated by GenAI technology. At the very least, GenAI could take some of the load off the researcher.\n\nExpect GenAI to continue to be a hot topic across threat intelligence applications. As threats grow increasingly sophisticated - powered by GenAI themselves, in many cases - GenAI will play a growing role in combatting them.", "source": {"uri": "securityboulevard.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Security Boulevard"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyber_threat_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cyber threat intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_breach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Data breach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Real-time computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Analytics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Computer security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ransomware", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ransomware"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "PDF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_format", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "File format"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_analysis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Intelligence analysis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Excel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Excel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Natural language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discord", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Discord"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_hacker", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Security hacker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telegram_(messaging_service)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Telegram (messaging service)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_traffic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Network traffic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_spoofing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Email spoofing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Header_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Header (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human\u2013computer_interaction", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Human\u2013computer interaction"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Associations", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Academic_Departments", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Academic Departments", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Data_Administration", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Data Administration", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Intelligence", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Intelligence", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://securityboulevard.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Human-Factors.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9603026", "eventUri": "eng-9603026", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

It is common for investment funds to make small initial investments or wait for technology maturity.\n\nKey factors to evaluate AI start-ups include competitive advantage, revenue model and the team behind it, Vy added.\n\nLaura Nguyen, a partner at GenAI Fund, stressed that the top concern for investment funds is to ensure the sustainability of GenAI startup business models.\n\nThis is particularly important in the presence of tech giants like Google and Microsoft, who have access to massive amounts of data.\n\nShe also highlighted the need for GenAI entrepreneurs to protect their businesses from market risks while fostering innovation and creativity.\n\nExperts are sharing optimistic insights on the progress of AI in Vietnam as technology companies make big investments.\n\nMany university students are now GenAI founders and have already developed products that generate substantial revenues.\n\nVietnam's start-up ecosystem has progressed remarkably in recent years.\n\nExperts highlight the importance of creating a supportive environment and infrastructure for startup development.\n\nWith a stable economy, a fast-growing ecosystem, a favourable startup environment, low costs and support from government policies and large corporations, AI startups are flourishing.\n\nVy from Do Ventures noted the benefits of collaborations between GenAI founders and major corporations, which provide extensive systems and data. And Vietnamese corporations have policies to foster partnerships with startups.\n\nThough the United States and China have a technological infrastructure advantage in AI, Vietnam can still compete in application development.\n\nValerie Vu, founder of Ansible Ventures, believes in the country's talented engineers' potential to create impactful AI applications.\n\nVietnam's high-quality human resources excel in both software and hardware development, setting it apart. -- Viet Nam News/ANN", "source": {"uri": "thestar.com.my", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Star "}, "authors": [],

Infosys is pivoting to a GenAI first company, Salil Parekh, chief executive and managing director of India's second-largest software services firm told ET. In a wide-ranging interview with Sameer Ranjan Bakshi, Beena Parmar and Surabhi Agarwal, he spoke of his plans to prepare the $18.6 billion software services giant -- through its Topaz platform -- for the GenAI-led transformation that will take root as global macro-economic concerns ease. For now, as clients postpone large digital transformation projects amid uncertain demand for technology services, Infosys will choose profitability over growth. The 59-year-old -- whose second tenure as Infosys CEO extends until 2027 -- said his spare time these days is devoted to experimenting with different AI tools. Edited Excerpts\n\nThe current financial year was supposed to be one of recovery, how has it been so far?\n\nWe are not seeing discretionary spends and the (return) of large digital programs. Financial services was looking a little better at the end of fourth quarter (FY24), that continues. While GenAI is currently very small in terms of revenue, the good part is that there is a lot of activity. It's a way to manufacture new intelligence - whether it is through tokens or assistants or agents. And we are using them in different places - software engineering or in customer service or in sales and marketing. And we are seeing new elements coming from generative AI, as well as some cost efficiency and productivity. As the inflation, interest rate, macro-economic environment changes, we will start to see some of the digital programs start to come back. And then GenAI will also start to scale up. It is a multi-year project.\n\nAlso read | After tennis, Infosys Topaz to drive AI-led innovation of Formula E racing\n\nAre clients taking big bets on GenAI projects yet?\n\nThere are (ongoing) generative AI projects, but those are not what we call enterprise-wide. They are like a division or a particular area of a company. More of that will come as the economic environment changes. In addition to digital transformation, there will be a push to \"GenAI transformation\", with changes to how customer connect is built and how operations are run more efficiently.\n\nRevenue forecasts remain conservative across top-tier companies despite bagging big deals, why is this so?\n\nLast financial year, Infosys secured deals over $17 billion TCV (total contract value), one of the largest we've had. Most of those deals are on cost, efficiency, automation and consolidation. But large digital transformation programs and the discretionary projects are not in the market today. These large programmes, the discretionary and the cost takeout ( where clients are looking to drive efficiencies and reduce cost) deals, is what has given us the overall growth momentum over the years. Since a part of that is not happening, and most of the ( current growth) is coming on the back of (efficiency-driven) deals, we've given a growth guidance of 1% to 3% for this financial year on a constant currency basis.\n\nEven in this quarter, the pipeline is similar to what we shared at the start of the quarter. And there are a lot of vendor consolidation deals which we're betting on and benefiting from.\n\nAlso read | Infosys Q4 net profit jumps 30%; company buys German tech firm for \u20ac450 million\n\nIn this competitive market, we hear that companies are ready to sign contracts on zero percent margins. What is your approach?\n\nWe are a high margin company and our aspiration is high margins. There's changes in the environment and what we're seeing in terms of the large deals. What we are doing with generative AI is very strong-- and at one to three percent organic growth guidance-- is one of the strongest in the industry today.\n\nOur margin for the large deals is about the same as what we had seen in the previous quarter. There's always price intensity in this industry and every one or two years there's some entity that certainly becomes unusually price focused but that keeps changing. It doesn't look any different right now.\n\nHaving said that, we have a very strong margin program (Maximus) that we put in place about a year ago which is giving us very good outcomes. In the past financial year we saw some early benefits.\n\nDo you see the FTE or full-time employment model changing with the GenAI disruption? Do you anticipate IT companies hiring fewer people going forward?\n\nThere are two aspects to it, one is the macro situation like inflation, high interest rates and so on, playing out. That essentially is where we see reduced discretionary and digital transformation spending (by clients) and that is one of reasons we have seen headcount reduction. In the GenAI piece, there are two parts to it: one is on revenue growth and the other is productivity. Both combined, the GenAI activity is quite strong. It's not affecting at the company level in stats (statistics). However, we are getting ready for GenAI for the overall business of the future. As the macro environment starts to change, we will start to see changes.\n\nThe way we look at it is, technology is a huge driver for the world. If you look at large organisations, they still have Cobol with them and today we have GenAI, that's a gap of 40 years. And every technology in between still exists. We are good with large organisations to work across a range of technologies to improve their businesses in whichever way it is - growth, costs, etc. As the economic environment changes, we also feel the outlook in the longer term is hugely favourable to someone like Infosys.\n\nWith Infosys pivoting as a GenAI company, how are you readying talent? Many existing roles will not be needed and some will evolve. How do you see this evolving?\n\nClose to 80% of employees are already trained in GenAI. We feel the talent we can access with the Infosys brand is incredible. And generally, we look after our employees even in difficult macro environments, we look out for their best and so we have no constraints on the quality and number of people we can get. In the AI-first approach, we build our own capabilities and we are ready to train even more people as we bring them onboard. That is the biggest advantage that Infosys has and that a country like India has-- the kind of talent that can support transformation of the world into the new GenAI era.\n\nDo you see India losing talent edge with the kind of roles getting automated?\n\nWhat we see and experience with GenAI today is that it is more helpful to individuals. When we start to work for large organisations, there is a need for enormous capability to drive business.\n\nYes, generative AI will have benefits, but we also need to make sure that it works across all of the areas for large organisations. There are different types of skills that services companies like Infosys and others will develop over time, which will continue to expand. Technology talent is a key differentiator around the world and we are fortunate to have a lot of it in India, and within Infosys, and that's going to be critical for the future.\n\nAlso read | Infosys reports drop in hiring for fifth straight quarter in Q4\n\nWhat kind of work are you doing on GenAI?\n\nThe one we are working with is for large organizations, where we take a large language model and train it with specific data from that organization. We call it a narrow transformer approach.\n\nAs you pivot Infosys towards an AI-first company, what kind of inputs do you get from chairman Nandan Nilekani and founder NR Narayana Murthy?\n\nNandan (Nilekani) gives strong inputs, has a clear vision, and spends a lot of time with me and the team which is working on GenAI.

Prep for Success With These 4 Tips", "body": "Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) has taken the world by storm, with more than 55% of organizations piloting or actively using the technology. Yet, despite this overwhelming interest in the transformative potential of GenAI, security teams still have a responsibility to ensure that any new tool or platform is implemented securely and rigorously protected in accordance with industry and company best practices.\n\nA recent poll of business and cybersecurity leaders, conducted by Information Security Media Group (ISMG), found five common concerns around GenAI implementation:\n\nSo what steps can security teams take to make sure that their organizations are prepared to safely implement GenAI?\n\nAs with any new technology, foundational cybersecurity best practices are one of the best places to start when implementing a new tool or platform into your environment. Referencing widely used security standards can help CISOs incorporate broader trustworthiness considerations into the design, development, deployment, and use of AI systems in their own environments. Here are four steps to prepare your organization for GenAI.\n\nZero trust is the cornerstone of any cyber resilience plan, limiting the impact of an incident on the organization. Instead of assuming everything behind the corporate firewall is safe, the zero-trust model assumes a breach and verifies each request as though it originates from an open network. Applying a familiar security framework like zero trust can help organizations better manage and govern any GenAI tools operating in their environments.\n\nBasic security hygiene still protects against 99% of attacks. Meeting the minimum standards for cyber hygiene is essential for protecting against cyber threats, minimizing risk, and ensuring the ongoing viability of the business. For organizations that are concerned about privacy or potential AI misuse or fraud, strong cyber hygiene standards can help protect against some of the most common threats.\n\nUnderstanding that data security is one of the chief concerns for GenAI implementation, security teams should also work to establish a comprehensive data security and protection plan before implementing any new GenAI technology. A defense-in-depth approach is one of the best protection strategies available when it comes to fortifying data security. We also recommend enforcing data labeling to ensure sensitive data is appropriately tagged and implementing stringent data permissions to reduce unauthorized access to sensitive information.\n\nFinally, before your organization can fully activate your chosen GenAI solution, you must have an AI governance structure in place. AI-ready organizations will have implemented processes, controls, and accountability frameworks that govern data privacy, security, and development of their AI systems, including the implementation of responsible AI standards.", "source": {"uri": "darkreading.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Dark Reading"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_practice", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Best practice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Computer security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Information security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyber_resilience", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cyber resilience"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firewall_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Firewall (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Data security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labeled_data", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Labeled data"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberattack", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cyberattack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accountability", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Accountability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Information privacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Privacy"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security", "wgt": 42}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Products_and_Tools", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Products and Tools", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Internet", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Internet", "wgt": 35}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Advisories_and_Patches", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Advisories and Patches", "wgt": 33}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/FAQs,_Help,_and_Tutorials", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/FAQs, Help, and Tutorials", "wgt": 33}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 51}], "image": "https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt6d90778a997de1cd/blt07309b91c116606b/65ca5364c31fbf040a5a0761/GenAI_MauriceNorbert_Alamy.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9603026", "eventUri": "eng-9603026", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.6549019607843136, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

It removes the need to use extract/transform/load or ETL tools to pull data from different systems into a centralized database. It can pull information from multiple databases and systems of record, centralize it in a single repository for processing, run analyses and then visualize the results with graphs.\n\nThat platform is now being tweaked to cater to generative AI workloads, the company said. The new Operational GenAI offering integrates the company's flagship platform with various best-of-breed open-source large language models, plus tools to fine-tune them so that companies can infuse them with their own knowledge to ensure accuracy and safety.\n\nTo do this, it's partnering with the RAG-as-a-service startup Vectara Inc. and the AI pipeline company aiXplain Inc., which handle RAG plus model serving and fine-tuning, respectively, directly within the Operational GenAI platform. By using Supermicro's AI-optimized hardware, companies can keep their new generative AI data foundation in-house, ensuring privacy.\n\nThe company argues that if generative AI initiatives are going to be successful, they need access to fresh, detailed information that's not only secure, but also private. Most enterprises lack this, which is where the new Operational GenAI service comes in. It gives companies a way to fully automate generative AI applications with access to unlimited data in a secure, customizable environment where data privacy and governance standards are always upheld.\n\nIncarta co-founder and Chief Executive Osama Elkady said the partnerships with Vectara and aiXplain mean it is uniquely able to combine enterprise operational data with unstructured information. \"This enables customers with a click of the button to have access to an unlimited, private, and fine-tuned generative AI solution on top of the best data foundation for AI,\" he said.\n\nAiXplain founder and CEO Hassan Sawaf said generative AI is evolving to become a world of \"agents\" that can drive innovation and operational efficiencies in hundreds of very specific niches. These agents are all based on LLMs and then trained to perform certain tasks to a high degree of excellence, but to do this, enterprises need the right platform, he stressed. He therefore likens Operational GenAI as a primary AI agent that directs the execution of other AI agents.\n\n\"With aiXplain, Vectara's RAG and Incorta's Operational Lakehouse platform, applications can seamlessly become AI agents directed by Operational GenAI,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "siliconangle.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SiliconANGLE"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Startup company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-premises_software", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "On-premises software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Analytics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Large language model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_transform,_load", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Extract, transform, load"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Open-source software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Privacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Database"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unstructured_data", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Unstructured data"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Information privacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Agents", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Agents", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Publications", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Data_Administration", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Data Administration", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://d15shllkswkct0.cloudfront.net/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2024/05/Screenshot-from-2024-05-28-09-40-29.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9603026", "eventUri": "eng-9603026", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3333333333333333, "wgt": 138, "relevance": 1}

In 2016, applying AI in OneAtlas made it possible to process high-resolution satellite images and extract useful information for farmers, insurers and energy companies. Since 2017 the Skywise digital platform, which uses technologies such as Natural Language Processing (NLP), has been improving predictive maintenance and limiting the breakdowns of aircraft in service.\n\nInitially, the use of AI was limited to specialist engineers or data scientists. Things are changing. The arrival of generative artificial intelligence brings the technology within reach for many more people. Its use is reaching unprecedented heights, with enormous potential in terms of efficiency, savings and quality.\n\nTo make the most of the opportunity and make GenAI accessible to everyone in the company, Airbus launched a company-wide working group in 2023. \"This group aims to bring the power of generative AI, large language models and base models to Airbus, while developing the policies and safeguards to do so responsibly, in line with our core values,\" says Catherine Jestin, Airbus Executive Vice President Digital.\n\nFrom engineering assistants, contract analytics, recruitment tools to cyber threat and risk analysis and procurement optimisation, 600 use cases have been identified across Airbus in less than a year. They range from improving processes to optimising the performance of products, services and support activities. GenAI can be applied to internal activities or to transforming customer relations, automating routine tasks or establishing itself as a genuine game changer.\n\nBetter manage complex and technical documents\n\n\"While it is unlikely that GenAI will be able to design future Airbus products from scratch, its ability to assist humans by enabling them to better manage complex and technical documents is proving promising,\" says Fabrice Valentin, head of AI and Advanced Analytics at Airbus.\n\nOne experiment, for example, aims to demonstrate how technology can help after-sales service teams to provide answers more quickly. Another full-scale experiment involves testing an AI assistant for Standard Operating Instructions, the manufacturing instructions used to build the aircraft. The chatbot facilitates access to technical data. \"For example, it enables us to check in an instant, using natural language, which torque spanner to use for a specific operation, whereas using a tablet sometimes involves going through many pages of documentation\", Fabrice Valentin explains.\n\nIn just a few months, GenAI has begun to make headway across Airbus. The experiments currently underway suggest some exciting prospects. However, large-scale deployment will take some time, at least in certain areas. \"We have to comply with the regulatory constraints that characterise the aerospace industry, and we want to ensure that GenAI's solutions are used in a safe , responsible, ethical and sustainable way,\" concludes Catherine Jestin.", "source": {"uri": "airbus.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Airbus"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbus", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Airbus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Natural language processing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Data science"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Customer service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Satellite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Large language model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Risk management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mathematical optimization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procurement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Procurement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Analytics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_president", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vice president"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Engineering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_assistant", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Virtual assistant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerospace", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aerospace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Natural language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_relationship_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Customer relationship management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablet_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tablet computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ethics"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Natural_Language", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Natural Language", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Associations", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Publications", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://www.airbus.com/sites/g/files/jlcbta136/files/styles/airbus_608x608/public/2024-05/Airbus-GenAir-assistant-screen.jpg?itok=qOHiZZXb", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9603026", "eventUri": "eng-9603026", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4588235294117646, "wgt": 118, "relevance": 1}

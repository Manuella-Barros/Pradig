India is comfortably in the lead with 47 finalists, but New Zealand and Australia are in a tie for second place at 19 finalists each. The New Zealand entries include Motion Sickness\u2018 \u201cYou\u2019re Cooked\u201d and Rep your suburb campaigns, Special Auckland\u2018s Every Kiwi Vote Counts and Making pretty impressive sh*t campaigns and DDB Group Aotearoa had multiple nominations including its Think Different Samsung and McDonald\u2019s Kiwiburger campaigns. The competitive pool of entries submitted were narrowed down following intense discussion and scrutiny from around 120 judges. \u201cAfter two years of hybrid sessions, it was a pleasure to welcome judges from all corners of the Asia Pacific region back to in-person judging and to witness the immense effort made to assess the merits of each case,\u201d said Awards Chairperson Tze Kiat Tan. \u201cThis would not have been possible without the sincere engagement and dedication of our jury, of which I am thankful for. I believe the finalists this year have set higher benchmarks for effectiveness and highlights the breadth of talent in the region, with more cases from non-traditional markets such as Indonesia and South Korea making the cut. I am pleased to introduce our full list of finalists and look forward to the Awards Gala where the results will be revealed.\u201d", "summary": "<p>Effie Asia Pacific has announced 121 finalists will vie for top honours in its annual Awards, with the winners revealed at a gala event on 13 September 2024.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://stoppress.co.nz/news/nz-agencies-recognised-as-effie-apac-finalists/\">NZ agencies recognised as Effie APAC finalists</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://stoppress.co.nz\">stoppress.co.nz</a>.</p>", "url": "https://stoppress.co.nz/news/nz-agencies-recognised-as-effie-apac-finalists/", "image": "https://stoppress.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Unknown-9-702x459.jpeg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-18 00:38:51", "author": "StopPress Team", "authors": ["StopPress Team"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "nz", "sentiment": 0.564}

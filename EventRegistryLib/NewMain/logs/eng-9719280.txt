I don't think anyone is thinking jail time, but given the decision for Ms. Gutierrez-Reed it's hard to know,\" the insider said.\n\nDuring his opening statement on Wednesday, Alec's attorney, Alex Spiro, argued that Alec \"committed no crime\" and was operating on set as actors normally do on a movie set involving weapons.\n\nNever miss a story -- sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\n\"Not a day goes by when we don't wish Alec had saved her life.

Alec looked sharp in a grey suit, white dress shirt and navy blue tie, while 40-year-old Hilaria donned a brown jacket over matching slacks.\n\nSurprisingly, Hilaria arrived with the couple's youngest child. At one point, video captured Alec asking Hilaria, \"Can I help you?,\" as she unloaded the stroller out of the black SUV. Alec was also seen asking his daughter, \"Want to come to daddy?,\" before Hilaria handed the youngest child to a caretaker.\n\n\"You have a celebrity, family man, an A-list celebrity that is also shooting a reality TV show, mind you, so the optics in front of the courthouse with a sea of media, and it's not a red carpet,\" noted Court TV Crime and Justice Correspondent Matt Johnson to ET's Cassie DiLaura.\n\nAlec was then seen heading inside the courthouse for day 2 of his involuntary manslaughter trial in connection to the fatal shooting of Rust cinematographer Halyna Hutchins on the set of his film in October 2021. On his way inside, a reporter asked, \"How are you feeling this morning?\" Alec looked at the reporter but said nothing.\n\n\"Number 1, he's trying to act like an everyday person and that he's taking this very seriously,\" Johnson said. \"He's wearing glasses, he's wearing a suit and tie even for the pretrial hearings and then he also has no hair dye. H appears a little bit older, even though he's only 66.\"\n\nHilaria and Ilaria's appearance wasn't the only familial support the actor-producer received. His brother, Stephen Baldwin, was also seen in a hallway outside of the courtroom. He donned a navy blue suit, a button-down shirt and tie with his hair slicked back.\n\nAfter a day of motions being sorted out, Tuesday's trial kicked off jury selection, albeit with a few technical difficulties that delayed the trial. In the end, 12 jurors and four alternatives were selected.\n\nAlec was indicted with a charge of involuntary manslaughter by a grand jury in the fatal shooting of 42-year-old Hutchins. He pled not guilty. If convicted, Alec faces up to 18 months in prison.\n\nAccording to court documents obtained by ET on June 18, special prosecutors Kari T. Morrissey and Erlinda O. Johnson allege that the actor engaged in \"horseplay\" with a gun during training.

(AP) -- Prosecutors sought to cast Alec Baldwin as someone who flouts rules and has little regard for safety at the first day of his New Mexico trial in the shooting of a cinematographer.\n\nSpecial prosecutor Erlinda Ocampo Johnson repeatedly referred to Baldwin playing \"make-believe\" with a revolver on the set of the film \"Rust,\" and said it led to very real danger and the death of Halyna Hutchins, whom she called \"a vibrant 42-year-old rising star.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Jury convicts movie armorer of involuntary manslaughter in fatal shooting by Alec Baldwin\n\nOcampo Johnson told jurors in her opening statement Wednesday that Baldwin \"requested to be assigned the biggest gun available\" and that during a training session for it, he had \"people filming him while he's running around shooting this gun.\"\n\nThe prosecutor said behind-the-scenes video will show Baldwin casually disregarding basic firearm safety.\n\n\"You will see him using this gun as a pointer to point at people, point at things,\" Ocampo Johnson said. \"You will see him cock the hammer when he is not supposed to cock the hammer, you will see him put his finger on the trigger when his finger's not supposed to be on the trigger.\"\n\nHutchins' death and the wounding of director Joel Souza nearly three years ago sent shock waves through the film industry and led to the felony involuntary manslaughter charge against Baldwin that could result in up to 18 months in prison.\n\nThe trial of the 66-year-old star of \"30 Rock\" and frequent host of \"Saturday Night Live\" continues Thursday with testimony from a crime scene technician with the Santa Fe County Sheriff's Department.\n\nThe beginning of testimony of the technician, Marissa Poppell, allowed jurors to see the revolver and the spent round from the shooting.\n\nBaldwin's lawyer Alex Spiro emphasized in his opening statement that Baldwin did only what actors always do.\n\n\"He must be able to take that weapon and use it in the way that the person he's playing would,\" Spiro told jurors.\n\nThat includes pulling the trigger. Baldwin has said the gun fired accidentally, but Spiro said that it still would not be manslaughter even if he had willfully fired it.\n\n\"On a movie set, you're allowed to pull that trigger,\" said Spiro.\n\nSpiro called the shooting an \"unspeakable tragedy\" and that an \"amazing person\" dies, but said the responsibility lies with the film's armorer Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, who has already been convicted of involuntary manslaughter, and of assistant director David Halls, who told Baldwin the gun was \"cold.\"\n\n\"It had been checked and double checked by those responsible for ensuring the gun was safe,\" Spiro said. \"He did not tamper with it, he did not load it himself. He did not leave it unattended.\"\n\nThe first witness to take the stand was Nicholas LeFleur, the first law enforcement officer to arrive at the movie set at Bonanza Creek Ranch after the shooting, and his lapel camera video gave jurors a glimpse of the chaotic scene: a grim view of an apparently unconscious Hutchins as LeFleur and others worked to revive her.\n\nREAD MORE: Judge rules Alec Baldwin's co-producer role not relevant in 'Rust' shooting case\n\nLater in the video, LeFleur can be seen telling Baldwin not to speak to the other potential witnesses, but Baldwin repeatedly does.\n\n\"Was Mr. Baldwin supposed to be talking about the incident?\" special prosecutor Kari Morrissey asked him.\n\n\"No ma'am,\" LeFleur replied.\n\n\"Does he appear to be doing it anyway?\" Morrissey asked.\n\n\"Yes, ma'am,\" LeFleur said.\n\nAmong those sitting in the gallery behind Baldwin watching the trial were his wife Hilaria Baldwin, younger brother Stephen Baldwin and older sister Elizabeth Keuchler -- who wiped away tears at times during the proceedings.\n\nDalton reported from Los Angeles.", "source": {"uri": "pbs.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "PBS.org"},

(AP) -- Prosecutors sought to cast Alec Baldwin as someone who flouts rules and has little regard for safety at the first day of his New Mexico trial in the shooting of a cinematographer.\n\nSpecial prosecutor Erlinda Ocampo Johnson repeatedly referred to Baldwin playing \"make-believe\" with a revolver on the set of the film \"Rust,\" and said it led to very real danger and the death of Halyna Hutchins, whom she called \"a vibrant 42-year-old rising star.\"\n\nOcampo Johnson told jurors in her opening statement Wednesday that Baldwin \"requested to be assigned the biggest gun available\" and that during a training session for it, he had \"people filming him while he's running around shooting this gun.\"\n\nThe prosecutor said behind-the-scenes video will show Baldwin casually disregarding basic firearm safety.\n\n\"You will see him using this gun as a pointer to point at people, point at things,\" Ocampo Johnson said. \"You will see him cock the hammer when he is not supposed to cock the hammer, you will see him put his finger on the trigger when his finger's not supposed to be on the trigger.\"\n\nHutchins' death and the wounding of director Joel Souza nearly three years ago sent shock waves through the film industry and led to the felony involuntary manslaughter charge against Baldwin that could result in up to 18 months in prison.\n\nThe trial of the 66-year-old star of \"30 Rock\" and frequent host of \"Saturday Night Live\" resumed for its second day Thursday with testimony from a crime scene technician with the Santa Fe County Sheriff's Department.\n\nWednesday started with testimony from the technician, Marissa Poppell, and allowed jurors to see the revolver and the spent round from the shooting.\n\nBaldwin's attorney Alex Spiro on Thursday asked Poppell detailed questions about how she collected and handled the gun and ammunition evidence. He was frequently interrupted by objections from the prosecution and subsequent sidebars with the judge.\n\nSpiro emphasized in his opening statement that Baldwin on the \"Rust\" set did what actors always do.\n\n\"He must be able to take that weapon and use it in the way that the person he's playing would,\" Spiro told jurors.\n\nThat includes pulling the trigger. Baldwin has said the gun fired accidentally, but Spiro said that it still would not be manslaughter even if he had willfully fired it.\n\n\"On a movie set, you're allowed to pull that trigger,\" said Spiro.\n\nSpiro called the shooting an \"unspeakable tragedy\" and that an \"amazing person\" dies, but said the responsibility lies with the film's armorer Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, who has already been convicted of involuntary manslaughter, and of assistant director David Halls, who told Baldwin the gun was \"cold.\"\n\n\"It had been checked and double checked by those responsible for ensuring the gun was safe,\" Spiro said. \"He did not tamper with it, he did not load it himself. He did not leave it unattended.\"\n\nThe first witness to take the stand was Nicholas LeFleur, the first law enforcement officer to arrive at the movie set at Bonanza Creek Ranch after the shooting, and his lapel camera video gave jurors a glimpse of the chaotic scene: a grim view of an apparently unconscious Hutchins as LeFleur and others worked to revive her.\n\nLater in the video, LeFleur can be seen telling Baldwin not to speak to the other potential witnesses, but Baldwin repeatedly does.\n\n\"Was Mr. Baldwin supposed to be talking about the incident?\" special prosecutor Kari Morrissey asked him.\n\n\"No ma'am,\" LeFleur replied.\n\n\"Does he appear to be doing it anyway?\" Morrissey asked.\n\n\"Yes, ma'am,\" LeFleur said.\n\nAmong those sitting in the gallery behind Baldwin watching the trial were his wife Hilaria Baldwin, younger brother Stephen Baldwin and older sister Elizabeth Keuchler -- who wiped away tears at times during the proceedings.\n\n___ For more coverage

The charges relate to the fatal on-set shooting of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins during the filming of the Western movie Rust in 2021.\n\nAlso present in the courthouse was their sister Elizabeth, 69.\n\nThe courtroom attendees included Stephen and Hilaria, 40, who sat among others in a row behind Alec, 66.\n\nThe trial opened with statements from both Alec's defense team and the prosecution. Hilaria, who has been married to Alec since 2012 and shares seven children with him, was also in attendance with two of their children for jury selection on July 9.\n\nStephen Baldwin, known for his roles in The Usual Suspects and Born on the Fourth of July, is the youngest of Alec's three brothers. The Baldwin family includes brothers Daniel, 63, and Billy, 61, along with two sisters, Elizabeth and Jane, 59.\n\nA source recently informed PEOPLE that Alec, though initially intending to face the trial alone, will have the support of his family throughout the proceedings. Alec could face up to 18 months in prison if convicted.\n\n\"Alec wants to put on a brave face and go to the trial alone, but his family will be present to support him,\" the source stated.\n\nAlec's criminal trial follows his not guilty plea in January, soon after a grand jury indicted him on the involuntary manslaughter charge.\n\nThe actor is reportedly \"stressed\" and \"understandably worried\" about the trial, particularly after Rust's armorer, Hannah Gutierrez Reed, was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter and sentenced to 18 months in prison in April.\n\n\"He has an excellent legal team,\" the source said. \"I don't\n\nthink anyone is thinking jail time, but given the decision for Ms. Gutierrez-Reed it's hard to know.\"\n\nSince the October 2021 incident, Alec has maintained that he did not pull the trigger of the prop gun when it discharged, leading to Hutchins' death and injuring director Joel Souza. Alec has also claimed he was unaware the gun contained live ammunition.", "source": {"uri": "tribune.com.pk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Express Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "pop_culture@tribune.com.pk", "name": "Pop Culture", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Baldwin", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Baldwin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alec_Baldwin", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alec Baldwin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halyna_Hutchins", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Halyna Hutchins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilaria_Baldwin", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hilaria Baldwin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_(genre)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Western (genre)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinematographer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cinematographer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_procedure", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Criminal procedure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manslaughter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manslaughter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Fe,_New_Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Santa Fe, New Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Santa Fe, New Mexico"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Mexico"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baldwin_family", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Baldwin family"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_Day_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Independence Day (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prop_gun", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prop gun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Souza", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joel Souza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weapons_master", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Weapons master"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grand jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indictment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plea", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Plea"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/pixelcut-export1720640429-0/pixelcut-export1720640429-0.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719280", "eventUri": "eng-9719280", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-10", "textStart": 111, "textEnd": 118}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-09", "textStart": 832, "textEnd": 838}], "sentiment": -0.1450980392156863, "wgt": 201, "relevance": 1}

Baldwin has said the gun fired accidentally, but Spiro said that it still would not be manslaughter even if he had willfully fired it.\n\n\"On a movie set, you're allowed to pull that trigger,\" said Spiro.\n\nFollow along for live updates:\n\nThe first witness who took the stand on Wednesday Nicholas LeFleur, the first law enforcement officer to arrive at the movie set at Bonanza Creek Ranch after the shooting, and his lapel camera video gave jurors a glimpse of the chaotic scene: a grim view of an apparently unconscious Hutchins as LeFleur and others worked to revive her.\n\nLater in the video, LeFleur can be seen telling Baldwin not to speak to the other potential witnesses, but Baldwin repeatedly does.\n\n\"Was Mr. Baldwin supposed to be talking about the incident?\" special prosecutor Kari Morrissey asked him.\n\n\"No ma'am,\" LeFleur replied.\n\n\"Does he appear to be doing it anyway?\" Morrissey asked.\n\n\"Yes, ma'am,\" LeFleur said.\n\nA dozen people were inside a movie set church the day Alec Baldwin shot and killed cinematographer Halyna Hutchins and wounded director Joel Souza during a rehearsal for the Western film \"Rust.\" It happened Oct. 21, 2021.\n\nThe crew was rehearsing in the small church on the movie set at Bonanza Creek Ranch in New Mexico.\n\nBaldwin, the lead actor and co-producer of the film, has claimed the gun fired accidentally after he followed instructions to point it toward Hutchins, who was behind the camera. Unaware that it was loaded with a live round, he said he pulled back the hammer -- not the trigger -- and it fired.\n\nA judge has ruled his role as co-producer of the film is not relevant to the trial, a significant victory for the defense.\n\nRELATED: Rust movie shooting: Jury convicts movie armorer of involuntary manslaughter\n\nAlec Baldwin's trial, which is taking place in Santa Fe, began the week of July 9 with jury selection. It's expected to last nine days, with opening statements on Wednesday, July 10, and closing statements Friday, July 19, if things stay on schedule.\n\nBaldwin is charged with felony involuntary manslaughter, and prosecutors have two alternative standards for proving the charge:\n\nThe 12 jurors will have to reach just one verdict -- guilty or not guilty -- on a single count.\n\nTwo major themes are likely to emerge through questioning: the chaotic atmosphere of the movie set, and the details of the Italian-made classic revolver that Baldwin pointed at Hutchins.\n\nThe trial will be streamed and broadcast by several outlets, including LiveNOW from FOX. Here's how to watch.\n\nViewer discretion is advised, as the judge ruled graphic images from Hutchins' autopsy and from police lapel cameras during the treatment of her injuries could be shown.\n\nRELATED: Where to watch LiveNOW from FOX\n\nNo, Alec Baldwin has not been in jail while awaiting trial.\n\nBaldwin remained free pending trial under conditions that include not possessing firearms, consuming alcohol or leaving the country. Baldwin can have limited contact with witnesses when it comes to promoting \"Rust,\" which has not been released for public viewing. Baldwin is prohibited from asking members of the \"Rust\" cast or crew to participate in a related documentary film.\n\nBaldwin, 66, could get up to 18 months in prison if jurors unanimously decide he committed the felony.\n\nRELATED: 'Rust' movie medic awarded $1.15 million partial settlement\n\nJudge Mary Marlowe Sommer is presiding over Alec Baldwin's trial.\n\nShe also presided over the trial of Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, who was working as an armorer on \"Rust\" when the deadly shooting happened. Gutierrez-Reed was convicted of involuntary manslaughter and sentenced to 18 months, the same charge and sentencing Baldwin faces.\n\nWhen sentencing Gutierrez-Reed in April, the judge told the defendant that anything less than the maximum sentence would not be appropriate, citing what she called recklessness.\n\nIf Gutierrez-Reed's trial is any indication, Marlowe Sommer will keep the attorneys on track and on schedule in what will be a high-profile proceeding.", "source": {"uri": "foxla.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FOX 11 Los Angeles"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Alec is facing charges stemming from the 2021 fatal on-set shooting of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins on the Western movie Rust.\n\nStephen and Hilaria, 40, could be seen sitting among other attendees in a row behind Alec, 66, as the trial opened with statements from both Alec's attorneys and prosecutors on Wednesday.

(AP) -- A defense attorney told jurors Wednesday that the shooting death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins was an unspeakable tragedy, but that Alec Baldwin committed no crime; he was an actor, performing.\n\nSANTA FE, N.M. (AP) A defense attorney told jurors Wednesday that the shooting death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins was an unspeakable tragedy, but that Alec Baldwin he didn't commit any crime; he was an actor, he was acting.\n\nBaldwin's attorney, Alex Spiro, stressed in his opening statement in court in Santa Fe, New Mexico, that Baldwin, who is on trial for involuntary manslaughter, did exactly what actors always do on the set of the movie Rust, where Hutchins was killed in October 2021.\n\nI don't need to tell you more because you've all seen shootouts in movies, Spiro said.\n\nSpecial Prosecutor Erlinda Ocampo Johnson said in her opening statement that before the shooting, Baldwin ignored security checks and handled a revolver recklessly.\n\nThe evidence will show that someone who played pretend with a real gun and violated cardinal rules of firearm safety is the defendant, Alexander Baldwin, Ocampo Johnson said.\n\nSpiro replied that these cardinal rules are not cardinal rules on a film set.\n\nOn a film set, safety precautions must be taken before a weapon is placed in an actor's hand, Spiro told the jury.\n\nThe first witness to testify was the first law enforcement officer to arrive at the Bonanza Creek Ranch after the shooting. Video played in the courtroom by the body camera of then-Santa Fe County Sheriff's Deputy Nicholas LeFleur captured the frantic efforts to save Hutchins, who appeared unconscious as several people tended to her and gave her an oxygen mask. In the courtroom, Baldwin stared somberly at the screen as the video played.\n\nLater in the video, LeFleur can be seen telling Baldwin not to talk to other potential witnesses, but Baldwin does so repeatedly.\n\nWhen Special Prosecutor Kari Morrissey asked if the deputy handled the situation ideally, he replied, \"Probably not. But that's what happened.\"\n\nSpiro tried to establish that neither LeFleur nor the trial's second witness, former sheriff's lieutenant Tim Benavidez, considered the scene to be a major crime. Benavidez, who recovered the gun after the shooting, acknowledged that he handled it carefully, as much for safety reasons as for anything else, but that he did not wear gloves or take meticulous forensic precautions as might be required in a homicide investigation.\n\nIn her opening statement, Ocampo Johnson recounted to jurors the events leading up to Hutchins' death. She said that on that day, Baldwin refused several opportunities to undergo standard security checks with the gunsmith. Hannah Gutierrez-Reed \"before the rehearsal at the small church about 20 miles from the courthouse where Hutchins, a dynamic 42-year-old rising star, was killed. She said Baldwin had instead been doing his own thing.\"\n\nHe cocks the hammer, points it directly at Miss Hutchins and fires that gun, sending that live round directly into Miss Hutchins' body, Ocampo Johnson said.\n\nDuring the presentation, Baldwin looked down at a notepad, away from the jury. He watched Spiro intently during the opening. His wife Hilaria Baldwin, his younger brother Stephen Baldwin and his older sister Elizabeth Keuchler, who occasionally wiped away tears, were among the family and friends seated behind him.\n\nTHE 16 jurors Eleven women and five men come from an area where gun ownership and safety are high, due to wilderness hunting. Four of the jurors will be considered alternates while the other 12 will deliberate once they receive the case.\n\nHutchins' Death and the injury of director Joel Souza nearly three years ago sent shockwaves through the film industry and led to a felony charge against Baldwin, 66, that could carry up to 18 months in prison.\n\n\"It killed an extraordinary person,\" Spiro said. \"It hurt another person and it changed lives forever.\"\n\nBaldwin claimed the shot was fired accidentally after he followed instructions to point the gun at Hutchins, who was behind the camera. Unaware that the gun was loaded with a live round, he said he pulled the hammer, not the trigger, and the shot was fired.\n\nNo one saw him intentionally pull the trigger, Spiro said.\n\nBut he added that even if Baldwin had done it, it would not have been involuntary manslaughter.\n\n\"On a movie set, you have the right to pull the trigger,\" Spiro said, adding, \"that doesn't make it homicide.\n\nThe attorney stressed that responsibility for safety lies with the film's armorer, Gutierrez-Reed, who has already been convicted of involuntary manslaughter, and assistant director David Halls, who pleaded not guilty to negligent use of a deadly weapon in exchange for his testimony.\n\nBaldwin had been told he had a cold weapon before he received the revolver, not knowing it had a live bullet in it.\n\n\"It was checked and rechecked by the people who were responsible for making sure the gun was safe,\" Spiro said. \"He didn't tamper with it, he didn't load it himself. He didn't leave it unattended.\"\n\nIn recent years, Spiro has become one of the most sought-after defense attorneys in the country. His clients include Elon Musk, New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft and Megan Thee Stallion.\n\nBaldwin the star of Beetlejuice, Glengarry, Glen Ross and 30 Rock has been a household name as an actor and public figure for over three decades.\n\nSpiro said in concluding his opening remarks that witnesses will testify that no actor in the story intercepted a live bullet from a fake gun.\n\nNo one could have imagined or expected an actor to do such a thing, the lawyer said.\n\nTestimony at the trial will focus on the mechanism of the gun and whether it could have been fired without pulling the trigger. Prosecutors say that was not possible.\n\nThe gun the defendant requested to be assigned worked perfectly well as designed, Ocampo Johnson said.\n\nAttorney Gloria Allred sat in the front row of the courtroom audience, recalling Baldwin's other legal troubles. Allred represents Rust script supervisor Mamie Mitchell and Hutchins' sister and parents in a lawsuit civil lawsuit against Baldwin and other producers.\n\nAllred said that from his observations in court, the jury appeared captivated by the testimony and evidence, including the police wrist-camera video.\n\n___ For more information on the Alec Baldwin manslaughter trial, visit:

Takes it out very fast, points it, and once again you will hear testimony that his finger was on or around the trigger. And the evidence will show that that third and fatal time, he takes it out once again, fast, cocks the hammer, pointed straight at Mrs. Hutchins and fires that gun.\"\n\nJohnson further told jurors: \"It's simple, straightforward. The evidence will show that someone who played make believe with a real gun and violated the cardinal rules of firearm safety is the defendant, Alexander Baldwin.\"\n\nDefense attorneys, on the other hand, blamed the shooting on the armorer on the set, saying Baldwin should be found innocent. In fact, they said he had no idea there was live ammunition anywhere around.\n\n\"This was an unspeakable tragedy,\" attorney Alex Spiro told the jury. \"But Alec Baldwin committed no crime. He was an actor. Actor playing the role of Harlan Rust. An actor playing a character can act in ways that are lethal, that just aren't lethal on a movie set. These cardinal rules, they're not cardinal rules on a movie set.\n\nSpiro focused much of his argument on a number of questions that have yet been answered, including why the live bullet was even on the set, why the armorer placed it in the gun and why the head of safety didn't notice it.\n\n\"None of it speaks to whether Alec knew or should have known those things,\" Spiro said. \"He didn't. No one on that set did. It was not foreseeable.\"\n\nBaldwin is charged with involuntary manslaughter in the shooting of Hutchins, a charge the movie's armorer, Hanna Guiterrez-Reed, was found guilty of back in March and sentenced to 18 months in prison. Hutchins was killed in October 2021 when Baldwin pointed a \"prop gun\" at Hutchins and pulled the trigger. The shot also injured the film's director, Joel Souza.\n\nBaldwin has said the gun fired accidentally after he followed instructions to point it toward Hutchins, who was behind the camera. Baldwin said he was unaware the gun contained a live round and that he pulled back the hammer -- not the trigger -- and the gun fired.\n\nAlso on Wednesday, Baldwin's attorney questioned the first witness in the case, Nicholas LeFleur, a former Santa Fe County Sheriff who arrived on the scene shortly after the shooting. Answering the attorney's questions about whether he perceived the shooting had been intentional, LeFleur said, \"I wouldn't say there was no intention. I don't know the individual's intentions, but his demeanor was sad. Upset.\"\n\nThe trial will continue on Thursday with more witnesses set to be called to the stand. If convicted of the charge, Baldwin could face up to 18 months in prison, the same sentence handed to Guiterrez-Reed.", "source": {"uri": "thetruthaboutguns.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Truth About Guns"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mark_chesnut@thetruthaboutguns.com", "name": "Mark Chesnut", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alec_Baldwin", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alec Baldwin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinal_(Catholic_Church)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cardinal (Catholic Church)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manslaughter", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Manslaughter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defendant", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Defendant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_body_camera", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Police body camera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_responder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "First responder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opening_statement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Opening statement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armourer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Armourer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hammer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hammer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_defense_lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Criminal defense lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tragedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammunition", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ammunition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearm", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Firearm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prop_gun", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prop gun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Souza", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joel Souza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheriff", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sheriff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Fe_County,_New_Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Santa Fe County, New Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Santa Fe County, New Mexico"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gun_Control", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gun Control", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Homemade", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Homemade", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 46}], "image": "https://www.thetruthaboutguns.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screen-Shot-2024-07-10-at-4.04.14-PM-560x373.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719280", "eventUri": "eng-9719280", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 195, "relevance": 1}

It may contain graphic details and strong language.\n\nSANTA FE, N.M. (AP) -- Prosecutors sought to cast Alec Baldwin as someone who flouts rules and has little regard for safety at the first day of his New Mexico trial in the shooting of a cinematographer.\n\nSpecial prosecutor Erlinda Ocampo Johnson repeatedly referred to Baldwin playing \"make-believe\" with a revolver on the set of the film \"Rust,\" and said it led to very real danger and the death of Halyna Hutchins, whom she called \"a vibrant 42-year-old rising star.\"\n\nOcampo Johnson told jurors in her opening statement Wednesday that Baldwin \"requested to be assigned the biggest gun available\" and that during a training session for it, he had \"people filming him while he's running around shooting this gun.\"\n\nThe prosecutor said behind-the-scenes video will show Baldwin casually disregarding basic firearm safety.\n\n\"You will see him using this gun as a pointer to point at people, point at things,\" Ocampo Johnson said. \"You will see him cock the hammer when he is not supposed to cock the hammer, you will see him put his finger on the trigger when his finger's not supposed to be on the trigger.\"\n\nHutchins' death and the wounding of director Joel Souza nearly three years ago sent shock waves through the film industry and led to the felony involuntary manslaughter charge against Baldwin that could result in up to 18 months in prison.\n\nThe trial of the 66-year-old star of \"30 Rock\" and frequent host of \"Saturday Night Live\" continues Thursday with testimony from a crime scene technician with the Santa Fe County Sheriff's Department.\n\nThe beginning of testimony of the technician, Marissa Poppell, allowed jurors to see the revolver and the spent round from the shooting.\n\nBaldwin's lawyer Alex Spiro emphasized in his opening statement that Baldwin did only what actors always do.\n\n\"He must be able to take that weapon and use it in the way that the person he's playing would,\" Spiro told jurors.\n\nThat includes pulling the trigger, Spiro said. Baldwin has said the gun fired accidentally, but Spiro said that it still would not be manslaughter even if he had willfully fired it.\n\n\"On a movie set, you're allowed to pull that trigger,\" said Spiro.\n\nSpiro called the shooting an \"unspeakable tragedy\" and that an \"amazing person\" died, but said the responsibility lies with the film's armorer Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, who has already been convicted of involuntary manslaughter, and of assistant director David Halls, who told Baldwin the gun was \"cold.\"\n\n\"It had been checked and double-checked by those responsible for ensuring the gun was safe,\" Spiro said. \"He did not tamper with it, he did not load it himself. He did not leave it unattended.\"\n\nThe first witness to take the stand was Nicholas LeFleur, the first law enforcement officer to arrive at the movie set at Bonanza Creek Ranch after the shooting, and his lapel camera video gave jurors a glimpse of the chaotic scene: a grim view of an apparently unconscious Hutchins as LeFleur and others worked to revive her.\n\nLater in the video, LeFleur can be seen telling Baldwin not to speak to the other potential witnesses, but Baldwin repeatedly does.\n\n\"Was Mr. Baldwin supposed to be talking about the incident?\" special prosecutor Kari Morrissey asked him.\n\n\"No ma'am,\" LeFleur replied.\n\n\"Does he appear to be doing it anyway?\" Morrissey asked.\n\n\"Yes, ma'am,\" LeFleur said.\n\nAmong those sitting in the gallery behind Baldwin watching the trial were his wife Hilaria Baldwin, younger brother Stephen Baldwin and older sister Elizabeth Keuchler -- who wiped away tears at times during the proceedings.", "source": {"uri":

According to a source speaking to PEOPLE, Hilaria will stay in New Mexico for the trial, providing emotional support to Alec.\n\nThe source conveyed that Alec is deeply reliant on Hilaria's presence during this stressful period, stating, \"She's incredibly supportive and will be at the trial every day.\" The source added that the couple is eager for the trial to conclude, with Hilaria maintaining faith in Alec's innocence.\n\nMarried to Alec since 2012, Hilaria was also at the courthouse on Tuesday, July 9, accompanied by two of their seven children. Alec Baldwin has pleaded not guilty to involuntary manslaughter charges, claiming he did not pull the trigger and was unaware the gun contained live ammunition. The incident, which occurred on October 21, 2021, resulted in Hutchins' death and injured director Joel Souza.\n\nIf convicted, Alec could face up to 18 months in prison. Prosecutors have already sentenced Rust armorer Hannah Gutierrez Reed to 18 months for similar charges.

Video shown in the courtroom from the body camera of Nicholas LeFleur, then a Santa Fe County sheriff's deputy, captured the frantic efforts to save Hutchins, who looked unconscious as several people attended to her and gave her an oxygen mask. In the courtroom, Baldwin looked at the screen somberly as it played.\n\nLater in the video, LeFleur can be seen telling Baldwin not to speak to the other potential witnesses, but Baldwin repeatedly does.\n\nWhen special prosecutor Kari Morrissey asked whether the sheriff's deputy handled the situation ideally he responded, \"Probably not. But it's what happened.\"\n\nSpiro tried to establish that neither LeFleur nor the trial's second witness, former sheriff's Lt. Tim Benavidez, treated the scene as a place where a major crime had occurred. Benavidez, who collected the revolver after the shooting, acknowledged that he was careful with it as much for safety reasons as anything else, but did not wear gloves or take meticulous forensic precautions as might be done for a homicide investigation.\n\nOcampo Johnson in her opening walked the jurors through the events leading up to Hutchins' death. She said on that day, Baldwin declined multiple opportunities for standard safety checks with armorer Hannah Gutierrez-Reed before the rehearsal in the small church about 20 miles from the courthouse where Hutchins, \"a vibrant 42-year-old rising star,\" was killed. She said Baldwin instead \"did his own thing.\"\n\n\"He cocks the hammer, points it straight at Miss Hutchins, and fires that gun, sending that live bullet right into Miss Hutchins body,\" said Ocampo Johnson.\n\nThe 16 jurors -- 11 women and five men -- come from a region with strong currents of gun ownership and safety informed by backcountry hunting. Four of the jurors will be deemed alternates while the other 12 deliberate once they get the case.\n\nHutchins' death and the wounding of director Joel Souza nearly three years ago sent shock waves through the film industry and led to one felony charge against Baldwin, 66, that could result in up to 18 months in prison.\n\nBaldwin has claimed the gun fired accidentally after he followed instructions to point it toward Hutchins, who was behind the camera. Unaware that it was loaded with a live round, he said he pulled back the hammer -- not the trigger -- and it fired.\n\n\"No one saw him intentionally pull the trigger,\" Spiro said.\n\nBut he said even if Baldwin had pulled it, it still would not have been manslaughter.\n\n\"On a movie set, you're allowed to pull that trigger,\" Spiro said, adding, \"that doesn't make it a homicide.\"\n\nAttorney Luke Nikas, left, and actor Alec Baldwin listen during his hearing in Santa Fe County District Court, Wednesday, July 10, 2024, in Santa Fe, N.M.

Although I fell in love with you the moment I met you, marrying you seemed like a dream,\" Alec began his caption of a carousel showing moments from their wedding day.\n\n\"Good and bad. Ups and downs. 7 kids. (Plus Ireland, Andre and Holland.) Four dogs. Four cats. In spite of some tough times for me, I wouldn't trade any of it,\" the actor continued.\n\nThe 66-year-old referenced his eldest child Ireland (and her family) who he shares with his ex-wife Kim Basinger.\n\n\"Happy Anniversary. You are my gift,\" the 30 Rock alum concluded.\n\nThe last photo of the actor's post shows a recent selfie of the pair. Hilaria used the same photo for her own tribute to their marriage.\n\n\"Happy 12 years of marriage, Alec...not only have there been joyful ups and sad downs that life inevitably brings, but we have also experienced everything from sideways, zigzags, tremendous love and also things that are so painfully and plainly backwards,\" Hilaria wrote alongside sweet picture.\n\n\"We hang on tight...hold on to family and friends to source our comfort and energy. Lean in to gratitude to brighten every day. How lucky am I to have you and our children, Alec,\" she continued.\n\nThe Baldwins' anniversary came just before Alec's manslaughter trial began on Wednesday, July 10. The trial is now in full swing, nearly three years after 42-year-old cinematographer Halyna Hutchins was fatally shot on the New Mexico set of the Western film Rust in October 2021.\n\nHilaria has been spotted in the New Mexico courthouse, along with Alec's brother Stephen Baldwin, to support Alec during the trial.\n\nThe jury has been sworn in and opening statements kicked off the trial on Wednesday.\n\nBaldwin has repeatedly said that he did not puller the trigger, however prosecutor Erlinda Johnson told the jury in her opening statement that, \"The evidence will show, ladies and gentlemen, that's not possible,\" per CNN.\n\n\"This was an unspeakable tragedy, but Alec Baldwin committed no crime. He was an actor, acting. Playing the role of Harland Rust. An actor playing a character can act in ways that are lethal, that just aren't lethal on a movie set,\" defense attorney Alex Spiro said.\n\nJurors have since been shown body camera footage of the moments following the shooting on set, including Baldwin being approached by responding officer Nicholas Lefleur, the actor admitting that he \"was holding the gun,\" and the crew discussing what happened.\n\nProsecutors originally charged Baldwin with involuntary manslaughter in January 2023 before they dropped the case three months later. They re-filed the case once again earlier this year.\n\nIf convicted, Baldwin could face up to 18 months in prison and a $5,000 fine.\n\nDespite Baldwin's possible jailtime, cameras will continue to roll for the Baldwins reality series, according to The New York Post.\n\nThe couple, who have seven children all under the age of 10, said The Baldwins will air on US cable network TLC in 2025.\n\nAlec and Hilaria share Carmen, 10, Rafael, 8, Leonardo, 7, Romeo, 6, Eduardo, 3, Lucia, 3, and Ilaria, 20 months.", "source": {"uri": "toofab.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Toofab"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alec_Baldwin", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alec Baldwin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Basinger", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kim Basinger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carousel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carousel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/30_Rock", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "30 Rock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selfie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Selfie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Mexico"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halyna_Hutchins", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Halyna Hutchins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Baldwin", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Baldwin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_(genre)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Western (genre)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinematographer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cinematographer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Swing music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manslaughter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manslaughter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TLC_(TV_network)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TLC (TV network)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romeo", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Romeo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonardo_da_Vinci", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Leonardo da Vinci"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tragedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cable_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cable television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Post", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reality television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://images.toofab.com/image/cc/16by9/2024/07/10/cce44779a4b14ea6ab139e166d3fd4fb_xl.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719280", "eventUri": "eng-9719280", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2012-06-30", "textStart": 114, "textEnd": 127}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-10", "textStart": 1382, "textEnd": 1389}], "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

(AP) -- Prosecutors sought to cast Alec Baldwin as someone who flouts rules and has little regard for safety at the first day of his New Mexico trial in the shooting of a cinematographer.\n\nSpecial prosecutor Erlinda Ocampo Johnson repeatedly referred to Baldwin playing \"make-believe\" with a revolver on the set of the film \"Rust,\" and said it led to very real danger and the death of Halyna Hutchins, whom she called \"a vibrant 42-year-old rising star.\"\n\nOcampo Johnson told jurors in her opening statement Wednesday that Baldwin \"requested to be assigned the biggest gun available\" and that during a training session for it, he had \"people filming him while he's running around shooting this gun.\"\n\nThe prosecutor said behind-the-scenes video will show Baldwin casually disregarding basic firearm safety.\n\n\"You will see him using this gun as a pointer to point at people, point at things,\" Ocampo Johnson said. \"You will see him cock the hammer when he is not supposed to cock the hammer, you will see him put his finger on the trigger when his finger's not supposed to be on the trigger.\"\n\nHutchins' death and the wounding of director Joel Souza nearly three years ago sent shock waves through the film industry and led to the felony involuntary manslaughter charge against Baldwin that could result in up to 18 months in prison.\n\nThe trial of the 66-year-old star of \"30 Rock\" and frequent host of \"Saturday Night Live\" continues Thursday with testimony from a crime scene technician with the Santa Fe County Sheriff's Department.\n\nThe beginning of testimony of the technician, Marissa Poppell, allowed jurors to see the revolver and the spent round from the shooting.\n\nBaldwin's lawyer Alex Spiro emphasized in his opening statement that Baldwin did only what actors always do.\n\n\"He must be able to take that weapon and use it in the way that the person he's playing would,\" Spiro told jurors.\n\nThat includes pulling the trigger. Baldwin has said the gun fired accidentally, but Spiro said that it still would not be manslaughter even if he had willfully fired it.\n\n\"On a movie set, you're allowed to pull that trigger,\" said Spiro.\n\nSpiro called the shooting an \"unspeakable tragedy\" and that an \"amazing person\" dies, but said the responsibility lies with the film's armorer Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, who has already been convicted of involuntary manslaughter, and of assistant director David Halls, who told Baldwin the gun was \"cold.\"\n\n\"It had been checked and double checked by those responsible for ensuring the gun was safe,\" Spiro said. \"He did not tamper with it, he did not load it himself. He did not leave it unattended.\"\n\nThe first witness to take the stand was Nicholas LeFleur, the first law enforcement officer to arrive at the movie set at Bonanza Creek Ranch after the shooting, and his lapel camera video gave jurors a glimpse of the chaotic scene: a grim view of an apparently unconscious Hutchins as LeFleur and others worked to revive her.\n\nLater in the video, LeFleur can be seen telling Baldwin not to speak to the other potential witnesses, but Baldwin repeatedly does.\n\n\"Was Mr. Baldwin supposed to be talking about the incident?\" special prosecutor Kari Morrissey asked him.\n\n\"No ma'am,\" LeFleur replied.\n\n\"Does he appear to be doing it anyway?\" Morrissey asked.\n\n\"Yes, ma'am,\" LeFleur said.\n\nAmong those sitting in the gallery behind Baldwin watching the trial were his wife Hilaria Baldwin, younger brother Stephen Baldwin and older sister Elizabeth Keuchler -- who wiped away tears at times during the proceedings.\n\n___ For more coverage of Alec Baldwin's involuntary manslaughter trial, visit: https://apnews.com/hub/alec-baldwin\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

They claimed that Baldwin trusted his crew and that he had no reason to believe that he had been given a loaded gun before shooting Hutchins. Baldwin previously pleaded not guilty and that he never pulled the trigger. The prosecution, however, painted a different picture, claiming that Baldwin \"played make-believe with a real gun\" and \"violated the cardinal rules of firearms safety.\"\n\n\"While it was a movie set, it was a real, live workplace for many people,\" prosecutor Erlinda Johnson said in her opening statements. \"You will hear that this workplace was on a tight budget... and some of the people who were hired were inexperienced.\"\n\nBaldwin's defense, attorney Alex Spiro, argued that Baldwin had been \"acting as he's done for generations, and it was the safety apparatus that failed them all,\" noting that real bullets should never have been near a movie set, placing the blame squarely on Rust armorer Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, who was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter earlier this year.\n\n\"Alec Baldwin committed no crime,\" said Spiro. \"It was an actor handling a prop.\"\n\n\"Real bullets are never supposed to be on movie sets,\" he added.\n\nOn October 21, 2021, while filming the western movie Rust, Alec Baldwin shot cinematographer Halyna Hutchins during a rehearsal. Baldwin claims the revolver that he had been given from the AD suddenly fired when he pulled back the hammer, emphatically stating that he did not pull the trigger.\n\nSubsequent analysis of the firearm from the FBI later concluded that \"the trigger had to be pulled or depressed sufficiently to release the fully cocked or retracted hammer of the evidence revolver.\"\n\nThe prosecution focused intensely on Baldwin's claim that he did not pull the trigger, citing the FBI investigation.

He was joined by his wife Hilaria and two of his seven children.\n\nWhile crossing the street, he playfully stuck his tongue out at his toddler daughter, who was wearing fuzzy boots with a cow pattern and being cradled by her mom who was sporting cut-off jeans and sandals.\n\nBaldwin and his family enjoyed a stroll after spending the majority of the day in court as opening statements took place\n\nIf not facing the prospect of 18 months in prison, it might have appeared just another day in the life of a celebrity\n\nPassing several high-end shops, they popped into two clothing stores including Eternity, where Baldwin tried on clothes while staring at himself in the mirror.\n\nHe bought several blazers, possibly for future court appearances. He then placed the bags on his daughter's stroller.\n\nThey rolled into a Starbucks, where he was greeted by more fans. 'He was very nice, very sweet to give us his autograph,' gushed Lucille Roybal, who had Baldwin sign the autograph to her daughter, Ocean.\n\n'I was going to ask for a selfie for my dad, but I didn't want to because he's going through a hard time', she added.\n\nAfter nearly an hour out and about, the Baldwin clan walked back to their luxury hotel, where they've been staying in a presidential suite just a few blocks from the courthouse.\n\nThe baggy-eyed actor, 66, arrived at the courthouse on Wednesday in a convoy of three SUVs wearing a dark suit and avoiding questions from reporters camped outside the Santa Fe courthouse.\n\nBaldwin and his wife Hilaria, 40, appeared at the courthouse as opening statements took placein the case involving the death of Halyna Hutchins on the set of the western film in October 2021.\n\nHe bought several blazers, possibly for future court appearances.

The film's director Joel Souza was also injured.\n\nThe stakes for Baldwin are incredibly high and were starkly illustrated in February when Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, 26, the armorer on the set, went on trial and was found guilty for the same charges in the same court.\n\nHalyna Hutchins died after being hit by a bullet from the prop gun that Baldwin was handling\n\nIn the court, Baldwin sat at the defense table and appeared nervous while Hilaria and his brother Stephen Baldwin, who is also an actor, sat behind him in the public gallery.\n\nIn her opening statement, Erlinda Johnson, a special prosecutor appointed to the case, said that Baldwin had 'violated the cardinal rules of firearm safety' and that he was 'reckless' on set.\n\nShe told jurors: 'When someone plays make believe with a real gun in a real life workplace and while playing with the gun violates the cardinal rules of gun safety people's lives are endangered and somebody could be killed.\n\n'That's what this case is about. It's simple, straightforward. That someone who played make believe with a real gun and violated the cardinal rules of firearm safety is the defendant, Alexander Baldwin.'\n\nWhile defense lawyer Alex Spiro told jurors that the death of Hutchins had been an 'unspeakable tragedy' but that Baldwin committed no crime.\n\nThe movie was being shot on the Bonanza Creek Ranch film set in Santa Fe\n\nBaldwin, seen here outside the Santa Fe County Sheriff's offices on the day of the shooting, was sensationally charged for a second time in January this year\n\nIn his opening statement, Spiro said: 'There were people responsible for ensuring the safety of the firearm. Those people failed in their duties.\n\n'On this set there was a real bullet something that should never be on a movie set.\n\n'You will hear no evidence that Baldwin had anything to do with that real bullet being bought on that set.\n\nRead More Harrowing images show Rust cinematographer after fatal shooting\n\n'The actor's job is to act, he's Harlan Rust, he's an outlaw running for his life.

His wife and brother watched intently from the public gallery.\n\nSeveral crew members and paramedics could be seen lifting Hutchins up on a stretcher. One person had a mask over her mouth and was pumping it to help her breathe.\n\nThe footage also showed Baldwin in the immediate aftermath of the incident, speaking with crew members despite being ordered not to by cops.\n\nDave Halls, the First Assistant Director, who had handed Baldwin the gun also arrives on the scene.\n\nHalls would later take a plea deal and serve months probation after pleading no contest to a misdemeanor charge.\n\nPhotos taken by detectives with Santa Fe County Sheriff's Office show the aftermath of the incident in October 2021\n\nLaw enforcement officer Nicholas LeFleur testifies during actor Alec Baldwin's hearing at Santa Fe County District Court\n\nThe trial is the culmination of a nightmare for Mr Baldwin that has lasted for nearly three years and has finally come to court.\n\nThe Emmy award winning actor, 66, has pleaded not guilty to two counts of involuntary manslaughter.\n\nThe case has had a long and tortured path to trial: Baldwin was originally charged in January 2023 with two counts of involuntary manslaughter.\n\nThey were dropped three months later in light of new evidence, prosecutors said, adding they needed more time to investigate.\n\nBaldwin was sensationally charged for a second time in January this year with the same charges.\n\nBaldwin and his wife are currently filming a reality TV series about their family. It is not clear if a camera crew is trailing them in New Mexico, but the show is due to air in 2025 meaning filming is likely underway now.\n\nThe case is expected to hear eight days of evidence and argument, followed by deliberations.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Prosecutors sought to cast Alec Baldwin as someone who flouts rules and has little regard for safety at the first day of his New Mexico trial in the shooting of a cinematographer.\n\nSanta Fe, New Mexico, Jul 11 (AP) Prosecutors sought to cast Alec Baldwin as someone who flouts rules and has little regard for safety at the first day of his New Mexico trial in the shooting of a cinematographer.\n\nSpecial prosecutor Erlinda Ocampo Johnson repeatedly referred to Baldwin playing \"make-believe\" with a revolver on the set of the film \"Rust,\" and said it led to very real danger and the death of Halyna Hutchins, whom she called \"a vibrant 42-year-old rising star.\"\n\nAlso Read | Matthew McConaughey Faces Bee Sting, Shares Swollen Eye Photo.\n\nOcampo Johnson told jurors in her opening statement Wednesday that Baldwin \"requested to be assigned the biggest gun available\" and that during a training session for it, he had \"people filming him while he's running around shooting this gun.\"\n\nThe prosecutor said behind-the-scenes video will show Baldwin casually disregarding basic firearm safety.\n\nAlso Read | 'Heeramandi' Star Taha Shah Badussha Meets Tom Cruise, Calls Him 'Lifelong Idol'.\n\n\"You will see him using this gun as a pointer to point at people, point at things,\" Ocampo Johnson said. \"You will see him cock the hammer when he is not supposed to cock the hammer, you will see him put his finger on the trigger when his finger's not supposed to be on the trigger.\"\n\nHutchins' death and the wounding of director Joel Souza nearly three years ago sent shock waves through the film industry and led to the felony involuntary manslaughter charge against Baldwin that could result in up to 18 months in prison.\n\nThe trial of the 66-year-old star of \"30 Rock\" and frequent host of \"Saturday Night Live\" continues Thursday with testimony from a crime scene technician with the Santa Fe County Sheriff's Department.\n\nThe beginning of testimony of the technician, Marissa Poppell, allowed jurors to see the revolver and the spent round from the shooting.\n\nBaldwin's lawyer Alex Spiro emphasized in his opening statement that Baldwin did only what actors always do.\n\n\"He must be able to take that weapon and use it in the way that the person he's playing would,\" Spiro told jurors.\n\nThat includes pulling the trigger. Baldwin has said the gun fired accidentally, but Spiro said that it still would not be manslaughter even if he had willfully fired it.\n\n\"On a movie set, you're allowed to pull that trigger,\" said Spiro.\n\nSpiro called the shooting an \"unspeakable tragedy\" and that an \"amazing person\" dies, but said the responsibility lies with the film's armorer Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, who has already been convicted of involuntary manslaughter, and of assistant director David Halls, who told Baldwin the gun was \"cold.\"\n\n\"It had been checked and double checked by those responsible for ensuring the gun was safe,\" Spiro said. \"He did not tamper with it, he did not load it himself. He did not leave it unattended.\"\n\nThe first witness to take the stand was Nicholas LeFleur, the first law enforcement officer to arrive at the movie set at Bonanza Creek Ranch after the shooting, and his lapel camera video gave jurors a glimpse of the chaotic scene: a grim view of an apparently unconscious Hutchins as LeFleur and others worked to revive her.\n\nLater in the video, LeFleur can be seen telling Baldwin not to speak to the other potential witnesses, but Baldwin repeatedly does.\n\n\"Was Mr. Baldwin supposed to be talking about the incident?\" special prosecutor Kari Morrissey asked him.\n\n\"No ma'am,\" LeFleur replied.\n\n\"Does he appear to be doing it anyway?\" Morrissey asked.\n\n\"Yes, ma'am,\" LeFleur said.\n\nAmong those sitting in the gallery behind Baldwin watching the trial were his wife Hilaria Baldwin, younger brother Stephen Baldwin and older sister Elizabeth Keuchler -- who wiped away tears at times during the proceedings.

The show will still premiere in 2025.\"\n\nHilaria and the couple's youngest daughter showed up with Alec, 66, for the start of his involuntary manslaughter trial in Santa Fe, New Mexico, on Tuesday.\n\nOpening statements are set to begin at 10:30 a.m. ET on Wednesday.\n\nHis trial is expected to last 10 days, and the proceedings will be livestreamed on Court TV.\n\nAlec Baldwin faces up to 18 months in jail, if convicted.\n\nLast month, Alec and Hilaria Baldwin announced that the upcoming show will focus on their home life with their seven young kids: Carmen, 10, Rafael, 8, Leonardo, 7, Romeo, 6, Eduardo, 3, Maria, 3, and Iliaria, 1.\n\nIf Baldwin is convicted, the show will take a different tone, a second production insider said.\n\n\"Alec and Hilaria were willing to open up their lives for the show, no matter where their lives lead,\" the insider said.\n\n\"If he's convicted and spends time in jail, that will be part of the show. And if not, then his acquittal and the aftermath will be part of the show.\"\n\nThe sources would not say whether TLC cameras are rolling behind closed doors during Alec Baldwin's trial.\n\nReps for the Baldwins and TLC did not return the Post's requests for comment.\n\nThe \"Saturday Night Live\" and New York public radio mainstay is accused of firing the gun that killed Hutchins on set in October 2021.\n\nAccording to incident reports, Baldwin allegedly picked up a gun that he didn't realize was loaded with a live round.\n\nPolice say that he pointed it at Hutchins and fired once, striking her.\n\nProsecutors have accused him of reckless behavior that caused the 42-year-old mother's death.\n\nIn an affidavit after the shooting, the Santa Fe County Sheriff's Office said that neither Baldwin nor first assistant director David Halls knew that the gun was loaded.\n\nHalls later pleaded guilty to one count of negligent use of a deadly weapon.\n\nThe armorer on the set, Hannan Gutierrez-Reed, was convicted of involuntary manslaughter in March and sentenced to 18 months in prison.\n\nShe is appealing her conviction.\n\nBaldwin has pleaded not guilty and has repeatedly denied any responsibility -- saying he did not pull the trigger.\n\nFor now, producers of his upcoming reality show are watching the trial closely -- and deciding how to proceed.\n\n\"There are contingencies for almost every scenario,\" says the production source.\n\n\"Obviously, no one wants him to go to jail, but if he does, we'll roll with it and work through it.\"", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com",

But it's what happened.\"\n\nMr Spiro tried to establish that neither Mr LeFleur nor the trial's second witness, former sheriff's lieutenant Tim Benavidez, treated the scene as a place where a major crime had occurred.\n\nMr Benavidez, who collected the revolver after the shooting, acknowledged that he was careful with it as much for safety reasons as anything else, but did not wear gloves or take meticulous forensic precautions as he might have done for a homicide investigation.\n\nShe said on that day, Baldwin declined multiple opportunities for standard safety checks with armorer Hannah Gutierrez-Reed before the rehearsal in the small church about 20 miles (32 kilometres) from the courthouse where Ms Hutchins, \"a vibrant 42-year-old rising star\", was killed. She said Baldwin instead \"did his own thing\".\n\n\"He cocks the hammer, points it straight at Miss Hutchins, and fires that gun, sending that live bullet right into Miss Hutchins body,\" said Ms Ocampo Johnson.\n\nDuring the presentation, Baldwin trained his eyes downward on a notepad, away from the jury. He watched Mr Spiro intently during his opening.\n\nHis wife Hilaria Baldwin, younger brother Stephen Baldwin and older sister Elizabeth Keuchler -- who wiped away tears at times -- were among the family and friends sitting behind him.\n\nThe 16 jurors -- 11 women and five men -- come from a region with strong currents of gun ownership and safety informed by backcountry hunting. Four of the jurors will be deemed alternates while the other 12 deliberate once they get the case.\n\nMs Hutchins' death and the wounding of director Joel Souza nearly three years ago sent shock waves through the film industry and led to one felony charge against Baldwin, 66, that could result in up to 18 months in prison.\n\n\"It killed an amazing person,\" Mr Spiro said. \"It wounded another, and it changed lives forever.\"\n\nBaldwin has claimed the gun fired accidentally after he followed instructions to point it towards Ms Hutchins, who was behind the camera.\n\nUnaware that it was loaded with a live round, he said he pulled back the hammer -- not the trigger -- and it fired.\n\n\"No one saw him intentionally pull the trigger,\" Mr Spiro said.\n\nBut he said even if Baldwin had pulled it, it still would not have been manslaughter.\n\n\"On a movie set, you're allowed to pull that trigger,\" Mr Spiro said, adding: \"That doesn't make it a homicide.\"\n\nBaldwin had been told \"cold gun\" before getting the revolver, not knowing there was a live round in it.\n\n\"It had been checked and double checked by those responsible for ensuring the gun was safe,\" Mr Spiro said. \"He did not tamper with it, he did not load it himself. He did not leave it unattended.\"\n\nMr Spiro said in concluding his opening that witnesses will attest that \"no actor in history\" has \"intercepted a live bullet from a prop gun\".\n\n\"No one could have imagined or expected an actor to do that,\" the lawyer said.\n\nTestimony at trial will delve into the mechanics of the weapon and whether it could have fired without a trigger pull. Prosecutors say it could not have.\n\n\"That gun the defendant had asked to be assigned worked perfectly fine as it was designed,\" Ms Ocampo Johnson said.\n\nAttorney Gloria Allred sat in the front row of the courtroom audience, a reminder of Baldwin's other legal difficulties.\n\nMs Allred is representing Rust script supervisor Mamie Mitchell and Hutchins' sister and parents in a civil lawsuit against Baldwin and other producers.\n\nMs Allred said that from her observations in court, the jury appeared to be riveted by testimony and evidence including the police lapel camera video.",

Baldwin is facing a single charge of involuntary manslaughter in the death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins on the set of the film \"Rust.\" ROSS D. FRANKLIN / POOL / Getty Images via AFP\n\nSANTA FE, United States -- Alec Baldwin was accused of violating basic gun safety rules and playing \"make-believe\" with a deadly weapon, as the Hollywood star's trial for involuntary manslaughter over a fatal shooting on the set of Western movie \"Rust\" began Wednesday, July 10.\n\nBaldwin was holding a prop revolver during a fateful rehearsal in October 2021 when it fired a live round, killing cinematographer Halyna Hutchins and wounding the movie's director.\n\nIn opening statements in a court in Santa Fe, New Mexico, prosecutor Erlinda Ocampo Johnson painted a picture of a powerful movie star who behaved in \"a reckless manner\" and \"without due regard for the safety of others\" on set.\n\nShe said Baldwin had \"requested to be assigned the biggest gun available\" for the \"Rust\" scene, had failed to take a weapons training session seriously, and regularly cocked and pointed firearms at people on set.\n\nBaldwin played \"make-believe with a real gun and violated the cardinal rules of firearm safety,\" Johnson told the jury.\n\nMovie set safety rules require actors \"to treat every firearm as though it's loaded, to never point a firearm at another person, and to never put your finger on the trigger unless you're prepared to shoot,\" she added.\n\n'Gunfights in movies'\n\nBaldwin, 66, faces up to 18 months in prison if found guilty.\n\nThe actor - known for the television comedy \"30 Rock\" - attended the court wearing a dark suit and tie, chatting quietly with wife Hilaria, brother Stephen and sister Beth.\n\nHis celebrity lawyer Alex Spiro, whose other clients include Elon Musk and Jay-Z, said Baldwin had no reason to believe the gun might be loaded, and was not responsible as an actor for checking the weapon's contents.\n\nNormal gun safety rules do not apply to actors while they are performing, he told the court in Santa Fe, New Mexico.\n\n\"These cardinal rules? They're not cardinal rules on a movie set,\" said Spiro.\n\n\"You've all seen gunfights in movies,\" he told the jury, citing classics like \"Platoon,\" \"Apocalypse Now\" and \"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.\"\n\n\"The reason that can happen is because safety is ensured before the actor\" is handed the weapon, he said.\n\nIn a 2021 television interview, Baldwin said he did not pull the trigger.\n\nOn Wednesday, Spiro appeared to partly row back on that claim, while maintaining his client's innocence.\n\n\"On a movie set, you're allowed to pull the trigger,\" he told the jury.\n\n\"So even if he intentionally pulled the trigger... that doesn't make him guilty of homicide.\"\n\n'Live bullet'\n\nHutchins, the victim, was originally from Ukraine, and her career as a Hollywood cinematographer was thriving when she was killed at the age of 42.\n\nThe tragedy occurred during a rehearsal in a small chapel on the Bonanza Creek Ranch, a historic location for Western movies, midway through the filming of \"Rust.\"\n\nBaldwin was practicing a scene in which his outlaw character, trapped by two marshals, brandishes his Colt six-shooter.\n\nFBI testing found the revolver could not have fired without its trigger being pulled and prosecutors will present witnesses, including the gun's manufacturer, to support that finding.\n\nHowever, the weapon was damaged during testing. Spiro suggested that could have been deliberate, to prevent the report's findings being disproved.\n\nBut he focused blame on the movie's safety officials, including armorer Hannah Gutierrez, for allowing a live bullet to be brought on set.\n\n\"That live bullet is the key,\" said Spiro.\n\nGutierrez was convicted by the same court this year and is serving an 18-month sentence.\n\nHarrowing video\n\nWitnesses called Wednesday included police officers who arrived early to the scene of the tragedy.\n\nThe court saw footage from their lapel cameras, including harrowing video of some of Hutchins's final moments.\n\nBaldwin watched with his arms crossed, fidgeting in his seat and occasionally glancing at the jury.\n\nIt is not known if Baldwin will take the stand in his defense. Legal experts say it would be a risky move, exposing the allegedly temperamental actor to hostile cross-examination.\n\nThe trial is scheduled to conclude Friday of next week, with jury deliberations to follow.", "source": {"uri": "entertainment.inquirer.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Inquirer"}, "authors": [{"uri": "andrew_marszal@entertainment.inquirer.net", "name": "Andrew Marszal",

He pleaded not guilty.\n\n\"The evidence will show, ladies and gentlemen, that like in many workplaces, there are people who act in a reckless manner and place other individuals in danger, and act without due regard for the safety of others,\" prosecutor Erlinda Ocampo Johnson told jurors during her opening statement. \"That, you will hear, was the defendant -- Alexander Baldwin, the lead actor on this film.\"\n\nJohnson told jurors that while they will hear the revolver referred to as a \"prop gun,\" it is a real gun that experts will testify was in proper working order.\n\nShe told jurors they will hear about \"numerous breaches\" of firearm safety regarding Baldwin, from him using it as a pointer to cocking the hammer and putting his finger on the trigger when he was not supposed to do either.\n\nWhile handling the firearm prior to the shooting, Baldwin \"would do his own thing,\" including having his finger on or around the trigger during two draws, Johnson said.\n\n\"The evidence will show that that third and fatal time, he takes it out once again, fast,\" Johnson said. \"He cocks the hammer, points it straight at Miss Hutchins and fires that gun, sending that live bullet right into Miss Hutchins' body.\"\n\nBaldwin has maintained that he did not pull the trigger of the firearm, though the FBI's forensic report determined the gun could not have been fired without pulling the trigger.\n\n\"After the shooting, the defendant began to claim he didn't pull the trigger. The evidence will show, ladies and gentlemen, that's not possible,\" Johnson told jurors.\n\nDefense attorney Alex Spiro told jurors the state will attempt to \"tarnish\" Baldwin but that the \"most critical issue\" in the case is how the live bullet got on set.\n\n\"On this set, there was a real bullet, something that should never be on a movie set, something which has nothing to do with making a movie,\" Spiro told the jurors during his opening statement. \"You will hear no evidence, not one word that Alec Baldwin had anything to do with that real bullet being brought onto that set.\"\n\nHe said it was the armorer's responsibility to ensure the firearm was safe, and that the loading of the live bullet had nothing to do with Baldwin.\n\n\"No one had any idea that this venomous, toxic element had been inserted into this magic they were creating,\" Spiro said. \"But it did. It entered that place. It killed an amazing person, it wounded another, and it changed lives forever.\"\n\nSpiro said when the gun was handed to Baldwin, \"cold gun\" was announced, indicating it was safe. When it fired, everyone on set was \"shocked,\" he said.\n\n\"Alec is startled. He immediately says, 'I didn't mean to shoot. I didn't pull the trigger,'\" Spiro said.\n\nSpiro said that Baldwin didn't pull the trigger but that on a movie set \"you're allowed to pull the trigger.\" Even if the state could prove that Baldwin did intentionally pull the trigger, \"that doesn't make him guilty of homicide,\" Spiro said.\n\n\"He did not know, or have any reason to know, that gun was loaded with a live bullet,\" Spiro said. \"That's the key. That live bullet is the key. That is the lethal element.\"\n\nFollowing opening arguments, the state called its first witness, officer Nicholas Lefleur, who was the first law enforcement officer to arrive in response to a 911 call reporting the on-set shooting.\n\nLefleur discussed his efforts to secure the scene at the Bonanza Creek Ranch and separate witnesses.\n\nDuring footage from his lapel camera shown to the jury, Lefleur seeks out Baldwin -- who is seen talking on his cellphone while still in costume -- and says he understands the actor was in the room during the shooting.\n\n\"I was the one holding the gun, yeah,\" Baldwin responds.\n\nProsecutor Kari Morrissey questioned Lefleur about several instances in which Baldwin was seen talking to other witnesses even though the officer asked him not to.\n\nIn his cross-examination, Spiro addressed that at no point during those instances did Lefleur tell the witnesses to separate.\n\nThe state's second witness, Lt. Timoteo Benavidez, who also responded to the shooting, recounted how he declared the movie set a crime scene due to the two shooting victims and collected the revolver from the film's armorer and secured it in his patrol vehicle. The firearm was entered into evidence in the trial.\n\nMarissa Poppell, a crime scene technician who examined the movie set following the shooting, testified that she sent the revolver to the FBI for firearms testing \"to make sure the firearm was in proper working order.\"\n\nShe also said she sent five suspected live rounds -- including one found in Baldwin's holster -- and a spent casing that she recovered from the set, along with the projectile recovered from Souza's shoulder, to the FBI for testing.\n\nCourt wrapped for the day following the state's questioning of Poppell.\n\nThe jury was selected on Tuesday. The trial is currently scheduled to go through July 19. That does not include deliberations.\n\nProsecutors were seeking to argue during the trial that, as a producer of the film, Baldwin bore responsibility for unsafe conditions on the set. However, during a pretrial hearing on Monday, Judge Mary Marlowe Sommer denied using evidence of his role as a producer during the trial.\n\nThe judge also ruled that footage from the \"Rust\" set showing Baldwin's handling of the firearm can be admitted into evidence in the trial, but that videos of him yelling or cussing at the crew to hurry up were not relevant in the case.\n\nBaldwin, 66, is the second person to go on trial in connection with the fatal shooting.\n\nThe film's armorer -- 27-year-old Hannah Gutierrez -- was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter in March. Prosecutors argued that she repeatedly failed to maintain proper firearm safety and brought several live rounds onto the set -- including the one that killed Hutchins.\n\nHer attorney told ABC News on Tuesday that they have been informed that she will be called to testify on Friday and plans to invoke the Fifth Amendment.\n\nMarlowe Sommer denied last month the state's request to use immunity to compel Gutierrez's testimony during Baldwin's trial. Prosecutors sought immunity so that Gutierrez's testimony could not be used against her in her appeal. At a pretrial interview in May, Gutierrez asserted her Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination, prosecutors said.\n\nLast year, David Halls, the film's first assistant director who had conducted the safety check on the Colt .45 revolver prior to the shooting, accepted a plea deal in the case after being charged with negligent use of a deadly weapon. He was sentenced to six months unsupervised probation.\n\nHe could also be called to testify during the trial, court records show.", "source": {"uri": "abc7ny.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ABC7 New York"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opening_statement", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Opening statement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolver", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Revolver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alec_Baldwin", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alec Baldwin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manslaughter", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manslaughter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearm", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Firearm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hammer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hammer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defendant", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Defendant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prop_gun", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prop gun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Souza", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joel Souza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halyna_Hutchins", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Halyna Hutchins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinematographer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cinematographer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grand jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indictment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plea", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Plea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Fe,_New_Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Santa Fe, New Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Santa Fe, New Mexico"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colt_.45_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Colt .45 (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_defense_lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Criminal defense lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_scene", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Crime scene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_(illusion)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Magic (illusion)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonanza_City,_New_Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bonanza City, New Mexico"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ABC News"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 59}], "image": "https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/15050934_071124-wls-n1-baldwin-54a-vid.jpg?w=1600", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719280", "eventUri": "eng-9719280", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-19", "textStart": 5760, "textEnd": 5767}], "sentiment": -0.2705882352941177, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

(AP) -- Prosecutors sought to cast Alec Baldwin as someone who flouts rules and has little regard for safety at the first day of his New Mexico trial in the shooting of a cinematographer.\n\nSpecial prosecutor Erlinda Ocampo Johnson repeatedly referred to Baldwin playing \"make-believe\" with a revolver on the set of the film \"Rust,\" and said it led to very real danger and the death of Halyna Hutchins, whom she called \"a vibrant 42-year-old rising star.\"\n\nOcampo Johnson told jurors in her opening statement Wednesday that Baldwin \"requested to be assigned the biggest gun available\" and that during a training session for it, he had \"people filming him while he's running around shooting this gun.\"\n\nThe prosecutor said behind-the-scenes video will show Baldwin casually disregarding basic firearm safety.\n\n\"You will see him using this gun as a pointer to point at people, point at things,\" Ocampo Johnson said. \"You will see him cock the hammer when he is not supposed to cock the hammer, you will see him put his finger on the trigger when his finger's not supposed to be on the trigger.\"\n\nHutchins' death and the wounding of director Joel Souza nearly three years ago sent shock waves through the film industry and led to the felony involuntary manslaughter charge against Baldwin that could result in up to 18 months in prison.\n\nThe trial of the 66-year-old star of \"30 Rock\" and frequent host of \"Saturday Night Live\" continues Thursday with testimony from a crime scene technician with the Santa Fe County Sheriff's Department.\n\nThe beginning of testimony of the technician, Marissa Poppell, allowed jurors to see the revolver and the spent round from the shooting.\n\nBaldwin's lawyer Alex Spiro emphasized in his opening statement that Baldwin did only what actors always do.\n\n\"He must be able to take that weapon and use it in the way that the person he's playing would,\" Spiro told jurors.\n\nThat includes pulling the trigger. Baldwin has said the gun fired accidentally, but Spiro said that it still would not be manslaughter even if he had willfully fired it.\n\n\"On a movie set, you're allowed to pull that trigger,\" said Spiro.\n\nSpiro called the shooting an \"unspeakable tragedy\" and that an \"amazing person\" dies, but said the responsibility lies with the film's armorer Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, who has already been convicted of involuntary manslaughter, and of assistant director David Halls, who told Baldwin the gun was \"cold.\"\n\n\"It had been checked and double checked by those responsible for ensuring the gun was safe,\" Spiro said. \"He did not tamper with it, he did not load it himself. He did not leave it unattended.\"\n\nThe first witness to take the stand was Nicholas LeFleur, the first law enforcement officer to arrive at the movie set at Bonanza Creek Ranch after the shooting, and his lapel camera video gave jurors a glimpse of the chaotic scene: a grim view of an apparently unconscious Hutchins as LeFleur and others worked to revive her.\n\nLater in the video, LeFleur can be seen telling Baldwin not to speak to the other potential witnesses, but Baldwin repeatedly does.\n\n\"Was Mr. Baldwin supposed to be talking about the incident?\" special prosecutor Kari Morrissey asked him.\n\n\"No ma'am,\" LeFleur replied.\n\n\"Does he appear to be doing it anyway?\" Morrissey asked.\n\n\"Yes, ma'am,\" LeFleur said.\n\nAmong those sitting in the gallery behind Baldwin watching the trial were his wife Hilaria Baldwin, younger brother Stephen Baldwin and older sister Elizabeth Keuchler -- who wiped away tears at times during the proceedings.\n\nDalton reported from Los Angeles.\n\n___ For more coverage of Alec Baldwin's involuntary manslaughter trial, visit: https://apnews.com/hub/alec-baldwin\n\nMore from this section\n\nFlexClip Back-to-School Campaign: 40%

Heavy of spirit and trundling of gait, he looks like a man with the weight of the world on his shoulders. As well he might.\n\nBaldwin is charged with involuntary manslaughter in the death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins on his film Rust in October 2021.\n\nOn set at the Bonanza Creek film ranch 20 miles south of Santa Fe, he was pointing a gun at Hutchins during a rehearsal inside a church when it went off, killing her and wounding director Joel Souza. Baldwin has pleaded not guilty to the charge.\n\nMedics try to save Hutchins, a Ukrainian cinematographer who was shot and killed on the set of Rust\n\nIn his curdled honour, the usual \u00adcircus had assembled outside the court, where 41 news organisations from around the world are credentialed to cover the event.\n\nGiving interviews in their midst was 83-year-old Gloria Allred, the high-profile lawyer who has been representing the victim's family. Allred held up a photograph of Hutchins in silent accusation, explaining that her family could not travel from their native Ukraine because of the war.\n\nShe is representing them in a civil lawsuit they have filed against Mr Baldwin and expressed some dismay over his upcoming reality show, The Baldwins. 'This is not a reality show!' she cried, adding that it would be 'sick' if he were to include moments from this trial in his new series. To be fair, there is absolutely no evidence that this is his intention.\n\nInside the courtroom we were soon on to opening statements in the first day of the 66-year-old actor's trial.\n\nHannah Gutierrez-Reed, the young Rust armourer responsible for on set gun safety, is already behind bars after being charged with the same offence.\n\nBaldwin not only had the support of his wife, Hilaria in court, but his actor brother, Stephen, was also in attendance\n\nShe is currently appealing her sentence, but the prosecution wasted no time in blaming him for her lack of safety checks and gun protocols.\n\n'Each time he handled this gun he did not do a safety check with this inexperienced armourer and the reason he did not do this was because he didn't want to offend her,' claimed prosecutor Erlinda Ocampo Johnson.\n\n'He violated the cardinal rules of gun safety.'\n\nFor the defence, Alex Spiro said: 'This was an unspeakable tragedy, but Alec Baldwin committed no crime.\n\nHe was an actor acting.' Spiro countered that the old adage saying you should never point a gun at someone unless you intend to shoot them does not apply here.\n\nWitnesses revealed that seconds after she was shot, Ms Hutchins cried out to a boom operator: 'That was no good. That was no good at all', according to a Los Angeles Times report based on interviews with 14 crew members\n\n'These cardinal rules are not cardinal rules on a movie set. In films we see people pointing guns at each other all the time.'\n\nThen he went off on a cheesy little rap about how films had to make it look real, baby.\n\n'The stuntman must leap. The snake must hiss,' he blathered before the prosecution objected and he moved on, asking the jury to make a separation between Alec Baldwin the actor and Alec Baldwin the person.\n\nThe jury was shown footage of cast and crew rehearsing the fateful scene. There was Alec Baldwin in costume as the outlaw Harland Rust, complete with Stetson on his head and rascally beard, pulling the gun out from his shoulder holster, again and again.\n\nAt the defence table Alec Baldwin, the person, observed this with his hand over his mouth. A few rows behind him, his wife Hilaria learned forward in her seat, chin resting in her hands, watching avidly.\n\nFrom my seat in the courtroom press benches, it seemed obvious that Baldwin's finger was on the trigger. In the past, Baldwin has denied pulling the trigger, a crucial but disputed factor in his case.\n\nArmourer Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, the movie set weapons handler who loaded a gun for actor Alec Baldwin before it fired and killed a cinematographer, was sentenced to 18 months in prison in April\n\n'The evidence you will hear is that is not possible, the gun will not discharge without pulling that trigger,' said Johnson for the prosecution. 'Even if he did,' said Spiro for the defence, 'that would only make his statement incorrect. That doesn't make him guilty of homicide.' Towards the end of the morning session there was a reminder of the tragedy at the heart of this case.\n\nWe were shown disturbing first responder lapel-cam footage of 42-year-old Hutchins fighting for her life on the dirt floor of the Bonanza Creek set.

'Jesus Christ,' someone exclaims as a medic rushes in with an \u00adoxygen tank.\n\nTheir panic is palpable as the stricken woman is stretchered into a helicopter before being flown to hospital, where doctors could not save her.\n\nIn the courtroom, Alec Baldwin watched on impassively, making notes on a yellow legal pad.

They're not cardinal rules on a movie set,\" said Spiro.\n\n\"You've all seen gunfights in movies,\" he told the jury, citing classics like Platoon, Apocalypse Now and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.\n\n\"The reason that can happen is because safety is ensured before the actor\" is handed the weapon, he said.\n\nIn a 2021 television interview, Baldwin said he did not pull the trigger.\n\nOn Wednesday, Spiro appeared to partly row back on that claim while maintaining his client's innocence.\n\n\"On a movie set, you're allowed to pull the trigger,\" he told the jury.\n\n\"So even if he intentionally pulled the trigger... that doesn't make him guilty of homicide.\"\n\n'Live bullet'\n\nHutchins, the victim, was originally from Ukraine, and her career as a Hollywood cinematographer was thriving when she was killed at the age of 42.\n\nThe tragedy occurred during a rehearsal in a small chapel on the Bonanza Creek Ranch, a historic location for Western movies, midway through the filming of \"Rust.\"\n\nBaldwin was practising a scene in which his outlaw character, trapped by two marshals, brandishes his Colt six-shooter.\n\nFBI testing found the revolver could not have fired without its trigger being pulled and prosecutors will present witnesses, including the gun's manufacturer, to support that finding.\n\nHowever, the weapon was damaged during testing. Spiro suggested that could have been deliberate, to prevent the report's findings being disproved.\n\nREAD MORE | 'Rust' armourer gets 18-month sentence for deadly on-set shooting\n\nBut he focused blame on the movie's safety officials, including armourer Hannah Gutierrez, for allowing a live bullet to be brought on set.\n\n\"That live bullet is the key,\" said Spiro.\n\nGutierrez was convicted by the same court this year and is serving an 18-month sentence.\n\nHarrowing video\n\nWitnesses called Wednesday included police officers who arrived early at the scene of the tragedy.\n\nThe court saw footage from their lapel cameras, including harrowing video of some of Hutchins' final moments.\n\nBaldwin watched with his arms crossed, fidgeting in his seat and occasionally glancing at the jury.\n\nIt is not known if Baldwin will take the stand in his defence.

Jury selection starts Tuesday (July 9, 2024) in Santa Fe, New Mexico, in the actor's trial on a charge of involuntary manslaughter that could get him 18 months in prison. The judge and attorneys in the case say they expect the 12 jurors will be seated in one day and opening statements can begin on Wednesday. Jurors will be tasked with deciding whether Baldwin committed a felony when a gun he was pointing at cinematographer Halyna Hutchins during a rehearsal for the film \"Rust\" went off and killed her in 2021.\n\nSANTA FE, N.M. (AP) -- A New Mexico judge is considering whether to dismiss a grand jury indictment against actor Alec Baldwin in the fatal shooting on the set of the Western movie \"Rust.\" There's a virtual court hearing Friday (May 17, 2024) on the motion to dismiss the case. Defense attorneys for Baldwin accuse prosecutors of unfair maneuvers at grand jury proceedings to divert attention away from exculpatory evidence and witnesses. A grand jury indictment in January charged Baldwin with involuntary manslaughter in the death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins at a movie ranch on the outskirts of Santa Fe in October 2021. Baldwin has pleaded not guilty.\n\nSANTA FE, N.M.

The judge said had it not been for the armorer's recklessness, Halyna Hutchins would be alive. A tearful Gutierrez-Reed was unsuccessful in her plea for a lesser punishment. The armorer's two-week trial and conviction was a prelude to the proceedings against Alec Baldwin, who has pleaded not guilty to a charge of involuntary manslaughter in the death of Halyna Hutchins. He is scheduled for trial in July.\n\nSANTA FE, N.M. (AP) -- A movie weapons supervisor is facing a possible sentence of up to 18 months in prison in the fatal shooting of a cinematographer by Alec Baldwin on the set of the Western film \"Rust.\" Movie armorer Hannah Gutierrez-Reed has been incarcerated at a county jail ahead of Monday's scheduled sentencing hearing on a involuntary manslaughter conviction. The armorer's two-week trial was a prelude to the proceedings against Alec Baldwin, who has pleaded not guilty to a charge of involuntary manslaughter in the shooting death of Halyna Hutchins. He is scheduled for trial in July at a courthouse in Santa Fe.\n\nSANTA FE, N.M. (AP) -- A jury convicted a movie weapons supervisor of involuntary manslaughter Wednesday (March 6, 2024) in the fatal shooting of a cinematographer by actor Alec Baldwin during a rehearsal on the set of the Western movie \"Rust.\"\n\nThe verdict against movie armorer Hannah Gutierrez-Reed assigned new blame in the October 2021 shooting death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins after an assistant director last year pleaded no contest to negligent handling of a firearm.\n\nGutierrez-Reed also had faced a second charge of tampering with evidence, stemming from accusations that she handed a small bag of possible narcotics to another crew member after the shooting to avoid detection. She was found not guilty on that count.\n\nImmediately after the verdict was read in court, the judge ordered the 26-year-old armorer placed into the custody of deputies. Lead attorney Jason Bowles said afterward that Gutierrez-Reed will appeal the conviction, which carries a penalty of up to 18 months in prison and a $5,000 fine.\n\nSanta Fe-based state district court Judge Mary Marlowe Sommer did not immediately set a sentencing date.\n\nBaldwin, the lead actor and a co-producer on \"Rust,\" was indicted by a grand jury in January on a charge of involuntary manslaughter. He was pointing a gun at Hutchins on a movie set outside Santa Fe, New Mexico, when the gun went off, killing the cinematographer and wounding director Joel Souza.\n\nThe trial was a preamble to Baldwin's trial scheduled in July. He has pleaded not guilty.\n\nMessages seeking comment about Wednesday's verdict from Baldwin's spokeswoman and a lawyer were not immediately returned.\n\nProsecutors said at trial that Gutierrez-Reed unknowingly brought live ammunition onto the movie set, and it remained there for at least 12 days before the fatal shooting, giving the armorer plenty of time to remove it.\n\nIn closing arguments, prosecutor Kari Morrissey described \"constant, never-ending safety failures\" on the set of \"Rust\" and Gutierrez-Reed's \"astonishing lack of diligence\" with gun safety.\n\n\"We end exactly where we began -- in the pursuit of justice for Halyna Hutchins,\" Morrissey told jurors. \"Hannah Gutierrez failed to maintain firearms safety, making a fatal accident willful and foreseeable.\"\n\nProsecutors also contended that the armorer repeatedly skipped or skimped on standard gun-safety protocols that might have detected the live rounds.\n\n\"This was a game of Russian roulette every time an actor had a gun with dummies,\" Morrissey said.\n\nAn attorney for Hutchins' parents and sister issued a statement expressing their satisfaction with Wednesday's verdict.\n\n\"Today was the first trial and conviction in the criminal justice process,\" said the statement from Gloria Allred on behalf of parents Olga Solovey and Anatolli Androsovych and Hutchins' sister, Svetlana Zemko. \"We look forward to the justice system continuing to make sure that everyone else who is responsible for Halyna's death is required to face the legal consequences.\"\n\nInside the courtroom Wednesday, Gutierrez-Reed's mother reacted with dismay at the conviction, bursting into tears and cursing the proceedings as her daughter was led away.\n\nDefense attorneys told jurors that the problems on the set extended far beyond Gutierrez-Reed's control, including the mishandling of weapons by Baldwin, citing sanctions and findings by state workplace safety investigators.\n\nThe defense also cast doubt on accusations that Gutierrez-Reed brought live rounds to the set and said an Albuquerque-based ammunition supplier was never fully investigated.\n\nJuror Alberto Sanchez said Gutierrez-Reed could have paused work on the set to address safety issues. Jurors concluded she brought live ammunition on set, whether she knew it or not, Sanchez said outside of court after jurors were dismissed.\n\n\"Pretty much it was just that (she) never did the safety checks,\" said Sanchez, whose work nearby in Los Alamos has involved safety decisions. \"Never checked the rounds, to pull them out to shake them. I mean, if she'd have done that this wouldn't have happened.\"\n\nBowles, the defense attorney, had told jurors that no one in the cast and crew thought there were live rounds on set and Gutierrez-Reed could not have foreseen that Baldwin would \"go off-script\" when he pointed the revolver at Hutchins. Investigators found no video recordings of the shooting.\n\n\"It was not in the script for Mr. Baldwin to point the weapon,\" Bowles said. \"She didn't know that Mr. Baldwin was going to do what he did.\"\n\nTo drive the point home, Bowles played a video outtake from another day in which Baldwin fired a revolver loaded with blanks -- including a shot after a director calls \"cut.\"\n\nOn the day of the shooting, Bowles said, Gutierrez-Reed alone was segregated in a police car away from others, becoming a convenient scapegoat.\n\n\"You had a production company on a shoestring budget, an A-list actor that was really running the show,\" Bowles said. \"At the end, they had somebody they could all blame.\"\n\nDozens of witnesses had testified during the 10-day trial, from FBI experts in firearms and crime-scene forensics to a camera dolly operator who described the fatal gunshot and watching Hutchins go flush and lose feeling in her legs before death.\n\nThe prosecution painstakingly assembled photographic evidence it said traced the arrival and spread of live rounds on set and argued that Gutierrez-Reed repeatedly missed opportunities to ensure safety and treated basic gun protocols as optional.\n\nThe defense had cast doubt on the relevance of photographs of ammunition, noting FBI testimony that live rounds can't be fully distinguished from dummy ones on sight.\n\nProsecutors said six live rounds found on set bear mostly identical characteristics and don't match live rounds seized from the movie's supplier in Albuquerque. Defense attorneys said the cluttered supply office was not searched until a month after the shooting, undermining the significance of physical evidence.\n\nSANTA FE, N.M. (AP) -- The former weapons supervisor on the set of the movie \"Rust\" won't have to take a drug test as she confronts felony charges of evidence tampering and involuntary manslaughter in the on-set shooting death of a cinematographer by actor Alec Baldwin.\n\nA New Mexico district court judge on Wednesday (July 19, 2023) dismissed a request from prosecutors to test Hannah Gutierrez-Reed for illegal drugs, calling it \"an ambush\" against her defense lawyers.\n\nProsecutors say Gutierrez-Reed passed narcotics to another person to avoid legal consequences in the immediate aftermath of the fatal shooting in October 2021, while contending in court documents that the armorer was likely hungover on the day a live bullet was placed into the gun Baldwin used.\n\nDefense attorney Jason Bowles said the drug use allegations are unsubstantiated and undocumented.\n\nIt's still unclear how several live rounds of ammunition got on set. Prosecutors say they have some evidence to support the theory that Gutierrez-Reed may be responsible for the introduction of the rounds.\n\nWednesday's hearing, held online, was the first for a recently filed felony charge against Gutierrez-Reed of tampering with evidence in the shooting, which killed cinematographer Halyna Hutchins and wounded director Joel Souza.\n\nState District Court Judge Mary Marlowe Sommer advised Gutierrez-Reed of her legal rights on the evidence-tampering charge, which carries a possible penalty of up to 18 months in prison. Gutierrez-Reed did not enter a plea.\n\nAn involuntary manslaughter charge against Baldwin was dropped in April. The actor was pointing a gun at Hutchins when it went off, killing her. Baldwin has said the gun fired accidentally after he followed instructions to aim it toward Hutchins, who was behind the camera.\n\nEvidentiary hearings may take place as soon as August to determine whether the case against Gutierrez-Reed advances toward trial.\n\nAdditionally, Gutierrez-Reed still has access to guns as a self-defense measure against threats -- something prosecutors raised as a concern during Wednesday's online court hearing.\n\n\"We have a person who is a substance user who is in possession of firearms,\" said special prosecutor Kari Morrissey.\n\nGutierrez-Reed's lawyers say prosecutors are resorting to \"character assassination\" to prop up their involuntary manslaughter case.\n\nThe filming of \"Rust\" resumed in April in Montana under an agreement with the cinematographer's widower, Matthew Hutchins, that makes him an executive producer. Souza says he returned to directing \"Rust\" to honor the legacy of Halyna Hutchins.\n\nUNDATED (AP)- The weapons supervisor charged with involuntary manslaughter in the shooting death of a cinematographer on the set of the Alec Baldwin film \"Rust\" has been charged with passing drugs to someone else on the day of the shooting. Prosecutors in New Mexico filed the new charge Thursday (June 22, 2023), alleging Hannah Gutierrez-Reed tampered with evidence by transferring narcotics to another person to avoid prosecution. Gutierrez-Reed's lawyer calls the charge \"retaliatory and vindictive.\" Gutierrez-Reed is the only remaining defendant in the case. An involuntary manslaughter charge was dropped in April against Baldwin, who was pointing a gun at cinematographer Halyna Hutchins when it went off and killed her.\n\nALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- Prosecutors are accusing the weapons supervisor on the film set where Alec Baldwin shot and killed a cinematographer of drinking and smoking marijuana in the evenings during the filming of \"Rust.\" They say she was likely hungover when she loaded a live bullet into the revolver. They leveled the accusations Friday (June 9, 2023) in response to a motion filed last month by Hannah Gutierrez-Reed's attorneys that seeks to dismiss her involuntary manslaughter charge. Gutierrez-Reed's attorney said Tuesday that the prosecution's case is weak and they're resorting to character assassination claims. Prosecutors also said in the filing that they expect to decide within the next 60 days whether to recharge Baldwin.\n\nSANTA FE, N.M. (AP) -- Prosecutors in New Mexico will dismiss an involuntary manslaughter charge against actor Alec Baldwin in the fatal 2021 shooting of a cinematographer on the set of the Western film \"Rust.\" A status conference was scheduled for Friday (April 21, 2023) in state District Court about next steps in the case. Special prosecutors Kari Morrisey and Jason Lewis say their investigation is not over and Baldwin has not been absolved. The film's weapons supervisor Hannah Gutierrez-Reed is still charged with involuntary manslaughter in the shooting of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins. Baldwin was pointing a pistol at Hutchins during a rehearsal when it when off, killing her and wounding director Joel Souza.\n\nSANTA FE, N.M. (AP) -- A New Mexico judge is sealing from public view the terms of a proposed settlement agreement in a wrongful death lawsuit involving actor Alec Baldwin. At a court hearing Monday (April 17, 2023), a judge agreed keep confidential the terms the agreement to settle a wrongful death lawsuit brought by Hutchins' widower and 10-year-old son against \"Rust\" producers including Baldwin. Baldwin was pointing a pistol at cinematographer Halyna Hutchins during a rehearsal on the film's set outside Santa Fe in 2021 when the gun went off, killing her and wounding the director. Separately, Baldwin and the film's weapons supervisor are charged with involuntary manslaughter.\n\nSANTA FE, N.M. (AP) -- New court filings show prosecutors have dropped the possibility of a sentence enhancement that could have carried a mandatory five-year sentence against Alec Baldwin in a fatal film-set shooting. The actor-producer's attorneys had earlier objected to the enhancement they said was unconstitutional because it was added after the October 2021 shooting. The amended complaint filed Friday in New Mexico was made public Monday (Feb. 20, 2023). Baldwin and weapons supervisor Hannah Gutierrez-Reed were charged last month with felony involuntary manslaughter in the shooting death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins during rehearsals for the film \"Rust\" at a ranch on the outskirts of Santa Fe.\n\nSANTA FE, N.M. (AP) -- A Santa Fe district attorney has filed involuntary manslaughter charges against actor Alec Baldwin in the fatal shooting of a cinematographer on the set of the Western movie \"Rust.\" Santa Fe District Attorney Mary Carmack-Altwies announced that her office filed the charges Tuesday (Jan. 31, 2023). She previously had said the charges would be forthcoming. Halyna Hutchins died shortly after being wounded during rehearsals at a ranch on the outskirts of Santa Fe in October 2021. Baldwin was pointing a pistol at her when the gun went off. Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, who supervised weapons on the set, also is charged with involuntary manslaughter.\n\nSANTA FE, N.M. (AP) -- Prosecutors are scheduled to file involuntary manslaughter charges in connection with the fatal shooting of a cinematographer by actor Alec Baldwin during a rehearsal on the set of a Western movie in 2021. Prosecutors say they will file in court and make public felony charges against Baldwin and weapons supervisor Hannah Gutierrez-Reed that could carry penalties of up to five years in prison. Prosecutors also said they will release a signed plea agreement with assistant director David Halls. Halls oversaw safety on the set. Baldwin has described the killing as a tragic accident and says he was told the gun was safe.\n\nSANTA FE, N.M. (AP) -- Prosecutors vow to file two manslaughter charges against actor Alec Baldwin and a weapons supervisor in the fatal 2021 shooting of a cinematographer on the set of a Western movie. The looming charges have set in motion evidentiary proceedings and a reckoning for film set safety and the handling of firearms. One charge is for negligence. Another is for reckless disregard \"without due caution and circumspection\" and carries a five-year minimum sentence. Halyna Hutchins died shortly after being wounded during rehearsals at a ranch on the outskirts of Santa Fe. Authorities say Baldwin was pointing a pistol at her when he cocked the hammer and fired.\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) -- As actor Alec Baldwin faces a charge of involuntary manslaughter in the shooting death of a cinematographer on a New Mexico, gun safety on sets remains at the forefront of many in Hollywood. Joey Dillon, who supervises weapons in TV and film, says that since the shooting he has become more vocal during productions on the status of guns being put into actors hands. And he says the actors are double checking the weapons themselves much more. But Baldwin's attorney and union both said Thursday (Jan. 19, 2023) that actors cannot be expected to make this a job responsibility, and should not be made a criminal if they fail at it.\n\nSANTA FE, N.M. (AP) -- A Santa Fe district attorney is prepared to announce whether to press charges in the fatal 2021 film-set shooting of a cinematographer by actor Alec Baldwin during a rehearsal on the set of the Western movie \"Rust.\" Santa Fe District Attorney Mary Carmack-Altwies says a decision will be announced Thursday (Jan. 19, 2023) in a statement and on social media platforms. Cinematographer Halyna Hutchins died shortly after being shot during setup for a scene at a filmset ranch on the outskirts of Santa Fe on Oct. 21, 2021.\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) -- Saying he wants to clear his name, Alec Baldwin is suing people involved in handling and supplying the loaded gun that he was using when it fired and killed a crew member last year during filming of the movie \"Rust.\" The shooting was ruled an accident. Baldwin on Friday (Nov. 11, 20220) sued in Los Angeles, alleging negligence by the armorer, gun supplier and others. Baldwin was rehearsing with a gun on the New Mexico set when it fired, killing cinematographer Halyna Hutchins. Baldwin has said he was told the gun was safe and didn't know it held a live round. Baldwin says he's been \"wrongly viewed as the perpetrator of this tragedy.\" Last month, Hutchins' family announced it had agreed to settle a lawsuit against the actor.\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) -- The family of a cinematographer shot and killed by Alec Baldwin on the set of the film \"Rust\" has agreed to settle a lawsuit against Baldwin and the movie's producers, and production may resume on the project in January 2023. Matthew Hutchins, widow of the cinematographer Halyna Hutchins, says in a statement that a settlement agreement has been reached in the New Mexico lawsuit. Matthew Hutchins says filming will resume on \"Rust\" in January, with the same principal players as before. New Mexico regulators say the production company has failed to pay a fine for safety violations, and have scheduled a hearing for April. Baldwin, Halyna Hutchins and others were setting up a shot inside a chapel on set when the gun he was holding went off in October 2021.\n\nSANTA FE, N.M. (AP) -- A New Mexico prosecutor says her office will decide whether criminal charges will be filed in the fatal film-set shooting of a cinematographer by actor Alec Baldwin once the investigation is complete. District Attorney Mary Carmack-Altwies said in a statement issued Wednesday (Aug. 3, 2022) that her office has received only portions of the investigation from the Santa Fe County Sheriff's Office. Still outstanding is forensic analysis of the weapon, data from Baldwin's cell phone and more from the FBI and state medical examiners. In records released since the October 2021 shooting, investigators described complacency, disorganization and neglected safety measures in the making of the low-budget movie \"Rust.\"\n\nSANTA FE, N.M. (AP) -- The New Mexico sheriff investigating the fatal film-set shooting of a cinematographer by actor Alec Baldwin described complacency, disorganization and neglected safety measures in the making of the low-budget movie \"Rust.\" The vast trove of newly released law enforcement files include lapel camera video of the mortally wounded Hutchins slipping in and out of consciousness as an evacuation helicopter arrives. Witness interrogations, email threads, text conversations, inventories of ammunition and hundreds of photographs round out the collection of evidence. The sheriff says he is waiting on a forensic analysis before turning the 6-month-old case over to prosecutors to decide whether criminal charges will be filed.\n\nSANTA FE, N.M. (AP) -- Law enforcement officials have released a trove of video and photographic evidence in the investigation of a fatal October shooting of a cinematographer by actor and producer Alec Baldwin on the set of a Western movie. Data files released by the Santa Fe County Sheriff's Office on Monday (April 25, 2022) included videos of investigators debriefing Baldwin on the day of the shooting inside a compact office as well as apparent rehearsal clips that show the actor in costume as he practices a quick-draw maneuver with a gun. Santa Fe County Sheriff Adan Mendoza said the investigation remains open and ongoing as it awaits the results of ballistics analysis from the FBI.\n\nSANTA FE, N.M. (AP) -- Alec Baldwin has surrendered his cellphone as part of the investigation into a fatal shooting on a New Mexico film set last fall. A Santa Fe County Sheriff's Office spokesman says Baldwin's phone was turned over Friday to authorities in New York's Suffolk County and that information from the phone will be provided to investigators. They obtained a search warrant last month for the phone's contents in their investigation into the Oct. 21 shooting on set for \"Rust.\" Baldwin was an actor and co-producer for the production. Authorities have said Baldwin's prop revolver discharged a live round during a rehearsal, killing cinematographer Halyna Hutchins and wounding director Joel Souza.\n\nSANTA FE, N.M. (AP) -- A new lawsuit accuses an ammunition supplier of creating dangerous conditions on a movie set where a gun held by actor Alec Baldwin killed a cinematographer, by including live ammunition in a box that was supposed to include only dummy rounds. The lawsuit was filed in New Mexico state district court by Hannah Gutierrez Reed, the armorer who oversaw firearms, ammunition and related training on the set of \"Rust\" alongside two assistants. Cinematographer Halyna Hutchins died on Oct. 21, 2021, from a gunshot wound during a \"Rust\" rehearsal at a ranch on the outskirts of Santa Fe in northern New Mexico.\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) -- Alec Baldwin says someone is responsible for the shooting on a New Mexico film set that killed a cinematographer, but it's not him. In an ABC interview with George Stephanopoulos that aired Thursday (Dec. 2, 2021) night, Baldwin said he would do anything to undo what happened, but he's not the person who put the live bullet in the gun, leading to the death of Halyna Hutchins. Baldwin said it was Hutchins herself who directed him to point the gun at her that they both believed was empty on Oct. 21 on the set of the Western \"Rust.\"\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- ABC News has released a clip in which Alec Baldwin tells George Stephanopoulos that he did not pull the trigger on a gun that went off on a New Mexico film set, killing a cinematographer. The interview will air as a prime-time special Thursday on ABC and will stream later on Hulu. Baldwin fired a prop gun that had been loaded with live ammunition. The cinematographer was killed and the film's director was injured. It is the first time Baldwin has spoken in depth on screen about the shooting. ABC News says it will do a more in-depth report on the investigation into the killing next week on \"20/20.\"\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Alec Baldwin will talk about the deadly shooting in October on the set of the movie \"Rust\" in an interview with George Stephanopoulos of ABC News.

Heavy of spirit and trundling of gait, he looks like a man with the weight of the world on his shoulders. As well he might.\n\nBaldwin is charged with involuntary manslaughter in the death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins on his film Rust in October 2021.\n\nOn set at the Bonanza Creek film ranch 20 miles south of Santa Fe, he was pointing a gun at Hutchins during a rehearsal inside a church when it went off, killing her and wounding director Joel Souza. Baldwin has pleaded not guilty to the charge.\n\nIn his curdled honour, the usual \u00adcircus had assembled outside the court, where 41 news organisations from around the world are credentialed to cover the event.\n\nGiving interviews in their midst was 83-year-old Gloria Allred, the high-profile lawyer who has been representing the victim's family. Allred held up a photograph of Hutchins in silent accusation, explaining that her family could not travel from their native Ukraine because of the war.\n\nShe is representing them in a civil lawsuit they have filed against Mr Baldwin and expressed some dismay over his upcoming reality show, The Baldwins. 'This is not a reality show!' she cried, adding that it would be 'sick' if he were to include moments from this trial in his new series. To be fair, there is absolutely no evidence that this is his intention.\n\nInside the courtroom we were soon on to opening statements in the first day of the 66-year-old actor's trial.\n\nHannah Gutierrez-Reed, the young Rust armourer responsible for on set gun safety, is already behind bars after being charged with the same offence.\n\nShe is currently appealing her sentence, but the prosecution wasted no time in blaming him for her lack of safety checks and gun protocols.\n\n'Each time he handled this gun he did not do a safety check with this inexperienced armourer and the reason he did not do this was because he didn't want to offend her,' claimed prosecutor Erlinda Ocampo Johnson.\n\n'He violated the cardinal rules of gun safety.'\n\nFor the defence, Alex Spiro said: 'This was an unspeakable tragedy, but Alec Baldwin committed no crime.\n\nHe was an actor acting.' Spiro countered that the old adage saying you should never point a gun at someone unless you intend to shoot them does not apply here.\n\n'These cardinal rules are not cardinal rules on a movie set. In films we see people pointing guns at each other all the time.'\n\nThen he went off on a cheesy little rap about how films had to make it look real, baby.\n\n'The stuntman must leap. The snake must hiss,' he blathered before the prosecution objected and he moved on, asking the jury to make a separation between Alec Baldwin the actor and Alec Baldwin the person.\n\nThe jury was shown footage of cast and crew rehearsing the fateful scene. There was Alec Baldwin in costume as the outlaw Harland Rust, complete with Stetson on his head and rascally beard, pulling the gun out from his shoulder holster, again and again.\n\nAt the defence table Alec Baldwin, the person, observed this with his hand over his mouth. A few rows behind him, his wife Hilaria learned forward in her seat, chin resting in her hands, watching avidly.\n\nFrom my seat in the courtroom press benches, it seemed obvious that Baldwin's finger was on the trigger. In the past, Baldwin has denied pulling the trigger, a crucial but disputed factor in his case.\n\n'The evidence you will hear is that is not possible, the gun will not discharge without pulling that trigger,' said Johnson for the prosecution. 'Even if he did,' said Spiro for the defence, 'that would only make his statement incorrect. That doesn't make him guilty of homicide.' Towards the end of the morning session there was a reminder of the tragedy at the heart of this case.\n\nWe were shown disturbing first responder lapel-cam footage of 42-year-old Hutchins fighting for her life on the dirt floor of the Bonanza Creek set. 'Halyna, Halyna, deep breath, deep breath,' a voice cries. 'Good girl, good girl,' says another. 'Jesus Christ,' someone exclaims as a medic rushes in with an \u00adoxygen tank.\n\nTheir panic is palpable as the stricken woman is stretchered into a helicopter before being flown to hospital, where doctors could not save her.\n\nIn the courtroom, Alec Baldwin watched on impassively, making notes on a yellow legal pad. Behind him, his wife, the mother of his seven young children looked drawn and tense.", "source": {"uri": "internewscast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Internewscast Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alec_Baldwin", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alec Baldwin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gloria_Allred", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gloria Allred"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Fe,_New_Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Santa Fe, New Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Santa Fe, New Mexico"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Souza", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joel Souza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halyna_Hutchins", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Halyna Hutchins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinal_(Catholic_Church)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cardinal (Catholic Church)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posse_comitatus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Posse comitatus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armourer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Armourer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinematographer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cinematographer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranch", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ranch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cinema of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Circus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Acquittal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courthouse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Courthouse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manslaughter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manslaughter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoga", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yoga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reality television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Temperature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opening_statement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Opening statement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Silent film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonanza", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bonanza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tragedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jesus"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gun_Control", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gun Control", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Guns", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Guns", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Airsoft", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Airsoft", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Homemade", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Homemade", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/rewrite-this-title-Hand-over-his-mouth-Baldwin-watched-the.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719280", "eventUri": "eng-9719280", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

The film's director Joel Souza, 51, was also injured in the incident.\n\nThe trial to assess whether Baldwin - who has since returned to complete the film with the filmmaker - is criminally liable for Hutchins' death is set to last eight days,as the court first sat on July 10.\n\nIf convicted, the dad-of-seven could face up to 18 months in prison. While Baldwin claims he's struggled to find work since Hutchin's death, her family said they wanted to find out the truth of who was responsible.\n\nThe armourer on set, Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, was convicted earlier this year of involuntary manslaughter after mistakenly mixing up dummy bullets being used for the film and live bullets belonging to her, which were found on around the set. The 26-year-old was sentenced to 18 months in prison - the same term Baldwin faces if convicted.\n\nCourt documents state Baldwin was handed the gun and told it was unloaded. While the defence argue it was not his job as an actor to check the weapon's safety, prosecution say he was negligent in his handling of the gun by pointing it at Hutchins, who was shot in the chest area.\n\nSpecial prosecutor Erlinda Johnson opened the case against the Hollywood star in Santa Fe, New Mexico, arguing Baldwin played 'make-believe with a real gun' and 'violated the cardinal rules of firearms safety' when Hutchins, a 'vibrant 42-year-old rising star', was fatally shot.\n\n'While it was a movie set, it was a real, live workplace for many people. But you will hear that this workplace was on a tight budget...and some of the people who were hired to work on this workplace were inexperienced,' she continued, as per the BBC.\n\nShe also claimed Baldwin requested the 'biggest gun available' prior to arriving on set, and - contesting the actor's claim he never pulled the trigger when the gun fired - argued that various tests by the FBI concluded the gun was in fine working order.\n\nHowever, the gun was damaged during the final test, which examined the possibility of accidental discharge. Defence argued their inability to examine the weapon in its original condition due to the damage was 'outrageous' and required 'dismissal' of the charges against Baldwin.\n\nBaldwin's lawyer, Alex Spiro, argued that he 'committed no crime' and was simply 'an actor acting'. He added that the rules for those holding firearms don't apply to movie sets, and that those whose job it was to ensure firearm safety had failed.\n\n'Real bullets are never supposed to be on movie sets,' Spiro said, also noting that the gun was double-checked.\n\n'Alec took the gun from those charged with its safety. He did not tamper with it. He did not load it himself. He did not leave it unattended,' Spiro says. 'It was an actor handling a prop... and the gun just went off.'\n\nPolice officer Nicholas Lefleur, who responded to the call, shared bodycam footage with the court of his arrival onto the scene showing some of Hutchin's last moments.\n\nSpiro asked Lefleur whether Baldwin - who was waiting patiently and respectfully on set as the homicide was being investigated - asked about Hutchins in the aftermath of the shooting, to why he replied, 'Yes'.\n\n'Have you ever seen that in all your experience? Somebody commits a homicide, and everyone around the scene circling the person, shaking his hand and talking to him about what happened?' Spiro asked, to which the Lefloeur replied: 'No.'\n\nThe jury listened to a 911 call in which the caller asked for help because two people were shot 'accidentally', repeating the word.\n\nProsecutors then stressed that the charge - involuntary manslaughter - is not 'intentional homicide' so whether it is accidental or not isn't the question.\n\nIf you've got a celebrity story, video or pictures get in touch with the Metro.co.uk entertainment team by emailing us celebtips@metro.co.uk, calling 020 3615 2145 or by visiting our Submit Stuff page - we'd love to hear from you.", "source": {"uri": "metro.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Metro"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kitty_chrisp@metro.co.uk", "name": "Kitty Chrisp", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manslaughter", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manslaughter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alec_Baldwin", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Alec Baldwin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Souza", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joel Souza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halyna_Hutchins", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Halyna Hutchins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prejudice_(legal_term)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prejudice (legal term)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Medic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinematographer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cinematographer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/30_Rock", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "30 Rock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filmmaking", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Filmmaking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearm", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Firearm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambulance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ambulance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plea", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Plea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood,_Los_Angeles", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hollywood, Los Angeles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinal_(Catholic_Church)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cardinal (Catholic Church)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Fe,_New_Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Santa Fe, New Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Santa Fe, New Mexico"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prop", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_camera", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Body camera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuff_(website)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stuff (website)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unintentional_discharge", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Unintentional discharge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro_(British_newspaper)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Metro (British newspaper)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Military"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gun_Control", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gun Control", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/SEI_212299989-4ca2.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0px%2C63px%2C1895px%2C997px&resize=1200%2C630", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719280", "eventUri": "eng-9719280", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-10", "textStart": 1332, "textEnd": 1339}], "sentiment": -0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

But it's what happened.\"\n\nMr Spiro tried to establish that neither Mr LeFleur nor the trial's second witness, former sheriff's lieutenant Tim Benavidez, treated the scene as a place where a major crime had occurred.\n\nMr Benavidez, who collected the revolver after the shooting, acknowledged that he was careful with it as much for safety reasons as anything else, but did not wear gloves or take meticulous forensic precautions as he might have done for a homicide investigation.\n\nMs Ocampo Johnson in her opening walked the jurors through the events leading up to Ms Hutchins death.\n\nShe said on that day, Baldwin declined multiple opportunities for standard safety checks with armorer Hannah Gutierrez-Reed before the rehearsal in the small church about 20 miles (32 kilometres) from the courthouse where Ms Hutchins, \"a vibrant 42-year-old rising star\", was killed. She said Baldwin instead \"did his own thing\".\n\n\"He cocks the hammer, points it straight at Miss Hutchins, and fires that gun, sending that live bullet right into Miss Hutchins body,\" said Ms Ocampo Johnson.\n\nDuring the presentation, Baldwin trained his eyes downward on a notepad, away from the jury. He watched Mr Spiro intently during his opening.\n\nHis wife Hilaria Baldwin, younger brother Stephen Baldwin and older sister Elizabeth Keuchler -- who wiped away tears at times -- were among the family and friends sitting behind him.\n\nThe 16 jurors -- 11 women and five men -- come from a region with strong currents of gun ownership and safety informed by backcountry hunting. Four of the jurors will be deemed alternates while the other 12 deliberate once they get the case.\n\nMs Hutchins' death and the wounding of director Joel Souza nearly three years ago sent shock waves through the film industry and led to one felony charge against Baldwin, 66, that could result in up to 18 months in prison.\n\n\"It killed an amazing person,\" Mr Spiro said. \"It wounded another, and it changed lives forever.\"\n\nBaldwin has claimed the gun fired accidentally after he followed instructions to point it towards Ms Hutchins, who was behind the camera.\n\nUnaware that it was loaded with a live round, he said he pulled back the hammer -- not the trigger -- and it fired.\n\n\"No one saw him intentionally pull the trigger,\" Mr Spiro said.\n\nBut he said even if Baldwin had pulled it, it still would not have been manslaughter.\n\n\"On a movie set, you're allowed to pull that trigger,\" Mr Spiro said, adding: \"That doesn't make it a homicide.\"\n\nThe lawyer emphasised that the responsibility for safety lay with the film's armourer, Gutierrez-Reed, who has already been convicted of involuntary manslaughter, and assistant director David Halls, who pleaded no contest to negligent use of a deadly weapon in exchange for his testimony.\n\nBaldwin had been told \"cold gun\" before getting the revolver, not knowing there was a live round in it.\n\n\"It had been checked and double checked by those responsible for ensuring the gun was safe,\" Mr Spiro said. \"He did not tamper with it, he did not load it himself. He did not leave it unattended.\"\n\nMr Spiro said in concluding his opening that witnesses will attest that \"no actor in history\" has \"intercepted a live bullet from a prop gun\".\n\n\"No one could have imagined or expected an actor to do that,\" the lawyer said.\n\nTestimony at trial will delve into the mechanics of the weapon and whether it could have fired without a trigger pull. Prosecutors say it could not have.\n\n\"That gun the defendant had asked to be assigned worked perfectly fine as it was designed,\" Ms Ocampo Johnson said.\n\nAttorney Gloria Allred sat in the front row of the courtroom audience, a reminder of Baldwin's other legal difficulties.\n\nMs Allred is representing Rust script supervisor Mamie Mitchell and Hutchins' sister and parents in a civil lawsuit against Baldwin and other producers.\n\nMs Allred said that from her observations in court, the jury appeared to be riveted by testimony and evidence including the police lapel camera video.",

Ever the supportive wife, Hilaria followed from the first SUV, managing one of their seven young children and a stroller with characteristic grace.\n\nDespite the throng of reporters and the intense media glare, Alec remained focused on his family. Ignoring the barrage of questions, he briefly conversed with his child and assisted Hilaria by grabbing one of her bags.\n\nHilaria, 39, looked composed in a chic tan pantsuit and large sunglasses, as she adjusted the stroller and handed their child to a nanny.\n\nAlec's trial stems from the tragic incident in October 2021, where Halyna Hutchins lost her life. Alec, who allegedly pointed a gun at Hutchins not realizing it was loaded with a live round, has been accused of reckless behavior leading to her death.\n\nHe has pleaded not guilty to the charges and could face up to 18 months in prison if convicted.\n\nThe day marked the beginning of jury selection, a process anticipated to be rigorous given the high-profile nature of the case.\n\nThe trial, expected to span ten days, will be livestreamed on Court TV. Opening statements could commence as early as Wednesday, offering a public window into the courtroom proceedings.\n\nDespite the looming trial, Alec and Hilaria recently celebrated a significant personal milestone -- their 12th wedding anniversary.\n\nThe couple's public appearance at the courthouse underscored their commitment to facing challenges together, even in the most daunting circumstances.\n\nIn a surprising turn, Alec and Hilaria have announced their upcoming reality TV series, set to premiere in 2025. The show, titled \"The Baldwins,\" will give viewers an intimate look at their home life with their seven children: Carmen, 10, Rafael, 8, Leonardo, 7, Romeo, 6, Eduardo, 3, Maria, 3, and Ilaria, 1.\n\n\"We're inviting you into our home to experience the ups and downs; the good, the bad, the wild, and the crazy,\" Alec shared in a video posted on social media.

She grew up in Boston and attended The Cambridge School of Weston. Baldwin has spoken about her interest in dance and fitness from a young age, which eventually led her to study at New York University. Her academic focus was on art history and dance.\n\nHilaria Baldwin's professional career is primarily centered around wellness and fitness. She is a yoga instructor and has co-founded a chain of yoga studios known as Yoga Vida in New York. Her approach to yoga and wellness has garnered significant attention, helping her establish a name in the wellness community. Apart from her work in yoga, Hilaria has ventured into media and publishing. She authored The Living Clearly Method, a book that outlines methods to improve one's life balance, health, and happiness through yoga and mindfulness practices. She also frequently appears on television and has taken part in podcasts and other media formats, discussing topics related to health, wellness, and her lifestyle.\n\nHer yoga prowess even caught the eye of Alec Baldwin. The couple tied the knot in 2012 (despite their 26-year age gap) and have since welcomed seven children together: Carmen Gabriela, Mar\u00eda Luc\u00eda Victoria, and Ilaria Catalina Irena, as well as four sons Rafael Thomas, Leonardo \u00c1ngel Charles, Romeo Alejandro David, and Eduardo \"Edu\" Pao Lucas.\n\nBut it hasn't all been smooth sailing for the famous couple. In 2021, Alec found himself in hot water after a tragic incident on the set of his movie Rust, in which a prop gun he was holding discharged, killing cinematographer Halyna Hutchins. The actor was subsequently charged with involuntary manslaughter, setting the stage for a legal battle that has dominated headlines.\n\nHilaria is no stranger to controversy herself. In late 2020, Hilaria Baldwin faced significant media scrutiny and public backlash over her cultural and ethnic identity. It was revealed that despite her public persona that suggested she was from Spain, complete with a Spanish accent in some appearances, she was, in fact, born and raised in the United States with no direct birth connection to Spain.\n\nHilaria Baldwin took to Instagram to post a series of videos in which she that her birth name is indeed Hillary. She mentioned that \"Hilaria\" is a name used among family and friends because of her deep connection to Spanish culture. While some found her explanation satisfactory, others criticized her for what they perceived as a deliberate attempt to mislead the public about her identity.\n\nAs she continues to navigate life in the public eye, it is likely that she will remain a subject of ongoing discussion and debate.", "source": {"uri": "wegotthiscovered.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "We Got This Covered"}, "authors": [{"uri": "omar_faruque@wegotthiscovered.com", "name": "Omar Faruque", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilaria_Baldwin", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hilaria Baldwin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alec_Baldwin", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alec Baldwin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoga", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Yoga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_fitness", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Physical fitness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cambridge_School_of_Weston", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Cambridge School of Weston"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_history", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Art history"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manslaughter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manslaughter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guru", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Guru"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindfulness", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mindfulness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonardo_da_Vinci", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Leonardo da Vinci"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria,_British_Columbia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Victoria, British Columbia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Victoria, British Columbia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prop", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halyna_Hutchins", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Halyna Hutchins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinematographer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cinematographer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sailing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sailing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spanish language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Journals", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Journals", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Lacemaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Lacemaking", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Nursing/History", "label": "dmoz/Health/Nursing/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Alec-Baldwin-wife-Hilaria-Baldwin.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719280", "eventUri": "eng-9719280", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3333333333333333, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

(AP) -- Prosecutors sought to cast Alec Baldwin as someone who flouts rules and has little regard for safety at the first day of his New Mexico trial in the shooting of a cinematographer.\n\nSpecial prosecutor Erlinda Ocampo Johnson repeatedly referred to Baldwin playing \"make-believe\" with a revolver on the set of the film \"Rust,\" and said it led to very real danger and the death of Halyna Hutchins, whom she called \"a vibrant 42-year-old rising star.\"\n\nOcampo Johnson told jurors in her opening statement Wednesday that Baldwin \"requested to be assigned the biggest gun available\" and that during a training session for it, he had \"people filming him while he's running around shooting this gun.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...

Baldwin has said the gun fired accidentally, but Spiro said that it still would not be manslaughter even if he had willfully fired it.\n\n\"On a movie set, you're allowed to pull that trigger,\" said Spiro.\n\nSpiro called the shooting an \"unspeakable tragedy\" and that an \"amazing person\" dies, but said the responsibility lies with the film's armorer Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, who has already been convicted of involuntary manslaughter, and of assistant director David Halls, who told Baldwin the gun was \"cold.\"\n\n\"It had been checked and double checked by those responsible for ensuring the gun was safe,\" Spiro said. \"He did not tamper with it, he did not load it himself. He did not leave it unattended.\"\n\nThe first witness to take the stand was Nicholas LeFleur, the first law enforcement officer to arrive at the movie set at Bonanza Creek Ranch after the shooting, and his lapel camera video gave jurors a glimpse of the chaotic scene: a grim view of an apparently unconscious Hutchins as LeFleur and others worked to revive her.\n\nLater in the video, LeFleur can be seen telling Baldwin not to speak to the other potential witnesses, but Baldwin repeatedly does.\n\n\"Was Mr. Baldwin supposed to be talking about the incident?\" special prosecutor Kari Morrissey asked him.\n\n\"No ma'am,\" LeFleur replied.\n\n\"Does he appear to be doing it anyway?\" Morrissey asked.\n\n\"Yes, ma'am,\" LeFleur said.\n\nAmong those sitting in the gallery behind Baldwin watching the trial were his wife Hilaria Baldwin, younger brother Stephen Baldwin and older sister Elizabeth Keuchler -- who wiped away tears at times during the proceedings.\n\nDalton reported from Los Angeles.\n\n___ For more coverage of Alec Baldwin's involuntary manslaughter trial, visit: https://apnews.com/hub/alec-baldwin\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

The Hollywood A-lister was pointing a gun at cinematographer Halyna Hutchins during a fateful rehearsal in October 2021 when it fired a live round, killing her and wounding the movie's director. Baldwin, 66, says he did not know the gun was loaded and did not pull the trigger. After the court's break, prosecutors and the defense attorneys conferred with the judge regarding the parameters of certain video evidence that will be played during testimony today. It is unclear what stipulations the judge placed on the playing of video during the private consultation, but after the conference, a visibly perturbed special prosecutor Kari Morrissey quickly walked over to Alec Baldwin's defense table and admonished his lawyers. \"You need to tell me the moment (the video) needs to start and the moment it needs to stop. I'm not just jumping around to random seconds,\" Morrissey said. Pre-trial hearings in the case have been marked by frequent clashes between attorneys from each side, with the judge in the case frequently interrupting disputes and at one point calling out the tone between opposing parties. The prosecution called its first witness in the criminal trial against Alec Baldwin. Nicholas Lefleur is a current officer at the Santa Fe Police Department in New Mexico, he said on the stand, adding that he has been working there for two years. Previously, he worked at the Santa Fe Sheriff's Department. He said he received a dispatch call of someone being shot on a movie set in 2021. He arrived at the scene of the shooting first. \"Even if he intentionally pulled the trigger like the prosecutor just demonstrated, that doesn't make him guilty of homicide,\" Alec Baldwin's attorney Alex Spiro said in his opening argument. The live bullet on set was the key to Hutchins' death, he said, adding that an actor is allowed to pull the trigger and behave as his character would. The prop gun Baldwin used was destroyed during the investigation into the shooting, according to Spiro, adding that it was the one item that could prove whether or not Baldwin pulled the trigger. Spiro told jurors members of the \"Rust\" crew will also testify, saying that none of them knew about the live round that made its way into the prop gun. \"None of them had any idea it was on that set or in that gun,\" said Spiro, leading jurors back to why the live bullet was there in the first place. \"None of it speaks to whether Alec knew or should have known those things. He didn't. No one on that set did. It was not foreseeable,\" he said. \"Actors don't check the weapons. Safety is ensured by dedicated personnel,\" he added. Attorney Alex Spiro has told the jury \"cold guns can't hurt people\" as he gives opening statements in defense of Alec Baldwin. Spiro said Baldwin was handed a gun by the armorer and was assured it was a cold gun. He said a \"cold gun doesn't mean no live bullets,\" but rather, a cold gun doesn't even have a fake bullet. \"You don't need to worry even about eye gear or ear plugs for that fake bang,\" he said. \"Cold guns can't hurt people. It's impossible. Literally impossible for a cold gun to hurt somebody.\" He continued that the belief a prop is a \"cold gun\" is \"why these artists are carrying on in their art. In a significant victory for the defense, Alec Baldwin's role as a producer on the film \"Rust\" will not be considered during his involuntary manslaughter trial in the fatal on-set shooting of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins, Judge Mary Marlowe Sommer ruled Monday.", "source": {"uri": "nation.com.pk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Nation"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alec_Baldwin", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alec Baldwin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Fe,_New_Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Santa Fe, New Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Santa Fe, New Mexico"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morrissey", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Morrissey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Mexico"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood,_Los_Angeles", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hollywood, Los Angeles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_(genre)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Western (genre)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manslaughter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manslaughter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prop_gun", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prop gun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halyna_Hutchins", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Halyna Hutchins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Spiro", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alex Spiro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinematographer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cinematographer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_procedure", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Criminal procedure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homicide", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Homicide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prop", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weapons_master", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Weapons master"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Marlowe", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christopher Marlowe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Film producer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gun_Control", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gun Control", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Homemade", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Homemade", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://www.nation.com.pk/print_images/large/2024-07-11/testimony-begins-in-alec-baldwin-s-trial-over-rust-movie-shooting-1720669567-1989.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719280", "eventUri": "eng-9719280", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

In the Alec Baldwin involuntary manslaughter trial in Santa Fe, Mexico, special prosecutor Erlinda Ocampo Johnson and Baldwin's defence attorney Alex Spiro made called it \"cardinal rule\" of gun safety and \"shiny object\" respectively.\n\nAs Alec watched, Erlinda Johnson said that the actor should be held criminally liable in the death of Rust cinematographer Halyna Hutchins. Alec had accidentally fired a live shot at cinematographer Halyna Hutchins, who died on the set of Rust.\n\nJohnson told the court that Alec Baldwin \"played make believe with a real gun and violated the cardinal rule of firearm safety. He pointed the gun at another human being, cocked the hammer and pulled the trigger in reckless disregard for Ms. Hutchins' safety.\" The prosecutor called the actor a reckless man with a gun.\n\nMeanwhile, Alec's defence said that the jury should consider him something else. Spiro said jury should consider him as \"Harland Rust\". Harland is the name of the character from Alec Baldwin's indie Western film Rust. Spiro said, \"He's an outlaw running for his life. His mind is somewhere else, in the being of another, a century away, an outlaw.\"\n\nSpiro then made references to films like King Kong, Superman, Platoon and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. \"Movies and magic have always been closely associated,\" Spiro said. \"The evidence will show that guns are in movies because guns are in peoples' lives.\"\n\nAlso read: George Clooney writes scathing op-ed against Joe Biden's candidacy: Not going to win with this president\n\nSpiro then pointed out that it wasn't Alec Baldwin's job to check the gun, that that responsibility belonged to assistant director Dave Halls and armourer Hannah Gutierrez-Reed. The defence attorney narrated over footage of the scene the Rust crew were filming when Hutchins was shot.", "source": {"uri": "wionews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WION"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halyna_Hutchins", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Halyna Hutchins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinematographer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cinematographer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alec_Baldwin", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alec Baldwin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearm", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Firearm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinal_(Catholic_Church)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cardinal (Catholic Church)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama_(film_and_television)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drama (film and television)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manslaughter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manslaughter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Fe,_New_Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Santa Fe, New Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Santa Fe, New Mexico"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outlaw", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Outlaw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Kong", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "King Kong"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butch_Cassidy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Butch Cassidy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sundance_Kid", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sundance Kid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assistant_director", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assistant director"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_(genre)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Western (genre)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Clooney", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "George Clooney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independent film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_(illusion)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Magic (illusion)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Op-ed", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Op-ed"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gun_Control", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gun Control", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Airsoft", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Airsoft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Homemade", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Homemade", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://cdn.wionews.com/sites/default/files/2022/08/20/289142-new-wion-40.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719280", "eventUri": "eng-9719280", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2941176470588235, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

Yesterday, July 8, 2024, the actor attended his first court appearance. He was present for an important day, as it was decided by the judge that his role as a producer in the movie Rust would not be taken into consideration, unlike in the Hannah Gutierrez trial, marking a major win for his defense counsel.\n\nThroughout this sad ordeal - with the life of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins having been tragically lost on the movie set in 2021 - Baldwin's wife Hilaria, has been at her husband's side supporting him, the two having recently celebrated their 12th wedding anniversary.\n\nHilaria Baldwin tied the knot with her spouse on June 30, 2012, a year after they first met. The couple has a large family together, with seven beautiful children, having welcomed their youngest in 2022. Baldwin had been married once before, to fellow actress Kim Basinger, with whom he had his eldest daughter, Ireland, who was born in October 1995.\n\nAlec Baldwin was born Alexander Rae Baldwin III on April 3, 1958, in Long Island, New York. At 66 years old as of 2024, he is the eldest Baldwin sibling born to Carol Newcomb and Alexander Rae Baldwin Jr.\n\nThe actor's wife, Hilaria, was born Hillary Hayward-Thomas, only later in life adopting the name she goes by today. Her parents, Kathryn Hayward and David Thomas Jr., had her on January 6, 1984, in Boston, Massachusetts. Hilaria is 26 years younger than her husband, having turned 40 in January 2024.\n\nWith her latest post on Instagram, as seen above, Hilaria openly expressed her love and support for her husband of 12 years. She also remarks on how grateful she is for all those online who have made her Instagram page into a \"supportive community,\" during what is surely being a very uncertain time for their family.", "source": {"uri": "wegotthiscovered.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "We Got This Covered"}, "authors": [{"uri": "margarida_bastos@wegotthiscovered.com", "name": "Margarida Bastos", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alec_Baldwin", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alec Baldwin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinematographer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cinematographer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Film producer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halyna_Hutchins", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Halyna Hutchins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilaria_Baldwin", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hilaria Baldwin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Basinger", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kim Basinger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Island", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Long Island"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Long Island"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hayward,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hayward, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hayward, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Grief,_Loss_and_Bereavement", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Grief, Loss and Bereavement", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Design-sem-nome-67.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719280", "eventUri": "eng-9719280", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2012-06-30", "textStart": 734, "textEnd": 747}, {"amb": false, "date": "1995-10-", "textStart": 1022, "textEnd": 1034}], "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

Jury selection was scheduled to begin in Baldwin's trial on charges related to the 2021 shooting death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins on the set of Baldwin's Western film \"Rust.\"\n\nThe couple pulled up in separate black SUVs, which were quickly surrounded by the media, the New York Post reported. The 66-year-old \"30 Rock\" star, dressed in a dark suit and wearing sunglasses, was seen on video, stepping out of the second SUV and hurrying to help his influencer wife out of the first vehicle, the Post said.\n\nHilaria Baldwin, dressed in a tan pantsuit and large sunglasses, helped one of their children out of the vehicle and directed the child to a stroller, while Baldwin briefly talked to his child and helped his wife unload one of her bags, the Post said. It appears that the child was their youngest, Ilaria, who is 19 months old.\n\nWhen the girl didn't seem inclined to get into the stroller, Hilaria Baldwin picked her up and handed her off to someone, presumably to one of the couple's several reported nannies.\n\nThe actor then walked ahead of his wife, joining his attorneys inside as he dodged reporters' questions, the New York Post said. But video also captured his daughter crying, as she was held by the nanny and her mother turned to make her way into the courtroom, holding a cup of coffee.\n\nThe Associated Press reported that Hilaria Baldwin took a seat in the back of the courtroom with Baldwin's younger brother, \"The Usual Suspects\" actor Stephen Baldwin.\n\nIt appears that Hilaria Baldwin didn't bring the little girl into the courtroom with her. Critics of the Baldwins, who have accused the couple of exploiting their children on social media and, now, in an upcoming reality TV show, speculate that the one-time yoga teacher might have enjoyed the opportunity to bring one of more of her children into the courtroom. Among other things, it could be her way of generating sympathy for her husband, as he faces trial in the killing of 42-year-old Hutchins, whose death left her own young son without a mother.\n\nLast month, when Alec and Hilaria Baldwin announced their reality TV deal with TLC, high-profile attorney Gloria Allred, who is representing Hutchins' family in a wrongful death lawsuit against the actor, slammed the timing of the news. Allred accused Baldwin of engaging in a \"cynical public relations move\" ahead of the trial.\n\n\"This appears to me to be a calculated and cynical public relations move to try to influence the jury pool in New Mexico to think of him as a sympathetic family man rather than as the killer of Halyna Hutchins,\" Allred told TMZ.\n\nEven though Hilaria Baldwin didn't bring their daughter into the courtroom, the little girl was seen by plenty of photographers, who snapped photos of her father talking to her and helping her mother set up the stroller.\n\nIt's possible that images of Baldwin interacting with his little girl outside the courtroom will make its way into their their reality show, or into two documentaries about the \"Rust\" case that are currently in production. The Hollywood Reporter said that two sets of filmmakers are working on projects with potentially competing storylines about the still-unfolding tragedy involving Hutchins' death.\n\nMeanwhile, People magazine reported that Baldwin intended to travel to Santa Fe alone for the trial, but his wife and family wanted to be \"by his side as the proceedings get underway.\" The Baldwins recently celebrated their 12th anniversary with the veteran film and TV star posting photos on Instagram of their wedding and of the two of them cuddling. \"In spite of some tough times for me, I wouldn't trade any of it,\" Baldwin captioned the photos. Together, they share seven children, including Carmen, 10, Rafael, 8, Leonardo, 7, Romeo, 5, Eduardo, 3, Mar\u00eda, 3, and Ilaria.\n\nIt's not known if all seven children have traveled to Santa Fe to be with their father during his trial -- and were perhaps staying Tuesday at wherever the Baldwins have established themselves in New Mexico.\n\nIt's also not known if any of the other children will make brief appearances at the courthouse -- perhaps to be handed off to nannies like Ilaria. What's also a mystery is where the presumed nanny took Ilaria while her parents were in the courtroom. Anyone who's had business in courthouses knows that their hallways, offices and courtrooms are not welcoming places for young children and families. So, it's a wonder why Alec and Hilaria Baldwin chose to bring their daughter to the courthouse. However, given her young age, they may have wanted her close so they could check on her during courtroom breaks.\n\nAt the end of Tuesday, 12 jurors were selected, along with four alternates, KOAT 7 News reported. The jurors are tasked with deciding whether Baldwin committed involuntary manslaughter when, during a rehearsal for \"Rust,\" a revolver went off while the actor was pointing it at Hutchins. For reasons that are still unknown, a live round had made its way into the revolver. It killed Hutchins and wounded director Joel Souza.\n\nBaldwin has said in media interviews and to investigators that he thought the gun held no live rounds and was safe to use, while he has insisted he didn't pull the trigger.

They're not cardinal rules on a movie set,\" said Spiro.\n\n\"You've all seen gunfights in movies,\" he told the jury, citing classics like \"Platoon,\" \"Apocalypse Now\" and \"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.\"\n\n\"The reason that can happen is because safety is ensured before the actor\" is handed the weapon, he said.\n\nIn a 2021 television interview, Baldwin said he did not pull the trigger.\n\nOn Wednesday, Spiro appeared to partly row back on that claim, while maintaining his client's innocence.\n\n\"On a movie set, you're allowed to pull the trigger,\" he told the jury.\n\n\"So even if he intentionally pulled the trigger... that doesn't make him guilty of homicide.\"\n\n- 'Live bullet' -\n\nHutchins, the victim, was originally from Ukraine, and her career as a Hollywood cinematographer was thriving when she was killed at the age of 42.\n\nThe tragedy occurred during a rehearsal in a small chapel on the Bonanza Creek Ranch, a historic location for Western movies, midway through the filming of \"Rust.\"\n\nBaldwin was practicing a scene in which his outlaw character, trapped by two marshals, brandishes his Colt six-shooter.\n\nFBI testing found the revolver could not have fired without its trigger being pulled and prosecutors will present witnesses, including the gun's manufacturer, to support that finding.\n\nHowever, the weapon was damaged during testing. Spiro suggested that could have been deliberate, to prevent the report's findings being disproved.\n\nBut he focused blame on the movie's safety officials, including armorer Hannah Gutierrez, for allowing a live bullet to be brought on set.\n\n\"That live bullet is the key,\" said Spiro.\n\nGutierrez was convicted by the same court this year and is serving an 18-month sentence.\n\n- Harrowing video -\n\nWitnesses called Wednesday included police officers who arrived early to the scene of the tragedy.\n\nThe court saw footage from their lapel cameras, including harrowing video of some of Hutchins's final moments.\n\nBaldwin watched with his arms crossed, fidgeting in his seat and occasionally glancing at the jury.\n\nIt is not known if Baldwin will take the stand in his defense. Legal experts say it would be a risky move, exposing the allegedly temperamental actor to hostile cross-examination.\n\nThe trial is scheduled to conclude Friday of next week, with jury deliberations to follow.", "source": {"uri": "france24.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "France 24"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alec_Baldwin", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alec Baldwin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manslaughter", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manslaughter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearm", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Firearm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinal_(Catholic_Church)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cardinal (Catholic Church)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prop", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halyna_Hutchins", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Halyna Hutchins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadly_weapon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Deadly weapon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movie_star", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Movie star"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_(genre)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Western (genre)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinematographer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cinematographer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolver", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Revolver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cinema of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Fe,_New_Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Santa Fe, New Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Santa Fe, New Mexico"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butch_Cassidy", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Butch Cassidy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shootout", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shootout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sundance_Kid", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sundance Kid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apocalypse", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apocalypse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Classics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/30_Rock", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "30 Rock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay-Z", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jay-Z"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Television comedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonanza_City,_New_Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bonanza City, New Mexico"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colt's_Manufacturing_Company", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Colt's Manufacturing Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outlaw", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Outlaw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marshal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tragedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gun_Control", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gun Control", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Guns", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Guns", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Trivia", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Trivia", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Homemade", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Homemade", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://s.france24.com/media/display/5d2dfb4e-3f37-11ef-b09f-005056a90284/000_363G7NB.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719280", "eventUri": "eng-9719280", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.5215686274509803, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

Alec, 66, has pleaded not guilty to involuntary manslaughter following the fatal 2021 shooting of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins while filming western film Rust.\n\nAs Alec sat in the courtroom, Hilaria, 40, and Stephen, 58, could be seen in the row behind the 30 Rock alum and his attorneys. At one point, Alec appeared to whisper in his brother's ear before taking a seat.\n\nHilaria, who shares seven children with Alec, also supported her husband. In one photo, she placed her hands on either side of his face to presumably whisper in his ear.\n\nIn October 2021, a prop gun held by Alec fired a single round that injured Rust director Joel Souza and killed Hutchins, who was 42 when she died.\n\n\"The trigger wasn't pulled. I didn't pull the trigger,\" Alec said during an interview with ABC News weeks later. \"I would never point a gun at anyone and pull the trigger at them. Never. I have no idea [how a bullet got in there]. Someone put a live bullet in a gun. A bullet that wasn't even supposed to be on the property.\"\n\nHe further said that the accident was the \"worst thing\" that's ever happened to him, denying that he was aware the firearm had a bullet lodged inside.\n\nProsecutors later charged Alec and film armorer Hannah Gutierrez-Reed with two counts each of involuntary manslaughter in January 2023. Gutierrez-Reed, 27, was sentenced in April to 18 months in prison. Alec, for his part, pleaded not guilty to the charges before filing to dismiss the case. His motion was denied last month ahead of the trial start date.\n\nBoth Stephen -- one of Alec's siblings alongside Billy, Daniel, Elizabeth and Jane -- and Hilaria have remained in his corner throughout the ordeal.\n\n\"My heart is with Halyna. Her husband. Her son. Their family and loved ones. And my Alec,\" Hilaria previously wrote via Instagram in October 2021. \"It's said, 'There are no words' because it's impossible to express the shock and heartache of such a tragic accident. Heartbreak. Loss. Support.\"\n\n\"Asking for your prayers tonight friends,\" Stephen wrote. \"Not much can be said other than please pray for all involved in the wake of this tragic accident thank you.\"", "source": {"uri": "usmagazine.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Us Weekly"}, "authors": [{"uri": "miranda_siwak@usmagazine.com", "name": "Miranda Siwak", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halyna_Hutchins", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Halyna Hutchins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_(genre)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Western (genre)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinematographer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cinematographer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/30_Rock", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "30 Rock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manslaughter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manslaughter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plea", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Plea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Fe,_New_Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Santa Fe, New Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Santa Fe, New Mexico"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prop_gun", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prop gun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Souza", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joel Souza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ABC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weapons_master", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Weapons master"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Alec-Baldwin-Gets-Court-Support-From-Wife-Hilaria-Brother-Stephen-During-Rust-Manslaughter-Trial-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C27px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&quality=86&strip=all", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719280", "eventUri": "eng-9719280", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-10", "textStart": 36, "textEnd": 43}], "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

(AP) A defense attorney told jurors Wednesday that the shooting death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins was an unspeakable tragedy, but that Alec Baldwin he didn't commit any crime; he was an actor, he was acting.\n\nBaldwin's attorney, Alex Spiro, stressed in his opening statement in a Santa Fe, New Mexico, courtroom that Baldwin, who is on trial for involuntary manslaughter, did exactly what actors always do on the set of the movie Rust, where Hutchins was killed in October 2021.\n\nI don't need to tell you more because you've all seen shootouts in movies, Spiro said.\n\nSpecial Prosecutor Erlinda Ocampo Johnson said in her opening statement that before the shooting, Baldwin ignored security checks and handled a revolver recklessly.\n\nThe evidence will show that someone who played pretend with a real gun and violated cardinal rules of firearm safety is the defendant, Alexander Baldwin, Ocampo Johnson said.\n\nSpiro responded that these cardinal rules are not cardinal rules on a film set.\n\nOn a film set, safety precautions must be taken before a weapon is placed in an actor's hand, Spiro told the jury.\n\nThe first witness to testify was the first law enforcement officer to arrive at the Bonanza Creek Ranch after the shooting. Video played in the courtroom by the body camera of then-Santa Fe County Sheriff's Deputy Nicholas LeFleur captured the frantic efforts to save Hutchins, who appeared unconscious as several people tended to her and gave her an oxygen mask. In the courtroom, Baldwin stared somberly at the screen as the video played.\n\nLater in the video, LeFleur can be seen telling Baldwin not to talk to other potential witnesses, but Baldwin does so repeatedly.\n\nWhen Special Prosecutor Kari Morrissey asked if the deputy handled the situation ideally, he replied, \"Probably not. But that's what happened.\"\n\nSpiro tried to establish that neither LeFleur nor the trial's second witness, former sheriff Lt. Tim Benavidez, considered the scene to be a major crime. Benavidez, who recovered the gun after the shooting, acknowledged that he handled it carefully, as much for safety reasons as for anything else, but that he did not wear gloves or take meticulous forensic precautions as might be required in a homicide investigation.\n\nIn her opening statement, Ocampo Johnson recounted to jurors the events leading up to Hutchins' death. She said that on that day, Baldwin refused several opportunities to undergo standard security checks with the gunsmith. Hannah Gutierrez-Reed Before the rehearsal at the small church about 20 miles from the courthouse where Hutchins, a dynamic 42-year-old rising star, was killed, she said Baldwin had instead done his own thing.\n\nHe cocks the hammer, points it directly at Miss Hutchins and fires that gun, sending that live round directly into Miss Hutchins' body, Ocampo Johnson said.\n\nDuring the presentation, Baldwin looked down at a notepad, away from the jury. He watched Spiro intently during the opening. His wife Hilaria Baldwin, his younger brother Stephen Baldwin and his older sister Elizabeth Keuchler, who occasionally wiped away tears, were among the family and friends seated behind him.\n\nTHE 16 jurors Eleven women and five men come from an area where gun ownership and safety are high, due to wilderness hunting. Four of the jurors will be considered alternates while the other 12 will deliberate once they receive the case.\n\nHutchins' Death and the injury of director Joel Souza nearly three years ago sent shockwaves through the film industry and led to a felony charge against Baldwin, 66, that could carry up to 18 months in prison.\n\n\"It killed an extraordinary person,\" Spiro said. \"It hurt another person and it changed lives forever.\"\n\nBaldwin claimed the shot was fired accidentally after he followed instructions to point the gun at Hutchins, who was behind the camera. Unaware that the gun was loaded with a live round, he said he pulled the hammer, not the trigger, and the shot was fired.\n\nNo one saw him intentionally pull the trigger, Spiro said.\n\nBut he added that even if Baldwin had done it, it would not have been involuntary manslaughter.\n\n\"On a movie set, you have the right to pull the trigger,\" Spiro said, adding that doesn't make it homicide.\n\nThe attorney stressed that the responsibility for safety lies with the film's armorer, Gutierrez-Reed, who has already been convicted of involuntary manslaughter, and assistant director David Halls, who pleaded not guilty to negligent use of a deadly weapon in exchange for his testimony.\n\nBaldwin had been told he had a cold weapon before he received the revolver, not knowing it had a live bullet in it.\n\nThe gun was checked and rechecked by the people assigned to make sure it was safe, Spiro said. He did not tamper with it, did not load it himself and did not leave it unattended.\n\nIn recent years, Spiro has become one of the most sought-after defense attorneys in the country. His clients include Elon Musk, New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft and Megan Thee Stallion.\n\nBaldwin the star of Beetlejuice, Glengarry, Glen Ross and 30 Rock has been a household name as an actor and public figure for over three decades.\n\nSpiro said in concluding his opening remarks that witnesses will testify that no actor in the story intercepted a live bullet from a fake gun.\n\nNo one could have imagined or expected an actor to do such a thing, the lawyer said.\n\nTestimony at trial will focus on the mechanism of the gun and whether it could have fired without having to pull the trigger. Prosecutors say that was not possible.\n\nThe gun the defendant requested to be assigned worked perfectly well as designed, Ocampo Johnson said.\n\nAttorney Gloria Allred sat in the front row of the courtroom audience, recalling Baldwin's other legal troubles. Allred represents Rust script supervisor Mamie Mitchell and Hutchins' sister and parents in a lawsuit civil lawsuit against Baldwin and other producers.\n\nAllred said that from his observations in court, the jury appeared captivated by the testimony and evidence, including the police wrist-camera video.\n\n___ For more information on the Alec Baldwin manslaughter trial, visit:

Hutchins was killed and the director Joel Souza was injured after a weapon that Baldwin was holding - that, unbeknown to anyone on set, contained live ammunition - fired a single bullet.\n\nThe incident, the first shooting death on a Hollywood set since 1993, sent shockwaves through the industry and the trial is being closely followed by media outlets from around the world.\n\nBaldwin has denied pulling the trigger, but prosecutors said that evidence shows he did so and that he violated \"cardinal rules of firearm safety\" while on set, and repeatedly had his finger on the hammer and trigger, and pointed it at people while filming.\n\nIn opening statements and in testimony from witnesses, prosecutors sought to portray an unsafe workplace on a tight budget with a lead actor who acted recklessly and placed others in danger.\n\n\"That gun the defendant had asked to be assigned worked perfectly fine, as it was designed,\" prosecutor Erlinda Johnson said. \"He pointed the gun at another human being, cocked the gun and pulled that trigger in reckless disregard for Ms Hutchins' safety.\"\n\nBaldwin's defense team, however, cast the blame on the film's armorer and first assistant director, who were responsible for checking the gun. Baldwin was focused on his job on set - acting - and the people who were supposed to ensure the safety of the weapon failed to do so, defense attorney Alex Spiro told the jury on Wednesday.\n\n\"The evidence will show that on a movie set, safety has to occur before the gun is placed in an actor's hands,\" he said.\n\nBaldwin has long denied pulling the trigger, but even if he did so, Spiro said, he would not be guilty of a crime. \"On a movie set you're allowed to pull the trigger, so even if he intentionally pulled the trigger, as prosecutors said, that doesn't mean he committed a homicide.\"\n\nThe jury this week has heard from law enforcement who first responded to the incident and a crime scene technician who testified she found several live rounds of ammunition on scene.\n\nBaldwin faces up to 18 months in prison if convicted.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dani_anguiano@theguardian.com", "name": "Dani Anguiano", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinematographer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cinematographer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manslaughter", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manslaughter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Mexico"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood,_Los_Angeles", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hollywood, Los Angeles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halyna_Hutchins", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Halyna Hutchins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonanza_City,_New_Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bonanza City, New Mexico"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Medic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alec_Baldwin", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alec Baldwin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheriff", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sheriff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Souza", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joel Souza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opening_statement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Opening statement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammunition", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ammunition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearm", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Firearm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_defense_lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Criminal defense lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armourer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Armourer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assistant_director", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assistant director"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_scene", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Crime scene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homicide", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Homicide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defendant", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Defendant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gun_Control", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gun Control", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a6641b141a86fb5c2dd009a1026ec72c0a8e38b8/0_176_5318_3192/master/5318.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=471d98d3ca122e231d5056340c0caac6", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719280", "eventUri": "eng-9719280", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3411764705882353, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

Bodycam footage shown in the courtroom captured the frantic efforts to save Hutchins.\n\nSpiro tried to establish that neither LeFleur, nor the trial's second witness, former sheriff's Lt. Tim Benavidez, treated the scene as a place where a major crime had occurred, according to The Associated Press.\n\nEarlier Wednesday, prosecutor Erlinda Johnson delivered the opening statement for the prosecution, telling jurors that a prop gun \"is a real gun\" and alleging that Baldwin requested to be assigned the biggest gun available. Johnson said Baldwin mishandled the gun on set, such as using it as a pointer.\n\n\"The evidence will show that someone who played make-believe with a real gun, and violated the cardinal rules of firearm safety, is the defendant, Alexander Baldwin,\" Johnson said.\n\nDuring opening statements, Baldwin listened intently, taking notes as his family looked on.\n\n\"Movie set safety rules require actors, like the defendant, to never point a firearm at another person,\" Johnson said.\n\nThroughout Johnson's opening statement, the prosecution played photos from the set, including photos of Hutchins and the church where the shooting took place behind her, Baldwin in costume, the church surrounded with crime scene tape and of emergency personnel working.\n\nAlex Spiro then began the defense's opening statement, telling the jury that critical safety issues on the set were not Baldwin's fault -- that safety checks should be performed before a gun goes into an actor's hand.\n\n\"It was just a prop, the gun has to be safe before it gets into the actor's hands,\" Spiro said.\n\nThe defense played scenes during the opening statement that included the director's comments to Baldwin to repeat the scene, which Spiro said indicated no one thought there was any danger from the gun.\n\n\"The prop gun was placed into Mr. Baldwin's hands, and 'cold gun,' was announced,\" Spiro said.\n\nJury selection Tuesday was marked by delays, with the questioning of the 70 potential jurors starting several hours later than expected. But by the end of the day, that pool had been winnowed to 16 jurors, four of whom are alternates. The 11 women and five men seated will hear the case over the coming weeks and decide whether to convict the 66-year-old actor.\n\nAround 2 p.m. local time on Oct. 21, 2021, a prop firearm held by Baldwin went off, killing Hutchins and wounding director Joel Souza during a rehearsal in a small church on the set. Baldwin, the Western's star and coproducer, has said he pulled back the Colt .45's hammer, but did not pull the trigger.\n\nAuthorities were called to the set at the Bonanza Creek Ranch and Hutchins was taken to the University of New Mexico Hospital in Albuquerque via helicopter, where she died of her injuries, according to the sheriff's office at the time.\n\nAuthorities who searched the set recovered live ammunition. The New Mexico Office of the Medical Investigator determined in 2022 that the incident was an accident.\n\nAlec Baldwin faces a charge of involuntary manslaughter, a felony. If convicted, he could face up to a year and a half in prison. He has pleaded not guilty.\n\nHe was initially charged in January 2023 but prosecutors dismissed those counts three months later. Prosecutors again indicted Baldwin on a charge of involuntary manslaughter in January.\n\nBaldwin asked for the charge to be dismissed, but the judge overseeing the case rejected his request.\n\nJudge Mary Marlowe Sommer is presiding over the trial in New Mexico's First District Court, in Santa Fe.\n\nThe judge set the trial calendar to run from July 9-19. Jury selection was completed Tuesday and opening statements started on Wednesday. Courtroom proceedings are expected to conclude by July 19, after which the case will go to the jury for deliberations.\n\nWhile cameras were not allowed in the courtroom during jury selection, the trial is being livestreamed.\n\nBaldwin's attorneys have not said whether the actor will take the stand in his own defense. The actor has been in court for proceedings and is expected to attend every day.\n\nThe state's witness list contains 44 names, while the defense lists 14 individuals as potential witnesses.\n\nWhile prosecutors wanted to call the film's armorer, Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, who has already been convicted of involuntary manslaughter in the case, the judge ruled in June she could not be compelled to testify against Baldwin though she remains on the prosecution's list of potential witnesses. She did not testify in her own defense.\n\nOn the prosecution's list of dozens of potential witnesses is Joel Souza, the film's director who was also wounded in the shooting, along with several people who also also testified at Gutierrez-Reed's trial, such as Seth Kenney, who owned the prop weapons company that supplied the film's ammunition; Wyatt Mortenson, a stuntman on the film; and Gabrielle Pickle, a line producer.\n\nThe defense's shorter list of potential witnesses includes David Halls, assistant director and safety coordinator; Ryan Winterstern, a producer who also testified in Gutierrez-Reed's trial; and other members of the crew, among others.\n\nThe Los Angeles-based Hutchins, 42, was a self-described \"restless dreamer\" and \"adrenaline junkie\" who grew up on a remote Soviet military base. The Ukranian-born cinematographer earned a degree in International Journalism from Kyiv National University and graduated from the American Film Institute conservatory. Widely regarded as a rising star, her work included \"Archenemy,\" starring Joe Manganiello, \"Blindfire\" and \"Darlin',\" which premiered at the SXSW film festival in 2019.\n\nBaldwin announced in 2022 he had settled a wrongful death lawsuit with Hutchins' family: her husband, Matthew Hutchins, and their son, Andros.\n\nHannah Gutierrez-Reed, the armorer who oversaw firearms on the set, was also charged with involuntary manslaughter. Though she pleaded not guilty, she was convicted in March and sentenced to 18 months behind bars after a trial overseen by the same judge overseeing Baldwin's case. Gutierrez-Reed was acquitted on a charge of tampering with evidence.\n\nEarlier, Halls pleaded no contest to unsafe handling of a firearm. Halls, who agreed to cooperate in the shooting investigation, received a suspended sentence of six months probation.\n\nThe production company overseeing the movie was fined $136,000, the maximum under state law, by New Mexico's Occupational Health and Safety Bureau over the incident.", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Jurors saw four witnesses take the stand, heard the 911 call after the shooting and watched body camera footage of the response.\n\nThe trial is scheduled to resume for a second day Thursday at 10:30 a.m. EDT.\n\nOn Wednesday, the prosecution called witness Santa Fe Police officer Nicholas Lefleur, who was the first law enforcement officer at the scene to respond to the 911 call after the Rust movie set shooting.\n\nLefleur testified that he told Baldwin to stop talking as he was detained over concerns that the witnesses could possibly taint their statements about what happened on the set.\n\nLefleur's body camera video of the response was then shown to jurors. The video showed first responders wheeling Halyna Hutchins out of the movie set's church on a stretcher and loading her into an ambulance. Hutchins later died of her injuries. The video then shows director Joel Souza, who was injured in the shooting, being wheeled off the set.\n\n\"I was holding the gun, yeah,\" Baldwin is seen telling Lefleur as armorer Hannah Gutierrez Reed can be seen crying as she identifies rounds that were used.\n\nOn cross examination, the defense played the 911 call. A script supervisor can be heard saying, \"we've had two people accidentally shot on a movie set by a prop gun. We need help immediately.\"\n\nThe defense also asked Lefleur about the mistakes he made that day and questioned whether Baldwin defied his order not to speak to others.\n\n\"He wasn't really disobeying police orders was he, sir?\" Defense attorney Alex Spiro asked.\n\n\"To an extent, yes,\" LeFleur responded.\n\nSpecial Prosecutor Erlinda Ocampo Johnson called a second witness, Timoteo Benavidez, who is a retired lieutenant with the Santa Fe County Sheriff's Office. He testified that he secured the gun from the film's armorer and ensured there were no more rounds before placing it in his patrol car.\n\nDetective Joseph Lujan testified for the prosecution about how Souza was treated for his injury.\n\nThe fourth witness was a crime scene tech with the Santa Fe County Sheriff's Office, Marissa Poppell, who testified Wednesday about taking photographs and collecting evidence inside the church set, including Baldwin's holster, which held one live round of ammunition.\n\nEarlier Wednesday, Judge Mary Marlow Sommer opened the trial in Santa Fe with a reading of Baldwin's grand jury indictment and instructions to the jury, which was selected Tuesday.\n\nAlong with the actor's wife, Hilaria, Baldwin's brother Stephen Baldwin was also in the New Mexico courtroom in a show of support.\n\n\"The trial is expected to last eight days,\" the judge told jurors before opening statements began.\n\n\"When someone plays make believe with a real gun in a real-life workplace and while playing make believe with that gun, violates the cardinal rules of firearm safety, people's lives are endangered, and someone could be killed,\" Johnson said in her opening statement. \"Ladies and gentlemen, that's what this case is about. It's simple. It's straightforward.\"\n\nJohnson told the jury Baldwin allegedly asked to be given the \"biggest gun\" available. The gun, she told jurors, was sold to the film crew in \"perfect\" working order, and that Baldwin routinely failed to do safety checks and, likewise, failed to do so the day Hutchins was fatally shot in 2021 on the Rust set.\n\n\"He pointed the gun at another human being, cocked the hammer and pulled that trigger, in reckless disregard for Ms. Hutchins' safety,\" Johnson said. \"The only true and just verdict in this case, so that true justice can be served, is a verdict of guilty to involuntary manslaughter.\"\n\nBaldwin, who was both acting in and producing the movie, faces charges stemming from the incident in which he was rehearsing a scene with a revolver when the gun discharged a live bullet, killing Hutchins and injuring Souza. If convicted, Baldwin faces up to 18 months in prison.\n\n\"You will learn that one of the rounds in that revolver was a real round, and the evidence will show that Ms. Gutierrez then handed the gun to the defendant,\" Johnson said. \"And what you will learn is that, once again, the defendant failed to do a gun safety check with this armorer.\"\n\nBaldwin was practicing what's known as a cross-draw in a church on the movie set when the gun fired a live round, striking Hutchins and Souza. The gun in question was supposed to have been loaded with blanks, but a live round was in the gun.\n\nBaldwin has maintained that he did not pull the trigger when the gun went off and denied responsibility for Hutchins' death on the grounds that there were supposed to be no live rounds on set, while prosecutors argued Baldwin disregarded the risks by declining to participate in the armorer's safety check and that he handled the gun in a way that the rehearsal did not require.\n\n\"You'll see the video footage of the multiple occasions during which the defendant used this firearm on the set, and each time he fired it, it was working just fine,\" the prosecution told the jury. \"And in fact, you'll hear evidence that the defendant himself admitted in December of 2021 that this gun didn't have any mechanical problems.\"\n\nAn independent report last year insisted it was nearly impossible for the weapon to fire without the trigger being pulled. That report hinted that Baldwin possibly could face manslaughter charges.\n\nMeanwhile, Baldwin's defense tried to shift the focus as to how a live bullet got into the gun in the first place when it was not supposed to be there, saying Baldwin committed no crime.\n\n\"This was an unspeakable tragedy, but Alec Baldwin committed no crime,\" Spiro said. \"He was an actor, acting. Playing the role of Harland Rust. An actor playing a character can act in ways that are lethal, that just aren't lethal on a movie set.\"\n\nSpiro placed blame on the armorer and David Halls, the first assistant director of Rust at the time, who admitted that he was \"negligent\" by failing to check safety measures as Baldwin's defense the actor could not have been responsible for Hutchins' death, as actors are expected to rely on professionals to ensure the safe handling of weapons on set.\n\n\"Everybody on a movie set has a role,\" Spiro told the court Wednesday. \"The armorer armors. The director directs. The actor acts. They work in harmony, but they have a division of responsibility.\"\n\nHe pointed out how on a movie set, \"you're allowed to pull the trigger,\" but that even if Baldwin did intentionally pull the trigger as he claims he did not, \"that doesn't make him guilty of homicide.\"\n\n\"He did not know, or have any reason to know, that gun was loaded with a live bullet,\" Spiro told the jury.\n\nThis trial begins as it was recently announced the 66-year-old actor and his wife landed their own TLC reality show, The Baldwins, expected to premiere next year as the trial would have likely been over for several months by that point.\n\nThe TLC announcement followed the news how the judge presiding over the involuntary manslaughter case had denied Baldwin's request to dismiss the charge.",

Gutierrez-Reed was convicted of involuntary manslaughter and sentenced to 18 months' imprisonment earlier this year.\n\nThe case stems from the 2021 on-set shooting of Hutchins, who died at the hospital after being shot with a .45-caliber revolver held by Baldwin in a small church on Bonanza Creek Ranch, a popular filming location near Santa Fe, during a rehearsal.\n\nBaldwin, who has pleaded not guilty, has said he pulled the hammer but did not pull the trigger.\n\nThursday's testimony is expected to begin with the defense cross-examination of Marissa Poppell, a crime scene technician who photographed evidence, the fourth law enforcement witness called by prosecutors as they argue the movie set was an unsafe work environment where safety rules were ignored, including and encouraged by Baldwin. The defense argued in its opening statement that Baldwin was on-set as an actor, and it was the armorer who loaded the gun, not Baldwin.\n\nBaldwin, who was joined in the courtroom Wednesday by his wife, Hilaria Baldwin; his brother, actor Stephen Baldwin; and his sister Beth Keuchler, is expected to be in the courtroom each day of the trial, which is scheduled through July 19.

Video shown in the courtroom from the body camera of Nicholas LeFleur, then a Santa Fe county sheriff's deputy, captured the frantic efforts to save Hutchins, who looked unconscious as several people attended to her and gave her an oxygen mask. In the courtroom, Baldwin looked at the screen somberly as it played.\n\nLater in the video, LeFleur can be seen telling Baldwin not to speak to the other potential witnesses, but Baldwin repeatedly does.\n\nWhen special prosecutor Kari Morrissey asked whether the sheriff's deputy handled the situation ideally he responded, \"Probably not. But it's what happened.\"\n\nRELATED STORY | Judge decides Alec Baldwin's role as co-producer not relevant to trial over fatal 2021 set shooting\n\nSpiro tried to establish that neither LeFleur nor the trial's second witness, former sheriff's Lt. Tim Benavidez, treated the scene as a place where a major crime had occurred. Benavidez, who collected the revolver after the shooting, acknowledged that he was careful with it as much for safety reasons as anything else, but did not wear gloves or take meticulous forensic precautions as he might do for a homicide investigation.\n\nOcampo Johnson in her opening walked the jurors through the events leading up to Hutchins' death. She said on that day, Baldwin declined multiple opportunities for standard safety checks with armorer Hannah Gutierrez-Reed before the rehearsal in the small church about 20 miles (32 kilometers) from the courthouse where Hutchins, \"a vibrant 42-year-old rising star,\" was killed. She said Baldwin instead \"did his own thing.\"\n\n\"He cocks the hammer, points it straight at Miss Hutchins, and fires that gun, sending that live bullet right into Miss Hutchins' body,\" said Ocampo Johnson.\n\nDuring the presentation, Baldwin trained his eyes downward on a notepad, away from the jury. He watched Spiro intently during his opening. His wife Hilaria Baldwin, younger brother Stephen Baldwin and older sister Elizabeth Keuchler -- who wiped away tears at times -- were among the family and friends sitting behind him.\n\nThe 16 jurors -- 11 women and five men -- come from a region with strong currents of gun ownership and safety informed by backcountry hunting. Four of the jurors will be deemed alternates while the other 12 deliberate once they get the case.\n\nHutchins' death and the wounding of director Joel Souza nearly three years ago sent shock waves through the film industry and led to one felony charge against Baldwin, 66, that could result in up to 18 months in prison.\n\n\"It killed an amazing person,\" Spiro said. \"It wounded another, and it changed lives forever.\"\n\nBaldwin has claimed the gun fired accidentally after he followed instructions to point it toward Hutchins, who was behind the camera. Unaware that it was loaded with a live round, he said he pulled back the hammer -- not the trigger -- and it fired.\n\n\"No one saw him intentionally pull the trigger,\" Spiro said.\n\nBut he said even if Baldwin had pulled it, it still would not have been manslaughter.\n\n\"On a movie set, you're allowed to pull that trigger,\" Spiro said, adding, \"that doesn't make it a homicide.\"\n\nRELATED STORY | New Mexico judge weighs whether to compel testimony from 'Rust' movie armorer in Alec Baldwin trial\n\nThe lawyer emphasized that the responsibility for safety lay with the film's armorer, Gutierrez-Reed, who has already been convicted of involuntary manslaughter, and assistant director David Halls, who pleaded no contest to negligent use of a deadly weapon in exchange for his testimony.\n\nBaldwin had been told \"cold gun\" before getting the revolver, not knowing there was a live round in it.\n\n\"It had been checked and double checked by those responsible for ensuring the gun was safe,\" Spiro said. \"He did not tamper with, it he did not load it himself. He did not leave it unattended.\"\n\nSpiro has in recent years become one of the most sought-after defense attorneys in the country. His clients have included Elon Musk, New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft, and Megan Thee Stallion.\n\nBaldwin -- the star of \"Beetlejuice,\" \"Glengarry Glen Ross\" and \"30 Rock\" -- has been a household name as an actor and public personality for more than three decades.\n\nSpiro said in concluding his opening that witnesses will attest that \"no actor in history\" has \"intercepted a live bullet from a prop gun.\"\n\n\"No one could have imagined or expected an actor to do that,\" the lawyer said.\n\nTestimony at trial will delve into the mechanics of the weapon and whether it could have fired without a trigger pull. Prosecutors say it couldn't have.\n\n\"That gun the defendant had asked to be assigned worked perfectly fine as it was designed,\" Ocampo Johnson said.\n\nAttorney Gloria Allred sat in the front row of the courtroom audience, a reminder of Baldwin's other legal difficulties. Allred is representing \"Rust\" script supervisor Mamie Mitchell and Hutchins' sister and parents in a civil lawsuit against Baldwin and other producers.\n\nAllred said that from her observations in court, the jury appeared to be riveted by testimony and evidence, including the police lapel camera video.", "source": {"uri": "10news.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KGTV"}, "authors": [],

Baldwin was holding a Colt .45 revolver that discharged a live round and killed Hutchins, but he maintains he did not pull the trigger -- a claim state prosecutors contest.\n\nDuring opening statements, Special Prosecutor Erlinda Johnson told jurors Baldwin acted negligently with the gun and failed to perform necessary safety checks with former Rust armorer Hannah Gutierrez-Reed on multiple occasions throughout filming. Just under three months ago, First Judicial District Court Judge Mary Marlowe Sommer gave Gutierrez-Reed the maximum sentence for her negligent behavior in the same incident, which the former armorer filed to appeal in early May.\n\nFurthermore, the special prosecutor noted the actor requested \"the biggest gun available,\" which \"worked perfectly fine\" leading up to the fatal afternoon.\n\n\"When someone plays make believe with a real gun in a real-life workplace, people's lives are in danger and someone could be killed. The evidence will show that the someone who played make believe with a real gun and violated the cardinal rules of firearm safety is the defendant Mr. Baldwin,\" Johnson said. \"The only true verdict that can serve justice in this case is guilty of involuntary manslaughter.\"\n\nIn response, Baldwin defense attorney Alex Spiro told jurors that while the fatal shooting on set was \"an unspeakable tragedy,\" the actor \"committed no crime\" and was simply doing his job.\n\n\"On a movie set, safety has to occur before a gun is placed in an actor's hands. The actor's job is to act and to rehearse,\" Spiro said. \"He's Harland Rust -- he's an outlaw. His mind is somewhere else in the being of another, a century away. He must be able to take that weapon and use it, to wave it and to point it in ways that would be lethal in the real world, but not lethal on a movie set.\"\n\nThe defense added the gun had been checked and cleared that day by others and no one -- especially Baldwin -- could have foreseen live ammunition on set.\n\n\"'Cold gun' doesn't mean no live bullets. There are 100% no live bullets on a movie set -- that's unimaginable. It means it's empty, inert [and] cosmetic,\" Spiro told jurors. \"None of the evidence you'll see speaks to whether Alec knew or should've known live ammunition was in there. He didn't. Nobody did. It was not foreseeable. This was anything other than foreseeable.\"\n\nFollowing opening statements, the state called several former and current staff from the Santa Fe County Sheriff's Department as witnesses, who recounted the day of the shooting and the subsequent investigation.\n\nNicholas Lefleur, the first officer to respond on scene the day of the shooting, fielded questions from attorneys on officers' handling of the call that day. He described an unprecedented situation for officers that made it difficult to separate witnesses.\n\n\"It was a big, old cowboy western-themed town, and there were a bunch of people running everywhere,\" he told Special Prosecutor Kari Morrissey when asked why people were not separated. \"There were more than 100 people there.\"\n\nHe added that his first priority was to \"make sure whoever needs help gets help\" which added to the delay in rounding up those on set. Despite this, he says he told people -- including Baldwin -- to stop talking among themselves to avoid \"tainting each other's memories.\"\n\nThe defense team scrutinized this claim during cross examination, with Spiro noting Lefleur never called out Baldwin when he spoke to others in lapel footage played during his testimony, which Lefleur acknowledged.\n\nBaldwin remained stoic throughout the day, sporting glasses, a gray jacket and a pink shirt. If convicted, he faces up to 18 months in prison.", "source": {"uri": "sfreporter.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Santa Fe Reporter"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opening_statement", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Opening statement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armourer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Armourer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manslaughter", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Manslaughter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halyna_Hutchins", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Halyna Hutchins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colt_.45_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colt .45 (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximate_cause", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Proximate cause"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_construction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Set construction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Marlowe", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Christopher Marlowe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinematographer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cinematographer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolver", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Revolver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Negligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_procedure", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Criminal procedure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alec_Baldwin", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alec Baldwin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Film producer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinal_(Catholic_Church)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cardinal (Catholic Church)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_defense_lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Criminal defense lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outlaw", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Outlaw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tragedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammunition", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ammunition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearm", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Firearm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morrissey", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Morrissey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Fe_County,_New_Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Santa Fe County, New Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Santa Fe County, New Mexico"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gun_Control", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gun Control", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.sfreporter.com/resizer/QpG9Ece7CjJlVfaAdyY0kaBFcYU=/1200x630/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/sfr/5NSFX32EURGFVAMXTCVQM3XRSI.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719280", "eventUri": "eng-9719280", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 168, "relevance": 1}

In October 2021, Baldwin was carrying a prop handgun at an essential rehearsal when it shot a live cartridge, killing Hutchins and injuring the director of the film. Prosecutors reportedly presented him as a \"headstrong\" actor who frequently ignored his responsibilities to ensure gun safety on the movie set, while the defence claimed that the death of the cinematographer was a consequence of other crew members' negligence.\n\nThe actor allegedly \"violated the cardinal rules of firearm safety\" on multiple occasions and pulled the trigger that discharged a live round from a prop gun, according to special prosecutor Erlinda Ocampo Johnson, who made her opening statement to the jury on July 10, reports The Washington Post.\n\n\"When someone plays make-believe with a real gun in a real-life workplace, and while playing make-believe with that gun violates the cardinal rules of firearm safety, people's lives are endangered and someone could be killed,\" Ocampo was quoted by CNN as telling the jurors. She alleged Baldwin had consistently cocked and pointed firearms at individuals on set, had not taken a weapons training class seriously, and had \"requested to be assigned the biggest gun available\" for the Rust scene.\n\nAccording to France 24, Ocampo emphasised that actors must adhere to certain safety regulations, including handling all firearms as if they were loaded, not pointing a handgun at someone else and never pulling the trigger until you're ready to fire.\n\nAdditionally, Ocampo criticised him for neglecting to have armourer Hannah Gutierrez Reed inspect his rifle after she erroneously loaded it with a live round. Variety cited her as stating, \"He pointed the gun at another human being, cocked the hammer and pulled the trigger in reckless disregard for Ms. Hutchins' safety.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Defence lawyer Alex Spiro stated in his opening statement that Baldwin depended on Reed and first assistant director Dave Halls to ensure the pistol was secure and that it was not his duty to inspect it, Variety added.\n\nFollowing the opening arguments, the jury saw police lapel camera footage that was captured just after the incident while Hutchins and the injured director Joel Souza were being attended to by medical personnel, according to the Washington Post. Hutchins, who was at the moment still alive, was surrounded by multiple individuals in one tumultuous scene.\n\nIf found guilty, Baldwin, 66, could face up to 18 months behind bars. Baldwin, who has denied pulling the trigger or knowing why the rifle had live ammo, pledged not guilty to one count of involuntary manslaughter. The trial of Baldwin began on Wednesday, almost three years after Hutchins' unintentional death at a church structure at Bonanza Creek Ranch in October 2021.", "source": {"uri": "news18.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News18"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_safety", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gun safety"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alec_Baldwin", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alec Baldwin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinematographer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cinematographer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prop", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halyna_Hutchins", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Halyna Hutchins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinal_(Catholic_Church)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cardinal (Catholic Church)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opening_statement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Opening statement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartridge_(firearms)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cartridge (firearms)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Negligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manslaughter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manslaughter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearm", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Firearm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handgun", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Handgun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plea", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Plea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rifle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rifle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prop_gun", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prop gun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France_24", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "France 24"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Variety (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Washington Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Souza", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joel Souza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonanza_City,_New_Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bonanza City, New Mexico"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hammer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hammer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pistol", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pistol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gun_Control", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gun Control", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Reloading", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Reloading", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 52}], "image": "https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2024/01/alec-baldwin-reuters-rust-2024-01-43e59972fc107f17b3acc0e37d9429c3-16x9.jpg?impolicy=website&width=1200&height=675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719280", "eventUri": "eng-9719280", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-10", "textStart": 1010, "textEnd": 1017}], "sentiment": -0.3333333333333334, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

(AP) -- Prosecutors sought to cast Alec Baldwin as someone who flouts rules and has little regard for safety at the first day of his New Mexico trial in the shooting of a cinematographer.\n\nSpecial prosecutor Erlinda Ocampo Johnson repeatedly referred to Baldwin playing \"make-believe\" with a revolver on the set of the film \"Rust,\" and said it led to very real danger and the death of Halyna Hutchins, whom she called \"a vibrant 42-year-old rising star.\"\n\nOcampo Johnson told jurors in her opening statement Wednesday that Baldwin \"requested to be assigned the biggest gun available\" and that during a training session for it, he had \"people filming him while he's running around shooting this gun.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...

Sattui Winery sued by former employee alleging wage abuse\n\nThe prosecutor said behind-the-scenes video will show Baldwin casually disregarding basic firearm safety.\n\n\"You will see him using this gun as a pointer to point at people, point at things,\" Ocampo Johnson said. \"You will see him cock the hammer when he is not supposed to cock the hammer, you will see him put his finger on the trigger when his finger's not supposed to be on the trigger.\"\n\nHutchins' death and the wounding of director Joel Souza nearly three years ago sent shock waves through the film industry and led to the felony involuntary manslaughter charge against Baldwin that could result in up to 18 months in prison.\n\nThe trial of the 66-year-old star of \"30 Rock\" and frequent host of \"Saturday Night Live\" continues Thursday with testimony from a crime scene technician with the Santa Fe County Sheriff's Department.\n\nThe beginning of testimony of the technician, Marissa Poppell, allowed jurors to see the revolver and the spent round from the shooting.\n\nBaldwin's lawyer Alex Spiro emphasized in his opening statement that Baldwin did only what actors always do.\n\n\"He must be able to take that weapon and use it in the way that the person he's playing would,\" Spiro told jurors.\n\nThat includes pulling the trigger. Baldwin has said the gun fired accidentally, but Spiro said that it still would not be manslaughter even if he had willfully fired it.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n\"On a movie set, you're allowed to pull that trigger,\" said Spiro.\n\nSpiro called the shooting an \"unspeakable tragedy\" and that an \"amazing person\" dies, but said the responsibility lies with the film's armorer Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, who has already been convicted of involuntary manslaughter, and of assistant director David Halls, who told Baldwin the gun was \"cold.\"\n\n\"It had been checked and double checked by those responsible for ensuring the gun was safe,\" Spiro said. \"He did not tamper with it, he did not load it himself. He did not leave it unattended.\"\n\nThe first witness to take the stand was Nicholas LeFleur, the first law enforcement officer to arrive at the movie set at Bonanza Creek Ranch after the shooting, and his lapel camera video gave jurors a glimpse of the chaotic scene: a grim view of an apparently unconscious Hutchins as LeFleur and others worked to revive her.\n\nLater in the video, LeFleur can be seen telling Baldwin not to speak to the other potential witnesses, but Baldwin repeatedly does.\n\n\"Was Mr. Baldwin supposed to be talking about the incident?\" special prosecutor Kari Morrissey asked him.\n\n\"No ma'am,\" LeFleur replied.\n\n\"Does he appear to be doing it anyway?\" Morrissey asked.\n\n\"Yes, ma'am,\" LeFleur said.\n\nAmong those sitting in the gallery behind Baldwin watching the trial were his wife Hilaria Baldwin, younger brother Stephen Baldwin and older sister Elizabeth Keuchler -- who wiped away tears at times during the proceedings.\n\nDalton reported from Los Angeles.\n\n___ For more coverage of Alec Baldwin's involuntary manslaughter trial, visit: https://apnews.com/hub/alec-baldwin\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Video shown in the courtroom from the body camera of Nicholas LeFleur, then a Santa Fe county sheriff's deputy, captured the frantic efforts to save Hutchins, who looked unconscious as several people attended to her and gave her an oxygen mask. In the courtroom, Baldwin looked at the screen somberly as it played.\n\nLater in the video, LeFleur can be seen telling Baldwin not to speak to the other potential witnesses, but Baldwin repeatedly does.\n\nWhen special prosecutor Kari Morrissey asked whether the sheriff's deputy handled the situation ideally he responded, \"Probably not. But it's what happened.\"\n\nSpiro tried to establish that neither LeFleur nor the trial's second witness, former sheriff's Lt. Tim Benavidez, treated the scene as a place where a major crime had occurred. Benavidez, who collected the revolver after the shooting, acknowledged that he was careful with it as much for safety reasons as anything else, but did not wear gloves or take meticulous forensic precautions as he might be done for a homicide investigation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOcampo Johnson in her opening walked the jurors through the events leading up to Hutchins death. She said on that day, Baldwin declined multiple opportunities for standard safety checks with armorer Hannah Gutierrez-Reed before the rehearsal in the small church about 20 miles (32 kilometers) from the courthouse where Hutchins, \"a vibrant 42-year-old rising star,\" was killed. She said Baldwin instead \"did his own thing.\"\n\n\"He cocks the hammer, points it straight at Miss Hutchins, and fires that gun, sending that live bullet right into Miss Hutchins body,\" said Ocampo Johnson.\n\nDuring the presentation, Baldwin trained his eyes downward on a notepad, away from the jury. He watched Spiro intently during his opening. His wife Hilaria Baldwin, younger brother Stephen Baldwin and older sister Elizabeth Keuchler -- who wiped away tears at times -- were among the family and friends sitting behind him.\n\nThe 16 jurors -- 11 women and five men -- come from a region with strong currents of gun ownership and safety informed by backcountry hunting. Four of the jurors will be deemed alternates while the other 12 deliberate once they get the case.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHutchins' death and the wounding of director Joel Souza nearly three years ago sent shock waves through the film industry and led to one felony charge against Baldwin, 66, that could result in up to 18 months in prison.\n\n\"It killed an amazing person,\" Spiro said. \"It wounded another, and it changed lives forever.\"\n\nBaldwin has claimed the gun fired accidentally after he followed instructions to point it toward Hutchins, who was behind the camera. Unaware that it was loaded with a live round, he said he pulled back the hammer -- not the trigger -- and it fired.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"No one saw him intentionally pull the trigger,\" Spiro said.\n\nBut he said even if Baldwin had pulled it, it still would not have been manslaughter.\n\n\"On a movie set, you're allowed to pull that trigger,\" Spiro said, adding, \"that doesn't make it a homicide.\"\n\nThe lawyer emphasized that the responsibility for safety lay with the film's armorer, Gutierrez-Reed, who has already been convicted of involuntary manslaughter, and assistant director David Halls, who pleaded no contest to negligent use of a deadly weapon in exchange for his testimony.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBaldwin had been told \"cold gun\" before getting the revolver, not knowing there was a live round in it.\n\n\"It had been checked and double checked by those responsible for ensuring the gun was safe,\" Spiro said. \"He did not tamper with it he did not load it himself. He did not leave it unattended.\"\n\nSpiro has in recent years become one of the most sought-after defense attorneys in the country. His clients have included Elon Musk, New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft, and Megan Thee Stallion.\n\nBaldwin -- the star of \"Beetlejuice,\" \"Glengarry Glen Ross\" and \"30 Rock\" -- has been a household name as an actor and public personality for more than three decades.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpiro said in concluding his opening that witnesses will attest that \"no actor in history\" has \"intercepted a live bullet from a prop gun.\"\n\n\"No one could have imagined or expected an actor to do that,\" the lawyer said.\n\nTestimony at trial will delve into the mechanics of the weapon and whether it could have fired without a trigger pull. Prosecutors say it couldn't have.\n\n\"That gun the defendant had asked to be assigned worked perfectly fine as it was designed,\" Ocampo Johnson said.\n\nAttorney Gloria Allred sat in the front row of the courtroom audience, a reminder of Baldwin's other legal difficulties. Allred is representing \"Rust\" script supervisor Mamie Mitchell and Hutchins' sister and parents in a civil lawsuit against Baldwin and other producers.\n\nAllred said that from her observations in court, the jury appeared to be riveted by testimony and evidence including the police lapel camera video.", "source": {"uri": "manilatimes.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Manila times"},

It's now asking $18.9 million after a series of cuts\n\nAlec Baldwin's Hamptons home is still up for sale despite a $10 million price cut as the actor's involuntary manslaughter trial begins.\n\nOn Tuesday, July 9, the soon-to-be reality star, 66, arrived at the First Judicial District Court in Santa Fe, N.M. to begin his criminal trial following the fatal shooting of Halyna Hutchins. The cinematographer was shot on the set of the Western movie Rust in October 2021 after a prop gun discharged while the actor was holding it.\n\nBaldwin has repeatedly insisted that he did not pull the gun's trigger or know that it contained live ammunition. If convicted, he faces up to 18 months in prison.\n\nHe initially listed his East Hampton farmhouse for sale in November 2022 and has reduced the price several times since. A recent New York Times article alleged the cuts are due to uncertainty in his finances amid the legal action.\n\nHowever, a source denied the actor is having money troubles to PEOPLE. \"There is no financial strain. That house has been on the market for two years,\" the insider said on Wednesday, July 10.\n\nRelated: Alec Baldwin Stars in Real Estate Video for Hamptons Mansion as He Relists It with Major Price Cut: WATCH\n\nThe Times cited lost jobs, growing legal expenses and the cost of caring for his seven young children with his wife Hilaria Baldwin, 40, as causes of strain.

Alec is also dad to Ireland, 28, from his previous marriage to ex Kim Basinger.\n\nIn addition to listing their Hamptons home, Alec also made several significant real estate moves in the last few years, per the outlet, including purchasing a $1.75 million farm in Vermont and selling a house in Upstate New York for $530,000.\n\nSince it was first listed in November 2022, the East Hampton property received a series of price cuts and has been taken on and off the market.\n\nIn January 2023, the price was first cut down to $24.9 million, followed by another reduction to $22.5 million in March that same year. The home was taken off the market altogether in September 2023 but it was later re-listed in January 2024 for $18.9.\n\nRelated: Hilaria Baldwin Excited About Reality Show with Husband Alec and Sharing 'Chaotic' and 'Beautiful' Family Life, Sources Say\n\nAs of July 10, the home is still available at the same price, according to the listing, which is held by Scott Bradley and Michael N. Cinque of Saunders & Associates.\n\nRelated: Hilaria Baldwin Supports Husband Alec Baldwin at Court as Jury Selection Begins in His Rust Trial\n\nWhen the home was re-listed in January, Alec recorded a video with the real estate agency in which he gives a tour outside of the property and recalls his favorite things about the 10,000-square-foot home that he purchased in 1996.\n\n\"I fell in love with this place the moment I came here,\" the 30 Rock alum says of the 8-acre plot, adding that \"you just can't get this out here anymore, you can't buy big pieces of land.\"\n\nHe added that he and Hilaria have made changes to the house over the decades, including additions to both the eastern and western sides in 1996 and 2014.\n\nNever miss a story -- sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\n\"I love it in the winter time because it's so peaceful and it's so beautiful,\" he noted, adding that he is \"always happiest when I come here, especially this time of year.\"\n\nThe home was originally built in 1740 and features seven bedrooms and seven full bathrooms.

But not like this.\n\nAlec Baldwin swept into town this week for the start of his involuntary manslaughter trial, and he's not exactly getting a warm welcome from New Mexicans.\n\nA small crowd of local spectators came out to the courthouse as lawyers delivered opening statements. Baldwin, 66, is accused of firing a real gun mistakenly loaded with a live round on the set of the Western \"Rust\" -- killing cinematographer Halyna Hutchins, 42, and wounding director Joel Souza in October 2021.\n\nBackground actor Janelle Rogers and a friend held signs that said on one side, \"Justice for Halyna\" and on the other \"Safety on set! Is a must! No excuses!!\"\n\nRogers, an Albuquerque resident who once appeared on \"Better Call Saul,\" criticized the industry, saying, \"There is no safety on set.\"\n\n\"Safety is a must on set regardless of who you are or where you are,\" Rogers said. \"Halyna Hutchins shouldn't have died.\"\n\nRogers said she has a friend that worked as an extra on \"Rust\" and she believes a lot of people had to have screwed up for the shooting to have been allowed to occur.\n\n\"I blame a lot of people for her death. It's multiple people. Just because you're an actor or not a producer, doesn't mean you're exempt,\" Rogers said.\n\nShe also blasted the \"30 Rock\" star for making a reality TV show \"The Baldwins\" with wife Hilaria Baldwin and his seven kids, which is slated to premiere on TLC next year.\n\n\"It's a joke,\" Rogers said of the show. \"I think he's doing that for a publicity stunt.\"\n\nHilaria and Baldwin brought their baby to court Tuesday for jury selection, but none of there children were present Wednesday.\n\n\"I think it's absolutely grotesque and then he came over here with his wife and baby,\" Rogers said. \"She has no business being here. I think it's a huge publicity stunt promoting him.\"\n\n\"It's egotistical, it's narcissistic. We've noticed that when he played Trump,\" Rogers said, referring to Baldwin's recurring role on \"Saturday Night Live\" parodying the former president.\n\n\"He played that part easy. Why is that? The attitude of 'I'm above everyone else.' Immunity. Exceptions.\"\n\nRachel Jarrell, 32, was first in line to attend trial Wednesday after driving an hour from her home in Rio Rancho, N.M.\n\nJarrell, a stay-at-home mom of two, said she followed along closely during a separate trial against \"Rust\" rookie armorer Hannah Gutierrez-Reed -- who was sentenced to 18 months behind bars after she was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter in March.\n\n\"I watched the Gutierrez case,\" Jarrell said. \"[I'm] super excited it was in my home state. [I] drove about an hour to be here.\"\n\nJarrell said she's an advocate for stricter gun safety laws and added that she wants justice for Hutchins.\n\nAs for the Baldwins' upcoming reality show, Jarrell said: \"I think that was wild to capitalize off a tragedy for fame. I thought that was sad.\"\n\n\"I would say Halyna's death is a tragedy. To ride that off a wave into a reality show,\" she added.\n\nSanta Fe resident Frank Winberly, 81, said he didn't buy Baldwin's claims in the media following Hutchins' death that he didn't pull the trigger on his .45-caliber replica Colt revolver.\n\n\"The hammer won't fall unless you pull the trigger,\" Winberly said. \"I think he pulled the trigger.\"\n\nBaldwin lawyer Alex Spiro Wednesday morning said his client didn't \"intentionally\" pull the trigger -- an apparent attempt to backtrack on Baldwin's previous denial.\n\nSpiro said blame for Hutchins' death should lay with Gutierrez-Reed and others on set who were responsible for the safe use of weapons during filming. Spiro said Baldwin was simply doing his job of acting, when he fired the gun, which was never supposed to contain a live round.\n\nBut prosecutor Erlinda Ocampo argued during her openings that Baldwin \"played make-believe with a real gun\" and flouted gun safety rules, contributing to the fatal tragedy.\n\nHilaria and Baldwin's brother Stephen Baldwin were both seated in the courtroom gallery a few rows behind the embattled actor as trial got underway Wednesday.\n\nAlec and Hilaria got a slightly warmer reception after the end of proceedings on Wednesday.\n\nAfter leaving court, the Baldwins went shopping along a touristy stretch of downtown Santa Fe before grabbing Starbucks. The couple was spotted with their toddler.\n\nAlec pushed an empty stroller as Hilaria held the little girl's hand.\n\nHe signed autographs for fans inside the coffee shop.\n\n\"I was going to ask for a selfie for dad but I didn't want to because he's going through a hard time,\" a girl said after leaving Starbucks.\n\n\"He was a very, very nice man,\" said Lucille Roybal, of Santa Fe, who got an autograph addressed to her 2-year-old son Ocean.\n\n\"He was a very sweet man to take his time to give Ocean his autograph.\"\n\nRoybal added: \"I don't think he should be found guilty. No, it's my opinion. I think there should have been people who took care of the gun.\"", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New York Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Alec's sister Beth Keuchler was in tears during opening statements, and her brother was seen consoling her in the courtroom. A source told Entertainment Tonight that Beth was crying during opening statements, and Stephen Baldwin, Alec's brother, was seen consoling her.\n\nThe emotional scene continued into a break in the trial, when Beth and Stephen went out into the hallway. Stephen continued to console his sister, who was visibly emotional, crying and wiping away tears. Alec joined his family and hugged his sister before the break ended.\n\nAlec's wife, Hilaria Baldwin, and their 21-month-old daughter, Ilaria, were also present in the courtroom. Alec, 66, is on trial for involuntary manslaughter stemming from the fatal shooting that took place in October 2021 on the set of his upcoming film Rust. Cinematographer Halyna Hutchins was killed on set when a gun that Alec was holding went off.\n\nSpecial prosecutor Erlinda Ocampo Johnson spent her opening statement attempting to argue that Alec was careless on set. She claimed that Alec used the gun as a pointer, cocked the hammer when he wasn't supposed to, and put his finger on the trigger when it wasn't supposed to be there. Alec's attorney, Alex Spiro, countered by outlining the safety measures the film's crew took, implying that Alec had every reason to believe the gun was not loaded.\n\nThe prosecution called its first witness, Santa Fe deputy Nicholas LeFleur, who was the first law enforcement official on the scene. Jurors also heard the 911 call placed immediately after the shooting. Alec has repeatedly stood by his assertion that he did not pull the trigger on the prop gun.", "source": {"uri": "tribune.com.pk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Express Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "pop_culture@tribune.com.pk", "name": "Pop Culture", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Baldwin", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Baldwin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alec_Baldwin", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alec Baldwin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boroughs_of_New_York_City", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boroughs of New York City"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment_Tonight", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Entertainment Tonight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_procedure", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Criminal procedure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Mexico"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilaria_Baldwin", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hilaria Baldwin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinematographer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cinematographer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manslaughter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manslaughter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prop_gun", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prop gun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halyna_Hutchins", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Halyna Hutchins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_crew", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Film crew"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Fe,_New_Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Santa Fe, New Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Santa Fe, New Mexico"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/IHDRQOY2D5OV5CYYGBP62UG5SE1668229819-0/IHDRQOY2D5OV5CYYGBP62UG5SE1668229819-0.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719280", "eventUri": "eng-9719280", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2019-01-23", "textStart": 95, "textEnd": 111}], "sentiment": -0.2, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

They're not cardinal rules on a movie set,\" said Spiro.\n\n\"You've all seen gunfights in movies,\" he told the jury, citing classics like \"Platoon,\" \"Apocalypse Now\" and \"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.\"\n\n\"The reason that can happen is because safety is ensured before the actor\" is handed the weapon, he said.\n\nIn a 2021 television interview, Baldwin said he did not pull the trigger.\n\nOn Wednesday, Spiro appeared to partly row back on that claim, while maintaining his client's innocence.\n\n\"On a movie set, you're allowed to pull the trigger,\" he told the jury.\n\n\"So even if he intentionally pulled the trigger... that doesn't make him guilty of homicide.\"\n\n- 'Live bullet' -\n\nHutchins, the victim, was originally from Ukraine, and her career as a Hollywood cinematographer was thriving when she was killed at the age of 42.\n\nThe tragedy occurred during a rehearsal in a small chapel on the Bonanza Creek Ranch, a historic location for Western movies, midway through the filming of \"Rust.\"\n\nBaldwin was practicing a scene in which his outlaw character, trapped by two marshals, brandishes his Colt six-shooter.\n\nFBI testing found the revolver could not have fired without its trigger being pulled and prosecutors will present witnesses, including the gun's manufacturer, to support that finding.\n\nHowever, the weapon was damaged during testing. Spiro suggested that could have been deliberate, to prevent the report's findings being disproved.\n\nBut he focused blame on the movie's safety officials, including armorer Hannah Gutierrez, for allowing a live bullet to be brought on set.\n\n\"That live bullet is the key,\" said Spiro.\n\nGutierrez was convicted by the same court this year and is serving an 18-month sentence.\n\n- Harrowing video -\n\nWitnesses called Wednesday included police officers who arrived early to the scene of the tragedy.\n\nThe court saw footage from their lapel cameras, including harrowing video of some of Hutchins's final moments.\n\nBaldwin watched with his arms crossed, fidgeting in his seat and occasionally glancing at the jury.\n\nIt is not known if Baldwin will take the stand in his defense. Legal experts say it would be a risky move, exposing the allegedly temperamental actor to hostile cross-examination.\n\nThe trial is scheduled to conclude Friday of next week, with jury deliberations to follow.", "source": {"uri": "bilyonaryo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bilyonaryo Business News -"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinal_(Catholic_Church)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cardinal (Catholic Church)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alec_Baldwin", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alec Baldwin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearm", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Firearm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Fe,_New_Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Santa Fe, New Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Santa Fe, New Mexico"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prop", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halyna_Hutchins", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Halyna Hutchins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadly_weapon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Deadly weapon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movie_star", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Movie star"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_(genre)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Western (genre)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinematographer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cinematographer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolver", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Revolver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cinema of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manslaughter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manslaughter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butch_Cassidy", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Butch Cassidy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shootout", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shootout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sundance_Kid", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sundance Kid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apocalypse", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apocalypse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Classics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/30_Rock", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "30 Rock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay-Z", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jay-Z"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Television comedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonanza_City,_New_Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bonanza City, New Mexico"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colt's_Manufacturing_Company", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Colt's Manufacturing Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deliberation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Deliberation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outlaw", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Outlaw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marshal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gun_Control", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gun Control", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Acting", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Acting", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Guns", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Guns", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Trivia", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Trivia", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://bilyonaryo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/baldwin.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719280", "eventUri": "eng-9719280", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 156, "relevance": 1}

Five men and 11 women were chosen by Santa Fe County special prosecutors and the actor's team of defence attorneys. Twelve will be designated as the jury and four as alternates by the court only after they hear the case.\n\nThey'll be tasked with deciding whether Baldwin committed the felony when, during a rehearsal in October 2021, a revolver went off while he was pointing it at cinematographer Halyna Hutchins, killing her and wounding director Joel Souza on the set of the film, Rust.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMedia members were not allowed in the courtroom when attorneys used their challenges to strike jurors. Those sworn into the jury were told to avoid news about the case and to report on Wednesday morning. Baldwin, 66, could get up to 18 months in prison if the jurors unanimously find him guilty.\n\nWhen Judge Mary Marlowe Sommer asked the pool of 70 possible jurors if they were familiar with the case, all but two raised their hands to indicate they were. Two others indicated they would not be able to be fair and impartial and were excused.\n\nBaldwin, the star of 30 Rock (2006) and The Hunt for Red October (1990) and a major Hollywood figure for 35 years, sat in the courtroom with a team of four lawyers. His wife, Hilaria Baldwin, and brother, The Usual Suspects (1995) actor Stephen Baldwin, were seated in the back of the courtroom.\n\nUnder questioning from prosecutor Kari Morrissey, a potential juror said she hates firearms, but many others acknowledged owning them and few people expressed strong opinions about guns. Baldwin's lawyer Alex Spiro in his questioning highlighted the gravity of the situation \"obviously someone lost their life\" and asked jurors to come forward with any reservations about their own ability to be fair and impartial.\n\n\"Does anyone have that view, even in the slightest?\" Spiro asked the group. He asked them to come forward if they'd shared opinions about the case online. None did. Spiro asked if any of them had strong opinions on gun safety, and whether a person can rely on an expert to ensure the safety of a gun, not just themselves.\n\nSeveral said they always treat a gun as if it were loaded. One man said he was taught to respect and treat guns the same way, but also deferred to an instructor during instruction he got for a concealed carry permit.\n\nSpiro also asked whether jurors were comfortable questioning the judgment of law enforcement officials, even those testifying under oath. Baldwin and his wife arrived at the courthouse early with their youngest child, Ilaria Catalina Irena Baldwin.\n\nBaldwin has said the gun fired accidentally after he followed instructions to point it toward Hutchins, who was behind the camera. Unaware that the gun contained a live round, Baldwin said he pulled back the hammer, not the trigger, and it fired.", "source": {"uri": "mid-day.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "mid-day"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alec_Baldwin", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alec Baldwin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manslaughter", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manslaughter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Mexico"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baldwin_County,_Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Baldwin County, Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Baldwin County, Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Souza", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joel Souza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halyna_Hutchins", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Halyna Hutchins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinematographer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cinematographer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolver", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Revolver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Fe_County,_New_Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Santa Fe County, New Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Santa Fe County, New Mexico"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilaria_Baldwin", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hilaria Baldwin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hunt_for_Red_October", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Hunt for Red October"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Baldwin", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Baldwin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Marlowe", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Christopher Marlowe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/30_Rock", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "30 Rock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cinema of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morrissey", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Morrissey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearm", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Firearm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_reservation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indian reservation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concealed_carry_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Concealed carry in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gun_Control", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gun Control", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Regulatory_and_Legal", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Regulatory and Legal", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://images.mid-day.com/images/images/2024/jul/Alec-Baldwin-jj_d.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719280", "eventUri": "eng-9719280", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1058823529411764, "wgt": 156, "relevance": 1}

Alec's wife, Hilaria Baldwin, and brother, actor Stephen Baldwin, were in the courtroom consoling the 30 Rock star.\n\nBut an eyewitness also tells ET that Alec's sister, Beth Keuchler, was also in court supporting her brother. The eyewitness said that \"Stephen was seen consoling his sister, who was crying during opening statements.\" Once the court went on break, the eyewitness says \"Elizabeth and Stephen went out into the hallway, where Stephen continued to console his sister, who was visibly emotional, crying and wiping away tears.\"\n\nThe eyewitness further stated that before the break ended, \"Alec joined his family and hugged his sister.\"\n\nBaldwin is standing trial for one count of involuntary manslaughter in connection to the fatal shooting of Rust cinematographer Halyna Hutchins on the set of his film in October 2021. If convicted, he faces up to 18 months in prison. The film's armorer, Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, was previously convicted and sentenced to 18 months behind bars.\n\nTuesday's pre-trial hearing concluded with the selection of 12 jurors and four alternates. On Wednesday, special prosecutor Erlinda Ocampo Johnson sought to paint Alec as careless in her opening statement.\n\n\"You will see him using this gun as a pointer to point at people, to point at things,\" she said via Court TV's livestream of the trial. \"You will see him cock the hammer when he's not supposed to.\"\n\nShe added, \"You will see him put his finger on the trigger when his finger is not supposed to be on the trigger. You will hear about numerous breaches of firearm safety with this defendant and this use of his firearm.\"\n\nJohnson concluded her opening statement by saying Alec acted in \"reckless disregard\" that cost Hutchins her life.\n\nAlec's defense attorney, Alex Spiro, insisted in his opening statement that \"the gun was double checked\" and \"verified it was a cold gun\" and that Alec was never made aware that there was a live round in the revolver.\n\n\"It had been checked and double checked by those responsible for ensuring the gun was safe,\" Spiro said. \"He did not tamper with it, he did not load it himself.

According to Johnson, it is a clear and direct matter. She argued that the individual who engaged in make-believe with a real gun and disregarded firearm safety rules is the accused party.\n\n\"There are people who act in a reckless manner and place other individuals in danger and act without due regard for the safety of others,\" the prosecutor went on. That was Baldwin, she said.\n\n'Did his own thing.'\n\nIn succinct fashion, the state laid out a case where safety guidelines were presented, directions to perform a certain way were given but, throughout his time on the set, \"the defendant did his own thing.\"\n\nJohnson promised jurors they would see multiple videos of Baldwin handling the firearm. Those videos, the prosecutor said, will show him using the weapon but never performing a safety check with the film's disgraced armorer Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, who was convicted of the same charge Baldwin faces, \"because he didn't want to offend her.\"\n\nThe prosecutor also said jurors will see, in those videos, Baldwin using the gun as a pointer, cocking the hammer when he is not supposed to do so, putting his finger on the trigger when it is not supposed to be on the trigger and \"numerous\" other \"breaches of firearm safety.\"\n\nJohnson also previewed the testimony of a movie set safety expert who will be brought in to testify that industry rules require people to treat all firearms like they are real and loaded, to never point guns at people, and to never put your finger on the trigger unless you are \"prepared to shoot or to destroy whatever is in front of you.\"\n\nOn the day Hutchins died, the state said, there wasn't even a real rehearsal happening. Rather, she said, the actor was being directed through a series of blocking exercises -- which are simply the physical placement of actors and objects on a set or stage.\n\nDuring the blocking, Baldwin was directed to slowly pull the gun out and hold it, Johnson said. The prosecutor then characterized how those exercises occurred: one time he did it correctly, one time he did it differently by cocking the hammer without being asked to do so, and then they broke for lunch.\n\n\"On Oct. 21, 2021, after that lunch break, the defendant violated those set safety rules,\" the prosecutor alleged.\n\nAnother round of blocking exercises ensued. Each time, Baldwin was directed to slowly remove the gun from the holster and nothing more, Johnson said. Each time, however, Baldwin removed the gun quickly and cocked the hammer with \"his finger was on or around the trigger.\" The third time, the prosecutor said, Baldwin pointed the gun at Hutchins.\n\n'On a movie set.'\n\nDefense attorney Alex Spiro often invoked cinematic themes, used references to famous films, and frequently repeated the phrase \"on a movie set\" in a decidedly more disjointed opening statement.\n\n\"This was an unspeakable tragedy, but Alec Baldwin committed no crime,\" the defense attorney began. \"He was an actor acting -- playing the role of Harlan Rust. An actor playing a character can act in ways that are lethal that just aren't lethal on a movie set. These 'cardinal rules,' they're not cardinal rules on a movie set. And I don't have to tell you much more about this because you've all seen gunfights in movies. And the reason that can happen is because safety is ensured before the actor. On this movie set, there were people responsible for ensuring the safety of the set and the firearm -- those people failed in their duties but Alec Baldwin committed no crime.\"\n\nPart of the jumbled defense beginning was intentional: Spiro played the initial 911 call after Hutchins was shot as well as video of Baldwin practicing the scene that, when later blocked, took Hutchins' life.\n\nWhat could prove to be a powerful moment for the defense did not rely on Spiro's oft-invoked \"movie magic\" at all.\n\nIn the raw scene practice footage, Baldwin is seen seated and looking at the camera. He asks the director if he should \"whip it out\" -- in reference to the prop gun -- and the director answers in the affirmative. In successive takes, Baldwin quickly draws the gun and points it forward without complaint.\n\nSpiro, however, did not linger on the direction issue after the footage aired -- instead pivoting to a different point and telling jurors: \"Everyone was doing exactly how they go about their business everyday.\"\n\nPart of the defense's case seems to be raising a bit of a whodunit: \"Why did a real bullet get loaded into a prop movie gun?\" Spiro asked at one point. The defense attorney also said a key concern is how the real bullet get onto the movie set in the first place.\n\nThe defense asked and left the questions to hang in the air -- forecasting a mystery that, sadly, has no real answers.\n\n\"No one had any idea that this venomous, toxic element had been inserted into this magic they were creating,\" Spiro said. \"But it did. It entered that place. It killed an amazing person. It wounded another and it changed lives forever. And, so, to find out what happened on that movie set, you need to do something that the prosecutors could never do. You have to step back and remember what they were doing on a movie set.\"\n\nThe defense went on to argue that verisimilitude is a necessary component to making movies -- particularly the use of guns.\n\nPart of the disconnect in the defense opening came from no less than three objections lodged by the state.\n\nUnder the court's rules, those objections will remain a mystery. Instead of objecting on grounds audible to the gallery, each side is expected to request a brief sidebar -- so as not to use objections to influence jurors, First Judicial District Court Judge Mary Marlowe Sommer ruled on Monday during a pretrial hearing.\n\nOne of the state's objections came as Spiro rattled off a list of violent films including \"Platoon,\" \"Apocalypse Now,\" and \"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.\" After the silent-to-viewers sidebar, the defense briefly mentioned the role guns play in people's lives -- and therefore in films -- and then moved on again.\n\nSpiro then described the concept of a \"cold gun,\" saying the phrase was called out on the set before the armorer handed the gun to Baldwin. Then, the defense recounted the blocking exercises, and the surprise shooting before playing the 911 call in which someone exclaims \"the f -- -- AD ... he's responsible.\"\n\n\"Not a word about Alec Baldwin,\" the defense attorney said, repeating some of what was said on the call, after the audio played.\n\nSpiro later went over several details of the immediate aftermath -- promising jurors they will be able to view videos and pieces of evidence beneficial to Baldwin's point of view as well -- and stressing to jurors \"the evidence in the moment\" and what people did and \"originally said\" on the day in question matter more than anything else in the case.\n\n\"If you remember anything I say today as the evidence proceeds, remember that,\" the defense attorney advised. \"Look at the evidence of what the people of 'Rust' said and did that day. Life changes. Memories change. There are human motivations. Internal pressure. External pressure. That's why preservation is so important.\"\n\nAlmost from the beginning, however, the investigation went awry, Spiro said. He noted that police did not secure the prop truck -- which supplied the prop cart where the gun and ammunition were stored -- until \"several days\" after the shooting and did not secure the prop house -- which supplies the prop truck -- until \"over a month\" later.\n\nEventually, the heart of the defense's argument came into view.\n\nThe sloppy investigation, Spiro said, quickly became something of a prosecutorial effort to pin Hutchins' death on Baldwin.\n\nThe facts of the case, the defense attorney argued, did not matter to the state so much as winning a high-profile trial.\n\nKey here, he said, was the admitted destruction of the gun that occurred when an FBI firearm examiner performed several tests.\n\n\"They just destroyed it,\" Spiro said. \"Can't ever be tested in the same condition it was in that day. Won't ever allow Alec to show his truth. And the destruction of this gun that you will hear in this evidence is symbolic of this entire case. Because the officers will tell you at that point: they weren't really investigating anymore. They were trying to disprove Alec -- to get Alec.\"", "source": {"uri": "internewscast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Internewscast Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baldwin_Locomotive_Works", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Baldwin Locomotive Works"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_construction", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Set construction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hammer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hammer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alec_Baldwin", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alec Baldwin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearm", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Firearm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opening_statement", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Opening statement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_defense_lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Criminal defense lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defendant", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Defendant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halyna_Hutchins", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Halyna Hutchins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinal_(Catholic_Church)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cardinal (Catholic Church)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armourer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Armourer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_(genre)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Western (genre)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinematographer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cinematographer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manslaughter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manslaughter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Mexico"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prop_gun", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prop gun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shootout", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shootout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mystery_fiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mystery fiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tragedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_(illusion)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Magic (illusion)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugby_union_positions", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rugby union positions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butch_Cassidy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Butch Cassidy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sundance_Kid", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sundance Kid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Marlowe", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christopher Marlowe"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gun_Control", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gun Control", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Guns", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Guns", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Trivia", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Trivia", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Homemade", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Homemade", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Opening-statements-in-Alec-Baldwin-manslaughter-trial.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719280", "eventUri": "eng-9719280", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1529411764705882, "wgt": 152, "relevance": 1}

(AP) -- A defense attorney told jurors Wednesday that the shooting death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins was an \"unspeakable tragedy\" but that \"Alec Baldwin committed no crime; he was an actor, acting.\"\n\nBaldwin's lawyer Alex Spiro emphasized in his opening statement in a Santa Fe, New Mexico, courtroom that Baldwin, who is on trial for involuntary manslaughter, did exactly what actors always do on the set of the film \"Rust,\" where Hutchins was killed in October 2021.\n\n\"I don't have to tell you any more about this, because you've all seen gunfights in movies,\" Spiro said.\n\nSpecial prosecutor Erlinda Ocampo Johnson said in her opening statement that before the shooting, Baldwin skipped safety checks and recklessly handled a revolver.\n\n\"The evidence will show that someone who played make believe with a real gun and violated the cardinal rules of firearm safety is the defendant, Alexander Baldwin,\" Ocampo Johnson said.\n\nSpiro replied that \"these cardinal rules, they're not cardinal rules on a movie set.\"\n\n\"On a movie set, safety has to occur before a gun is placed in an actor's hand,\" Spiro told the jury.\n\nThe first witness to take the stand was the first law enforcement officer to arrive at Bonanza Creek Ranch after the shooting. Video shown in the courtroom from the body camera of Nicholas LeFleur, then a Santa Fe county sheriff's deputy, captured the frantic efforts to save Hutchins, who looked unconscious as several people attended to her and gave her an oxygen mask. In the courtroom, Baldwin looked at the screen somberly as it played.\n\nLater in the video, LeFleur can be seen telling Baldwin not to speak to the other potential witnesses, but Baldwin repeatedly does.\n\nWhen special prosecutor Kari Morrissey asked whether the sheriff's deputy handled the situation ideally he responded, \"Probably not. But it's what happened.\"\n\nSpiro tried to establish that neither LeFleur nor the trial's second witness, former sheriff's Lt. Tim Benavidez, treated the scene as a place where a major crime had occurred. Benavidez, who collected the revolver after the shooting, acknowledged that he was careful with it as much for safety reasons as anything else, but did not wear gloves or take meticulous forensic precautions as he might be done for a homicide investigation.\n\nOcampo Johnson in her opening walked the jurors through the events leading up to Hutchins death. She said on that day, Baldwin declined multiple opportunities for standard safety checks with armorer Hannah Gutierrez-Reed before the rehearsal in the small church about 20 miles (32 kilometers) from the courthouse where Hutchins, \"a vibrant 42-year-old rising star,\" was killed. She said Baldwin instead \"did his own thing.\"\n\n\"He cocks the hammer, points it straight at Miss Hutchins, and fires that gun, sending that live bullet right into Miss Hutchins body,\" said Ocampo Johnson.\n\nDuring the presentation, Baldwin trained his eyes downward on a notepad, away from the jury. He watched Spiro intently during his opening. His wife Hilaria Baldwin, younger brother Stephen Baldwin and older sister Elizabeth Keuchler -- who wiped away tears at times -- were among the family and friends sitting behind him.\n\nThe 16 jurors -- 11 women and five men -- come from a region with strong currents of gun ownership and safety informed by backcountry hunting. Four of the jurors will be deemed alternates while the other 12 deliberate once they get the case.\n\nHutchins' death and the wounding of director Joel Souza nearly three years ago sent shock waves through the film industry and led to one felony charge against Baldwin, 66, that could result in up to 18 months in prison.\n\n\"It killed an amazing person,\" Spiro said. \"It wounded another, and it changed lives forever.\"\n\nBaldwin has claimed the gun fired accidentally after he followed instructions to point it toward Hutchins, who was behind the camera. Unaware that it was loaded with a live round, he said he pulled back the hammer -- not the trigger -- and it fired.\n\n\"No one saw him intentionally pull the trigger,\" Spiro said.\n\nBut he said even if Baldwin had pulled it, it still would not have been manslaughter.\n\n\"On a movie set, you're allowed to pull that trigger,\" Spiro said, adding, \"that doesn't make it a homicide.\"\n\nThe lawyer emphasized that the responsibility for safety lay with the film's armorer, Gutierrez-Reed, who has already been convicted of involuntary manslaughter, and assistant director David Halls, who pleaded no contest to negligent use of a deadly weapon in exchange for his testimony.\n\nBaldwin had been told \"cold gun\" before getting the revolver, not knowing there was a live round in it.\n\n\"It had been checked and double checked by those responsible for ensuring the gun was safe,\" Spiro said. \"He did not tamper with it he did not load it himself. He did not leave it unattended.\"\n\nSpiro has in recent years become one of the most sought-after defense attorneys in the country. His clients have included Elon Musk, New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft, and Megan Thee Stallion.\n\nBaldwin -- the star of \"Beetlejuice,\" \"Glengarry Glen Ross\" and \"30 Rock\" -- has been a household name as an actor and public personality for more than three decades.\n\nSpiro said in concluding his opening that witnesses will attest that \"no actor in history\" has \"intercepted a live bullet from a prop gun.\"\n\n\"No one could have imagined or expected an actor to do that,\" the lawyer said.\n\nTestimony at trial will delve into the mechanics of the weapon and whether it could have fired without a trigger pull. Prosecutors say it couldn't have.\n\n\"That gun the defendant had asked to be assigned worked perfectly fine as it was designed,\" Ocampo Johnson said.\n\nAttorney Gloria Allred sat in the front row of the courtroom audience, a reminder of Baldwin's other legal difficulties. Allred is representing \"Rust\" script supervisor Mamie Mitchell and Hutchins' sister and parents in a civil lawsuit against Baldwin and other producers.\n\nAllred said that from her observations in

Cinematographer Halyna Hutchins was killed on set when a gun that Alec was holding went off. If convicted, Alec faces up to 18 months in prison.\n\nThe film's armorer, Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, has already been convicted and was sentenced to 18 months.\n\nSpecial prosecutor Erlinda Ocampo Johnson spent her opening statement attempting to argue Alec was careless on set.\n\n\"You will see him using this gun as a pointer to point at people, to point at things,\" she said, per Court TV's livestream of the trial. \"You will see him cock the hammer when he's not supposed to.\"\n\n\"You will see him put his finger on the trigger when his finger is not supposed to be on the trigger. You will hear about numerous breaches of firearm safety with this defendant and this use of his firearm.\"\n\nAlec's attorney Alex Spiro countered by outlining the safety measures the film's crew took, implying the actor had every reason to believe the gun was not loaded. He said \"the gun was double-checked\" and the crew \"verified it was a cold gun,\" adding that Alec was allegedly never told there was a live round in the chamber.\n\nSpiro added, \"It had been checked and double-checked by those responsible for ensuring the gun was safe. He did not tamper with it, he did not load it himself. He did not leave it unattended.\"\n\nAlec has repeatedly stood by his assertion that he did not pull the trigger on the prop gun.\n\nIn addition to opening statements, the prosecution called its first witness, Santa Fe deputy Nicholas LeFleur, who was the first law enforcement official on the scene.

The New York native, 66 -- wearing a dark suit, light purple shirt and maroon tie -- gave away little emotion, occasionally taking notes and at one point putting his hand on his brow and bowing his head slightly.\n\nEmergency responders showed up at Bonanza Creek Ranch on Oct. 21, 2021 where Hutchins and director Joel Souza had been shot after Baldwin was mistakenly handed a gun with a live .45-caliber round during filming for the gun-slinging Western.\n\nThe footage was taken from the body-worn camera of Santa Fe police officer Nicholas LeFleur -- who walked the jurors through the mayhem that unfolded in the aftermath of the deadly shooting.\n\nHutchins and Souza could both be seen on the ground inside a small church where they'd been filming surrounded by medics, first responders and medical equipment.\n\n\"Halyna, deep breaths, deep breaths,\" one unidentified woman could be hear repeating to Hutchins during footage.

Clips of Baldwin on set beforehand and in the aftermath were also shown.\n\nThe 66-year-old is charged with involuntary manslaughter and has pleaded not guilty, always maintaining he did not pull the gun's trigger and was not responsible for ensuring safety on set.\n\nAnd the critical question that really needs to be answered, say his lawyers, is how the live round ended up there in the first place. The court later heard from a crime scene technician, who says she believed she recovered six live rounds in total from the set.\n\nThe high-profile trial will delve into gun safety and star power on a low-budget Western movie, which was being filmed on the remote Bonanza Creek Ranch set when the tragedy took place in October 2021.\n\nBaldwin, whose is on trial under his real name, Alexander Rae Baldwin, faces up to 18 months in prison if he is found guilty. He was supported in court by his wife, Hilaria, and brother Stephen, who is also an actor, along with other friends and relatives.\n\nIn her opening statement, Ms Johnson told jurors the actor requested \"the biggest gun available\" before arriving on set.\n\nBaldwin was 'reckless', says prosecutor\n\n\"The evidence will show that someone who played make believe with a real gun and violated the cardinal rules of firearm safety is the defendant, Alexander Baldwin,\" she said.\n\nThe Rust set was a workplace, she emphasised. \"The evidence will show that like in many workplaces, there are people who act in a reckless manner and place other people in danger. That, you will hear, is the defendant.\"\n\nProsecutors say they will present evidence to show Baldwin went \"off script\" and failed to follow basic industry standards for firearms safety.\n\nTestimony from experts will also delve into the mechanics of the weapon and whether it could have fired without a trigger pull - which prosecutors say is impossible.\n\n\"That gun the defendant had asked to be assigned worked perfectly fine as it was designed,\" Ms Johnson said.\n\n'You've all seen gunfights in movies'\n\nHowever, in his opening statement, Baldwin's lawyer Alex Spiro told jurors the star behaved exactly as actors always do. \"I don't have to tell you any more about this, because you've all seen gunfights in movies,\" he said.\n\n\"On a movie set, safety has to occur before a gun is placed in an actor's hand,\" Mr Spiro added.\n\nBaldwin, who was unaware the gun contained a live round, has claimed it fired accidentally after he followed instructions to point it toward Ms Hutchins, who was behind the camera.\n\nMr Spiro reiterated to the court several times that the responsibility for safety did not lie with him. Instead, he said, it was the job of the film's armourer, Hannah Gutierrez, who was convicted of involuntary manslaughter following a separate trial earlier this year, and assistant director David Halls, who pleaded no contest to negligent use of a deadly weapon in 2023.\n\nBaldwin had been told \"cold gun\" before getting the revolver, not knowing there was a live round in it, the court was told.\n\n\"It had been checked and double checked by those responsible for ensuring the gun was safe,\" Mr Spiro said.\n\n\"No actor in history\" has \"intercepted a live bullet from a prop gun,\" he said. \"No one could have imagined or expected an actor to do that.\"\n\nSanta Fe County Sherriff's officers were among those to give evidence during the first day of the trial.\n\nTheir testimony painted a picture of a chaotic scene, with a \"bunch of people running everywhere\".\n\nThe trial continues, and is scheduled to last for about eight days.", "source": {"uri": "news.sky.com",

He has pleaded not guilty.\n\nThe defense's prosecutor Erlinda O.

Honestly, sir, a fair characterization to this jury to say that Mr. Baldwin was disobeying police orders at the scene?\n\nStay updated on the latest news updates with the KOAT app. You can download it here.", "source": {"uri": "koat.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KOAT 7"}, "authors": [{"uri": "faith_egbuonu@koat.com", "name": "Faith Egbuonu", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alec_Baldwin", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alec Baldwin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Fe_County,_New_Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Santa Fe County, New Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Santa Fe County, New Mexico"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Fe,_New_Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Santa Fe, New Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Santa Fe, New Mexico"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morrissey", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Morrissey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courthouse", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Courthouse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halyna_Hutchins", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Halyna Hutchins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilaria_Baldwin", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hilaria Baldwin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Baldwin", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Baldwin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinematographer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cinematographer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manslaughter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manslaughter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-examination", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cross-examination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KOAT-TV", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "KOAT-TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheriff", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sheriff"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law_Enforcement", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law Enforcement", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Competition_Shooting", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Competition Shooting", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Shooting", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Shooting", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Organizations", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://kubrick.htvapps.com/vidthumb/421e9438-2802-4770-ac42-229377e5376f/d746e35e-5965-4bde-920a-43db991ec21f.jpg?crop=0.787xw:0.786xh;0.143xw,0.00578xh&resize=640:*", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719280", "eventUri": "eng-9719280", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-10", "textStart": 127, "textEnd": 134, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.0980392156862745, "wgt": 147, "relevance": 1}

The 66-year-old actor is charged with involuntary manslaughter in the 2021 death of Rust cinematographer Halyna Hutchins and faces up to 18 months in prison if convicted. The jury heard opening statements from the prosecution and defense. The state called four witnesses. Here's a recap of Day 1.\n\nThe actor was supported by family members, including Hilaria Baldwin and his brother Stephen Baldwin. They sat behind him in court, and at one point, Hilaria Baldwin appeared to comfort her husband during a break.\n\nThe actor was seen intently taking notes on multiple occasions, particularly when prosecutors spoke. He wore glasses the majority of time the court was in session. Baldwin closely watched evidence as it appeared onscreen in front of him. He looked especially interested in the state's fourth witness, Marissa Poppell, a crime scene technician who inspected the scene.\n\nBaldwin's defense attorney Alex Spiro specifically called out first assistant director David Halls, who was the film's safety coordinator, for declaring the gun \"cold\" before handing it to the actor. That meant it was safe and the gun had no live ammunition. (Halls denied this in a deposition and took a plea deal early in the case to avoid jail time.) Spiro also put blame on armorer Hannah Gutierrez-Reed for failing to properly do her job.\n\n\"The gun was double-checked, verified it was a cold gun. Not an actor's responsibility to check; safety was ensured before,\" Spiro said.\n\n\"The gun went off during the rehearsal. No one saw [Alec] intentionally pull the trigger,\" Spiro continued. \"It was obviously a tragic accident, but Alec committed no homicide. Alec took the gun from those charged with its safety. He did not tamper with it. He did not load it himself. He did not leave it unattended. ... It was an actor handling a prop.\"\n\nSpiro repeatedly called out the prosecution as the gun used by Baldwin was damaged by the FBI during testing. Baldwin has maintained he didn't pull the trigger and the gun discharged on its own.\n\n\"[The state] never solved the question of the lethal bullet; they destroyed the gun and all they were left with was Alec Baldwin and the movie they intend to put on,\" he said. \"There will not be one witness, not one shred of evidence in this trial that Alec knew or should have known the gun was loaded with a live round. So they can't prove their high-profile homicide case.\"\n\nSpecial prosecutor Erlinda Ocampo Johnson alleged that Baldwin \"mishandled\" the gun on the set and failed to routinely do safety checks with the \"inexperienced\" on-set armorer.\n\n\"You will see him using this gun as a pointer to point at people, to point at things,\" she said. \"You will see him cock the hammer when he's not supposed to,\" she told jurors. \"You will see him put his finger on the trigger when his finger is not supposed to be on the trigger. You will hear about numerous breaches of firearm safety with this defendant and this use of this firearm.\"\n\nProsecutors claim that, although the gun was ultimately damaged, they will prove the trigger must have been pulled for it to discharge.\n\nThe state called Nicholas LeFleur, an officer with the Santa Fe Police Department, as its first witness. LeFleur was one of the first people to respond to the scene. Bodycam footage was shown depicting the aftermath of the tragedy. Baldwin can be seen talking with Halls. Both are detained, not under arrest.\n\nDuring cross-examination, LeFleur denied being coached by prosecutors to avoid calling the incident an accident. Spiro pointed out that the officer did not stop crew members from speaking to one another at the scene, which could be viewed as a mistake.\n\nTimoteo Benavidez, a former lieutenant with the Santa Fe Sheriff's office who was on duty the day of the accident, was the second witness. The state called him to establish a chain of custody for the gun in question. He was handed the gun by Gutierrez-Reed.\n\nWhen asked by Spiro during cross-examination if he knew what happened to the ammunition used in the weapon, Benavidez said, \"I do not.\"\n\nDetective Joseph Lujan with the Santa Fe County Sheriff's office was the third witness to take the stand.

The cinematographer was shot on the set of the Western movie Rust in October 2021 after a prop gun discharged while the actor was holding it.\n\nBaldwin has repeatedly insisted that he did not pull the gun's trigger or know that it contained live ammunition. If convicted, he faces up to 18 months in prison.\n\nHe initially listed his East Hampton farmhouse for sale in November 2022 and has reduced the price several times since. A recent New York Times article alleged the cuts are due to uncertainty in his finances amid the legal action.\n\nHowever, a source denied the actor is having money troubles to PEOPLE. \"There is no financial strain. That house has been on the market for two years,\" the insider said on Wednesday, July 10.\n\nThe Times cited lost jobs, growing legal expenses and the cost of caring for his seven young children with his wife Hilaria Baldwin, 40, as causes of strain. The couple share Ilaria Catalina Irena, 19 months, Mar\u00eda Luc\u00eda Victoria, 3, Eduardo \"Edu\" Pao Lucas, 3, Romeo Alejandro David, 5, Leonardo \u00c1ngel Charles, 7, Rafael Thomas, 8, and Carmen Gabriela, 10. Alec is also dad to Ireland, 28, from his previous marriage to ex Kim Basinger.\n\nIn addition to listing their Hamptons home, Alec also made several significant real estate moves in the last few years, per the outlet, including purchasing a $1.75 million farm in Vermont and selling a house in Upstate New York for $530,000.\n\nSince it was first listed in November 2022, the East Hampton property received a series of price cuts and has been taken on and off the market.\n\nIn January 2023, the price was first cut down to $24.9 million, followed by another reduction to $22.5 million in March that same year. The home was taken off the market altogether in September 2023 but it was later re-listed in January 2024 for $18.9.\n\nAs of July 10, the home is still available at the same price, according to the listing, which is held by Scott Bradley and Michael N. Cinque of Saunders & Associates.\n\nWhen the home was re-listed in January, Alec recorded a video with the real estate agency in which he gives a tour outside of the property and recalls his favorite things about the 10,000-square-foot home that he purchased in 1996.\n\n\"I fell in love with this place the moment I came here,\" the 30 Rock alum says of the 8-acre plot, adding that \"you just can't get this out here anymore, you can't buy big pieces of land.\"\n\nHe added that he and Hilaria have made changes to the house over the decades, including additions to both the eastern and western sides in 1996 and 2014.\n\nNever miss a story -- sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\n\"I love it in the winter time because it's so peaceful and it's so beautiful,\" he noted, adding that he is \"always happiest when I come here, especially this time of year.\"\n\nThe home was originally built in 1740 and features seven bedrooms and seven full bathrooms. It overlooks five acres of agricultural reserve and boasts a pool, spa, fenced vegetable garden and outdoor living area complete with a fieldstone fireplace.", "source": {"uri": "people.com",

After court broke for the day, the couple strolled up Santa Fe's ritzy East San Fracisco Street, popping into shops with their 20-month-old daughter in tow.\n\nALEC BALDWIN'S 'RUST' ARMORER REQUESTS PRISON RELEASE DAYS BEFORE ACTOR'S INVOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER TRIAL\n\nStressing his sprawling family ties, Rice said, appears strategic.\n\n\"The defense may try to use to their advantage the fact that he has eight children, seven with Hilaria and a grandchild,\" he said. \"Females may be sympathetic to a father and grandfather along with his fame.\"\n\nAttorney Elizabeth Bunker countered that female jurors could recoil at the aggressive posture assumed by Baldwin's attorney, Alex Spiro, and Baldwin's abrasive persona.\n\nThe actor's counsel grilled Santa Fe police officer Nicholas Lefleur on the stand Wednesday in an attempt to highlight what he deemed to be shoddy investigative work.\n\n\"Sometimes being too aggressive on cross can backfire more with a female-heavy jury,\" Bunker said. \"It could go either way.\" She also noted that Baldwin's reputation as gruff could hurt him more with women than men.\n\nStressing that the trial hinged largely on Baldwin's handling of the gun that killed Hutchins, \"a female-heavy jury might not have as much firearm knowledge,\" she said.\n\n\"Men are a little more black and white, and they might say, 'Of course, you pulled the trigger.'\"\n\nBaldwin has repeatedly said he cocked the gun but did not pull the trigger.\n\nALEC BALDWIN'S CLAIM HE DIDN'T PULL TRIGGER ON 'RUST' SET QUESTIONED BY SHERIFF: 'GUNS DON'T JUST GO OFF'\n\nBut entertainment lawyer Tre Lovell said gender is unlikely to weigh heavily on a verdict.\n\n\"Overall, for this case, I don't see how gender is all that significant,\" he told Fox News Digital. \"What is significant is how the jurors feel about Alec Baldwin and what their feelings are in terms of guns and being able to rely on experts.\"\n\nThe actor accidentally shot and killed Hutchins and wounded director Joel Souza on Oct. 21, 2021, after the film's armorer, Hannah Gutierrez Reed, accidentally loaded a live round into the revolver.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER\n\nProsecutor Erlinda Johnson argued in opening statements that Baldwin \"violated the cardinal rules of firearm safety\" by pointing a real gun on set.\n\nSpiro countered that Baldwin was told the gun was cold and that on a movie set it is the duty of the armorer, not the actor, to ensure the weapons are safe.\n\n\"On a movie set, safety has to occur before a gun is placed in an actor's hand,\" the attorney told jurors in his opening.\n\nThe trial resumes Thursday.\n\nOriginal article source: Alec Baldwin 'Rust' shooting trial: Female-heavy jury may be more

The baby and the caretaker departed in the same SUV moments later.\n\nLegal observers speculated the Baldwins wanted to humanize the churlish actor in the eyes of the public and perhaps even potential jurors.\n\nALEC BALDWIN 'RUST' TRIAL: JUDGE MAKES MAJOR RULING IN ACTOR'S FAVOR\n\n\"The bringing of the child is unusual because it's not really a great place for a child,\" divorce attorney Christopher C. Melcher told Fox News Digital. \"And you've got to think, if they have care with a nanny, why bring the child other than for show?\"\n\nThe Baldwins, he said, knew images of the mother and child arriving at the courthouse would quickly cascade online.\n\n\"They could have afforded child care. A courthouse is not really a place for a child. So, it does seem to be strategic.\"\n\n-- Christopher C. Melcher, divorce attorney\n\n\"There's many people who have to go to court, and they have no child care, and they're stuck bringing their kid to court,\" Melcher said. \"That happens quite often. But, you know, this is not the situation with the Baldwins. They could have afforded child care. A courthouse is not really a place for a child. So, it does seem to be strategic.\"\n\nWATCH: Alec Baldwin leaves court after jury is selected for actor's 'Rust' shooting trial\n\nKnown for his volcanic temper and confrontations with both the press and public, Baldwin's reputation, some have theorized, could hurt his case.\n\n\"As a defense attorney, you always want to humanize someone that's on trial, to show that they're more than this incident that's under a microscope,\" said New Mexico-based attorney Elizabeth Bunker. \"Having family support can show the jury that a lot of people care about the outcome of this case and can subtly encourage them to really dig deep and pay attention to the facts.\"\n\nBunker cautioned, however, that Hilaria and company's appearance could also induce eye rolls among Santa Fe residents.\n\n\"On the flip side, doing too much empathy-garnering can backfire,\" she said. \"If there's any sense of desperation, my experience is that, naturally, jurors will reject anything inauthentic and too performance-like.\"\n\nALEC BALDWIN 'RUST' SHOOTING TRIAL: FATAL TIMELINE THAT LED TO ACTOR'S INVOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER CHARGE\n\nWhile the artsy New Mexico town has attracted its share of chic residents over the years, one lawyer warned that many locals, including potential jurors, are likely less fixated on celebrity and may even harbor a distaste for the rich and famous.\n\n\"The risk is it could backfire if people think you have a nanny 24 hours a day,\" said New York-based lawyer Mark Bederow. \"Why would you have the baby come out of the SUV just to hand the baby off as though it's a prop. It could be perceived as a contrived way to garner public support and positive coverage.\"\n\nThe actor recently announced plans to star in the TLC reality show \"The Baldwins,\" alongside his wife and kids, which he wrote would showcase his family's \"ups and downs, the good, the bad, the wild and the crazy.\"\n\nLIKE WHAT YOU'RE READING? CLICK HERE FOR MORE ENTERTAINMENT NEWS\n\nBut the embattled actor, Melcher added, was faced with a largely unwinnable public relations quandary. Hilaria's absence, he noted, would have spawned questions about her lack of support for her man.\n\n\"With the stakes being so high, you would expect that you would have supporters there, close family would be there,\" he said. \"I think the absence of her would have hurt.\"\n\nPHOTOS: Alec Baldwin and his wife, Hilaria Baldwin, leave courthouse after jury selection\n\nBaldwin's brother, Stephen Baldwin, also showed up to court Tuesday and sat with Hilaria in the back row of the courtroom.\n\nAfter a two-hour delay in the morning, jury selection began around 10:30 a.m. Tuesday. A jury of 16, including four alternates, was chosen to hear arguments in the involuntary manslaughter case.

However, Spiro argued that this does not equate to criminal negligence.\n\nSince the incident, Baldwin has consistently claimed he did not pull the trigger. This assertion has been central to his public defense, aiming to absolve him of responsibility for Hutchins' death. Prosecutors, who find Baldwin's claim \"absurd on its face,\" have made significant efforts to disprove it.\n\nIn his opening statement, Spiro contended that pulling the trigger on a movie set does not inherently make Baldwin guilty of homicide. \"On a movie set, you're allowed to pull the trigger,\" Spiro stated. \"Even if he intentionally pulled the trigger... that doesn't make him guilty of homicide.\"\n\nThe prosecution plans to focus on proving Baldwin did pull the trigger. Special prosecutor Erlinda Johnson stated that multiple firearms experts would testify that the gun was functioning correctly at the time of the shooting. The prosecution will also present testimony from Alessandro Pietta, the gun's manufacturer, who will discuss his quality control measures.\n\n\"The evidence will show... this gun functioned and worked just fine,\" Johnson asserted. Additionally, the prosecution is expected to call a crew member who witnessed Baldwin pull the trigger.\n\nThe defense has not fully conceded that Baldwin pulled the trigger, maintaining that the gun may have misfired. Baldwin's lawyers will argue that an FBI examiner destroyed the gun, preventing conclusive evidence of its functionality. Spiro also mentioned the gun's \"hair trigger\" and the possibility of accidental discharge if the hammer drops on a live primer.\n\nSpiro acknowledged that jurors might conclude Baldwin did pull the trigger but urged them to acquit him regardless. \"If he did, of course, that would only make his statement incorrect,\" Spiro said. \"That would mean he misspoke.\" He emphasized that the critical issue is the presence of a live bullet in the gun, which violated film industry safety standards.\n\n\"He did not know, or have any reason to know, that the gun was loaded with a live bullet. That's the key. That live bullet is the key. That is the lethal element,\" Spiro argued. He suggested that the focus on disproving Baldwin's denial was a distraction from the core issue of the live bullet's presence.\n\nIn contrast, the defense for Hannah Gutierrez Reed, the \"Rust\" armorer, took a different approach. Her lawyer, Jason Bowles, argued that she was a \"scapegoat\" for others' mistakes and did not concede any potential wrongdoing on her part. Despite this, Gutierrez Reed was convicted of involuntary manslaughter in less than three hours.

The prosecution is largely unprecedented in US history, holding an actor criminally responsible for a gun death during filming.\n\nOn Wednesday, a New Mexico jury heard prosecutor Erlinda Johnson outline arguments Baldwin disregarded safety during filming of the low-budget movie when he pointed a gun at Hutchins, cocked it and pulled the trigger as they set up a camera shot in movie-set church southwest of Santa Fe in New Mexico.\n\n\"The evidence will show that someone who played make believe with a real gun and violated the cardinal rules of firearm safety is the defendant, Alexander Baldwin,\" Johnson said.\n\nBaldwin's wife Hilaria Baldwin sat in the second row of the public gallery, his brother Stephen Baldwin in front of her.\n\nHis lawyer Alex Spiro pointed to Rust armorer Hannah Gutierrez - head of gun safety - and first assistant director Dave Halls - responsible for overall set safety.\n\nBoth have been convicted in the shooting, and Spiro said they did not check the rounds in the gun to ensure it was safe for Baldwin to use.\n\n\"There were people responsible for firearms safety, but actor Alec Baldwin committed no crime,\" Spiro told the court.\n\nHutchins was killed, and director Joel Souza wounded when Baldwin's reproduction 1873 Single Action Army revolver fired a live round, inadvertently loaded by Gutierrez.\n\nSince a police interview on October 21 in 2021, the day of the shooting, Baldwin has argued the gun just \"went off.\"\n\nIn an ABC News interview two months later, Baldwin told George Stephanopoulos he did not pull the trigger. A 2022 FBI test found the gun was in normal working condition and would not fire from full cock without the trigger being pulled.\n\nIn a sign the defence was backing away from that position, Spiro said that even if Baldwin pulled the trigger, it was not a crime. He said it was the job of Gutierrez and Halls to safely allow an actor \"to wave it, to point it, to pull the trigger, like actors do.\"\n\n\"On a movie set you're allowed to pull the trigger, so even if he intentionally pulled the trigger, as prosecutors said, that doesn't mean he committed a homicide,\" Spiro said.\n\nState prosecutors charged Baldwin with involuntary manslaughter in January 2022. They dropped charges three months later after Baldwin's lawyers presented photographic evidence the gun was modified, arguing it would fire more easily, bolstering the actor's accidental discharge argument.\n\nProsecutors called a grand jury to reinstate the charge in January after an independent firearms expert confirmed the 2022 FBI study.\n\n\"He pointed the gun at another human being, cocked the hammer and pulled the trigger in reckless disregard for miss Hutchins' safety,\" Johnson said.\n\nArmorer Gutierrez, whose job on the set of Rust included managing firearms safely, was convicted of involuntary manslaughter in March for loading the live round and jailed for 18 months.\n\nLawyer Gloria Allred, representing Hutchins' parents and sister in a lawsuit against Baldwin, was

I know that you're representing them. What would you like to see done at the end of this trial, which is pretty obvious, but I would like to hear from you.Gloria Allred: Halyna's father has said this was in his victim impact statement that I read at the sentencing of Hannah Gutierrez, the armorer, who was convicted of involuntary manslaughter of Halyna. He said that he would like to see everyone who may be responsible for the death of Halyna have to face the consequences. So, we'll look forward to seeing what the evidence proves in this case. But they do want to know the truth of what happened. And in a way, I'm glad they were not in court this morning because if they saw on the video what I saw: Halyna being placed on a stretcher, medics trying to save her life, seeing her beautiful blonde hair for the last time she's placed on a helicopter to take her to the hospital. And she did not survive the bullet that went into her from the gun held by Alec Baldwin that the bullet was discharged from went right through her, I don't think they would have been able to stay in the courtroom after that.Faith Egbuonu: I know the defense right now, they're arguing that their client, actor Alec Baldwin, is not responsible for this. He did not pull the trigger. What's your take on that?Gloria Allred: Alec Baldwin's attorneys are arguing that he was not responsible, that he's not liable, that he's not guilty, that essentially, he didn't follow, and he didn't have to follow safety protocols. There will be expert testimony. The prosecution said this morning from witnesses who will testify that anyone who holds a gun in their hand and points it at another human being should assume it is loaded and should assume that if it's discharged, that whatever is in the chamber is discharged, that it could destroy another human being or anyone else or anything else to which it's pointed. So, whether or not he pulled the trigger and of course, he denied it in his interview with George Stephanopoulos on ABC, first of all, I think the prosecution is going to present evidence that they will hopefully persuade the jury that, in fact, he did pull the trigger, even though he denied it and that the evidence will also be in the FBI expert's testimony, which will be that, that gun could not have discharged anything from its chambers, from its rounds if the trigger was not pulled. So, we'll see what the evidence proves because the arguments of counsel, either defense or prosecution, are not evidence. They're just arguments. Evidence is only, as the jury instructed, were instructed this morning by the judge, is only what the witnesses will testify to or documentary evidence that is presented in this case.

Evidence is only, as the jury instructed, were instructed this morning by the judge, is only what the witnesses will testify to or documentary evidence that is presented in this case.\n\nFaith Egbuonu: Thank you for your time.\n\nStay updated on the latest news updates with the KOAT app. You can download it here.", "source": {"uri": "koat.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KOAT 7"}, "authors": [{"uri": "faith_egbuonu@koat.com", "name": "Faith Egbuonu", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halyna_Hutchins", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Halyna Hutchins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gloria_Allred", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gloria Allred"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alec_Baldwin", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alec Baldwin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KOAT-TV", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "KOAT-TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinematographer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cinematographer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Fe_County,_New_Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Santa Fe County, New Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Santa Fe County, New Mexico"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weapons_master", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Weapons master"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Medic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manslaughter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manslaughter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expert_witness", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Expert witness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicopter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Helicopter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Stephanopoulos", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "George Stephanopoulos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plea", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Plea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Documentary film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gun_Control", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gun Control", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Evidence_Based_Medicine", "label": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Evidence Based Medicine", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Tractor_and_Truck_Pulling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Tractor and Truck Pulling", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://kubrick.htvapps.com/vidthumb/images/gloria1-668f32254a326.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=640:*", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719280", "eventUri": "eng-9719280", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-10", "textStart": 166, "textEnd": 173, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 136, "relevance": 1}

Nicholas LeFleur was the first law enforcement officer to arrive at Bonanza Creek Ranch after the shooting, the Associated Press reported. Bodycam footage shown in the courtroom captured the frantic efforts to save Hutchins.\n\nEarlier Wednesday, prosecutor Erlinda Johnson delivered the opening statement for the prosecution, telling jurors that a prop gun \"is a real gun\" and alleging that Baldwin requested to be assigned the biggest gun available. Johnson said Baldwin mishandled the gun on set, such as using it as a pointer.\n\nThroughout Johnson's opening statement, the prosecution played photos from the set, including photos of Hutchins and the church where the shooting took place behind her, Baldwin in costume, the church surrounded with crime scene tape and of emergency personnel working.\n\nAlex Spiro then began the defense's opening statement, telling the jury that critical safety issues on the set were not Baldwin's fault -- that safety checks should be performed before a gun goes into an actor's hand. The defense played scenes during the opening statement that included the director's comments to Baldwin to repeat the scene, which Spiro said indicated no one thought there was any danger from the gun.\n\nJury selection Tuesday was marked by delays, with the questioning of the 70 potential jurors starting several hours later than expected. But by the end of the day, that pool had been winnowed to 16 jurors, four of whom are alternates. The 11 women and five men seated will hear the case over the coming weeks and decide whether to convict the 66-year-old actor.\n\nAround 2 p.m. local time on Oct. 21, 2021, a prop firearm held by Baldwin went off, killing Hutchins and wounding director Joel Souza during a rehearsal in a small church on the set. Baldwin, the Western's star and coproducer, has said he pulled back the Colt .45's hammer, but did not pull the trigger.\n\nAuthorities were called to the set at the Bonanza Creek Ranch and Hutchins was taken to the University of New Mexico Hospital in Albuquerque via helicopter, where she died of her injuries, according to the sheriff's office at the time.\n\nAuthorities who searched the set recovered live ammunition. The New Mexico Office of the Medical Investigator determined in 2022 that the incident was an accident.\n\nAlec Baldwin faces a charge of involuntary manslaughter, a felony. If convicted, he could face up to a year and a half in prison. He has pleaded not guilty.\n\nHe was initially charged in January 2023 but prosecutors dismissed those counts three months later. Prosecutors again indicted Baldwin on a charge of involuntary manslaughter in January.\n\nBaldwin asked for the charge to be dismissed, but the judge overseeing the case rejected his request.\n\nJudge Mary Marlowe Sommer is presiding over the trial in New Mexico's First District Court, in Santa Fe.\n\nThe judge set the trial calendar to run from July 9-19. Jury selection was completed Tuesday and opening statements started on Wednesday. Courtroom proceedings are expected to conclude by July 19, after which the case will go to the jury for deliberations.\n\nCourt began at 8:30 a.m. MDT, 10:30 a.m. EDT.\n\nWhile cameras were not allowed in the courtroom during jury selection, the trial will be livestreamed.\n\nBaldwin's attorneys have not said whether the actor will take the stand in his own defense. The actor has been in court for proceedings and is expected to attend every day.\n\nThe state's witness list contains 44 names, while the defense lists 14 individuals as potential witnesses.\n\nWhile prosecutors wanted to call the film's armorer, Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, who has already been convicted of involuntary manslaughter in the case, the judge ruled in June she could not be compelled to testify against Baldwin though she remains on the prosecution's list of potential witnesses. She did not testify in her own defense.\n\nOn the prosecution's list of dozens of potential witnesses is Joel Souza, the film's director who was also wounded in the shooting, along with several people who also also testified at Gutierrez-Reed's trial, such as Seth Kenney, who owned the prop weapons company that supplied the film's ammunition; Wyatt Mortenson, a stuntman on the film; and Gabrielle Pickle, a line producer.\n\nThe defense's shorter list of potential witnesses includes David Halls, assistant director and safety coordinator; Ryan Winterstern, a producer who also testified in Gutierrez-Reed's trial; and other members of the crew, among others.\n\nThe Los Angeles-based Hutchins, 42, was a self-described \"restless dreamer\" and \"adrenaline junkie\" who grew up on a remote Soviet military base. The Ukranian-born cinematographer earned a degree in International Journalism from Kyiv National University and graduated from the American Film Institute conservatory. Widely regarded as a rising star, her work included \"Archenemy,\" starring Joe Manganiello, \"Blindfire\" and \"Darlin',\" which premiered at the SXSW film festival in 2019.\n\nBaldwin announced in 2022 he had settled a wrongful death lawsuit with Hutchins' family: her husband, Matthew Hutchins, and their son, Andros.\n\nHannah Gutierrez-Reed, the armorer who oversaw firearms on the set, was also charged with involuntary manslaughter. Though she pleaded not guilty, she was convicted in March and sentenced to 18 months behind bars after a trial overseen by the same judge overseeing Baldwin's case. Gutierrez-Reed was acquitted on a charge of tampering with evidence.\n\nEarlier, Halls pleaded no contest to unsafe handling of a firearm. Halls, who agreed to cooperate in the shooting investigation, received a suspended sentence of six months probation.\n\nThe production company overseeing the movie was fined $136,000, the maximum under state law, by New Mexico's Occupational Health and Safety Bureau over the incident.", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

They jumped right into testimony after opening statements Wednesday morning.\n\nWe already heard from witnesses, which were the first deputies getting to the Bonanza Creek Ranch that fateful day in October 2021.\n\nOpening statements is where the day started, and this moment in the trial is crucial because they laid out the roadmap for how both sides plan to persuade this jury.\n\nThe state's case is headed up by special prosecutor Kari Morrissey. She is the same prosecutor who secured a conviction against the \"Rust\" armorer, Hannah Gutierrez Reed.\n\nIt was Erlinda Johnson, the other special prosecutor on this case, that took center stage during opening statements.\n\nShe spent a significant amount of time on the gun, how Baldwin wanted the biggest gun he could get, how the film was on a tight budget. She was also trying to set a foundation for how Baldwin acted recklessly throughout the filming process.\n\nJohnson then described the victim in this case, Halyna Hutchins, the film's cinematographer, as a rising star before Baldwin shot and killed her.\n\n\"The evidence will show ladies and gentlemen, like in many workplaces there are people who act in a reckless manner, and place other individuals in danger, and act without due regard for the safety of others. That you will hear was the defendant, Alexander Baldwin,\" said Johnson.\n\nThe style between the prosecution and defense was evident in a big way in openings. The prosecutors are really narrowly sticking to the facts and the evidence.\n\nThere are really two facets of Baldwin's defense, based on his attorney's opening statements Wednesday.\n\nFirst, Baldwin had no connection to the actual lethal aspect of this shooting, which is the live bullet that got loaded into the prop gun.\n\nBaldwin's attorney, Alex Spiro, went over the checks and balances system in place prior to Baldwin being handed that gun. That involved armorer Hannah Gutierrez Reed, and assistant director David Halls, who both allegedly declared the gun was cold.\n\nSpiro argues there's no way Baldwin could have assumed, whether getting an all clear from Gutierrez Reed and Hall or not, that the gun used in that scene could in any way harm, let alone kill, a person. That's because there should be absolutely no reason a live bullet would be on any movie set.\n\nSpiro explained to the jury, safety should be confirmed way before a weapon is ever handed to an actor. When Baldwin got the weapon that fateful day, he was led to believe by Gutierrez Reed and Halls, it was completely safe.\n\n\"On this movie set there were people responsible for ensuring the safety of the set and the firearm, those people failed in their duties. But Alec Baldwin committed no crime. The most critical issue in this case is how a real bullet got on a movie set,\" said Spiro.\n\nThat's something we still don't know. Santa Fe County deputies nor prosecutors have ever determined how a live round got onto the \"Rust\" set and into that prop gun.\n\nIn fact, Spiro seemingly tried to convince the jury because investigators could never answer that question. Instead, they went after the most high-profile aspect of this case, Alec Baldwin himself.\n\n\"They don't find the lethal bullet. They never did, they never did. And as things roll in to police and prosecutors, cell phones, photos and forensics, looking for this shiny object, they found another shiny object. Instead of trying to find the source of the lethal bullet, they focused on Mr. Baldwin,\" said Spiro.\n\nBut this is not just about the death of a woman who lived out-of-state, or holding a Hollywood actor responsible.

At the center of the trial is a tragic incident that occurred on the set of \"Rust\" in 2021 after Alec's prop gun shot and injured director Joel Souza and killed cinematographer, Halyna Hutchins. Following a thorough investigation, and plenty of lawsuits, officials charged Alec with involuntary manslaughter. He has pleaded not guilty. With the trial beginning, Alec was present in the courtroom, but he wasn't alone. Stephen and Alec's wife, Hilaria Baldwin, showed their support for the actor by joining him in court. A sweet gesture that was quickly overshadowed by the brother's distracting hair (below).\n\nThe brotherly duo attempted to look professional with slicked back hair, but they both missed some pieces. Alec's locks, which were combed over to one side, had pieces of hair sticking out on the side that wasn't slicked over. As for Stephen, he has taken on the trendy hairstyle of a mullet. Like his brother, he used gel to comb his hair back, but he either ran out or couldn't reach the back of his head because the bottom of his locks were free to move about in a messy way.

Pictured: Baldwin with the deceased Halyna Hutchins (centre) and film crew\n\nThe stakes for Baldwin are incredibly high and were starkly illustrated in February when Gutierrez-Reed went on trial and was found guilty for the same charges in the same court.\n\nIn her opening statement, Erlinda Johnson, a special prosecutor appointed to the case, said that Baldwin had 'violated the cardinal rules of firearm safety' and that he was 'reckless' on set.\n\nA similar incident occurred on the set of a Bliss n Eso music video filmed on the Gold Coast in January 2017, in which Australian martial artist Johann Ofner was fatally shot dead by a prop shot gun.\n\nRead More Kyle Sandilands loses his licence for the NINTH time - and threatens to leave Australia", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Sandilands", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Sandilands"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinematographer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cinematographer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alec_Baldwin", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alec Baldwin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manslaughter", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manslaughter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henderson,_Nevada", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Henderson, Nevada"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Henderson, Nevada"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prop_gun", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prop gun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Souza", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joel Souza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halyna_Hutchins", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Halyna Hutchins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schapelle_Corby", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Schapelle Corby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Film producer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Mexico"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coming out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prop", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bliss_n_Eso", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bliss n Eso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_crew", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Film crew"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martial_arts", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Martial arts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_video", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Music video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearm", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Firearm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_Coast,_Queensland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gold Coast, Queensland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gold Coast, Queensland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/07/10/23/87182713-0-image-a-10_1720652167983.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719280", "eventUri": "eng-9719280", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2017-01-", "textStart": 3079, "textEnd": 3091}], "sentiment": -0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 128, "relevance": 1}

If a jury unanimously convicts him, he could get 18 months in prison.\n\nTwo major themes will predominate, one large, one small: the chaotic atmosphere of the movie set, and the details of the Italian-made classic revolver that Baldwin pointed at Hutchins.\n\nProsecutors have two alternative standards for proving the charge. One is based on the negligent use of a firearm. The other is proving beyond a reasonable doubt that Baldwin acted with total disregard or indifference for the safety of others.\n\nDespite the legal and technical complexities of the case, the 12 citizens of Santa Fe County that will make up the jury will have to reach just one verdict -- guilty or not guilty -- on the single count.\n\nMore from this section\n\nFlexClip Back-to-School Campaign: 40% Education Discounts and Extra 700 Free AI Credits\n\nAvenu Insights & Analytics Launches Avenu | Records: Transforming Document Management for Local Governments\n\nVice Capital Markets Launches Integration with Fannie Mae Mission Score API", "source": {"uri": "kulr8.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KULR-8 Local News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@kulr8.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alec_Baldwin", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alec Baldwin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Mexico"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halyna_Hutchins", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Halyna Hutchins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinematographer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cinematographer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convict", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Convict"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolver", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Revolver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manslaughter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manslaughter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atmosphere"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extra_(American_TV_program)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Extra (American TV program)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reasonable_doubt", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reasonable doubt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fannie_Mae", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fannie Mae"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_(magazine)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vice (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearm", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Firearm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plea", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Plea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Fe_County,_New_Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Santa Fe County, New Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Santa Fe County, New Mexico"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Competition_Shooting", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Competition Shooting", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Organizations", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 70}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/kulr8.com/content/tncms/custom/image/ebec0578-57d0-11ee-978f-b7da313020af.jpg?resize=600%2C315", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719280", "eventUri": "eng-9719280", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 109, "relevance": 1}

As Colorado was already well on their way to winning, leading 8-2, a third out in the top of the fourth led Rockies pitcher Cal Quantrill to really let Red Sox catcher Reese McGuire know how he felt about him.\n\nAs the right-handed pitcher walked to his dugout, fired up from just ending the top of the inning on a fly out, he looked right at McGuire and got very specific with his trash talk. There's no recorded audio, but the lip reading of Quantrill in the now viral video appears to go something like:\n\nNow, who is to say whether or not Quantrill started the verbal back-and-forth? Maybe Reese McGuire said something as he ran to first base that caused the Rockies pitcher to counter with that NSFW line?\n\nAll we do know is that whatever Quantrill yelled triggered an all-out, benches-clearing brawl between the two MLB teams. The league surely wasn't happy to see a fight between the Rockies and the Red Sox, but everyone in attendance at Coors Field in Denver, Colorado absolutely loved it.\n\nIn case you were wondering why Quantrill yelled that expletive-riddled line at McGuire, the catcher faced indecent exposure charges in Florida during his playing days with the Toronto Bluejays. Police were called to a shopping center, where Reese McGuire was allegedly in his car... you know what he was doing. He didn't fight the allegations and fully cooperated with the police.\n\nAs you can read more about in the context provided below the original post:\n\nThat's some A+ trash talking from Quantrill.

Red Sox catcher Reese McGuire worked his way to a full count before Rockies starting pitcher Cal Quantrill eventually forced him into an inning-ending flyout.\n\nAs McGuire made his obligatory trot down to first, Quantrill celebrated and immediately began trash talking the veteran. McGuire chirped back, and both benches cleared.\n\nNo one was ejected, no punches were thrown and the game moved along. The genesis of the pseudo brawl warranted a closer look, though.\n\nAdditional camera angles showed that Quantrill yelled expletives at McGuire, unprompted. He seemingly made comments about McGuire's arrest back in February 2020, and that set the catcher off.\n\nDuring Spring Training 2020, a 24-year-old McGuire was found masturbating in a parking lot in Dunedin, Florida. He was ultimately charged with a misdemeanor count of indecent exposure, accepting a $500 fine for disorderly conduct.\n\nMcGuire was a member of the Toronto Blue Jays at the time, but his time in Canada came to a close in 2022. The Red Sox acquired him from the Chicago White Sox at the trade deadline later that season, and he has remained Boston's backup catcher ever since.\n\nThrough 52 games this season, McGuire is batting .209 with three home runs, 18 RBI, a .575 OPS and a 0.2 WAR. The 29-year-old went 0-for-4 with a strikeout on Wednesday.\n\nQuantrill, on the other hand, allowed six hits, two walks and two earned runs in 6.0 innings of work. He is now 7-7 with a 4.09 ERA, 1.338 WHIP and a 2.2 WAR through the first 21 starts of his age 29 season.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cal_Quantrill", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cal Quantrill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Red_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Red Sox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Rockies", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Rockies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Catcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reese_McGuire", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reese McGuire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Out (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starting_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Starting pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_training", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spring training"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Batting average (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indecent_exposure", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indecent exposure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wins_Above_Replacement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wins Above Replacement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walks_plus_hits_per_inning_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Walks plus hits per inning pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_White_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago White Sox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Innings pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Earned run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-base_plus_slugging", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "On-base plus slugging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Blue_Jays", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Toronto Blue Jays"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_on_balls", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Base on balls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunedin,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dunedin, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dunedin, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_5127,h_2883,x_0,y_117/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/fastball/01j3ka8s11608rb7j64d.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9760980", "eventUri": "eng-9760980", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2020-02-", "textStart": 828, "textEnd": 841}], "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 204, "relevance": 1}

Red Sox outfielder Jarren Duran was particularly heated and had to be held back by coaches and pitcher Nick Pivetta.\n\nThe incident occurred 20 years to the day after the famous brawl between the Red Sox and Yankees in 2004, which started after Jason Varitek pushed Alex Rodriguez in what became one of that season's most indelible images.", "source": {"uri": "bostonherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Boston Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mac_cerullo@bostonherald.com", "name": "Mac Cerullo", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cal_Quantrill", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cal Quantrill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reese_McGuire", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reese McGuire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batted_ball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Batted ball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Center fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Red_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston Red Sox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Catcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Rockies", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Rockies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullpen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bullpen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Pivetta", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nick Pivetta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Varitek", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jason Varitek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Rodriguez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alex Rodriguez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Yankees", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Yankees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Outfielder"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/AP24206744178173.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9760980", "eventUri": "eng-9760980", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 198, "relevance": 1}

After taking care of McGuire, Quantrill delivered some trash talk that suddenly ignited a bench-clearing brawl between the two teams:\n\nFrom this angle, you can see an animated Quantrill getting fired up immediately and talking to McGuire immediately after contact was made on the baseball:\n\nSo, what did Quantrill say to McGuire that caused the heated brawl? Lip readers on X/Twitter were able to uncover the answer.\n\nIt appears as though Cal Quantrill was making fun of McGuire's February 2020 arrest for indecent exposure in Dunedin, Florida. McGuire was arrested in a shopping mall and later pleaded no contest, receiving a $500 fine for the offense.

He had a phenomenal outing against a dynamic Boston lineup, allowing just two earned runs in six innings of work as the Rockies cruised to a 20-7 victory.\n\nMcGuire was 0-for-4 at the plate on Wednesday, striking out once in a loss that dropped Boston to 54-46. The Red Sox have now lost five of six coming out of the All-Star Break and will try to rebound when they begin a three-game set against the New York Yankees at Fenway Park on Friday.\n\nCal Quantrill Is A Hot Candidate To Be Moved At Trade Deadline\n\nPlayoff contenders and World Series hopefuls are always looking to bolster their pitching ahead of the trade deadline. So expect the Rockies to receive plenty of offers for Quantrill as the July 30 deadline approaches.\n\nQuantrill is having a fine season on a struggling Rockies team, sporting a 4.09 ERA with 86 strikeouts in 114.1 innings pitched. He's also just two years removed from a 15-win season with the Cleveland Guardians, so contenders should be keen to roll the dice on Quantrill with the idea he can regain that star-like form.", "source": {"uri": "totalprosports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Total Pro Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alex_hoegler@totalprosports.com", "name": "Alex Hoegler", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reese_McGuire", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Reese McGuire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cal_Quantrill", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cal Quantrill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Red_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Red Sox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Rockies", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Rockies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bench-clearing_brawl", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bench-clearing brawl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batted_ball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Batted ball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Center fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National League (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_White_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicago White Sox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunedin,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dunedin, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dunedin, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Guardians", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Guardians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fenway_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fenway Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Yankees", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Yankees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Innings pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Earned run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trade (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major League", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Trading", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Trading", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.totalprosports.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/calquantrillreesemcguire.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9760980", "eventUri": "eng-9760980", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-30", "textStart": 2031, "textEnd": 2038}, {"amb": false, "date": "2020-02-", "textStart": 774, "textEnd": 787}], "sentiment": -0.2235294117647059, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

They had to be separated as both benches and bullpens ran onto the field, but the situation calmed down without any ejections.\n\nLater, video surfaced online of Quantrill taunting McGuire by appearing to yell: 'You j***ed off in a f***ing parking lot you dumb f***.'\n\nAs a member of the Toronto Blue Jays in 2020, McGuire was arrested for indecent exposure during spring training after he was allegedly caught masturbating in his car while parked at a Dollar Tree parking lot in Florida. He ultimately pleaded no contest to a disorderly conduct charge and paid a $500 fine.\n\nCoincidentally, Quantrill is the son of former New York Yankees reliever Paul Quantrill, who was involved in a brawl with the Red Sox exactly 20 years ago Wednesday. That melee is best known for Boston catcher Jason Varitek punching New York's Alex Rodriguez during a standoff at home plate.\n\nAs for Wednesday, things cooled down without incident or anyone being ejected.\n\nBrenton Doyle hit his first career grand slam, Ezequiel Tovar and Jacob Stallings homered and finished with three hits each, and Colorado obliterated Boston by 13 runs.\n\nRyan McMahon also went deep, Brendan Rodgers had four hits, and Kris Bryant and Michael Toglia had three hits for Colorado, which tied with a franchise high in runs, and its 21 hits were a season high.\n\nJarren Duran homered, tripled and singled, Rafael Devers had three hits, Ceddanne Rafaela had two hits and infielder Dominic Smith pitched a clean eighth inning for the Red Sox.\n\nTovar extended his hitting streak to 11 games with his 17th home run leading off the bottom of the first off right-hander Nick Pivetta. Colorado tacked on two more runs in the inning on Rodgers' double to left center.\n\nBoston got a run back in the second when McGuire reached on a fielding error and Devers scored, but the Rockies extended the lead to 5-1 with two runs in the bottom of the inning.\n\nStallings' three-run homer in the third inning, his fifth of the season, made it 8-1.\n\nPivetta (4-7) allowed 10 hits and eight runs (seven earned) in 2 2/3 innings.\n\nThe Rockies blew it open in the fourth on McMahon's two-run homer, his 15th, and Toglia's two-run double.\n\nDuran hit a solo homer in the fifth inning, his 13th of the season. Boston had two runners on in the sixth before Quantrill got Romy Gonzalez to hit into an inning-ending double play.\n\nQuantrill (7-7) allowed three runs on six hits in six innings.\n\nDoyle capped a six-run sixth with his grand slam -- his 17th homer of the season and 10th this month. Colorado has hit four grand slams this season.\n\nMcGuire's 2020 arrest briefly looked to put his once-promising career in jeopardy.\n\nA witness called police in Dunedin, Florida on Friday to report that the then-24-year-old was 'sitting and masturbating in a white Mercedes SUV in the parking lot,' according to an incident report provided to the Daily Mail. The team trains in Dunedin.\n\nMcGuire was charged with misdemeanor exposure of sexual organs.\n\n'The vehicle had perfectly clear tint and was occupied by a tall white male subject,' read the officer's report. 'As I approached the vehicle... I could clearly observe the male subject was naked from the waist down.\n\n'The subject's shirt tail was barely covering his genitals and his sweatpants were around his ankles. The subject, later identified by his Washington Driver's License as Reese Jackson McGuire, saw the Sheriff's Deputies approaching his vehicle and was hastily trying to pull his pants back up.'\n\nMcGuire was immediately apologetic and did not attempt to deny anything, police said.\n\n'Reese was instructed to make himself decent and then exit the vehicle,' the report continued.\n\n'As Reese exited the driver's side door, he repeatedly stated, \"I'm sorry, I'm so sorry, this is really embarrassing.\"\n\n'I asked Reese why his pants were down and he replied, \"I really shouldn't have been doing that.\"\n\nThe police also asked McGuire how he came to be parked in that particular strip mall.\n\nMcGuire, who said he is staying nearby, did not have a clear answer.\n\n'After lunch Reese stated he came to the parking lot and began \"hanging out,\"' the report said. 'I asked Reese why he came to this parking lot in particular. Reese stated he did not know, it just seemed like a good place. I pointed out the high foot traffic and vehicles in and around the entire parking lot and Reese acknowledged this.'\n\nPolice discovered the pornographic video when McGuire unlocked his phone to give officers the address at which he is staying during spring training.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Colorado was leading 8-2 at the time of the incident.\n\nWednesday afternoon's Laugher in LoDo had a little bit of everything.\n\nEn route to their 20-7 shellacking of the Red Sox, the Rockies mashed four home runs, including the first career grand slam of Brenton Doyle's career -- a blast that came off former Rockies right-hander Chase Anderson.\n\nColorado lambasted Boston pitchers for a season-high 21 hits on a 93-degree day at Coors Field where baseballs were jumping.\n\nThere was even a bench-clearing kerfuffle in the fourth inning, which began with harsh words between Rockies starter Cal Quantrill and Boston catcher Reese McGuire.\n\nThe Rockies' 20 runs tied a franchise high, accomplished four times. The last time they scored 20 was on Sept. 18, 2006, in a 20-8 victory over the Giants at Coors Field.\n\n\"The runs just kept coming today,\" veteran catcher Jacob Stalling said after going 3 for 4 and recording three extra-base hits in a game for the first time in his career. \"It's a credit to our guys. We did a really good job today getting hits off a really good pitcher in (Nick) Pivetta. And that's a really good staff over there.\"\n\nThe Rockies have suffered a power outage for several seasons, but they're hitting home runs at a rapid pace this summer. Since June 15, they have hit 58 homers in 33 games, the most in the majors.\n\nIn addition to Doyle's slam, Ezequiel Tovar led off the first with a homer, Stallings launched a three-run bomb in the third, and Ryan McMahon hit a two-run shot in Colorado's five-run fifth.\n\n\"Our offense is ticking up a little bit and we had some really good at-bats today against a good pitcher in Pivetta,\" manager Bud Black said. \"He elevated some pitches and we took advantage of that, for sure.\"\n\nThe game got tense in the fourth inning.\n\nQuantrill escaped a jam by getting McGuire to fly out to Doyle for the third out. Quantrill, a demonstrative pitcher, pumped his arms to celebrate and then exchanged heated words with McGuire as McGuire ran up the line.\n\nThe two players charged toward each other, and players from both benches and bullpens rushed onto the field. Stallings got between Quantrill and McGuire.\n\nNo punches were thrown and no one was ejected. Colorado was leading 8-2 at the time of the incident. It scored five runs in the bottom of the fifth to take a 13-3 lead.\n\nQuantrill made his 12th quality start, giving up three runs (two earned) on six hits over six innings. He struck out three and walked two. Quantrill is 3-2 with a 3.29 ERA in nine starts at Coors Field, and seven of them are quality starts.\n\n\"It's important to win in your stadium,\" said Quantrill, who's been the subject of trade rumors as next week's deadline looms. \"The key for us, if we want to become a championship-level team, is to win here. And find different ways to do it.\"\n\nMcMahon's home run was his first since June 22. The Rockies' lone All-Star had not hit a homer in 83 at-bats until he parked the ball off reliever Bailey Horn.\n\nThe Red Sox played sloppy baseball and were charged with four errors.", "source":

None, though, stands out like the fourth-inning near-brawl that was touched off when Rockies starter Cal Quantrill exchanged words with Red Sox catcher Reese McGuire following the latter's fly-out. Here's a look:\n\nQuantrill is a demonstrative and excitable sort on the mound, and that may have been the inciting incident here. As things unfolded, Quantrill shouted at McGuire and appeared to reference his 2020 arrest for indecent exposure (NSFW lip reading can be done here), which led to further hostilities.\n\nNo one was ejected, and thankfully, an outright brawl between the two teams was avoided. Afterward, Quantrill in the clubhouse addressed the incident:\n\nFor what it's worth -- and it may not be relevant at all to the current situation -- Quantrill, dating back to his Guardians days, has a sliver of history when it comes to showing exuberance following an out recorded against the Red Sox. Let's roll tape from 2022:\n\nIn this one, the 29-year-old Quantrill, acquired from Cleveland via trade last November, notched a quality start and picked up his seventh win of the season. McGuire went 0 for 4 at the plate.\n\nAs MLB.com's Thomas Harding notes, the occasion marked the anniversary of another, much more famous Boston brawl (a game that also featured a Quantrill on the mound):\n\n\"Maybe there's something about the Red Sox and July 24, because Wednesday marked the 20th anniversary of the famous face-shoving fracas between Jason Varitek and Alex Rodriguez, a game that also happened to feature a pitching appearance from Paul Quantrill, father of Cal.\"\n\nThe loss drops Boston to 54-47 on the season and 1 \u00bd games out of the third and final AL wild-card spot. The Red Sox are also in third place in the AL East and 6 \u00bd games behind the Orioles.", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dayn_perry@cbssports.com", "name": "Dayn Perry", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Quantrill", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paul Quantrill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Red_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Red Sox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Rockies", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Rockies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reese_McGuire", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reese McGuire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cal_Quantrill", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cal Quantrill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coors_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coors Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Catcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Varitek", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jason Varitek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Games_behind", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Games behind"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_start", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quality start"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Rodriguez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alex Rodriguez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League_East", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American League East"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_Orioles", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore Orioles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MLB.com", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "MLB.com"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Miniatures/Conventions", "label": "dmoz/Games/Miniatures/Conventions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2024/07/24/ab5d9317-6f25-4fb5-a06b-8b7acaad7b0f/thumbnail/1200x675/f77fb4f2328881f8def89a7abf475dec/quantrill-rockies-usatsi.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9760980", "eventUri": "eng-9760980", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-24", "textStart": 1677, "textEnd": 1684}], "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

over past arrest in tense...", "body": "Cal Quantrill appeared ready to bust this one out.\n\nDuring the top of the fourth inning of Thursday's Rockies-Red Sox matinee at Coors Field, the Colorado hurler got out of a two-out jam by inducing a flyout to center from Boston's Reese McGuire, but that's when things got heated -- and seemingly personal with some colorful language -- during a benches-clearing moment.\n\nAfter getting the fly ball, Quantrill yelled and lifted up his leg in a moment of exaltation, which seemed to upset McGuire, the Red Sox catcher, who then stopped running toward first base and turned his attention to the starting pitcher.\n\nWarning, graphic language\n\nThe two converged, with catcher Jacob Stallings in the middle, and jawed at each other when Quantrill appeared to mouth the words: \"You jacked off in a f-king parking lot, you dumb f-k.\"\n\nThis seemingly was a callback over four years in the making.\n\nMcGuire, in 2020, was arrested for allegedly masturbating in a Dunedin, Florida parking lot near the spring training facility of the Blue Jays, the organization he was playing for at the time.\n\nAfter first being charged with exposure of sexual organs -- a first-degree misdemeanor that's punishable with up to one year in jail -- McGuire pleaded no contest and faced just a $450 fine.\n\nThe two teams eventually emptied the dugouts, coming together along the first-base line in what became a heated moment that eventually cooled off with no physical altercation taking place.\n\nNo ejections were handed out after the moment fraught with tension, and Quantrill remained in the game, pitching for six innings, allowing three runs on six hits with three strikeouts.\n\nThe Rockies would go on to win the game 20-7.\n\nThe two nearly had a chance to face each other again in the top of the sixth inning, but Boston's Romy Gonzalez -- the hitter before McGuire -- hit into an inning-ending double play.\n\nRockies reliever Tyler Kinley then came on in the seventh inning to face McGuire.\n\nFittingly, the bench-clearing incident came 20 years to the day after the Red Sox and Yankees got into an infamous scuffle involving Alex Rodriguez, Bronson Arroyo and Jason Varitek..\n\nAnd to add another layer of connection to it all, Quantrill's dad, Paul, pitched 2/3 of an inning of relief for the Yankees that game.", "source":

McGuire, who didn't appreciate the unnecessary out-of-the-blue reaction to a routine flyout, directly approached Quantrill before being blocked off by Colorado catcher Jacob Stallings and the crowd of emptied benches and bullpens.\n\nPresumably, Quantrill's instigating tactics got the exact reaction that the 29-year-old was looking for from McGuire.\n\nBoston outfielder Jarren Duran needed to be restrained by the coaching staff and guided back to the dugout. The 27-year-old All-Star shouted back Quantrill's direction and backed it up by taking the right-hander 419 feet out of Coors Field, cutting Colorado's lead over the Red Sox to 13-3 in the fifth inning -- giving the Rockies the perfect response.\n\nIronically, the McGuire-Quantrill shoving match came on the 20th anniversary of the iconic Jason Varitek-Alex Rodriguez brawl between the Red Sox and New York Yankees in 2004. Granted, that multi-decade-old fight measures as one of the more violent Boston-related skirmishes, however, what's even more ironic is Cal being the son of ex-big leaguer Paul Quantrill, who started the Varitek-Rodriguez game at Fenway Park.\n\nBoston entered the series finale losers in four of its five games coming out of the All-Star break, placing the Red Sox six games back of the American League East and a single game behind the Kansas City Royals for the final AL wild-card spot.", "source": {"uri": "nesn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NESN"}, "authors": [{"uri": "gio_rivera@nesn.com", "name": "Gio Rivera", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Red_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Red Sox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Rockies", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Rockies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Catcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Batting average (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reese_McGuire", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reese McGuire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cal_Quantrill", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cal Quantrill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dugout_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dugout (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batted_ball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Batted ball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Center fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Stallings", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jacob Stallings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Quantrill", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paul Quantrill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullpen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bullpen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Outfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fenway_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fenway Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coors_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coors Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League_East", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American League East"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_card_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wild card (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Royals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Royals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Yankees", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Yankees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American League"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://nesn.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/07/Reese-McGuire.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9760980", "eventUri": "eng-9760980", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

History didn't necessarily repeat itself Wednesday but the Sox did get involved in a bit of a skirmish at Coors Field.\n\nWith two outs in the top of the fourth inning in a game the Rockies have led big since the first, Colorado starter Cal Quantrill appeared to scream loudly in celebration after he got Reese McGuire to pop out to end the inning with a man on third and preserve an 8-2 lead. McGuire appeared to take exception with Quantrill's yell and said something, only for Quantrill to go back at McGuire with a comment that seemed -- based on amateur lip-reading -- to reference an off-field legal issue from the catcher's past. McGuire momentarily charged toward Quantrill before Rockies catcher Jacob Stallings got in the middle to break it up. No punches were thrown as Rafael Devers, base coaches Kyle Hudson and Andy Fox broke things up before they got more heated.\n\nBoth teams' bullpens jogged in from the outfield and the teams briefly exchanged shoves on the first base line. Jarren Duran and Nick Pivetta appeared to be the most heated members of the Red Sox. The umpiring crew warned both teams and tempers did not flare for the rest of the game.\n\nThe Rockies scored multiple runs in each of the first four innings to get an early lead and chased Pivetta, who gave up eight runs (seven earned) on 10 hits in 2 \u2154 innings. Colorado tacked on six more runs in the sixth inning and leads 19-3 in the seventh to put the Red Sox on the verge of going 1-5 on their road trip to open the second half.\n\nTuesday was not the first time the Red Sox emptied their bench for a potential skirmish this year. On May 26 at Fenway Park, reliever Chris Martin and Brewers first base coach Quintin Berry briefly exchanged words before things settled down.\n\nCoincidentally, Quantrill's father Paul (who broke into the majors with the Red Sox from 1992-1994), pitched for the Yankees in that famous game on July 24, 2004. The Red Sox won, 11-10, on a Bill Mueller walk-off home run in the bottom of the ninth.", "source": {"uri": "masslive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MassLive"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cal_Quantrill", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cal Quantrill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Red_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boston Red Sox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Rockies", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Rockies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reese_McGuire", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reese McGuire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Varitek", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jason Varitek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Rodriguez", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alex Rodriguez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coors_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coors Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Yankees", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Yankees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Catcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarren_Duran", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jarren Duran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Stallings", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jacob Stallings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Pivetta", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nick Pivetta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Hudson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Daniel Hudson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "First baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullpen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bullpen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Outfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Devers", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Devers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Mueller", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bill Mueller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fenway_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fenway Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quintin_Berry", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quintin Berry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coach_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coach (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walk-off_home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Walk-off home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Brewers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Brewers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umpire_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Umpire (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Relief pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.masslive.com/resizer/v2/YWNUWO3UEZBQVBSOCRDVODKA4Q.jpg?auth=ba8857eb527ac5d7f8cba571690c147cf7f48ebc5337ad923084fe3a66594f24&width=1280&quality=90", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9760980", "eventUri": "eng-9760980", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-26", "textStart": 1795, "textEnd": 1801}, {"amb": false, "date": "2004-07-24", "textStart": 2084, "textEnd": 2097}], "sentiment": -0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

Tempers abruptly flared in the Wednesday afternoon matchup at Coors Field, and fans were treated to a bench-clearing spat in the fifth inning.\n\nRockies right-hander Cal Quantrill had an over-the-top reaction, shouting hysterically, after watching Red Sox catcher Reese McGuire's fly out to center to end the inning for Boston.\n\nIt was salt in the wound for McGuire, so he stepped out of the box and headed for the animated Quantril. Soon, players stepped out of their respective dugouts, and a beef broke out on the diamond.\n\nJarren Duran, the reigning All-Star Game MVP and Red Sox outfielder, was the biggest firecracker in the bunch, requiring Red Sox personnel to escort him back to the dugout.\n\nIt was one of those midday scenes that makes us sports fans grateful for baseball in July, with nothing else going on but a couple of pissed-off guys playing baseball in irritable heat.\n\nThe fuss appeared to arise unexpectedly and eventually subsided.\n\nA loose lip-reading of Quantrill's reaction showed the pitcher throwing some pretty heated language toward McGuire specifically. Online sleuths on X gathered that Quantrill yelled the following at McGuire: \"you j****d off in a f***ing parking lot you dumb f**k.\"\n\nBased on the video, Quantrill definitely said something along those lines.\n\nAnd the salacious dig at McGuire alluded to a misdemeanor count of indecent exposure he received in 2020, which OutKick's Joe Kinsey previously covered. Needless to say, Quantrill has no love loss for McGuire. Expect more fallout from this newly stirred rivalry.\n\nLater on, Jarren Duran managed to get some payback (if you can call it that) in the fifth inning with a home run, reducing the deficit to 13-3. Boston shut out Colorado on Tuesday with a score of 6-0.

The sequence started when McGuire took exception to Quantrill celebrating the inning-ending out that stranded a Boston runner on third. The Rockies led 8-2 at the time thanks to Ezquiel Tovar's second-career leadoff home run, Brendan Rodgers' two-run double later in the first, a couple of more Rockies runs in the second and Jacob Stallings' three-run homer in the third.\n\n\"Listen, I recognize we were up by whatever we were up by, but I celebrate when I get important outs, and he took offense to it,\" Quantrill said in the postgame locker room. \"Some words were exchanged. It's baseball. We'll all move on.\"\n\nQuantrill's words almost ignited a brawl. Video and amateur lip reading appears to show Quantrill hurl profanities at Boston's catcher while referencing a 2020 incident where McGuire was charged with exposure of sexual organs after he was caught masturbating in a Florida parking lot. Stallings had to hustle to prevent McGuire from getting to the 29-year-old righty as both teams rushed out of their dugouts and bullpens.\n\n\"I saw it all unfold, because I was pumped. So, I was like 'Let's go!' to Cal, and Cal was looking right at me,\" Stallings said.\n\n\"I know Reese from our Pirates days, and I knew Cal wasn't yelling at Reese initially, so I just wanted to calm things down before anything got too crazy. Luckily, I wasn't watching the ball. I was kind of locked into what was going on.\"\n\nThat was far from the only excitement on the day. The Rockies hitters continued to mash, as Ryan McMahon and Brenton Doyle, who hit the first grand slam of his career, homered in the latter innings to cement Quantrill's seventh win of the season. Quantrill didn't directly address what was said after his quality start, scattering three runs across six innings to go with one moment that won't soon be forgotten.\n\nSign Up for Pikes Peak 5 Game analysis and insights from The Gazette sports staff including columns by Woody Paige and Paul Klee.\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

The Rockies had a prime opportunity to break the record when the Red Sox turned to first baseman Dominic Smith to pitch the eighth, but the Rockies were retired in order in their last at-bat.\n\nOn the mound: Cal Quantrill improved to 7-7 on the season. Tyler Kinley added a scoreless inning of relief, while Peter Lambert gave up four runs in the final two innings. The Red Sox used six pitchers, none of which lasted longer than Nick Pivetta.\n\nAt the plate: Brenton Doyle's first-career grand slam and five RBIs highlighted Colorado's offense, while Jacob Stallings plated four runs and went 3 for 4 at the plate. Hilliard (3), Michael Toglia (2), Brendan Rodgers (2), Ryan McMahon (2) and Ezquiel Tovar (2) each drove in multiple runs for the Rockies.\n\nJarren Duran was Boston's offensive star, homering off Quantrill in the fifth and added a two-run triple in the ninth.\n\nUp next: The Rockies have a day off Thursday before starting a four-game series in San Francisco on Friday.", "source": {"uri":

Rockies starting pitcher Cal Quantrill forced him to fly out to center field, delivering some intense smack talk on his way back to the dugout.\n\nWe're not professional lip-readers here at FanSided, but luckily, social media is. You can see Quantrill delivering a rather personal and not-safe-for-work message to McGuire, referencing the latter's 2020 arrest for exposing his sexual organs in public. As a result, tensions flared, sparking the skirmish between the Red Sox and Rockies.\n\nBenches clear in Red Sox-Rockies after Cal Quantrill brings up Reese McGuire's legal troubles\n\nMcGuire was a member of the Toronto Blue Jays at the time he got detained. During the incident, he reportedly was seen in an SUV in the parking lot of a strip mall in Dunedin, Florida. Clearly, Quantrill hasn't forgotten about the matter, reminding the veteran backstop of his past off-field transgressions.\n\nOverall, the drama unfolded and ended in short order. It wasn't long before the Red Sox and Rockies returned to their regularly scheduled programming. Roughly a minute after the instance, both sides retreated to their respective bunkers. However, Boston fans probably got more amusement out of that than the blowout ballgame at Coors Field.\n\nColorado was already up 8-2 when the uproar initiated and has only expanded their lead since. The lowly Rockies shellacked the Red Sox 20-5, a stunning outcome considering the two clubs are trending in opposite directions.\n\nFalling to 54-47 following the loss, the Red Sox are fighting for one of the three highly contested Wild Card spots in the American League.

The tempers on the field got even hotter during a benches-clearing brawl with some creative language that happened during the fourth inning.\n\nThe Rockies beat Boston, 20-6, as Colorado tied a franchise-record for runs scored in a game. The Rockies crushed four home runs, including a sixth inning grand slam by outfielder Brenton Doyle. Colorado is the second worst team in the National League this season -- the win moved the club to 38-65 on the year -- but they just took two of three from Boston.\n\nColorado's incredible show of force display at the plate was somehow overshadowed by the brawl. After Rockies starter Cal Quantrill got Boston catcher Reese McGuire to fly out, the pitcher began pumping his fist in celebration. McGuire took exception to what he considered showboating and started barking at him. Quantrill then escalated the situation by bringing up the time McGuire was arrested for, uh, playing with himself in his car.\n\nWatch the video here:\n\nHere's a better look at Quantrill's exchange with McGuire.\n\nMcGuire was arrested in 2020 for \"exposure of sexual organs\" after being caught masterbating in a parking lot. To quote one philosopher, \"people don't forget.\"\n\nBoston had a strong start to the year, but it's freefalling to come out of the All-Star break by losing five of six. A series against the hapless Rockies was supposed to count for a few easy wins, but instead the BoSox got embarrassed in more ways than one.\n\nBoston was already down 8-2 when the benches-clearing brawl happened. Quantrill stayed in the game and finished with a six-inning performance that saw him give up six hits and two earned runs while striking out three.\n\nLosing to the Rockies in epic fashion is humiliating enough.

It'll be closer to July 31 when that happens.\n\nThat's the day the Red Raiders begin preseason practice, and Tech coach Joey McGuire plans to make August a month of putting his team -- the offense, in particular -- into simulated road-game environments.\n\n\"We're going to try to make the offense as uncomfortable as possible,\" McGuire said. \"I've never had the offense on the visitors' sideline. I know that sounds stupid, but we're going to make them come in on the visitors' sideline. We're going to put crowd noise behind them during the scrimmage.\"\n\nThe Red Raiders are 10-3 at home under McGuire and 3-8 on the road. The disparity has made improvement on the road a point of emphasis.\n\nRelated: Why Joey McGuire is going to Detroit to see Lions coach Dan Campbell\n\nMore: Updating the dates to know on Texas Tech football facilities projects\n\nTwo months ago, McGuire and four other Tech staff members went to Detroit to observe the Lions' second session of offseason organized team activities. One of the points of the trip was to visit with Lions coach Dan Campbell, whose team went 6-3 in regular-season road games last year, including wins over the Super Bowl champion Kansas City Chiefs, two other playoff teams and two teams who'd made the playoffs the year before.\n\n\"It was great, man,\" McGuire said. \"Dan Campbell is creating a monster. Just the atmosphere, the environment, the pace of practice. I got to talk to him for about 45 minutes, just on different things. We're going to incorporate some stuff he talked about, how they practiced. We're going to do it during camp.\"\n\nThe Red Raiders have used crowd noise over loudspeakers in practice during game preparation. That's nothing new, but it's commonly used in season on weeks of road games. McGuire hopes the attention paid in August will pay off, especially when the Red Raiders go to TCU, Iowa State and Oklahoma State in late October and November.\n\n\"We're going to start it off during camp,\" McGuire said, \"because at the end of the day, if we're going to be in the mix for who's going to be playing the Big 12 championship, we've got to win on the road. We've got to be able to go into Ames, we've got to be able to go into Stillwater, we've got to be able to go into Fort Worth late in the season and win those games.\"\n\nMore: Texas Tech football's Joey McGuire updates status of Micah Hudson, other rehabbing players", "source": {"uri": "eu.lubbockonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Lubbock Avalanche-Journal"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lubbock_avalanche_journal@eu.lubbockonline.com", "name": "Lubbock Avalanche-Journal", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joey_McGuire", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joey McGuire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Campbell", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dan Campbell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Tech_Red_Raiders_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Texas Tech Red Raiders football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_State_Cougars_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington State Cougars football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa_State_Cyclones_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iowa State Cyclones football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_State_Cowboys_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma State Cowboys football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCU_Horned_Frogs_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TCU Horned Frogs football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_12_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Big 12 Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Chiefs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Chiefs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ames,_Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ames, Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ames, Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Worth,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fort Worth, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Fort Worth, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stillwater,_Oklahoma", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stillwater, Oklahoma"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Stillwater, Oklahoma"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Canadian", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Canadian", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads_and_Highways/Periodicals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads and Highways/Periodicals", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/images/smg/2024/07/13/USAT/74390616007-USATSI_19495662.jpeg?auto=webp&crop=5567,3133,x0,y289&format=pjpg&width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9760980", "eventUri": "eng-9760980", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-07", "textStart": 173, "textEnd": 180}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-31", "textStart": 288, "textEnd": 295}], "sentiment": -0.0980392156862745, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

It is also worth noting that this play was the last before they started the fifth inning. Then, tempers flared up inside Reese McGuire's head. The Red Sox player spoke in a heavy tone against the Rockies pitcher. Immediately, the two started walking towards each other and were very near to squaring off in the field.\n\nA lot of speculations and lip readers posit that the Rockies pitcher said something about the Red Sox catcher's incident in a parking lot. Obviously, this would open up wounds regarding McGuire's case for indecent exposure. The Red Sox catcher had been arrested in 2020 for the case but then just had to pay a fine after not contesting the verdict.

At the same time, he began creating his own YouTube content, primarily videos about FIFA and football more generally, while also recreating famous Vine clips.

Then he has what he describes as his main channel, which has 2.1million followers, which he rarely posts on. He explained: 'My main TikTok, I've earned \u00a3637.' Conceding that he hasn't posted a huge number of videos, he did point out that a recent clip had garnered a massive 19million views, with others also racking up huge numbers.

'Simon from Sidemen, say whatever you want about your mate KSI who lost,' he said on Instagram. 'But don\u2019t ever mention my daughter\u2019s name again or me and you\u2019re going to have a problem. Keep my child\u2019s name out of your mouth.' KSI then stuck up for his Sidemen friend with a tweet designed to invoke fury. 'Bambi,' he wrote on X, responding to Fury's video. Minter has previously spoken out about what it means to be a sideman. Speaking previously in a video, Minter said: 'A sideman is basically someone's b**** who just follows them around...

This line of custom-designed, printable puppets aims to empower children - no matter how they learn - and their families by encouraging creative expression.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Experts emphasize the importance of creative outlets, especially as screen time continues to impact the way we connect with one another, which can be particularly difficult for neurodivergent kids to navigate. Hands-on creative activities, such as puppet crafting, offer a therapeutic alternative that helps neurodivergent children express themselves more effectively while significantly enhancing social engagement.\n\nPrint Pals was inspired by Stacey Gordon's artistic background, experiences as a former autism therapist and mother of neurodivergent children. Gordon is also known for creating Julia, the first autistic character on Sesame Street.\n\n\"I've seen firsthand how the magic of puppetry can transform playtime into a social-emotional learning opportunity for kids and parents,\" said Gordon. \"Using puppets to communicate and story-tell in a way that represents diverse experiences and perspectives allows us to understand each other better and promote empathy and inclusion.\"\n\nPrint Pals offers two styles of puppets for kids of all ages and a variety of characters and customization options, allowing kids to personalize their puppets with different eyes, mouths, and arms. These printable activities will be available for free on HP's website starting June 13.\n\nTo further fuel advocacy, understanding and action, HP has teamed up with Kylie Kelce and its charitable partner EAF to bring Print Pals to life in the community. An advocate from childhood, Kelce works to champion and raise awareness for the neurodiversity community through her continued work with EAF. Kelce and EAF will introduce Print Pals to their community as a resource to create more inclusion and accessibility for children and families.\n\nAs Neurodiversity Pride Day approaches, Print Pals provides a simple yet magical, screen-free activity that can bring the whole family together -- kids, parents, and grandparents alike -- to drive connection and improve wellbeing while at home from school this summer and beyond.\n\nTags Dcc Wire Tncen Loffredi Travel\n\nOriginally published on julielo.com, part of the BLOX Digital Content Exchange.\n\nNeed to get away?\n\nStart exploring

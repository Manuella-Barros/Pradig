The Jets managed only 3 yards of offense in the first quarter and just two first downs in the first half.\n\nJets quarterback Josh McCown sat out this game, but Hackenberg did little to impress in his absence. Hackenberg was 2 of 6 for 14 yards and was sacked twice.\n\nStafford went 8 of 10 for 84 yards.\n\nMatt Prater kicked field goals of 37 and 25 yards in the first half, and his 50-yarder with 1:11 left in the fourth quarter put the Lions up 16-6.\n\nDetroit's depth along the defensive front is being tested because of injuries to Hyder and Ziggy Ansah, but the Lions looked fine in this game. On the very first series, Cornelius Washington came in unblocked and sacked Hackenberg, forcing a fumble that the Jets were able to recover.\n\nDetroit's Akeem Spence added a sack later in the first quarter. New York finished the half with minus-3 net yards passing.\n\nWith Matt Forte still recovering from a hamstring injury, Bilal Powell had nine carries for 32 yards for the Jets.\n\nStafford was fairly sharp for the Lions, but they managed only one touchdown. Jones made a nice catch in the back corner of the end zone and held on amid tight coverage from Morris Claiborne to put Detroit up 10-0.\n\nRoss Martin made field goals of 31 and 28 yards in the fourth quarter for the Jets, but he missed from 56 in the third.\n\nINJURIES\n\nJets: S Rontez Miles left with an eye laceration and was evaluated for a head injury.\n\nLions: lost WR TJ Jones in the first half to a hamstring issue, but they were able to avoid the type of major injury they had to deal with in their previous game.\n\nNICE MOMENT\n\nEastern Michigan coach Chris Creighton, whose team made it to a bowl last season, was interviewed on the big screen during a break in the action. That turned out to be one of the game's highlights, because Creighton used the opportunity to present senior wide receiver Jaron Johnson with a scholarship .\n\nOTHER QUARTERBACKS\n\nJets: Bryce Petty went 15 of 24 for 160 yards with an interception in relief of Hackenberg.\n\nLions: Jake Rudock went 8 of 13 for 84 yards with an interception, and Brad Kaaya was 4 of 7 for 38 yards.\n\n___\n\nFor more NFL coverage: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL .\n\nCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE\n\nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press.

The second-year signal-caller got a surprise start, but did nothing to convince anyone he is ready to start. In fact, Josh McCown probably won the quarterback competition by default without ever taking a snap.\n\nHackenberg went 2-for-6 passing for 14 yards and a 42.4 rating. He was sacked twice, fumbled once and did not lead the Jets to any points. Four of his five drives were three-and-outs. He managed just two first downs -- one throwing and one on which he scrambled. The Jets averaged 2.2 yards per play with him in the game, netting 43 yards total and minus-three passing. Hackenberg has failed to lead the Jets to any points in 13 possessions this preseason.\n\nHackenberg exited at halftime, giving way to Bryce Petty, who went 15-for-24 for 160 yards with an interception on a desperation throw with five seconds left in the game.\n\nAfter some positive steps in the first preseason game against the Titans when he was decisive and accurate if not spectacular, Hackenberg took a big step backward against the Lions. On the third play of the game, he was drilled by defensive end Cornelius Washington, who came in unblocked. Hackenberg fumbled, but guard James Carpenter recovered for the Jets. It looked as if Hackenberg did not call the right protection to account for Washington.\n\nOn the second drive, Hackenberg was nearly intercepted by safety Glover Quin on a pass that bounced off wide receiver Charone Peake's hands, but Quin dropped the ball.\n\nHackenberg was sacked again on the Jets' third series. Defensive tackle Akeem Spence blew past guard Brian Winters to sack Hackenberg, who took a three-step drop, but failed to get rid of the ball quickly.\n\nThe Jets' initial first down came with 13:22 left in the second quarter. Hackenberg used his feet to get it, scrambling for a 12-yard gain. He followed that up with a 17-yard pass to running back Bilal Powell on a short throw that Powell turned into a first down. Both of Hackenberg's completions went to Powell, who basically was the Jets' offense in the first half. Powell also rushed nine times for 32 yards.\n\nThe Jets' defense started strong. They held the Lions to a Matt Prater 37-yard field goal on Detroit's opening drive, which began at the Jets' 43-yard line. But Lions quarterback Matthew Stafford got his team moving on its third drive. Detroit went 78 yards on 11 plays, capped by a beautiful 5-yard touchdown pass by Stafford to wide receiver Marvin Jones over Jets cornerback Morris Claiborne that gave the Lions a 10-0 lead.\n\nThe most troubling moment of the night for the Jets' defense came near the end of the first half, when backup quarterback Jake Rudock moved the Lions down the field with ease against the Jets' starting defense. Rudock took the Lions 87 yards on 16 plays. The Jets held them to a 25-yard field goal from Prater that made it 13-0 at halftime.\n\nPetty led the Jets on two field-goal drives in the second half to avoid the shutout.\n\nIt is unlikely Bowles will announce his starting quarterback this week, but it is clear McCown will start the year as No. 1. McCown likely will get the bulk of the playing time next Saturday in the third preseason game, against the Giants. Hackenberg may get some time in the final preseason game against the Eagles, but Bowles' decision likely will be made before then. It is also tough to judge anything in the fourth preseason game when backups start.\n\nThis likely was Hackenberg's last shot at winning the job for Week 1 -- and he stumbled. Now, he will have to wait for his shot, which should come sometime in the middle of the year, unless McCown gets injured.\n\nbrian", "dateTime": "2017-08-20T03:45:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim":

Chris Pedota/NorthJersey.com\n\n1 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE\n\nDETROIT -- When Christian Hackenberg buttoned up his chinstrap and ran into the huddle to start Saturday night's second preseason game, it was a surprise.\n\nAnyone who had been watching the Jets' quarterback competition believed that Josh McCown was the favorite to win the job. The expectation was that he'd start against the Detroit Lions. But Jets coach Todd Bowles decided to Hackenberg a real chance to win the job.\n\nAnd so we got a preview of what the Jets might look like with Hackenberg as the starting quarterback.\n\nThe results were not good.\n\nHackenberg never got the offense going and looked generally overwhelmed while playing the entire first half with the starting offense in a 16-6 loss to the Lions. He completed only 2-of-6 passes for 14 yards -- both passes were caught behind the line of scrimmage. He was sacked twice, losing 17 yards. He fumbled on one play.\n\nHackenberg was bad in every way possible. Hackenberg, the Jets' 2016 second-round pick, did not look ready.\n\nBut afterward, Bowles said it wasn't all the 22-year-old's fault. In Bowles' eyes, the offensive line wasn't good enough.\n\n\"He really didn't get a chance,\" Bowles said of Hackenberg. \"It's not a fair evaluation of the kid because he didn't get a chance on the couple pass plays he had and there was a lot of pressure on him.\"\n\nAnd though Hackenberg's lackluster performance seemed to lock up the starting job for McCown -- who did nothing more than hold a clipboard on Saturday night -- Bowles insisted that he's nowhere near ready to name a starting quarterback.\n\n\"Not at this point,\" Bowles said.\n\nHackenberg and the offensive line weren't the only ones to struggle Saturday night. The first-team defense got beaten up by the Lions and starting quarterback Matthew Stafford. The Jets fumbled a punt and missed a field goal.\n\nEverywhere you looked, bad things were happening to the Jets. But nothing was more discouraging than the offense under Hackenberg.\n\nIn the five drives led by Hackenberg, the Jets went three-and-out four times. They gained only 43 yards in the first half with Hackenberg on the field.\n\nThe big trouble started on the third play from scrimmage. There was a miscommunication at the line of scrimmage, allowing Lions defensive end Cornelius Washington a clear path at Hackenberg. Before Hackenberg could even react, Washington leveled him with a vicious tackle, forcing a fumble.\n\nThe Jets recovered, but the tone had been set.\n\n\"I don't know it happened too fast,\" Bowles said when asked who was at fault for the play. \"I just saw him getting hit.\"\n\nHackenberg didn't look comfortable for the rest of the night.\n\nOn his second drive, another three-and-out, Hackenberg was nearly intercepted after his pass went through the hands of receiver Charone Peake. The third drive was another three-and-out.\n\nThe Jets finally got a first down early in the second quarter, when Hackenberg scrambled 12 yards up the middle. It was his best play of a forgettable night. He then found running back Bilal Powell for his first completion of the game, a 17-yard gain on a screen pass that Powell caught behind the line of scrimmage.\n\nBut even that drive had a tough end for Hackenberg. The ball slipped out of his hand on third-and-8 for an ugly incompletion.\n\nFor the second straight game, the Jets didn't\" score a single point with Hackenberg on the field. But he said it wasn't all lost.\n\n\"Overall, it was a really good learning expereince,\" Hackenberg said. \"They're professionals over there and they did a great job game-planning us based on what we did last week.\"\n\nBryce Petty looked better in the second half, finishing 15-of-24 for 160 yards, but he also failed to get the Jets in the end zone for a touchdown. The Jets have not scored since their first drive of the preseason under McCown.\n\nThe offensive line didn't give the run game much room to operate, or Hackenberg much time to work. In a surprise, Jonotthan Harrison started at center instead of Wesley Johnson. Ben Ijalana and Brandon Shell started at the tackle positions alongside guards Brian Winters and James Carpenter.\n\nJohnson later worked in at center, and Kelvin Beachum and Brent Qvale later played at tackle -- a clear sign that those positions are all still up for grabs. But no matter who played, the results weren't very good.\n\nThe Jets starting defense also struggled. Stafford went 8-for-10 for 84 yards and a touchdown, leading a 78-yard scoring drive in the second quarter. But more concerning was Jake Ruddock's performance.\n\nThe 2016 sixth-round pick had no problems against the Jets' top defense, completing 6-of-8 passes for 67 yards.\n\nKicker Ross Martin missed wide left from 56 yards in the third quarter, but later made a 31-yarder and a 28-yarder to get the Lions on the board in the fourth quarter. Chandler Catanzaro, competing with Martin for the starting kicking job, missed his 55-yard attempt in Week 1 of the preseason. The battle remains tight.\n\nMeanwhile, the Jets competition for a kick/punt returner is not taking place at a high level.\n\nFrankie Hammond fumbled a punt, which the Lions recovered in the third quarter. Marcus Murphy fumbled during a kick return during the first half, but the play didn't count because of a penalty.\n\nThere is no clear favorite to win that job, but Murphy and Hammond certainly didn't help their causes.\n\nEmail: vasqueza@northjersey.com\n\n1 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE", "dateTime": "2017-08-20T04:02:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.8549019694328308, "dateCrawl":

Hackenberg has still failed to produce a single point in two extended preseason appearances. After looking decent in last week's 7-3 win over the Titans, when he was 18-for-25 for 127 yards, he looked tentative and overmatched through much of his playing time against the Lions.\n\nJetsNFL preseason: Jets vs. Lions\n\nHe was just 2-for-6 in the first half against the Lions, with his two biggest plays a 12-yard scramble up the middle and a swing pass to running back Bilal Powell that went for 17 yards. By the time Hackenberg gave way to Bryce Petty after the first half, the Jets were down 13-0.\n\nadvertisement | advertise on newsday\n\nWith Hackenberg at quarterback, the Jets have not scored a point so far; the Jets wound up losing to the Lions, 16-6.\n\nIn fairness, the Jets' second-round pick in the 2016 draft, Hackenberg wasn't the only culprit in the team's inability to put any points on the board against the Lions' starters. The Jets, still tinkering with the offensive line, rotated six different players into the mix, and both the run-blocking and pass-blocking was consistently poor.\n\n\"We're not giving [Hackenberg] a chance,\" coach Todd Bowles said at halftime during a brief interview on CBS. \"We have to block for him.\"\n\nOn Hackenberg's first dropback of the night, he was whacked from his right side by defensive end Cornelius Washington, who was unblocked on the play. It's uncertain whose fault it was that Washington broke free. Right tackle Brandon Shell took an inside angle and Powell didn't get over in time to block the Lions' defender. Hackenberg fumbled on the play, but the ball was recovered by guard James Carpenter.\n\nJetsJets juggle center and tackle spots to start the game\n\nHackenberg, who had thrown mostly short passes against the Titans, aired one out on his next drive. But his deep pass down the right sideline to Robby Anderson was overthrown and landed out of bounds. Hackenberg went three-and-out on his three drives in the first quarter.\n\nHackenberg finally produced a first down on his fourth possession, as he scrambled 12 yards up the middle after getting heavy pressure. He hit Powell in the left flat, and the veteran running back got to midfield before being pushed out of bounds. But three plays later, on third-and-8 from the Lions' 48, the ball slipped out of Hackenberg's hands as he looked to throw down the middle. The pass was called incomplete, and the Jets were forced to punt.\n\nHackenberg gave way in the third quarter to Bryce Petty, who has been running mostly with the third team through training camp and isn't expected to contend for the starting job.\n\nPetty was 15-for-24 for 160 yards and an interception Saturday night.\n\nJust how things will pan out to start the regular season remains to be seen. McCown got the start last Saturday against the Titans, and looked sharp on his one and only drive. He has rotated as the No. 1 quarterback with Hackenberg the last two weeks in practice, with Hackenberg's workload gradually increasing.\n\nIt was a mild surprise that McCown didn't even play against the Lions. Coach Todd Bowles had hinted earlier in the week that there might not be any changes to the starting lineup, but after discussing the deployment of his quarterbacks with the coaching staff, it was decided that only Hackenberg and Petty would handle those duties.\n\nadvertisement | advertise on newsday\n\nThat means if McCown is going to be the opening day starter, his only significant work will come in Saturday's preseason game against the Giants. The third preseason game is typically the most important tuneup for most NFL teams, and the starters frequently play into the third quarter.\n\nBowles is counting on McCown's experience to carry him through the experimentation period with Hackenberg, so if the 38-year-old McCown does start the season, he'll be able to draw from his 14 NFL seasons.", "dateTime": "2017-08-20T03:06:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.8117647171020508, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-20", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3374995", "time": "03:06:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3375052", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "305872", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "score": 5}, {"id": "306941", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "New York Jets"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Jets", "score": 5}, {"id": "309051", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "CBS"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS", "score": 3}, {"id": "310749", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Defensive end"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_end", "score": 2}, {"id": "316239", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Starting lineup"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starting_lineup", "score": 1}, {"id": "324224", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Running back"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_back", "score": 3}, {"id": "324226", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Fumble"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fumble", "score": 2}, {"id": "360558", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Todd Bowles"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todd_Bowles", "score": 3}, {"id": "361834", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Christian Hackenberg"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Hackenberg", "score": 4}, {"id": "372336", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Josh McCown"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_McCown", "score": 3}, {"id": "379060", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Bilal Powell"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilal_Powell", "score": 3}, {"id": "401985", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Bryce Petty"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryce_Petty", "score": 4}, {"id": "424519", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Ouvrage Hackenberg"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ouvrage_Hackenberg", "score": 5}, {"id": "515963", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Cornelius Washington"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornelius_Washington", "score": 2}], "image": "https://cdn.newsday.com/polopoly_fs/1.14077463.1503197592!/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1280/image.jpeg", "timeCrawl": "03:06:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "Hackenberg gets start but struggles in loss to Lions", "originalArticle": null}

Hackenberg finished 2 of 6 passing for 14 yards and did not complete a pass until early in the second quarter.\n\n\"It was pretty strong,\" Lions coach Jim Caldwell said of his team's defensive effort in a halftime interview with WJBK-TV. \"I think they were in the minus yards in terms of passing, so we got a little pass rush and we played pretty good pass defense.\"\n\nThe Lions played Saturday without their top two defensive ends - Ziggy Ansah remains on the physically unable to perform list with a leg injury - and sat starters Haloti Ngata and Darius Slay after just two series.\n\n[Dave Birkett's game-by-game picks for the 2017 Detroit Lions]\n\nMatthew Stafford led two scoring drives in his three offensive possessions, and gave way to Jake Rudock after throwing a 5-yard touchdown pass to Marvin Jones on the second play of the second quarter.\n\nStafford finished 8 of 10 passing for 84 yards, and running back Ameer Abdullah played parts of just three series and had four carries for 16 yards in his return from Lisfranc surgery.\n\n\"Obviously, a bunch of stuff to clean up like every preseason game, but did a nice job moving the ball a couple times, got a touchdown, field goal,\" Stafford said on WJBK-TV. \"Good start, bunch to clean up.\"\n\nMore: Watch this: Marvin Jones, teammates have double-dutch TD celebration\n\nThe Lions got their first look at right guard T.J. Lang, who's practiced sporadically this preseason as he returns from hip surgery.\n\nLang played three series and told WJBK-TV that it was \"good to get out there with the guys, run around a little bit (and) start getting ready for the season.\"\n\n\"I thought we did some good things there in the first quarter when Matt was in,\" Lang said. \"Obviously, we got to protect the quarterback a little bit better, but scored 10 points in one quarter so not a bad job for us. Me, I feel like a lot of room to get better but it's definitely nice to be back on the field.\"\n\nRudock (8 of 13 passing, 84) led the Lions on a 16-play, 87-yard field goal that ate up most of the second quarter, but neither he nor third quarterback Brad Kaaya (4-7, 38 yards) had much success in the second half.\n\nThe Lions, who lost No. 3 wide receiver TJ Jones to a hamstring injury in the second quarter, had just 80 yards of offense in the second half, with much of that coming on a late fourth-quarter field-goal drive.\n\nLions first-half observations: Stafford, defense solid vs. Jets\n\nPhotos: Lions vs. Jets exhibition game Fullscreen Lions wide receiver TJ Jones runs by against the Jets' Lorenzo Mauldin during the first quarter on Saturday, Aug. 19, 2017, at Ford Field.

The results weren't shocking to team decision makers, who have believed all along that the second-year signal caller needs more time to evolve.\n\nOne week after the team rolled out a conservative blueprint to build Hackenberg's confidence, the young quarterback went 2 for 6 for 14 yards and 42.4 passer rating in the first half.\n\nThe Jets went three-and-out on four of Hackenberg's five drives (excluding a half-ending kneel down) and racked up a grand total of two first downs and 43 total yards. Bryce Petty played the entire second half, but he has never been a part of the starting quarterback equation.\n\nBowles' offensive line didn't exactly do Hackenberg any favors, breaking down along the edge and interior on two Lions sacks.\n\nIt was ugly from jump street for an offense devoid of playmakers.\n\nHackenberg was drilled by Lions defensive end Cornelius Washington on the third play from scrimmage, a crushing thud from a behemoth who had a free run at the signal caller. Bottom line: The right side of the offensive line and/or running back screwed up. Hackenberg fumbled, but the Jets recovered.\n\nIt didn't get much better on the Jets' next drive. Or the one after that. Or the one after that. Or the one after that. Or the one after that. Or the one... you get the picture.\n\nSomeone on One Jets drive needs to pull out a sandwich board and get an intern to walk around the city with this plea:\n\nWANTED: Playmakers.\n\nHackenberg needed someone-anyone - to help him out. Alas, it didn't happen.\n\nOn the second drive, second-year wideout Charone Peake saw a pass from Hackenberg on a quick slant sail off his hands and nearly into the waiting arms of a defender. That was a receiver problem, not a quarterback problem.\n\nBowles hoped to evaluate Hackenberg in a variety of different situations like red-zone and two-minute work, but it never materialized.\n\nMorton dialed up a draw play on 3rd and 13 from the Jets 25-yard line for Pete's sake rather than give Hackenberg a chance to pick up a first down. Perhaps the offensive coordinator was concerned for the youngster's health given the early breakdowns up front. If so, the safe approach was warranted. Otherwise, it was a curious move. (Morton called another draw play on third-and-long later in the half).\n\nThe Jets failed to pick up a first down on three first-quarter drives (three three-and-outs for a total of three yards is not good).\n\nHackenberg finally moved the chains on a third-down scramble in the first few minutes of the second quarter.\n\nHe connected with Bilal Powell, the only player to pick up any yardage in the first four drives other than the quarterback, for a 17-yard catch and run. But the drive stalled. The Jets went three-and-out on the next series before a kneel-down before halftime ended Hackenberg's misery.\n\nDespite his ghastly numbers, Hackenberg gained valuable experience that should serve him well moving forward. It's premature to pour dirt on the guy - he has talent -- but the present is a different story altogether.\n\nHackenberg, who hasn't led the Jets to any points in 13 preseason drives, is simply not ready to be the team's starter right now. It's unrealistic to expect miracles in the final few weeks before the games actually count.\n\nThe mystery surrounding winner of the Jets quarterback competition is over. Expect McCown to start in the team's final dress rehearsal against the Giants next weekend. Barring injury, McCown will start the regular season under center.\n\nIt would be the exact wrong move for Bowles to trot out an inferior player at the game's most important position. It would be an impossible sell to his locker room.\n\nHackenberg will ultimately play in the regular season, but Bowles & Co. were never going to force the issue with the former second-round pick. They gave him a chance on Saturday night.\n\nThe results weren't entirely surprising to them, but it had to be done.\n\nTags: new york jets detroit lions mlb Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation: facebook Tweet", "dateTime": "2017-08-20T03:27:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 927, "textStart": 919, "imp": true, "date": "2017-09-10", "amb": false}], "sim": 0.7647058963775635, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-20", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3374995", "time": "03:27:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3375052", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "305439", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Offensive coordinator"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offensive_coordinator", "score": 2}, {"id": "305872", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "score": 5}, {"id": "306941", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "New York Jets"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Jets", "score": 5}, {"id": "310130", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "score": 2}, {"id": "310743", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Quarterback sack"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback_sack", "score": 3}, {"id": "310749", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Defensive end"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_end", "score": 3}, {"id": "324224", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Running back"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_back", "score": 3}, {"id": "324226", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Fumble"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fumble", "score": 3}, {"id": "324464", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Offensive line"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offensive_line", "score": 4}, {"id": "325480", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Passer rating"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passer_rating", "score": 3}, {"id": "326127", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Down (American and Canadian football)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Down_(American_and_Canadian_football)", "score": 3}, {"id": "326592", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Solar eclipse"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_eclipse", "score": 4}, {"id": "360558", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Todd Bowles"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todd_Bowles", "score": 4}, {"id": "361834", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Christian Hackenberg"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Hackenberg", "score": 3}, {"id": "372336", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Josh McCown"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_McCown", "score": 3}, {"id": "379060", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Bilal Powell"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilal_Powell", "score": 2}, {"id": "401985", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Bryce Petty"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryce_Petty", "score": 3}, {"id": "419561", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Sandwich board"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandwich_board", "score": 2}, {"id": "424519", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Ouvrage Hackenberg"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ouvrage_Hackenberg", "score": 5}, {"id": "515963", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Cornelius Washington"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornelius_Washington", "score": 3}, {"id": "556220", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Draw play"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draw_play", "score": 3}], "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.3426299.1503197063!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/manishcolweb20s-4m7-web.jpg", "timeCrawl": "03:27:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "Jets offense already reaching record lows in loss to Lions", "originalArticle": null}

Video by Ryan Ford/DFP Wochit\n\n2 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE\n\nFree Press sports writer Carlos Monarrez tackles the burning questions facing the Detroit Lions following their victory over the New York Jets, 16-6, in Saturday's exhibition game at Ford Field.\n\nQuarterback Matthew Stafford played just a hair into the second quarter. How did he look in his first meaning game action?\n\nIf you look at the stats alone, Stafford seemed great. He was 8 of 10 for 84 yards with a touchdown pass to Marvin Jones and a 135 passer rating. He did play pretty well, but his passes weren't consistently on target. Stafford also made two nice deep passes to Golden Tate. But he threw high on a short pass to Tate, who could only tip the ball and almost had it intercepted. He also threw a short pass behind Marvin Jones. But Stafford led the Lions to the end zone and 10 points. That's pretty good for a little more than a quarter of work. Stafford admitted there's a \"bunch to clean up,\" and if there is he's running out of time. He'll get his last and most significant test of the exhibition next season Friday against the defending Super Bowl champion Patriots.\n\nMore: Lions first-half observations: Matthew Stafford, defense solid vs. New York Jets\n\nWith Kerry Hyder out and Ziggy Ansah still not practicing, how did the defense do?\n\nFirst, let's get something out of the way. The Jets are terrible, especially on offense. When starting quarterback Christian Hackenberg unintentionally spikes the ball on a pass, you know the Jets are a bad team. At one point in the game, the Lions had more points (10) than the Jets had net offensive yards (3). Ouch. The Lions played pretty well on defense. They got decent pressure up front, especially from defensive tackle Akeem Spence, who made consecutive great plays on a sack and a run stop. The Lions got a decent rush up front with Cornelius Washington filling in for Hyder. In the fourth quarter, rookie Jamal Agnew broke up a Bryce Petty pass in the end zone that forced the Jets to settle for a field goal and their first points. Again, the Jets stink. But the Lions' defense did its job.\n\nMore: Watch this: Lions' Marvin Jones, teammates have double-dutch TD celebration\n\nPhotos: Lions vs. Jets exhibition game Fullscreen Lions wide receiver TJ Jones runs by against the Jets' Lorenzo Mauldin during the first quarter on Saturday, Aug. 19, 2017, at Ford Field.

How was it?\n\nLights, camera, lights! And yet more lights! We already saw the huge LED video boards above either end zone and the LED band that encircles the field. A new addition has been countless moving spotlights and multicolored strobes. The pyrotechnics return to announce the team's return. There's now a spotlight that finds the leaping lion logo at midfield before the national anthem and at halftime. Sometimes there's so much random light movement you feel like you're in a nightclub on Ibiza. There's also a new in-stadium host who looks like a young Kurt Warner -- or an older Jonas brother -- and, at least for this night, he came off as more of a human commercial more than a host. The sound was really glitch, too. Poor young Kurt. The Lions get points for making the experience more dynamic, but they need to cut back on the scripting and add more fun and spontaneity. And no marriage proposals.\n\nContact Carlos Monarrez: cmonarrez@freepress.com. Follow him on Twitter @cmonarrez.

The rookie receiver caught two touchdown passes from Jake Rudock against the Colts. If he works with Matthew Stafford on Saturday, what will Golladay do for an encore?\n\n* Hyde and seek: Starting left end Kerry Hyder is out for the season with a torn Achilles tendon, and the Lions have three weeks to get his replacements ready. Cornelius Washington and Anthony Zettel should start at defensive end Saturday, and rookies Alex Barrett, Jeremiah Valoaga and Patrick O'Connor also will get a long look.\n\n[Dave Birkett's game-by-game picks for the 2017 Detroit Lions]\n\n* Turn tables: Asked to assess his team's performance in Week 1 of the exhibition season, one thing coach Jim Caldwell pointed out was the Lions' negative turnover ratio (Stafford threw an interception, and the Lions did not have a takeaway). The Lions ranked near the bottom of the NFL in takeaways last year and were minus-1 overall. Habits form in the preseason, and it'd be nice for the Lions to starting forcing turnovers today.\n\n* Ab's of steel: Ameer Abdullah played two snaps against the Colts, and touched the ball on both plays. The Lions' starting running back should get a longer look Saturday, when starters are expected to play about a quarter. A Lisfranc injury cost Abdullah most of last season, but in glimpses this training camp, it appears his explosion is back.\n\nLions react to Charlottesville: Abdullah calls racial tensions 'disheartening'\n\n* Testing, testing: The Jets are not a very good team. They might be the worst team in the NFL this year. But they do have three very good pass rushers in Leonard Williams, Sheldon Richardson and Muhammad Wilkerson who should give the Lions' offensive line a stern test. Greg Robinson should make his second straight start at left tackle, and Graham Glasgow needs to be more consistent at left guard.\n\nLions' LB Williams, DE Washington next men up after defensive injuries\n\nDave Birkett's practice observations from Thursday\n\nContact Dave Birkett: dbirkett@freepress.com.

It's time to put the New York Jets' quarterback competition to rest. Josh McCown should be declared the winner, albeit by default.\n\nGiven a terrific chance to state his case, Christian Hackenberg -- in a surprise start -- failed to generate any semblance of offense in the Jets' 16-6 loss to the Detroit Lions on Saturday night at Ford Field. In five possessions, the Hackenberg-led Jets crossed midfield only once (barely) and looked utterly lifeless.\n\nThis was a great learning experience for Hackenberg, who faced a starting defense, but it has become clear he's not ready to be the starting quarterback. In 13 possessions over two games, he has generated zero points. This week, he couldn't get away with his dinking and dunking. The Lions played tight coverage and pressured Hackenberg, who completed only 2 of 6 passes for 14 yards.\n\nLike it or not, McCown -- who got the night off -- gives the Jets (1-1) the best chance to win. Assuming the goal still is to win games, coach Todd Bowles should give McCown two-plus quarters next week against the New York Giants, and name him the opening-day starter. It's time to get serious.\n\nQB depth chart: Bryce Petty played the entire second half, and he looked better than Hackenberg. Playing against the Lions' backups, Petty (15-for-24, 160 yards) led the only two scoring drives and was able to push the ball downfield. He threw an interception, but it was a desperation throw in the final seconds. If there was any doubt about Petty's roster spot, it should be gone now. He did reasonably well for a guy who hasn't had many practice reps.\n\nWhen it was starters vs. starters, the Jets looked ...: Overmatched -- and that's being kind. The starting offense, which played the entire first half, managed only two first downs and 43 total yards. Running back Bilal Powell, in his preseason debut, got the ball on every play except one -- nine rushes, two catches. The defense allowed two long scoring drives, struggling with short passes. The Jets kept it vanilla from a scheme standpoint, which may have been a factor.\n\nOne reason to be concerned: The starting offensive line struggled in the running game for the second week in a row and it allowed pressure at times on Hackenberg. Maybe you can blame some of it on a lack of continuity, as they rotated at three positions -- left tackle (Kelvin Beachum and Ben Ijalana), right tackle (Brandon Shell and Brent Qvale) and center (Wesley Johnson and Jonotthan Harrison). OK, enough experimenting, it's time to settle on a starting line.\n\nRookie watch: Safety Jamal Adams has to clean up a couple of things in his game, especially his tackling technique. He missed an open-field tackle because he left his feet too soon. On another play, he was late picking up a receiver out of the flat. Hype notwithstanding, Adams isn't super human; he's experiencing growing pains like every other rookie. Wide receiver ArDarius Stewart made two catches in the second half.\n\nSecondary struggles: This looked like a replay of last season, except we can't blame it on Darrelle Revis. The Jets got picked apart by Matthew Stafford (understandable) and Jake Rudock (what?!). There were mistakes galore. Morris Claiborne allowed a few completions and used poor technique on a fade route, resulting in a 5-yard touchdown catch by Marvin Jones. Juston Burris dropped a would-be interception and missed a tackle. Cornerback will be an issue this season, count on it.\n\nLife after Lucky: Will the Jets ever find quality punt and kickoff returners? Without Lucky Whitehead (broken foot), they turned Frankie Hammond and Marcus Murphy. Let's see, Hammond muffed a punt and Murphy lost a fumble on a kickoff (he got bailed out by a Detroit penalty). General manager Mike Maccagnan needs to address this, pronto.\n\nThat guy could start: Cornerback Dexter McDougle won't crack the starting lineup, but he was one of the few bright spots and could push for playing time in sub packages.", "dateTime": "2017-08-20T02:53:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.7019608020782471, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-20", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3374995", "time":

Their offense was putrid. The defense -- when the starters were in -- was not much better. And it leads to an easy question for the Detroit Lions: How much of the first half of the team's 16-6 preseason victory over the Jets can be read into as promise and how much is facing a team that flat stunk Saturday?\n\nThe answer for Detroit is likely in the middle, but the three-and-out extravaganza by the Jets' offense and the pressure the Lions got on quarterback Christian Hackenberg are things for Detroit to build on. The real gauge might come in Friday's third preseason game, when starters typically play more and defending Super Bowl champion New England comes to town.\n\nQB depth chart: Matthew Stafford played a little more than a quarter and looked sharp during his three drives, completing 8 of 10 passes for 84 yards and a touchdown. At least one of the incompletions was a drop, too. Jake Rudock played the equivalent of a half, completing 8 of 13 passes for 84 yards and one interception. Brad Kaaya got the final quarter-plus of work and completed 4 of 7 passes for 38 yards. The depth chart remains the same: Stafford, Rudock, Kaaya.\n\nWhen it was starters vs. starters, the Lions looked ...: As mentioned previously, the Lions were dominant defensively. They held the Jets to 3 -- yes, 3 -- yards of offense in the first quarter and should have had at least one turnover. Offensively, Detroit was OK. Stafford was strong and moved the ball well after some initial struggles. His touchdown pass to Marvin Jones Jr. was on point, and Jones got good separation on New York corner Morris Claiborne. That's the type of play the Lions are hoping for from Jones this season.\n\nOne reason to be concerned: The offensive line. If the Jets have a strength, it is their defensive front. And the Lions' offensive line had its issues there. Stafford was hit a few times as he threw or a step after. There was also a stretch during which Rudock had the first-team offensive line (other than right guard T.J. Lang) in front of him and the Jets' front -- which included some second-teamers -- still ended up in the backfield. There's not much scheming done for these games, but it's something to keep an eye on. There were flashes of Detroit doing well on the line -- particularly left tackle Greg Robinson -- but some of the inconsistencies showed.\n\n\"I thought we did some good things there in the first quarter when Matt was in,\" Lang said. \"Obviously, we got to protect the quarterback a little bit better, but [we] scored 10 points in one quarter, so not a bad job for us.\"\n\nThat guy could start: Most of the Detroit starters are set, but with TJ Jones suffering a hamstring injury in the second quarter Saturday, that could open up a bigger opportunity for rookie receiver Kenny Golladay to nab a starting role right away. Golladay didn't have the high-impact game he did in the preseason opener (one catch, 6 yards against the Jets) but after getting some first-team work during the week in practice and on Saturday, this is a bigger chance for him heading into the third preseason game if Jones' injury is at all serious.\n\nRookie watch: Jamal Agnew stood out in the second half. Even when the cornerback allowed a completion, he was right there in coverage. The fifth-round draft pick had a team-high six tackles and broke up one pass. He also got a couple of reps as a punt and kick returner, as he's in the thick of that job. Linebacker Jarrad Davis had a couple of tackles and continued to show good instincts. Golladay had one catch for 6 yards. Jalen Reeves-Maybin showed good instincts and sideline-to-sideline speed for a linebacker and continued to be active on special teams. Tight end Michael Roberts caught both of his targets for 29 yards.\n\nKasey Redfern is pretty good: No, Redfern won't make the team unless Sam Martin somehow doesn't return from the non-football injury list, but he's shown an active leg throughout training camp practices and in his first two preseason games. There's no question he has the leg and accuracy to be an NFL punter; it just is unlikely to be in Detroit. Redfern had six punts for 266 yards (44.3 average) against the Jets, with two inside the 20-yard line.\n\nLooking for a sleeper for a roster spot? Check out Steve Longa: One of the byproducts of Brandon Copeland's season-ending pectoral injury is the possibility of another linebacker spot opening up on the roster. Longa has a real shot at it. He's been active during camp but impressive in games, particularly on special teams. He's often the first one down the field on kick coverage and both caused and recovered a fumble Saturday that was negated due to Detroit being offside. He also had a special-teams tackle and got some work with some No. 1 units. He would be the team's fifth (or sixth) linebacker if he makes it, but he could develop into a core special-teams player.", "dateTime": "2017-08-20T03:41:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.6666666865348816, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-20", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3375052", "time": "03:41:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3375052", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "concepts": [{"id": "70183", "label": {"eng": "Redfern"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redfern,_New_South_Wales", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Redfern"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, "score": 2}, {"id": "210760", "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "218051", "label": {"eng": "New York"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "302552", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Association football"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "score": 3}, {"id": "302611", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "score": 4}, {"id": "302622", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Tackle (football move)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(football_move)", "score": 2}, {"id": "304975", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Cornerback"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornerback", "score": 2}, {"id": "304976", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Interception"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interception", "score": 3}, {"id": "305661", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "National Football League"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_League", "score": 1}, {"id": "305872", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "score": 5}, {"id": "306941", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "New York Jets"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Jets", "score": 4}, {"id": "309225", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "score": 3}, {"id": "309397", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "New England"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England", "score": 3}, {"id": "309400", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Strong-side linebacker"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linebacker", "score": 2}, {"id": "312020", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Tight end"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tight_end", "score": 2}, {"id": "312092", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Detroit Lions"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Lions", "score": 4}, {"id": "314202", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "National Football League preseason"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_League_preseason", "score": 1}, {"id": "316239", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Starting lineup"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starting_lineup", "score": 5}, {"id": "322621", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Guard (American and Canadian football)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guard_(American_and_Canadian_football)", "score": 3}, {"id": "322846", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Special teams"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football_positions#Special_teams", "score": 2}, {"id": "324135", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Pulled hamstring"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulled_hamstring", "score": 2}, {"id": "324464", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Offensive line"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offensive_line", "score": 4}, {"id": "325513", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Punt (gridiron football)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punt_(gridiron_football)", "score": 2}, {"id": "361834", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Christian Hackenberg"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Hackenberg", "score": 3}, {"id": "379288", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "T.

The New York Jets, on the other hand, are clearly on track to be one of the league's worst teams.\n\nThe Lions jumped out to a 13-0 lead in the first half and held on through a largely punch-less final two quarters, coming away with a 16-6 victory at Ford Field.\n\nWith the starting offense on the field for the first three series, the Lions scored twice. On the opening possession, quarterback Matthew Stafford completed both of his throws for 28 yards, but couldn't overcome an 11-yard loss on a sack, leading to a 37-yard Matt Prater field goal.\n\nAfter the teams traded punts, Stafford led the offense 73 yards in 11 plays, connecting with Marvin Jones for a 5-yard touchdown on a fade to the back corner of the end zone. Stafford was 6-for-7 on the drive with Jones catching three passes.\n\nStafford took a seat after the touchdown, finishing his night 8-for-10 for 84 yards and the score.\n\nBOX SCORE: Lions 16, Jets 6\n\nDetroit's top defensive unit was even more impressive in the early going, forcing the Jets to go three-and-out on their first three possessions. On the first, defensive end Cornelius Washington came unblocked off the right edge on third down, delivering a punishing hit to Jets quarterback Christian Hackerberg that jarred the ball free. The fumble was recovered by the Jets, leading to a punt.\n\nOn the next Jets possession, Lions cornerback Nevin Lawson knocked away a Hackenberg pass intended for Charone Peake. The deflection was nearly intercepted by safety Glover Quin.\n\nThe Jets finished the first half with two first downs and 43 yards of offense.\n\nThe Lions tacked on three more points before halftime when backup Jake Rudock marched the offense 87 yards on 16 plays, highlighted by a frozen rope into a tight window to rookie tight end Michael Roberts for a 22-yard gain. But the drive stalled due to blocking breakdowns on second and third down deep in Jets territory, leading to a 25-yard chip shot from Prater.\n\nWith backups taking over on both sides in the second half, the game ground to a halt.\n\nThe Lions went three-and-out to start the third quarter, but rookie tight end Robert Tonyan was able to recover a muffed punt, giving the offense the ball back at the Jets 25. The opportunity was squandered when Rudock threw an interception directly to Jets linebacker Corey Lemonier.\n\nThe teams continued to trade punts until the Jets offense finally found some success with backup quarterback Bryce Petty. He led a 74-yard drive deep into Lions territory, but a throw into the end zone was broken up by cornerback Jamal Agnew, leading to a 31-yard Ross Martin field goal.\n\nMartin would cut the lead to seven with a 28-yard field goal on the Jets' next possession, but the Lions were able to salt the game away with a 50-yard Prater boot with 4:19 remaining.\n\nThe game-sealing field goal was largely set up by a 43-yard Keshawn Martin kickoff return.\n\nLions safety Roland Milligan intercepted Petty in the end zone in the final minute to preserve the 16-6 margin.\n\njdrogers@detroitnews.com\n\ntwitter.com/justin_rogers\n\n23 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 2 COMMENTEMAILMORE", "dateTime": "2017-08-20T03:06:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.6627451181411743,

The offensive line gave up a couple of sacks, and there was not a lot of chemistry with the pass catchers. Overall, the Jets offense can be described as a work in progress.\n\nBryce Petty came in and moved the ball against the Lions backups, but the Jets failed to get into the end zone, settling for 2 field goals.

He went 15/24 with 160 yards and an interception in the end zone at the end of the game.\n\nOn defense, Demario Davis got a sack of Matthew Stafford early.

Detroit Free Press\n\n'He's like a younger Stafford;' Lions 2nd-year backup QB continues to look better, but we likely won't see him after the preseason endsCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE\n\nOne of the first things they teach you in column-writing school -- after torture-endurance training and a survival course in the desert armed with just a Marriott Silver Elite rewards card -- is to never cede your opinion to someone else. Speak for yourself loudly, clearly and boldly.\n\nBut I'm breaking that rule right now. I'm allowing TJ Jones to voice an opinion for me because the veteran Detroit Lions receiver said something recently about quarterback Jake Rudock that was a little shocking and should be heard.\n\nAfter Rudock's impressive debut in the exhibition opener at Indianapolis, I asked Jones what Matthew Stafford's second-year backup was like in the huddle.\n\n\"He tells you what to do. He's like a younger Stafford,\" Jones said. \"He gets in it, he says the play with confidence, he lets you know what you have.\n\n\"He'll tell you what you need to see. If he has to point something out, he points it out and you go with the play. You don't miss a beat.\"\n\nThanks, TJ. I'll take it from here.\n\nJones' key phrases that jumped out to me: \"He's like a younger Stafford,\" and \"You don't miss a beat.\"\n\nSay what you will about Stafford. But at the very least, he's a capable starting quarterback who has helped lead his team to three playoff appearances and he's on the brink of signing a $100-million contract. And Jones is comparing Rudock's capability to Stafford's. That is not a small statement.\n\nMore: Matthew Stafford's touch passes part of evolving repertoire\n\nBefore we go any further, let's get this straight: Jones was not trying to stir any kind of quarterback controversy, and neither am I.\n\nWhat I am trying to stir is a little thought here. Stafford has had every advantage built into his career, whereas Rudock has had to overcome several obstacles. He had to learn three offensive systems in three years, he was a sixth-round draft pick and was relegated to the practice squad. Yet, he has clawed his way to becoming a proficient NFL quarterback.\n\n[Dave Birkett's game-by-game picks for the 2017 Detroit Lions]\n\nMaybe you already realize that about Rudock. I probably don't have to tell you he was the Lions' best quarterback during the 2016 exhibition season, as a rookie. I'm sure you saw for yourself that he was even more impressive against the Indianapolis Colts in last week's game.\n\nAnd all the hype about Kenny Golladay's two-touchdown debut? Well, Golladay didn't throw those passes to himself. Rudock throw both of those TD passes en route to a 113.6 passer rating -- fourth-best among QBs who attempted at least 20 passes last week.\n\n\"I think just having gone through the season before,\" Rudock said, \"having heard this offense a couple times now, having it installed a number of times, it makes you think a little bit less about what do I have to do, as opposed to hey, what's the defense trying to do to you?\"\n\nRead more:\n\nLions mailbag: How Kenny Golladay's emergence affects Golden Tate\n\nWhy Ameer Abdullah is the Detroit Lions' 2nd-most important player\n\nThe NFL exhibition season is a strange animal, and it's stranger still for backup QBs. When the NFL regular season starts, the backup quarterback attends meetings, runs the opponents' offense against the first-team defense and holds a clipboard during games. For that reason, playing in actual games -- OK, facsimiles of real games -- in the exhibition season are vital opportunities for a backup.\n\n\"Game reps, game speeds, are very different than obviously in practice, and we practice at a very high tempo,\" Rudock said. \"You can't replicate a game exactly like it is.\n\n\"Obviously I'm getting hit in a game and not so much in practice. So, reps everywhere are always valuable. Definitely being able to go out there and feel kind of the heat of being able to get hit and slammed here and there is good.\"\n\nIf there is one position in the NFL that's maddening, it's the quarterback. The position defies all logic in its disproportionate importance. Yet, the backup for this position is treated like a spare tire, a necessary instrument you'd prefer to never think about or use.\n\nBut Rudock appears to be progressing at a rapid rate.\n\n\"Just the amount of growth he's had from Year 1 to Year 2,\" Jones said, \"not being a wide-eyed rookie, really getting to sit into the playbook for a year, really getting to take the second-team reps and he's getting a lot more reps, whereas last year Dan (Orlovsky) was taking them.\n\n\"So he was learning more from a playbook aspect, whereas now he can take the playbook to the field. And I think coming from OTAs and all the off-season work we did together as a team, it's helped him tremendously.\"\n\nBut after the fourth exhibition game, that will end. If the Lions get their wish, Stafford will start 16 games and no one outside the team's facility will see Rudock throw another pass until next year.\n\nI'm not wishing for Stafford to get hurt. But I always find it laughably ironic the way fate sometimes saves coaches and general managers from themselves. If Drew Bledsoe hadn't gotten hurt, Tom Brady probably wouldn't have won five Super Bowls. If Trent Green hadn't gotten hurt, Kurt Warner wouldn't be in the Hall of Fame. If Tony Romo hadn't gotten hurt, no one would know who Dak Prescott is.\n\nIt's a shame it takes such a catastrophic blow to unveil the talented potential of promising understudies. But hey, what else are spare tires for?\n\nRookie quarterback Brad Kaaya passes first test with Lions\n\nContact Carlos Monarrez: cmonarrez@freepress.com.

The Lions went on the road and drubbed the Colts, 24-10.\n\nLions coach Jim Caldwell said he's looking for more precision from this team in this contest.\n\n\"A little bit more efficiency, play better than we played the week before,\" Caldwell said. \"I could give you a whole litany of things that we didn't do well in that game. Those things we want to see some improvement in.\"\n\nHere are seven players we'll be watching.\n\n\u25a0 Defensive end Jeremiah Valoaga\n\nThe undrafted rookie out of UNLV had quite a debut, racking up six tackles and a sack against the Colts. With Kerry Hyder and Brandon Copeland out for the year, the door is open for one, possibly two of the team's young defensive ends to claim a roster spot and role to start the season. The 6-foot-6, 275-pound Valoaga will need to continue to build upon his performance if he hopes to seize the opportunity.\n\n\u25a0 Running back Dwayne Washington\n\nA seventh-round draft pick in 2016, Washington flashed tantalizing big-play potential last preseason, but a lack of feel and patience as a ball carrier was apparent when the Lions needed to lean on him early in the regular season.\n\nThere's been praise for his improvement this offseason, and although the sample size is tiny, he did a better job identifying his lanes against the Colts, gaining 34 yards on six carries. With Theo Riddick still being eased back into contact following wrist surgery, Washington should continue to see a healthy amount of snaps against the Jets.\n\n\u25a0 Linebacker Jalen Reeves-Maybin\n\nReeves-Maybin is already starting to show up on special teams, racing down the field and gliding around blocks on punt and kickoff coverage. The rookie also impressed on defense in his debut, routinely showing up around the ball and tallying six tackles. Pro Football Focus graded him just ahead of Valoaga as the team's best performer against the Colts.\n\nReeves-Maybin is firmly behind starter Tahir Whitehead on the depth chart, but injuries hit the team hard at linebacker last season. It would be comforting to know the Lions have more reliable depth on the roster this season. And even if Reeves-Maybin isn't needed much this year, he's a strong candidate to start in 2018.\n\nESPN: Wait on Lions' Abdullah in fantasy draft\n\n\u25a0 Guard Graham Glasgow\n\nThe concerns at left tackle haven't completely evaporated, but Greg Robinson is showing steady improvement. He played the first half against the Colts and only allowed pressure to get to the quarterback once. The bigger issues could be found in the middle of the line.\n\nGlasgow, in his second season out of Michigan, looked primed to take a big step forward at the start of camp, but things haven't been as promising the past week. Whether it's communication errors or physical breakdowns, it's frightening to see rushers come through clean up the middle. He'll be tested by the Jets' front, which starts three former first-rounders.\n\n\u25a0 Tight end Michael Roberts\n\nRoberts, a big-bodied dual-threat capable of serving as a red-zone weapon or blocking in-line, was drafted to help stabilize the tight end group. But it's been a rough start for the rookie, both as a blocker and pass-catcher. His ball security issues are almost inexplicably, given his mammoth hands, but he's consistently put catchable balls on the ground. He dropped one against the Colts, and had two more balls pop free post-whistle.\n\nThere's a ton of talent here, but he's a long way from being able to be trusted and the season is fast approaching.\n\nWojo: Lions' Kenny Golladay handles the heat, and the hype\n\n\u25a0 Linebacker Steve Longa\n\nA tackling machine in college, Longa averaged 111 tackles his three seasons at Rutgers. The Lions stashed him on the practice squad last season with a focus on developing him in the scheme. He's shown solid improvement within the defense, and also appears to have the makings of a quality special teams performer. With Copeland out, there's a clearer path to a roster spot for the Cameroon native.\n\n\u25a0 Wide receiver Jace Billingsley\n\nBetween the mock game at Ford Field earlier this month and the preseason game against the Colts, Billingsley continues to showcase his quickness in the open field. He had two catches for 30 yards last week.\n\nThe competition for the fourth and fifth receiving jobs remains wide open, and Billingsley also remains locked in a battle to return punts, along with rookie cornerback Jamal Agnew.\n\njdrogers@detnews.com\n\nTwitter: @justin_rogers\n\nLions vs. Jets preseason\n\nKickoff: 7:30, Ford Field, Detroit\n\nTV/radio: Fox 2/760 AM\n\nPreseason records:

They nearly took the ball away twice, and dropped Christian Hackenberg twice.\n\nDetroit's starting defense didn't just maul the New York Jets to open a 16-6 exhibition win Saturday night at Ford Field. They did not allow so much as a first down until the second quarter, the most encouraging sign yet they can weather their injuries up front.\n\nThen again, it's the Jets. It'll be interesting to see what Detroit can do next week against an actual NFL team.\n\nUntil then, there was a lot to like about the Lions, who move to 2-0 in the preseason heading into next week's dress rehearsal against New England. That includes quarterback Matthew Stafford, who completed 8 of his 10 passes -- and one of the misfires was a drop from Marvin Jones.\n\nBut Jones rebounded nicely, catching a team-high four passes and counting a beautiful 5-yard touchdown among them. He ran a fade to the back right corner of the end zone, and tapped both toes before his momentum took him out of bounds.\n\nThe play was expertly timed on both ends, something the pair has shown throughout training camp, and it produced Matthew Stafford's first touchdown pass of the year. He's now completed 10 of his 13 passes in a workmanlike start to the preseason.\n\nDetroit scored twice on Stafford's three series against New York, with Matt Prater adding a 37-yard field goal.\n\nPrater completed Detroit's scoring with field goals of 50 and 25 yards. He was 3 for 3 overall without a miss.\n\nBut the real story was the dominance of the defense.\n\nThe Lions opened with three straight three-and-outs. Hackenberg dropped back four times in the first quarter, was sacked twice and didn't complete a pass. By the time the second quarter opened, Detroit's defense had actually gained 17 yards of field position whenever New York attempted to pass.\n\nThe Jets were outgained 182-43 in the first half, and blanked on the scoreboard until Ross Martin hit a 31-yard field goal with 11:06 left, long after most meaningful players had departed the game.\n\nHere are some observations from the game:\n\n-- Detroit gave most starters about three or four series, but did give four-fifths of the starting offensive line an entire half to gel. Greg Robinson got another start at left tackle, and has separated from the rest in that competition, if there ever really was one. Graham Glasgow, Travis Swanson and Rick Wagner also played two full quarters.\n\n-- Detroit's most surprising starter was T.J. Lang, who got the nod at right guard despite practicing just once in the last week. He still hasn't practiced on back to back days since the pads came on. Other players who made their preseason debuts include cornerback Darius Slay and defensive tackle Haloti Ngata.\n\n-- While Robinson has done enough good stuff to win that left tackle job, Cyrus Kouandjio has done just as much to lose it. He didn't play in the opener, and didn't play in the first half of this one. When he did enter the game late, he allowed a sack, then was tagged with a hold. This thing's over, baby. Greg Robinson is Detroit's left tackle until Taylor Decker returns.\n\n-- The win is cool and everything, but the preseason is about trying to stay healthy as much as anything else, and the Lions lost there once again. TJ Jones joined the growing list of banged-up regulars when he suffered a hamstring injury in the first half. He did not return. Jones started the game as the third receiver (yes, over Kenny Golladay), and even got the call over Jamal Agnew at punt returner. He brought back his first attempt for 17 yards on a nifty return, too, though it was nixed by a Charles Washington penalty. Jones continues to look like a slam dunk to make this team -- provided the injury is not a serious one.\n\n-- Jones was the biggest injury in the game for Detroit, although several players did not suit up while nursing their own issues. Running back Theo Riddick, tight end Eric Ebron and safety Tavon Wilson were among the notables who did not play.\n\n-- Jake Rudock followed his strong debut in Indy with a clunker against the Jets. He completed 8 of his 13 passes for 84 yards, no touchdowns and one ugly pick. His passer rating of 48.2 was his worst in six career preseason appearances. His four series ended in two punts, one interception and one field goal.\n\n-- Anthony Zettel started oppoosite Cornelius Washington at defensive end, and was among the last starters still in the game midway through the third quarter. With Kerry Hyder and Brandon Copeland done for the year, plus Ezekiel Ansah still not practicing, Zettel will be at least a key reserve to open the season, if not an outright starter. So Detroit is trying to get the second-year end as many reps as possible.\n\n-- Detroit has struggled to generate turnovers in the preseason, despite a year-long emphasis placed on it. The club finally got its first takeaway in the second half against New York, with Dez Stewart forcing a muffed punt and Robert Tonyan recovering it. Stewart is a receiver who was signed a few days into camp. Tonyan is an undrafted rookie tight end with a good shot to make the practice squad.\n\n-- There was nowhere for Kenny Golladay to go but down after debuting with two touchdowns against Indianapolis, although this was much lower than expected. He was targeted just once after coming off the bench as the fourth receiver, catching it for 6 yards. That's it. These are the types of things you can expect from the rookie receiver -- some thrilling highs, especially in the red zone, followed by some puzzling lows. He's not a finished product yet, even if he's already an intriguing one.\n\n-- NFL commissioner Roger Goodell is in town over the weekend. President Rod Wood said in a radio interview during the game that he would use the opportunity to give Goodell a \"soft sell\" on why Detroit would be a good host for the draft and Super Bowl. He'll also participate in a Q&A that will be broadcast on the team's website on Sunday.\n\n-- Cornelius Washington killed a man. Here's the evidence.\n\n-- Eastern Michigan offered a full-ride scholarship to a walk-on wide receiver on the new (and giant) video boards at Ford Field. It was a cool moment for that program.\n\n-- Jim Caldwell has a pregame tradition of shaking every player's hand during stretcihng. And he continued that tradition before this preseason game, even though there are still 90 players on the roster. The coach was running through the lines to get to every hand before time ran out. Say what you will about him as a football coach, but it's easy to see why players love playing for him.", "dateTime": "2017-08-20T03:37:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.5490196347236633,

You're mighty optimistic, Noah. Here's the deal: No matter what happens over the next few months, Bowles is rebuilding and the focus will be on player development. What choice does does the Jets head coach have?\n\nExcept for the inevitable tinkering on cut-down day, the roster is set, and it screams, \"Rebuilding!\" The Jets charted their course in late February, when they started dumping veteran players. They can't turn back now. They have only four players over 30, including the long-snapper, so it's not as though they have a glut of older guys impeding the progress of young, promising players. Every young player with upside will have a role.\n\nAh, but there is one caveat: The quarterback position. That's where the issue of now versus the future likely will come up.\n\nA couple of weeks ago, I asked Bowles if the quarterback decision will be based on which player gives the team the best chance to win.\n\n\"Always,\" he said matter-of-factly.\n\nThat's a slippery slope, because there probably will come a point where Bowles will have to turn to Christian Hackenberg even if he's not the \"best\" option. In other words, at what point does he look to the future at quarterback?\n\nA coach fighting for his job might wait longer than a coach with built-in security. A year ago, Bowles waited until the Jets were 3-9 before handing the keys to Bryce Petty. There's no way he can wait that long before turning to Hackenberg, assuming he doesn't win the job in the preseason.\n\nMaybe Hackenberg will make it a no-brainer by overtaking Josh McCown, who is hardly entrenched in the starting role. That would make it easier on everybody. If not, it'll be a dicey decision, because the downside to a win-first approach is the Jets might actually win a few, hurting their draft position.\n\nOwnership will evaluate Bowles after the season, deciding whether to part ways or extend him beyond 2018 (his final year) because a lame-duck situation wouldn't be good for anyone. Could Woody Johnson give him a contract extension now? It would be unusual, coming off a 5-11 season, but, hey, it's his money. It's not as though it counts against the salary cap. I suppose Johnson could make a verbal promise to retain Bowles beyond 2017, but ask Eric Mangini about Johnson's verbal promises.\n\nIn the end, if Bowles can get five to seven wins out of this team, he'll deserve a multi-year extension and a place in the Ring of Honor.", "dateTime": "2017-08-19T11:19:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 327, "textStart": 312, "date": "2017-08-18", "amb": false}], "sim": 0.5333333611488342, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-19", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3374995", "time": "11:19:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3375052", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "305872", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "score": 3}, {"id": "306941", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "New York Jets"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Jets", "score": 4}, {"id": "310462", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Farm team"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farm_team", "score": 5}, {"id": "339167", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Salary cap"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salary_cap", "score": 1}, {"id": "355959", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Woody Johnson"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woody_Johnson", "score": 1}, {"id": "360558", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Todd Bowles"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todd_Bowles", "score": 4}, {"id": "361834", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Christian Hackenberg"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Hackenberg", "score": 2}, {"id": "372336", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Josh McCown"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_McCown", "score": 2}, {"id": "401985", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Bryce Petty"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryce_Petty", "score": 2}, {"id": "1294987", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "List of New York Jets head coaches"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_New_York_Jets_head_coaches", "score": 3}], "image": "http://a3.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2017%2F0818%2Fr246002_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg", "timeCrawl": "11:19:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "Could more job security for Todd Bowles help the Jets rebuild?", "originalArticle": null}

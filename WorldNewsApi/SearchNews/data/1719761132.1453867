{"id": 225051058, "title": "\u201cChance of acquittal is zero\": Experts say Trump lawyer's closing argument reeked of \"desperation\"", "text": "Whether Donald Trump is guilty in the eyes of the law will be placed in the hands of twelve New Yorkers, who are set to begin deliberating in the former president\u2019s hush money trial on Wednesday and could come back with a verdict this week. It will be they who decide if the presumptive Republican nominee becomes the first American head of state to be convicted of a crime after leaving office \u2013 and up to the judge, Juan Merchan, to decide whether a conviction means Trump will also be the first former president behind bars. In his closing argument, defense attorney Todd Blanche tried to sneak that fact in during what was otherwise two hours spent attacking Michael Cohen, the former president\u2019s ex-fixer, dubbed by Blanche as the \u201cgreatest liar of all time.\u201d He also insisted that his client only ever paid Cohen for his legal work, subject to a retainer that was never documented. Saying that his client could go to prison if found guilty was how Blanche chose to close out, which does not suggest confidence that he will be found innocent; it\u2019s also why one of the last things the jury saw was Merchan reprimanding the defense counsel, reminding him that the rules of court prohibit trying to sway jurors with talk of incarceration when the crime, here, could be punished with a fine. Blanche, a former prosecutor himself, possibly calculated that the talking down would be worth if it give just one juror pause about the gravity of a conviction. It also reeked of \u201cdesperation,\u201d per former federal prosecutor Harry Litman. \u201cThe idea is to try to gin up a hung jury or some kind of person to have sympathy,\u201d Litman said during an appearance on MSNBC. That, he argued, does not suggest confidence that the five weeks of trial \u2013 in which jurors saw Trump Organization financial documents spelling out how Cohen would be reimbursed for a $130,000 hush payment to Stormy Daniels, including handwritten notes from Trump loyalist and Rikers Island inmate Allen Weisselberg \u2013 went well for his client. \u201cIf you thought you had a decent shot at a hung jury without that, I don\u2019t think you would engender the judge\u2019s ire in that way.\u201d Timothy Parlatore, an attorney who previously represented Trump, was similarly underwhelmed by Blanche\u2019s performance. \u201cIt went way too long,\u201d he told CNN, saying the two-hour rebuttal of the prosecution\u2019s case \u201cprobably bored the jury.\u201d It was dull without Blanche even addressing the documentary evidence, from Weisselberg\u2019s handwritten notes, as the Trump Organization\u2019s then-chief financial officer, on the apparent hush money conspiracy, to Trump Organization accountant Jeffrey McConney\u2019s notes explaining how Cohen\u2019s monthly payments \u201cfrom DJT\u201d would cover the taxes he\u2019d owe from falsely claiming the hush money reimbursement as income. \u201cWhy would Cohen and Weisselberg have done this without Trump\u2019s authorization? The defense failed to come up with a compelling explanation,\u201d wrote former U.S. attorney Joyce Vance on her personal website. Vance noted that multiple witnesses had described Trump as a micromanager \u2013 contra Blanche\u2019s argument he\u2019d be too busy as president to involve himself in an illicit scheme to falsify business records and evade campaign finance laws \u2013 and rebutted the notion that Cohen would drop $130,000 of his own money to buy Daniels\u2019 silence without Trump\u2019s knowledge and consent. \u201cThis was the prosecution\u2019s linchpin evidence,\u201d Vance wrote, \u201cand the defense didn\u2019t offer the jury a good reason to reject it.\u201d Norm Eisen, a CNN legal analyst and senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, was similarly underwhelmed. \u201cThe prosecution was ahead on points going into the closing arguments and Tuesday did not change that calculus,\u201d he wrote in a commentary on the closing arguments. Ty Cobb, another former Trump attorney, was more blunt. \u201cThe chance of an acquittal is zero to none,\u201d he told The Daily Beast.", "summary": "Trump's defense counsel failed to address the prosecution's documentary evidence and looked bad in front of jurors", "url": "https://www.salon.com/2024/05/29/chance-of-acquittal-is-zero-experts-say-lawyers-closing-argument-reeked-of-desperation/", "image": "https://mediaproxy.salon.com/width/1200/height/675/<?= https://media2.salon.com/2024/05/donald_trump_todd_blanche_2153375120.jpg ?>", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 14:17:56", "author": "Charles R", "authors": ["Charles R"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.68}

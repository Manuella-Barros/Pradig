Each of these decisions made by teams has a ripple effect, which makes summers so interesting. With the Oklahoma City Thunder\u2019s season coming to an end following a 4-2 series loss against the Dallas Mavericks, a pivotal offseason is ahead. This isn\u2019t a summer in which the Thunder needs to make the biggest move of any team to take that next step. Given how young the team is, natural development and experience will propel the team to new heights moving forward. But there are still quite a few contractual decisions to be made, along with a lottery pick in the draft to leverage. Furthermore, free agency and the trade market will be options for OKC to improve. What\u2019s next for the Thunder, and what key milestones will take place during the offseason that will directly impact the 2024-25 season for Oklahoma City? 2024 NBA Draft Oklahoma City at one time had four potential first-round selections in the 2024 NBA Draft, but will ultimately only have one. Two of those four were traded in deals for future draft capital, while a third (via the Utah Jazz) didn\u2019t convey due to protections and will likely become available in next year\u2019s draft.

In what has become a full-circle moment, this is one of the picks that Oklahoma City acquired in the swap of Russell Westbrook and Chris Paul when the franchise officially decided to reset. Although this is considered a weaker draft class, there are plenty of players who will become quality contributors at the NBA level. Furthermore, OKC has proven to be one of the most effective teams in recent years at drafting late in the lottery. Until closer to the 2024 NBA Draft in late June, it\u2019s difficult to even project which prospects may be available at No. 12 overall. Nonetheless, the Thunder has one of the best scouting departments in the league and will get a player they really like. Alternatively, that selection could be traded for a later pick, future draft capital or even a player who can help the team win now. Regardless, Oklahoma City is in a good position given this was a 57-win team and top seed in the Western Conference, but still has a lottery pick. Contracts and Roster Spots Oklahoma City will have at least three roster spots open up this season, as Gordon Hayward, Bismack Biyombo and Mike Muscala will be coming off the books. Not only will that be three open spots on the 15-man roster, but also nearly $35 million between those players \u2014 most of which come from Hayward\u2019s expiring deal. Furthermore, Lindy Waters III has a team option which almost certainly has a chance to be declined. He\u2019s a solid shooter off the bench, but could provide a fourth open roster spot if the team decides to part ways. Aaron Wiggins, Isaiah Joe and Josh Giddey each have team options as well, but it\u2019s extremely likely that all three have their contracts either opted into, or declined as a mechanism to immediately sign a new deal with the Thunder. To avoid more competition on the free agent market, Oklahoma City will likely be inclined to do just that with Joe and Wiggins, who are both well deserving of much larger contracts as negotiations take place in the coming weeks. In short, expect three or four roster spots to open up for the Thunder, along with roughly $35 million of cap space to work with in free agency or the trade market. Trade Market and Free Agency This summer\u2019s free agent class isn\u2019t the best as it relates to what OKC is looking for, so the Thunder shouldn\u2019t be expected to make a huge splash on that front. When looking at who may be available to sign that could fit what the team needs, some interesting names include Nic Claxton, Jonas Valanciunas, Jalen Smith, Precious Achiuwa, Derrick Jones Jr. and Saddiq Bey among others. Oklahoma City\u2019s cap space is more likely to be leveraged on the trade market to bring on unwanted salary attached to assets, or even win-now talent. Given the Thunder plays in a small market, this has always been the strategy for GM Sam Presti. Even then, the franchise will want to maintain financial flexibility so that it can pay its rising stars in the future and also continue to have sustained success for the next decade. Making an impulse move now in bringing in a highly-paid player on a long-term deal is unlikely. Oklahoma City could in theory bring in a star with one or two years left on their deal. Someone like Kevin Durant from a financial perspective would actually work out, given his current deal would come off the books before Jalen Williams and Chet Holmgren start their extensions \u2014 which are expected to be rookie max deals. As interesting as that would be \u2014 and it shouldn\u2019t be counted out \u2014 what\u2019s more likely is bringing in a younger player on a smaller deal. Oklahoma City has the assets to trade for nearly anyone in the league, and there are quite a few players who could be acquired to help fill voids now and enhance the team\u2019s playoff ceiling. Deni Avdija (Washington Wizards) Collin Sexton (Utah Jazz) Isaiah Stewart (Detroit Pistons) Onkyeka Okongwu (Atlanta Hawks) Robert Williams (Portland Trail Blazers) There are many directions this Thunder team could go during the offseason, but regardless of what happens Oklahoma City should be yet again a championship contender in the 2024-25 campaign.

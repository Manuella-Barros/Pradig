The Enquirer/Patrick Brennan\n\nCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE\n\nMASON -- The drought for an American champion at the Western & Southern Open extended into its second decade Saturday at the Lindner Family Tennis Center.\n\nEleven years on from Andy Roddick's 2006 victory at the Western & Southern, the likable John Isner was America's last hope at the 2017 edition of the men's singles event.\n\nIsner, the world-ranked No. 19 player and No. 14 seed at this year's event, didn't go quietly in his semifinal against Bulgarian Grigor Dimitrov, but still lost in straight sets to crash out of the competition.\n\nDimitrov won a marathon second-set tiebreak, 12-10, to take the match, 7-6(4), 7-6(10).\n\nPlayed in the heat of the day with the temperatures hovering around 90 degrees, the match saw Isner drop his first set of the week in Mason, and later his first match.\n\nSEE ALSO: Spain's Garbine Muguruza downs defending W&S Open singles champ, advances to title match\n\n\"Yeah, I think the difference was he was a bit more decisive in the big moments. Maybe a little calmer, as well. Sometimes you take the court, and everything is going well and you're not thinking too much out there and things are free flowing,\" Isner said during a press conference afterward. \"At times that was the case out there for me, but at times maybe it wasn't. And I think that cost me a little bit. I just think he was, as I said, a little more decisive and a little more free flowing, I think, in the big moments, and of course in a match like that, separated by a few points here or there, that was the case. So credit to him.\"\n\nWorld-ranked No. 11 Dimitrov did what Isner couldn't, both in advancing to Sunday's title tilt and in doing so without dropping a set all week.\n\nOn Saturday, Dimitrov sent a partisan crowd home disappointed in foiling Isner's attempt at his second career final in Cincinnati.\n\nIsner had openings against Dimitrov, but unlike his previous matches this week, and even prior to the Western & Southern, Isner missed his chances. Isner had consecutive break points at 3-2, 15/40 in the first set, but squandered the opportunity as Dimitrov managed to hold.\n\n\"I felt like throughout this week I played my break points pretty well,\" Isner said. \"I had two essentially set points at 15-40, whatever it was, and I played two good points. He just played two better points. I think I stepped up this week, which is what I was doing prior to this week, as well, and that's just sort of going for my shots. I mean, there are some times when I didn't, but all in all, I think I just gotta keep that up. It's the only way I can play.\n\nNeither player earned a break. Dimitrov only faced three break points for the match.\n\nTake the sports with you. Download the Cincinnati.com app on both the Apple App Store and Google Play.\n\nThough the tiebreak scenarios typically play nicely into the hands of Isner, a hard-serving Bombardier who lashed the ball at upward of 140 mph all week, faltered in both sets.\n\nDuring the second-set tiebreak, Isner moved several times to within a point of forcing a third set, but Dimitrov withstood Isner's furious last stand that saw the players contest the tiebreak over 22 points.\n\nIn advancing to his first-ever ATP Masters 1000 final, Dimitrov improved to 26-4 record in 2017 matches in which he's won the first set.\n\nDimitrov on Sunday will face the winner of the corresponding semifinal between unseeded Australian Nick Kyrgios and unseeded Spaniard David Ferrer.\n\nLike many players that exited earlier this week, Isner will now turn his attention to the U.S. Open, which will be contested in New York City from Aug. 28 through Sept. 10.\n\n\"Looking ahead to the US Open, I have a good team, got a great coach and great person to keep me healthy,\" Isner said, \"so just keep working on the right things and I should be in pretty good shape heading into that tournament.\"\n\nCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE", "dateTime": "2017-08-19T22:41:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 3835, "date": "2017-08-28", "amb": false, "textStart": 3811, "dateEnd": "2017-09-10", "imp": true}], "sim": 0.8078431487083435, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-19", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3374723", "time": "22:41:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3374723", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "67", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "233", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "194027", "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "302857", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "score": 4}, {"id": "303236", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "score": 2}, {"id": "306750", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Google Play Store"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Play", "score": 2}, {"id": "308220", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "App Store (iOS)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/App_Store_(iOS)", "score": 2}, {"id": "310203", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Garbi\u00f1e Muguruza"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbi\u00f1e_Muguruza", "score": 3}, {"id": "316782", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "John Isner"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Isner", "score": 5}, {"id": "321518", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "David Ferrer"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ferrer", "score": 1}, {"id": "323074", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Single skating"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_skating", "score": 3}, {"id": "337716", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "ATP World Tour Masters 1000"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATP_World_Tour_Masters_1000", "score": 1}, {"id": "350450", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Nick Kyrgios"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Kyrgios", "score": 1}, {"id": "405086", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Grigor Dimitrov"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grigor_Dimitrov", "score": 3}, {"id": "418093", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Andy Roddick"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Roddick", "score": 3}, {"id": "678502", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Lindner Family Tennis Center"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindner_Family_Tennis_Center", "score": 3}], "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/cincinnati.png", "timeCrawl": "22:41:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "John Isner ousted by Grigor Dimitrov in W&S Open semis", "originalArticle": null}

It's only fitting, because Isner has been ousting fellow Americans left and right at the Western & Southern Open.\n\nThe world No. 19 opened with a victory over Viktor Troicki and has since disposed of three consecutive American wild cards-Tommy Paul, Frances Tiafoe, and Jared Donaldson. Not one opponent managed to take a set off Isner and none earned a single break of serve. ( all had good scores and competitive matches )\n\nIsner's run continued on Friday afternoon with a 7-6(4), 7-5 defeat of Donaldson. The 2013 Cincinnati runner-up fired 25 aces and held all 12 of his service games without facing a break point to advance in one hour and 30 minutes.\n\nThe streak of countrymen on the other side of the net, however, will come to an end on Saturday.\n\nInstead, Grigor Dimitrov awaits Isner in the semifinals. Dimitrov also has refused to surrender a single set in wins over Feliciano Lopez, Juan Martin Del Potro, and Yuichi Sugita. The 11th-ranked Bulgarian was especially dominant on Friday, when he trounced surprising quarterfinalist Yuichi Sugita 6-2, 6-1 in 52 minutes.\n\n\"It's a good feeling, for sure,\" Dimitrov said of reaching the semis. \"I like playing in Cincinnati. I love that centre court, as well. I think all that brings me good memories and just a positive way of thinking when I come out there on the court.\n\n\"I think that was about it, to be honest.

a performance more akin to Sugita's level before his ridiculous positive break point variance kicked in a few months ago - and it's a fascinating match-up to analyse.\n\nDimitrov is available at [1.76] on the Exchange, and my model made this a few ticks of value, but nothing worth formally recommending, so with projected hold percentages on a fast hard court predictably high, in the 90%s for both players.\n\nThe duo have only met once before, with Isner coming out as a 7-6 6-2 winner in Miami in 2015, as a slight underdog, and on a slower hard court, their projected hold percentages for that match were merely in the high 80%s, with around an 18% of there being no breaks in the first set.\n\nHowever, today's expected conditions, and the changes in data for both players since then make a first-set tiebreak around a 55% chance, and with the Sportsbook offering even money on 7-6 to either player in the first set, this looks today's best bet.\n\nIn the other semi-final, David Ferrer meets Nick Kyrgios, with the Aussie a [1.43] favourite to make the final after despatching tournament favourite Rafa Nadal in straight sets in the late rescheduled match last night, after their third round matches were delayed from Thursday.\n\nKyrgios played four-and-a-half sets yesterday, needing three to overcome Ivo Karlovic after their first set was suspended midway through on Thursday, and given his injury issues and this potential fatigue, it will be interesting to see how he copes with a player who will chase every ball, albeit not nearly as successfully as at his peak several years ago.\n\nHaving said this, Ferrer comprehensively defeated Dominic Thiem last night, continuing the Austrian's mediocre hard court record post-Wimbledon each year in his career, and isn't without a chance here - my model priced Kyrgios bigger, at [1.54] for this match.\n\nHowever, I'm sticking to the first set tiebreak bet in the Isner and Dimitrov match tonight and anticipate two decent semi-finals in what has turned into a pretty open tournament -

Of course, it helps that only one of the aforementioned quartet competed in Cincinnati.\n\nWith Roger Federer, Andy Murray, and Novak Djokovic on the shelf, Dimitrov and Kyrgios have played their way into Sunday's title match. They picked up respective hard-fought, straight-set semifinal victories over John Isner and David Ferrer to set up what should be an entertaining championship clash.\n\nDimitrov gave Isner a taste of his own medicine, taking down the huge server and tiebreaker machine 7-6(4), 7-6(10) in two hours and three minutes.\n\n\"Today was, I think, one of those matches that I really had to just be patient,\" the 11th-ranked Bulgarian explained. \"I think that that was the key. I knew I'm not going to have that many rallies against John. I knew that he's going to serve big, bold serves. I just had to be very composed and use every opportunity that I had. I think in the end of the match, it was just a few points that made the biggest difference for me.\n\n\"I'm just happy with the way I kept myself together throughout the whole match-just remained calm in those tough moments. I mean, I know it's nerve-wracking from outside, but it's even tougher when you're in there and have to receive a serve that comes 141 miles an hour.\"\n\nFerrer also had to receive a few of those; too many, in fact, for his Cincinnati run to continue. The 35-year-old Spaniard held all 12 of his service games, but he never managed to earn a break of his own. Just like in the Dimitrov-Isner showdown, both sets progressed to tiebreakers without a single break of serve. In the end, Kyrgios had too much firepower in the pressure-packed moments and prevailed 7-6(3), 7-6(4) after two hours and four minutes.\n\nThe 22-year-old Australian out-aced his opponent 14 to one and won an impressive 43 of 48 first-serve points. Each man saved three of three break points.\n\nBoth Dimitrov and Kyrgios are through to their first-ever Masters 1000 final.

In fact, I was a little disappointed when I saw the market prices, given that I thought there was a reasonable chance Sugita would be over-rated by the market for this encounter.\n\nFollowing this match, there's an all-American clash as Jared Donaldson takes on heavy [1.38] favourite John Isner, and this is the match where my model indicated some slight prematch value, pricing the more experienced Isner at [1.48] against an improving opponent.\n\nIsner being loved by the market in his home country is certainly nothing new, and he does tend to get the job done in the end, but we can certainly look at handicap options for backing Donaldson here.\n\nThe +/- 2.5 game market is still forming on the Exchange, and Donaldson is currently available +2.5 games at [2.14]. I'd prefer a little bigger - anything in excess of [2.20] would be a touch more acceptable, and followers with patience should be rewarded.\n\nFinally, there is the more return-orientated clash, scheduled at midnight UK time, between Dominic Thiem and David Ferrer, which my model priced relatively similarly to the market lines, which made the Austrian a [1.54] favourite to progress, although there was a couple of percentage points value on the Spanish veteran, Ferrer.\n\nAfter being written off for the first half of the season, Ferrer has found a way to compete and in the last couple of months, has shown a solid enough level without ever reaching his previous heights. He can certainly give Thiem a decent match this evening.", "dateTime": "2017-08-18T11:37:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.7137255072593689, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3374723", "time": "11:37:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3374723", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "76", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "233", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "score": 2}, {"id": "304425", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "score": 3}, {"id": "305581", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Juan Mart\u00edn del Potro"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Mart\u00edn_del_Potro", "score": 2}, {"id": "311474", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Albert Ramos"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Ramos", "score": 3}, {"id": "316782", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "John Isner"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Isner", "score": 5}, {"id": "316792", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Dominic Thiem"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominic_Thiem", "score": 1}, {"id": "321518", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "David Ferrer"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ferrer", "score": 1}, {"id": "345054", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Feliciano L\u00f3pez"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feliciano_L\u00f3pez", "score": 3}, {"id": "350450", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Nick Kyrgios"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Kyrgios", "score": 3}, {"id": "359693", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "ATP Challenger Tour"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATP_Challenger_Tour", "score": 3}, {"id": "405086", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Grigor Dimitrov"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grigor_Dimitrov", "score": 3}, {"id": "502853", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Y\u016bichi Sugita"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y\u016bichi_Sugita", "score": 5}, {"id": "516331", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Ivo Karlovi\u0107"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivo_Karlovi\u0107", "score": 3}, {"id": "1339257", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Jared Donaldson"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jared_Donaldson", "score": 2}], "image": "https://betting.cdnbf.net/tennis/John%20Isner%20serve%20Cincy16.336x224.jpg", "timeCrawl": "11:37:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "ATP Cincinnati Masters Day 6 Preview: Donaldson can cover game handicap against Isner", "originalArticle": null}

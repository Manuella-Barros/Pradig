(Russian Defense Ministry Press Service)\n\nSince Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, President Vladimir Putin and other Kremlin voices have frequently threatened the West with its nuclear arsenal.\n\nOn Day 1 of the war, Putin said \"whoever tries to impede us, let alone create threats for our country and its people, must know that the Russian response will be immediate and lead to consequences you have never seen in history.\"\n\nOver nearly 2 1/2 years of fighting, the West has given Ukraine billions of dollars of advanced weapons, some of which have struck Russian soil. And while there have been more Kremlin threats -- and even the deployment of battlefield nuclear weapons in Belarus, just over the border from Ukraine -- so far it has remained only a blunt message.\n\nWhat could finally trigger a nuclear response?\n\nAsked that in June by international news agencies, Putin pointed to Russia's so-called nuclear doctrine.\n\n\"Look what is written there,\" he said at the St. Petersburg session. \"If somebody's actions threaten our sovereignty and territorial integrity, we consider it possible to use all means at our disposal.\"\n\nNow Russian hawks are urging him to change the doctrine to lower the threshold for using nuclear weapons, and Putin says the document could be modified to take into account the evolving global situation.\n\nWhat is Russia's nuclear doctrine?\n\nFormally known as the \"Basic Principles of State Policy on Nuclear Deterrence,\" it was signed by Putin in 2020 and outlines when Russia could dip into its atomic arsenal, the world's largest.\n\nIt describes nuclear weapons as \"a means of deterrence,\" noting that their use is an \"extreme and compelled measure.\" It declares that Russia \"takes all necessary efforts to reduce the nuclear threat and prevent aggravation of interstate relations that could trigger military conflicts, including nuclear ones.\"\n\nThe document states that \"nuclear deterrence is aimed to provide comprehension by a potential adversary of the inevitability of retaliation in the event of aggression against the Russian Federation and/or its allies.\"\n\nWhat does it say will trigger using nuclear weapons?\n\nRussia could use them, the doctrine says, \"in response to the use of nuclear and other types of weapons of mass destruction against it and/or its allies, as well as in the event of aggression against the Russian Federation with the use of conventional weapons when the very existence of the state is in jeopardy.\"\n\nIt says nuclear weapons could be used under the following specific situations:\n\n* If reliable information is received about the launch of ballistic missiles targeting the territory of Russia or its allies.\n\n* If nuclear weapons or other weapons of mass destruction are used against Russia or its allies.\n\n* If an enemy attack with conventional weapons threatens Russia's existence.\n\n* If there are attacks on critically important Russian government or military facilities that could undermine the country's retaliatory nuclear strike capability.\n\nHas any attack so far come close to crossing this threshold?\n\nAs Russia attacked parts of northeastern Ukraine near the city of Kharkiv, Washington has allowed Kyiv to use longer-range U.S.-supplied weapons for strikes in Russian territory in the border region. But these attacks have been limited in scope and would not seem to pose an existential threat that would fall under the nuclear doctrine.\n\nHowever, the hawks in Moscow have pointed to a series of Ukrainian attacks on Russian air bases that host long-range nuclear capable bombers earlier in the conflict, as well as recent raids on early warning radars.\n\nThey say these circumstances would seem to warrant the use of nuclear weapons as laid out in the doctrine.\n\nRussian officials haven't commented on the attacks on the more sensitive targets. The early warning radars are designed to spot the launch of U.S. missiles to allow Russia to launch its own nuclear-tipped missiles before they are destroyed.\n\nJames Acton, co-director of the nuclear policy program at the Carnegie Endowment, said in a recent commentary that Ukrainian attacks on the early warning radars could prompt the Kremlin to think Washington had encouraged such strikes to try to weaken Russia's nuclear deterrent.\n\n\"If Moscow believes that Washington could conduct a successful preemptive attack on its nuclear forces, its trigger finger could get very itchy, raising the risk that Russia might launch a large-scale nuclear attack based on a false or misinterpreted warning,\" Acton said.\n\nWhat changes in the doctrine are under discussion?\n\nThe Kremlin's nuclear threats have been dialed down recently amid Moscow's battlefield successes in Ukraine. However, there also have been calls in Russia for changing the nuclear doctrine, and Putin said it could be modified, depending on global events.\n\nHawks have called repeatedly for sharpening it, arguing the current document is too weak and vague. They say the doctrine hasn't deterred the West from increasing aid to Ukraine and gives the impression that Moscow won't ever resort to nuclear weapons.\n\nForeign affairs expert Dmitri Trenin, of the Institute of World Economy and International Relations, a state-funded Moscow think tank, suggests revising it to declare that Russia could strike first with nuclear weapons when \"the core national interests are at stake,\" like in Ukraine.\n\n\"The acute task in the third year of military confrontation is to prevent NATO's deeper engagement in it,\" Trenin wrote recently. \"If we don't do it, the inertia of persistent escalation by the West will lead to a direct clash between Russian and NATO militaries, which is fraught with a global nuclear war.\"\n\nAt the international forum in St. Petersburg, Sergei Karaganov, a foreign policy expert who advises the Kremlin, also urged Putin to amend the doctrine to lower the threshold for the use of nuclear weapons.\n\n\"I hope it will be changed soon to give you the formal right to respond to any strikes on our territory with a nuclear strike,\" he told the Russian leader. \"I hope that such a provision will be added to our doctrine to help cool our adversaries.\"\n\nKaraganov likened the West to Sodom and Gomorrah, the biblical cities destroyed by God with a rain of fire for their wickedness. \"Let's remember that rain and try to make humankind come to its senses,\" he said.\n\nPutin responded cautiously, saying that he currently sees no threats that would warrant nuclear weapons use, but he also held the door open to revising the policy.\n\n\"This doctrine is a living instrument, we are carefully watching what's going on in the world around us, and we don't exclude making changes in the doctrine,\" he said.\n\nThe need to modify the document, he said, was driven by concerns about the West pondering the possible deployment of low-yield nuclear weapons. Putin didn't give specifics, but his comments could refer to U.S. discussions on deploying low-power submarine-launched nuclear missiles.\n\nProponents say such weapons are needed to counter Russian threats, while critics argue they could lower the threshold for the U.S. using nuclear weapons and increase the risk of war.\n\n\"Nuclear devices of extremely low power are being developed, and we are aware of the ideas circulating in expert circles in the West that such strike assets could be used, and there is nothing particularly horrible about it,\" Putin said. \"We are obliged to take notice of that, and we are taking notice.\"", "source": {"uri": "stripes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Stars and Stripes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

And while there have been more Kremlin threats -- and even the deployment of battlefield nuclear weapons in Belarus, just over the border from Ukraine -- so far it has remained only a blunt message.\n\nWhat could trigger a Russian nuclear response?\n\nAsked that in June by international news agencies, Putin pointed to Russia's so-called nuclear doctrine.\n\n\"Look what is written there,\" he said at the St. Petersburg session. \"If somebody's actions threaten our sovereignty and territorial integrity, we consider it possible to use all means at our disposal.\"\n\nNow Russian hawks are urging him to change the doctrine to lower the threshold for using nuclear weapons, and Putin says the document could be modified to take into account the evolving global situation.\n\nFormally known as the \"Basic Principles of State Policy on Nuclear Deterrence,\" it was signed by Putin in 2020 and outlines when Russia could dip into its atomic arsenal, the world's largest.\n\nIt describes nuclear weapons as \"a means of deterrence,\" noting that their use is an \"extreme and compelled measure.\" It declares that Russia \"takes all necessary efforts to reduce the nuclear threat and prevent aggravation of interstate relations that could trigger military conflicts, including nuclear ones.\"\n\nThe document states that \"nuclear deterrence is aimed to provide comprehension by a potential adversary of the inevitability of retaliation in the event of aggression against the Russian Federation and/or its allies.\"\n\nRussia could use them, the doctrine says, \"in response to the use of nuclear and other types of weapons of mass destruction against it and/or its allies, as well as in the event of aggression against the Russian Federation with the use of conventional weapons when the very existence of the state is in jeopardy.\"\n\nIt says nuclear weapons could be used under the following specific situations:\n\n-- If reliable information is received about the launch of ballistic missiles targeting the territory of Russia or its allies.\n\n-- If nuclear weapons or other weapons of mass destruction are used against Russia or its allies.\n\n-- If an enemy attack with conventional weapons threatens Russia's existence.\n\n-- If there are attacks on critically important Russian government or military facilities that could undermine the country's retaliatory nuclear strike capability.\n\nAs Russia attacked parts of northeastern Ukraine near the city of Kharkiv, Washington has allowed Kyiv to use longer-range U.S.-supplied weapons for strikes in Russian territory in the border region. But these attacks have been limited in scope and would not seem to pose an existential threat that would fall under the nuclear doctrine.\n\nHowever, the hawks in Moscow have pointed to a series of Ukrainian attacks on Russian air bases that host long-range nuclear capable bombers earlier in the conflict, as well as recent raids on early warning radars.\n\nThey say these circumstances would seem to warrant the use of nuclear weapons as laid out in the doctrine.\n\nRussian officials haven't commented on the attacks on the more sensitive targets. The early warning radars are designed to spot the launch of U.S. missiles to allow Russia to launch its own nuclear-tipped missiles before they are destroyed.\n\nJames Acton, co-director of the nuclear policy program at the Carnegie Endowment, said in a recent commentary that Ukrainian attacks on the early warning radars could prompt the Kremlin to think Washington had encouraged such strikes to try to weaken Russia's nuclear deterrent.\n\n\"If Moscow believes that Washington could conduct a successful preemptive attack on its nuclear forces, its trigger finger could get very itchy, raising the risk that Russia might launch a large-scale nuclear attack based on a false or misinterpreted warning,\" Acton said.\n\nThe Kremlin's nuclear threats have been dialed down recently amid Moscow's battlefield successes in Ukraine. However, there also have been calls in Russia for changing the nuclear doctrine, and Putin said it could be modified, depending on global events.\n\nHawks have called repeatedly for sharpening it, arguing the current document is too weak and vague. They say the doctrine hasn't deterred the West from increasing aid to Ukraine and gives the impression that Moscow won't ever resort to nuclear weapons.\n\nForeign affairs expert Dmitri Trenin, of the Institute of World Economy and International Relations, a state-funded Moscow think tank, suggests revising it to declare that Russia could strike first with nuclear weapons when \"the core national interests are at stake,\" like in Ukraine.\n\n\"The acute task in the third year of military confrontation is to prevent NATO's deeper engagement in it,\" Trenin wrote recently. \"If we don't do it, the inertia of persistent escalation by the West will lead to a direct clash between Russian and NATO militaries, which is fraught with a global nuclear war.\"\n\nAt the international forum in St. Petersburg, Sergei Karaganov, a foreign policy expert who advises the Kremlin, also urged Putin to amend the doctrine to lower the threshold for the use of nuclear weapons.\n\n\"I hope it will be changed soon to give you the formal right to respond to any strikes on our territory with a nuclear strike,\" he told the Russian leader. \"I hope that such a provision will be added to our doctrine to help cool our adversaries.\"\n\nKaraganov likened the West to Sodom and Gomorrah, the biblical cities destroyed by God with a rain of fire for their wickedness. \"Let's remember that rain and try to make humankind come to its senses,\" he said.\n\nPutin responded cautiously, saying that he currently sees no threats that would warrant nuclear weapons use, but he also held the door open to revising the policy.\n\n\"This doctrine is a living instrument, we are carefully watching what's going on in the world around us, and we don't exclude making changes in the doctrine,\" he said.\n\nThe need to modify the document, he said, was driven by concerns about the West pondering the possible deployment of low-yield nuclear weapons. Putin didn't give specifics, but his comments could refer to U.S. discussions on deploying low-power submarine-launched nuclear missiles.\n\nProponents say such weapons are needed to counter Russian threats, while critics argue they could lower the threshold for the U.S. using nuclear weapons and increase the risk of war.\n\n\"Nuclear devices of extremely low power are being developed, and we are aware of the ideas circulating in expert circles in the West that such strike assets could be used, and there is nothing particularly horrible about it,\" Putin said. \"We are obliged to take notice of that, and we are taking notice.\"", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The decree also recommends that regional authorities match this payment from their budgets with at least the same amount.\n\nWith the minimum monthly payment for a private taking part in what Russia calls a \u201cspecial military operation\u201d set at 204,000 roubles, the new decree raises the minimum annual wage in the first year of service to 3.25 million roubles (US$37,791).\n\nMonthly wages for officers are higher and depend on their rank. All recruits also receive additional money for taking part in offensives or destroying enemy tanks and other machinery.\n\nEarlier this month, the mayor of Moscow set an upfront payment for city residents signing up to fight in Ukraine at 1.9 million roubles (US$21,777) from the city budget, bringing their annual pay in their first year of service to 5.2 million roubles.\n\nThe latest increases mean that the minimum annual pay for Russian contract soldiers fighting in Ukraine will exceed the average wage in Russia by more than threefold, with the minimum pay for Muscovites exceeding the average wage by more than fivefold.\n\nSuch payments have helped Russia avoid a new nationwide mobilisation after a troubled campaign in 2022 led to a mass exodus of people to neighbouring countries. However, some economists argue that the payments are creating a wage spiral in the economy.\n\nThe wage increases are also supported by an array of other measures, such as exemptions on monthly interest payments on consumer loans for volunteers and state guarantees on such loans in the case of death.\n\nThese measures have been encouraging would-be volunteers to take consumer loans and have contributed to continued growth in consumer lending, despite the central bank hiking its key interest rate to cool the economy.\n\nRussian officials say about 190,000 people have volunteered so far this year to fight in Ukraine, compared with 490,000 contracts signed in 2023.Russia trains troops in tactical nuclear weapons\n\nThe Russian military on Wednesday began a third round of drills with tactical nuclear weapons, part of the Kremlin\u2019s messaging intended to force the West to limit its support for Ukraine.\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry said the drills will feature units of the central and southern military districts armed with Iskander short-range missiles. They will practice receiving nuclear weapons from storage and deploying them to designated launch areas. The manoeuvres will also include air force units that will arm their warplanes with nuclear weapons and perform patrol flights.\n\nThe ministry said the drills are intended to maintain troops\u2019 readiness for combat missions.\n\nTactical nuclear weapons include bombs, warheads for short-range missiles and artillery munitions and are meant for use on a battlefield. They are typically far less powerful than strategic weapons \u2013 massive warheads that arm intercontinental ballistic missiles and are intended to obliterate entire cities.\n\nThe previous two rounds of the manoeuvres were held in May and June. The drills in June were conducted jointly with the armed forces of Russia\u2019s ally Belarus.\n\nLast year, Russia moved some of its tactical nuclear weapons into neighbouring Belarus, which also borders Ukraine and Nato members Poland, Latvia and Lithuania. Belarus\u2019 authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko has relied on close ties with Russia and provided his country as a staging ground for sending troops to Ukraine in February 2022.\n\nPresident Putin and his officials have repeatedly reminded the West about the country\u2019s nuclear might in a bid to discourage Nato allies from ramping up their support for Kyiv.\n\nThe Kremlin has described the drills with tactical nuclear weapons as part of Moscow\u2019s response to statements by Nato allies encouraging strikes on Russian territory with Western weapons and the possible deployment of Western troops to Ukraine.\n\nAmid recent battlefield gains in Ukraine, Putin has emphasised that Russia doesn\u2019t need nuclear weapons to achieve his goals. But he also reaffirmed that they can be used in the case of a threat to Russia\u2019s territorial integrity, in line with the country\u2019s nuclear doctrine.\n\nRussian hawks have urged the Kremlin to change the doctrine to lower the threshold for using nuclear weapons, and Putin said the document could be modified to take into account the evolving global situation.", "source": {"uri":

According to the Russian Ministry of Defense, this stage encompasses the preparation for the combat distribution of the nuclear arsenal.\n\nThis May, Moscow deployed its 2024 non-strategic nuclear arsenal for the first time during a major military exercise. The initial phase assessed the preparation and readiness for nuclear weapon use, while the second phase, conducted last month, involved the \"joint use of nuclear weapons,\" incorporating Belarus into the exercises.\n\nThe nonstrategic nuclear weapons\n\nNonstrategic nuclear weapons, often referred to as tactical nuclear weapons, are specifically designed for battlefield use or limited regional conflicts rather than long-range strategic purposes. Russia maintains a diverse array of these weapons, which feature various delivery systems and warhead types.\n\nOne key category of Russia's non-strategic nuclear weapons includes air-delivered munitions. Aircraft such as the Su-24M, Su-34, and Tu-22M3 bombers can deploy nuclear bombs and air-launched cruise missiles, offering both flexibility and rapid deployment capabilities.\n\nAnother critical category is sea-based nonstrategic nuclear weapons. These encompass nuclear-capable torpedoes, depth charges, and anti-ship and anti-submarine missiles. The Russian Navy's surface ships and submarines, including the advanced Yasen-M class submarines, are equipped to carry these weapons, boosting their operational versatility.\n\nGround-based systems play a pivotal role in Russia's non-strategic nuclear arsenal. Among these, the Iskander-M short-range ballistic missiles stand out, as they can be armed with nuclear warheads. These systems are crafted to strike enemy forces and infrastructure within a theater of operations, providing a swift response option.\n\nAdditionally, Russia integrates non-strategic nuclear weapons into its air defense systems. The S-300 and S-400 surface-to-air missile systems, for example, have the potential to be equipped with nuclear warheads. This dual-purpose capability allows them to serve in both air defense and tactical nuclear strike roles.\n\nThis development and upkeep of non-strategic nuclear weapons are integral to Russia's broader military doctrine. This strategic approach underscores the importance of maintaining a flexible and diverse nuclear capability. By emphasizing the potential use of tactical nuclear weapons across various conflict scenarios, Russia aims to deter both conventional and nuclear threats.\n\nThe tension\n\nTensions have escalated between Russia and the West due to Putin's ongoing conflict in Ukraine. On May 3, the Kremlin reacted to comments made by the then UK Foreign Secretary, David Cameron, who had stated that Ukraine could use British weapons to strike Russian territory.\n\nHowever, there's been a significant misunderstanding. In reality, London's \"permission\" allowed Ukraine to use British ammo to strike Russian positions in temporarily occupied territories like Crimea, not to target Russian soil.\n\nThe Russian Federation's land and sea non-strategic nuclear arsenal will play a part in the third stage of its anticipated nuclear deployment, alongside its combat aviation forces. Russia has cautioned that Western actions might compel it to amend its nuclear doctrine, specifying the scenarios under which it could deploy nuclear weapons.\n\nOn June 7, during the International Economic Forum in St. Petersburg, Putin described Russia's nuclear doctrine as a \"living instrument\" open to modification. He stated that Russia is \"carefully observing global events and does not exclude making some adjustments to this doctrine\" if necessary.", "source": {"uri": "bulgarianmilitary.com", "dataType":

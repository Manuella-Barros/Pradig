The saga began when Farzana Rahman, who lives in the Durham area, checked in guests on Oct. 25 with a check out date of May 24. But when Rahman\u2019s housekeeper arrived at the rental, the guests were still there and they refused to leave, the local ABC affiliate reported. When the cleaner knocked on the door, she asked if she should return the next day and they said, \u2018No, don\u2019t come back,'\u201d Rahman said. \u201cNow they\u2019re refusing to leave until there\u2019s an eviction order,\u201d Rahman told the outlet. \u201cI think they\u2019re just trying to gain time to stay there for free because they haven\u2019t paid.\u201d Rahman even got the cops to go to the rental with her and the squatters promised to leave the next day, but they never did. Rather, they hung a \u201cNo trespassing\u201d sign on the front door, that read, \u201cWe will vacate the property when you filed the proper paperwork with the civil magistrate for an eviction, for we are legal residents of this home.\u201d \u201cThis is my place, and I mean, I\u2019m counting on this income; my son is in college. I\u2019m a single parent,\u201d Rahman said. Rahman contacted Airbnb for help but said the $93 billion company was of little help. \u201cThey\u2019re sending me messages as please get help for your safety and get whatever legal help you have to get to get them out,\u201d she said. Rahman has filed eviction paperwork with the courts to try and regain possession of her rental. \u201cIt\u2019s wasted my time; it is wasting my energy; it is stressing me out,\u201d she said.", "summary": "The squatters hung a sign on the door reading, \"We will vacate the property when you filed the proper paperwork with the civil magistrate for an eviction, for we are legal residents of this home.\"", "url": "https://nypost.com/2024/06/08/us-news/north-carolina-mom-cant-get-rid-of-airbnb-squatters/", "image": "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/83464539.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 14:13:35", "author": "Dana Kennedy", "authors": ["Dana Kennedy"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.982}

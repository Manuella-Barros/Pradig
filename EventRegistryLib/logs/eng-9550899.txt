Production of the Cadillac XT4 small SUV will continue until the plant is shut down next year to retool for production of the Bolt.\n\nThe decision to end the Malibu after more than 10 million units in global sales doesn't come as a surprise because domestic automakers started paring them from their lineups starting in the mid-2010s to focus on more profitable SUVs. Ford Motor Co.'s Fiesta, Focus and Taurus, Stellantis NV's Dodge Dart and Charger, as well as GM's Cruze and Impala, are among the cars killed by the Detroit Three -- ceding the sedan market to foreign competitors that continue to show there's still a market for cars.\n\n\"Frankly, it's probably surprising that it's still in production now, and that's probably only because they sell a lot of them to rental fleets,\" said Sam Abuelsamid, e-mobility analyst for market research firm Guidehouse Inc. \"It's not terribly shocking that it's going away. Other non-U.S. brands, non-Detroit brands are still sticking with sedans, they're still making them and still selling quite a lot of them.\"\n\nGM previously said it would invest about $390 million in Fairfax to make the new Bolt, which will be based on GM's new, more flexible Ultium-based EV architecture. The previous generation Bolt, built at GM's Orion Assembly plant in Lake Orion, was not based on Ultium. Production of that Bolt ended in December 2023.\n\n\"To facilitate the installation of tooling and other plant modifications, after nine generations and over 10 million global sales, GM will end production of the Chevrolet Malibu in November 2024 and pause production of the Cadillac XT4 after January 2025,\" GM spokesperson Kevin Kelly said in a statement.\n\nKelly said the production pause \"will result in a layoff until production resumes for affected employees.

Production of the Cadillac XT4 small SUV will continue until the plant is shut down next year to retool for production of the Bolt.\n\nThe decision to end the Malibu after more than 10 million units in global sales doesn't come as a surprise because domestic automakers started paring them from their lineups starting in the mid-2010s to focus on more profitable SUVs. Ford Motor Co.'s Fiesta, Focus and Taurus, Stellantis NV's Dodge Dart and Charger, as well as GM's Cruze and Impala, are among the cars killed by the Detroit Three -- ceding the sedan market to foreign competitors that continue to show there's still a market for cars.\n\n\"Frankly, it's probably surprising that it's still in production now, and that's probably only because they sell a lot of them to rental fleets,\" said Sam Abuelsamid, e-mobility analyst for market research firm Guidehouse Inc. \"It's not terribly shocking that it's going away. Other non-U.S. brands, non-Detroit brands are still sticking with sedans, they're still making them and still selling quite a lot of them.\"\n\nGM previously said it would invest about $390 million in Fairfax to make the new Bolt, which will be based on GM's new, more flexible Ultium-based EV architecture. The previous generation Bolt, built at GM's Orion Assembly plant in Lake Orion, was not based on Ultium. Production of that Bolt ended in December 2023.\n\n\"To facilitate the installation of tooling and other plant modifications, after nine generations and over 10 million global sales, GM will end production of the Chevrolet Malibu in November 2024 and pause production of the Cadillac XT4 after January 2025,\" GM spokesperson Kevin Kelly said in a statement.\n\nKelly said the production pause \"will result in a layoff until production resumes for affected employees. Affected employees will be supported according to the provisions of the UAW-GM agreement. When production resumes in late 2025, Fairfax will produce both the Bolt EV and XT4 on the same assembly line, which gives GM flexibility to respond to changes in customer demand.\"\n\n\"Ending Malibu production is a function of GM refocusing resources on better-selling, more relevant offerings while continuing capital-intensive future technologies -- particularly electrification,\" said Paul Waatti, director of industry analysis for AutoPacific, a marketing research and consulting firm.\n\nChevrolet introduced the Malibu in 1964 after it was first a trim offer on the Chevy Chevelle. The bowtie brand briefly discontinued the sedan from 1983 until 1997, according to Motor Trend.\n\nThe Malibu's midsize car segment in 1996 represented 18% of the market and then started to slide year after year until the U.S. recession began to hit in 2007 and consumers downsized their vehicles. By 2012, the segment made up 16% of the market. And in 2023 it totaled 5.79%.\n\n\"The midsize sedan was it for so long,\" said Jessica Caldwell, director of industry insights at Edmunds.com Inc. Then crossovers arrived, and \"that sort of was the writing on the wall for a lot of midsize sedans, and cars in general, as well, just the popularity of the crossovers.\"\n\nSome cars have had a bit of resurgence because of the recent need for more affordable vehicles. But a Malibu priced starting at $25,100, Caldwell added, isn't \"really in that category of cars that are doing well.\"\n\nGM sold 130,342 Malibus in 2023, down from 210,951 sold in 2012 and 223,703 sold in 1998, according to Edmunds data dating back to 1996.\n\nMalibu competitors like the Toyota Camry and Honda Accord reported higher sales in 2023. Honda sold 197,947 Accords and Toyota sold 290,649 Camrys, according to company sales reports. In 2023, the Malibu had 14.5% of the segment behind the Camry's 28% and the Accord's 17%.\n\n\"Malibu just never reached that level where it was a very mainstream popular car that a lot of people owned,\" Caldwell said.\n\nThe ongoing market shift toward SUVs prompted both Ford and G M in 2018 to announce plans to trim sedans from lineups. That followed the decision in 2016 by Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV leadership to ax most sedan models.\n\nGM ended production of the Buick Verano in 2016 and the Chevrolet SS in 2017. In 2019, GM halted production of the Buick LaCrosse, Chevrolet Volt and Cruze followed by the Cadillac CT6, Buick Regal, and the Chevrolet Impala, Sonic and Spark.\n\nGM most recently halted production of the Chevrolet Camaro late last year, though the sporty sedan is expected to make a comeback. The automaker still sells the Corvette high-performance vehicle and the Cadillac CT4 and CT5 sedans.\n\nBetween 2018 and 2020, Ford stopped selling several sedans in the United States, including the Taurus, Fiesta, the C-Max hatchback and the Fusion. U.S. production of the Focus ended in May 2018 and Ford has said Focus production globally will end by next year. The only sedan Ford currently sells in the United States is the Mustang.\n\nAfter its 2016 announcement, Stellantis, then Fiat Chrysler, ended production of the Dodge Dart and Chrysler 200. Production of the Chrysler 300, Dodge Challenger and Charger ended in December 2023. Dodge Viper production ended in 2017.\n\nStellantis, which is still selling old inventory of the Challenger, Charger and 300, isn't done with its sedans. The automaker will launch an electric Charger midway through 2024. The automaker hasn't defined its plans for the Challenger and 300, but executives have suggested that those vehicles may not disappear forever.", "source": {"uri": "staradvertiser.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Honolulu Star Advertiser"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SUV", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SUV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadillac_XT4", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cadillac XT4"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet_Bolt", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chevrolet Bolt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet_Malibu", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chevrolet Malibu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "General Motors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedan_(automobile)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sedan (automobile)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid-size_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mid-size car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Three_(automobile_manufacturers)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Big Three (automobile manufacturers)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet_Cruze", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chevrolet Cruze"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Taurus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ford Taurus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet_Impala", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chevrolet Impala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Motor_Company", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ford Motor Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Fiesta", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ford Fiesta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ultium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellantis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stellantis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orion_Assembly", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Orion Assembly"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_Trend", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Motor Trend"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossover_(automobile)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Crossover (automobile)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodge_Charger", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dodge Charger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet_Chevelle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chevrolet Chevelle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodge_Dart", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dodge Dart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chevrolet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiat_Chrysler_Automobiles", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fiat Chrysler Automobiles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Honda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Toyota"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Autos", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Autos", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Parts_and_Accessories", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Parts and Accessories", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Wholesale_and_Distribution", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Wholesale and Distribution", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.staradvertiser.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Star-Advertiser-thumbnail-image.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550899", "eventUri": "eng-9550899", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2018-05-", "textStart": 5199, "textEnd": 5207}], "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 204, "relevance": 1}

On the surface, this seems like another blow to the sedan segment, which has been on the decline for the last decade or so as full-size trucks and SUVs overtook them in popularity in the U.S. But the death of the Malibu comes despite the sedan having sold over 130,000 examples in 2023, as Automotive News reports.\n\nWhile the Malibu's sales numbers are not what they once were -- and a fair number of them probably go to rental lots -- the sedan was nonetheless moving relatively well, sitting as the third best-performing nameplate behind only the Equinox and Silverado over the Bowtie's last calendar year. Malibu sales peaked in 2016, when Chevy moved in excess of 227,000 units of the four-door. Last year's decline of about 97,000 compared to the peak year in the mid-2010s did not bode well for the model, but the sedan managed to actually increase sales in 2023 compared to 2022, when Chevy sold slightly over 115,000 of them. So what gives?\n\nIt would make much more sense for Chevy to kill the Malibu if it had been selling as poorly as the recently deposed Subaru Legacy, which saw about 25,500 in sales for 2023. Why would Chevy leave any of those sales on the table?\n\nThe carmaker's official statement is that it's for the sake of the new Bolt. Per GM:\n\nAs previously announced, GM is investing approximately $390 million in our Fairfax Assembly Plant for production of the new, Ultium-based Chevrolet Bolt EV to deliver one of the most affordable all-electric vehicles with an improved driving, charging and ownership experience.\n\nTo facilitate the installation of tooling and other plant modifications, after nine-generations and over 10 million global sales, GM will end production of the Chevrolet Malibu in November 2024 and pause production of the Cadillac XT4 after January 2025. This will result in a layoff until production resumes for affected employees. Affected employees will be supported according to the provisions of the UAW-GM agreement.\n\nWhen production resumes in late 2025, Fairfax will produce both the Bolt EV and XT4 on the same assembly line, which gives GM flexibility to respond to changes in customer demand.\n\nGeneral Motors\n\nGM plans on clearing the way for EVs at the current site of Malibu production at Kansas City's Fairfax Assembly and Stamping. The plant also makes the Cadillac XT4 -- another crossover -- though production of the Caddy will be paused next year. It won't resume again until the plant is ready to start making the upcoming Bolt alongside the gas-burning Cadillac.\n\nGeneral Motors\n\nWhile the party line from GM is all about the Malibu dying off so the Bolt can be built in Fairfax, it still makes little sense if the ICE-powered XT4 will be produced at the same site. The only thing left to point to is that the XT4 is a crossover -- and a \"luxurious\" one at that -- while the Malibu is a lowly (read: less lucrative) sedan.\n\nThe cynical read is that the Malibu's death could have something to do with sedans yielding slimmer profit margins, as full-size pickups and crossovers tend to make more money for manufacturers. For reference, Chevy shifted 555,000 Silverados in 2023, while the Chevy Equinox reached nearly 213,000 in sales. And the sunsetting of the Malibu badge ostensibly has mostly to do with Chevy's great expectations for the next-generation Bolt EV, which GM is invested in to the tune of $390 million.\n\nThis isn't the first time that Chevy has decided to kill the Malibu: the car's original production run lasted nearly two decades, from 1964 through 1983. That timeframe saw the release of four Malibu generations, but the car wouldn't make a comeback until 1997 when the front-wheel-drive Malibu made a triumphant debut and took Motor Trend's Car of the Year award.\n\nThe fifth-gen Malibu spurred on another four generations (for a total of nine) that saw ongoing production for another 27 years, outdoing the Malibu's first production run. Indeed, it looked like the stalwart Chevy would endure the great sedan extinction of the last few years. But it seems that even if it could have lived through that based on sales alone, the Malibu is dying so the new Bolt may live.\n\nI have nearly no qualms with a solid ICE-equipped sedan dying off for the sake of an affordable EV, but I wish GM would hurry up and make an inexpensive EV sedan, as opposed to the crossover(ish) Chevy Bolt. The U.S. desperately needs small, cheap EVs, and the Tesla Model 3 desperately needs a rival from the Big 3.\n\nGot a tip?

Employees affected by this temporary shutdown will be supported according to the UAW-GM collective agreement.\n\nThe Chevrolet Malibu started life in 1964 as the top-line subseries of the Chevelle, and it wasn't until its fourth generation, in 1978, that it became a fully-fledged model. This isn't the first time the car has been discontinued, though. In 1983, the Malibu's original run ended, and production paused until the car returned in 1997 as a front-wheel drive model. Now in its ninth generation, the latest iteration of the sedan went into production in 2015.\n\nAlthough the Malibu's production line is being taken by the second-generation Bolt, GM tells us that the car is being discontinued in response to shifting consumer tastes. Like the Subaru Legacy, the popularity of SUVs is ultimately what put the final nail in the Chevy sedan's coffin.\n\nSadly for sedan fans, there won't be a direct replacement for the Malibu in Chevrolet's lineup.\n\n\"The Malibu has been a stalwart offering for nine generations and several decades,\" Kelly told us. \"However, as consumer choice continues to shift towards compact SUVs, now the largest segment in the US, Malibu customers will find a home in other vehicles in our lineup, with multiple options in terms of size, price and propulsion available to them.\"", "source": {"uri": "carscoops.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Carscoops"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sebastien_bell@carscoops.com", "name": "Sebastien Bell", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadillac_XT4", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cadillac XT4"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet_Bolt", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chevrolet Bolt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet_Malibu", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chevrolet Malibu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "General Motors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors_Fairfax_Assembly_Plant", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "General Motors Fairfax Assembly Plant"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Automotive industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SUV", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SUV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chevrolet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedan_(automobile)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sedan (automobile)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electric car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City,_Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City, Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kansas City, Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_line", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assembly line"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet_Chevelle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chevrolet Chevelle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subaru_Legacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Subaru Legacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front-wheel_drive", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Front-wheel drive"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Compact car"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Autos", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Autos", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Parts_and_Accessories", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Parts and Accessories", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Toys_and_Games", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Toys and Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 58}], "image": "https://www.carscoops.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-chevrolet-malibu-102-copyg.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550899", "eventUri": "eng-9550899", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-11-04", "textStart": 694, "textEnd": 706}], "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

Production of the Cadillac XT4 small SUV will continue until the plant is shut down next year to retool for production of the Bolt.\n\nThe decision to end the Malibu after more than 10 million units in global sales doesn't come as a surprise because domestic automakers started paring them from their lineups starting in the mid-2010s to focus on more profitable SUVs. Ford Motor Co.'s Fiesta, Focus and Taurus, Stellantis NV's Dodge Dart and Charger, as well as GM's Cruze and Impala, are among the cars killed by the Detroit Three -- ceding the sedan market to foreign competitors that continue to show there's still a market for cars.\n\n\"Frankly, it's probably surprising that it's still in production now, and that's probably only because they sell a lot of them to rental fleets,\" said Sam Abuelsamid, e-mobility analyst for market research firm Guidehouse Inc. \"It's not terribly shocking that it's going away. Other non-U.S. brands, non-Detroit brands are still sticking with sedans, they're still making them and still selling quite a lot of them.\"\n\nGM previously said it would invest about $390 million in Fairfax to make the new Bolt, which will be based on GM's new, more flexible Ultium-based EV architecture. The previous generation Bolt, built at GM's Orion Assembly plant in Lake Orion, was not based on Ultium. Production of that Bolt ended in December 2023.\n\n\"To facilitate the installation of tooling and other plant modifications, after nine generations and over 10 million global sales, GM will end production of the Chevrolet Malibu in November 2024 and pause production of the Cadillac XT4 after January 2025,\" GM spokesperson Kevin Kelly said in a statement.\n\nKelly said the production pause \"will result in a layoff until production resumes for affected employees. Affected employees will be supported according to the provisions of the UAW-GM agreement. When production resumes in late 2025, Fairfax will produce both the Bolt EV and XT4 on the same assembly line, which gives GM flexibility to respond to changes in customer demand.\"\n\n\"Ending Malibu production is a function of GM refocusing resources on better-selling, more relevant offerings while continuing capital-intensive future technologies -- particularly electrification,\" said Paul Waatti, director of industry analysis for AutoPacific, a marketing research and consulting firm.\n\nGoodbye, Malibu\n\nChevrolet introduced the Malibu in 1964 after it was first a trim offer on the Chevy Chevelle. The bowtie brand briefly discontinued the sedan from 1983 until 1997, according to Motor Trend.\n\nThe Malibu's midsize car segment in 1996 represented 18% of the market and then started to slide year after year until the U.S. recession began to hit in 2007 and consumers downsized their vehicles. By 2012, the segment made up 16% of the market. And in 2023 it totaled 5.79%.\n\n\"The midsize sedan was it for so long,\" said Jessica Caldwell, director of industry insights at Edmunds.com Inc. Then crossovers arrived, and \"that sort of was the writing on the wall for a lot of midsize sedans, and cars in general, as well, just the popularity of the crossovers.\"\n\nSome cars have had a bit of resurgence because of the recent need for more affordable vehicles. But a Malibu priced starting at $25,100, Caldwell added, isn't \"really in that category of cars that are doing well.\"\n\nGM sold 130,342 Malibus in 2023, down from 210,951 sold in 2012 and 223,703 sold in 1998, according to Edmunds data dating back to 1996.\n\nMalibu competitors like the Toyota Camry and Honda Accord reported higher sales in 2023. Honda sold 197,947 Accords and Toyota sold 290,649 Camrys, according to company sales reports. In 2023, the Malibu had 14.5% of the segment behind the Camry's 28% and the Accord's 17%.\n\n\"Malibu just never reached that level where it was a very mainstream popular car that a lot of people owned,\" Caldwell said.\n\nEnd of the domestic small car\n\nThe ongoing market shift toward SUVs prompted both Ford and G M in 2018 to announce plans to trim sedans from lineups. That followed the decision in 2016 by Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV leadership to ax most sedan models.\n\nGM ended production of the Buick Verano in 2016 and the Chevrolet SS in 2017. In 2019, GM halted production of the Buick LaCrosse, Chevrolet Volt and Cruze followed by the Cadillac CT6, Buick Regal, and the Chevrolet Impala, Sonic and Spark.\n\nGM most recently halted production of the Chevrolet Camaro late last year, though the sporty sedan is expected to make a comeback. The automaker still sells the Corvette high-performance vehicle and the Cadillac CT4 and CT5 sedans.\n\nBetween 2018 and 2020, Ford stopped selling several sedans in the United States, including the Taurus, Fiesta, the C-Max hatchback and the Fusion. U.S. production of the Focus ended in May 2018 and Ford has said Focus production globally will end by next year. The only sedan Ford currently sells in the United States is the Mustang.\n\nAfter its 2016 announcement, Stellantis, then Fiat Chrysler, ended production of the Dodge Dart and Chrysler 200. Production of the Chrysler 300, Dodge Challenger and Charger ended in December 2023. Dodge Viper production ended in 2017.\n\nStellantis, which is still selling old inventory of the Challenger, Charger and 300, isn't done with its sedans. The automaker will launch an electric Charger midway through 2024. The automaker hasn't defined its plans for the Challenger and 300, but executives have suggested that those vehicles may not disappear forever.\n\n\u00a92024 www.detroitnews.com.

But its sales started to decline in the early 2000s as the SUV became more prominent and pickup truck sales grew.\n\nNow the U.S. auto market is dominated by SUVs and trucks. Full-size pickups from Ford, Chevrolet and Ram are the top selling vehicles in America, and the top-selling non pickup is Toyota's RAV4 small SUV.\n\nLast year midsize cars made up only 8% of U.S. new vehicle sales, but it was 22% as recently as 2007, according to Motorintelligence.com. Still, Americans bought 1.3 million of the cars last year in a segment dominated by the Toyota Camry and Honda Accord.\n\nGM sold just over 130,000 Malibus last year, 8.5% fewer than in 2022. Sales rose to nearly 230,000 after a redesign for the 2016 model year, but much of those were at low profits to rental car companies.\n\nBut the midsize car segment made a bit of a comeback last year with sales up almost 5%.\n\nGM said it sold over 10 million Malibus, making nine generations since its debut.\n\nGM's factory in Kansas City, Kansas, which now makes the Malibu and the Cadillac XT4 small SUV, will stop making the Malibu in November and the XT4 in January.

Two months later, Cadillac XT4 production will be halted as well. Although the Caddy will return in late 2025 after GM retools and modifies the Kansas-based facility to the tune of $390 million in preparation for the next-gen Bolt EV, the four-door sedan from the Chevrolet division will not. GM spokesperson Kevin Kelly revealed that Malibu sales exceed 10 million deliveries worldwide. Speaking to Detroit News, the cited spokesperson also revealed that certain employees will be laid off. Be that as it may, affected employees will be supported in accordance with the provisions agreed by the UAW and the Detroit-based automaker.\n\nKelly further stated that XT4 and Bolt EV will be manufactured on the very same assembly line. This change gives the largest automaker in the United States greater flexibility to changes in customer demand, allowing the biggest automaker of the Big Three in Detroit to adjust production output. Had there been two lines and slowing demand for either the XT4 or Bolt EV, the company would have been forced to either lay off a shift or idle an assembly line.\n\nMalibu is the only sedan that wears the Chevrolet badge in the United States of America nowadays. The Chevrolet brand's passenger car lineup further comprises the Corvette. Recently updated for model year 2025 with a new exterior paint color, Malibu is listed as being a 2024 model by the configurator.\n\nThe only engine-transmission combo available is 1.5L four-cylinder turbo and CVT, which makes for a rather unrewarding experience behind the wheel. The direct-injected powerplant makes 163 hp at 5,700 revolutions per minute and 184 pound-feet (nearly 250 Nm) at 2,500 to 3,000 revolutions per minute, whereas the 1.5-liter mill in the Honda Civic is good for 180 horsepower at 6,000 and 177 pound-feet (240 Nm) at 1,700 through 4,500 rpm.\n\nPhoto: Chevrolet Considering that Malibu is a midsizer and the Civic is a compact, a better comparo would be against Toyota's all-new Camry and Honda's Accord. Rather than comparing maximum output, we should take a look at sales performance during the first quarter of 2024. The Malibu totaled 32,749 deliveries in the United States during the first three months of 2024, whereas the Camry and Accord clocked 78,337 and 41,927 sales, respectively.\n\nLast redesigned from the ground up in 2015 for model year 2016, the Malibu was initially marketed as a trim level for the Chevelle. It became its own thing in 1978, and through 1997, the Malibu was rear-wheel drive. It's not clear if the seventh-gen Camaro, which is reportedly coming back in the form of an electric sedan, will replace this fellow.\n\nSpeaking of electric, the second-generation Bolt EV has been confirmed by none other than chief executive officer Mary Barra in June 2023. As of May 2024, we know that it's coming back in 2025 with an LFP battery and Ultium goodies. Rather than starting from a clean sheet of paper, the second-gen Bolt EV is believed to be underpinned by an evolution of the first-gen's BEV2 platform.\n\nThe second coming of the Bolt EV should give Chevrolet a sub-$30,000 electric sport utility vehicle. Sans destination charge, the most affordable Equinox EV specification will drop in late 2024 with a starting price of $33,600. By comparison, the 2023 Chevrolet Bolt EV and Bolt EUV started at $26,500 and $27,800, respectively.", "source": {"uri": "autoevolution.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "autoevolution"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mircea_panait@autoevolution.com", "name": "Mircea Panait", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadillac_XT4", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cadillac XT4"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet_Bolt", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chevrolet Bolt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chevrolet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "General Motors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Automotive industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malibu,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Malibu, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Malibu, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_line", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Assembly line"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedan_(automobile)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sedan (automobile)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Auto_Workers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Auto Workers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors_Fairfax_Assembly_Plant", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General Motors Fairfax Assembly Plant"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet_Malibu", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chevrolet Malibu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolutions_per_minute", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Revolutions per minute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Detroit_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Detroit News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straight-four_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Straight-four engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Three_(automobile_manufacturers)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Big Three (automobile manufacturers)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gasoline_direct_injection", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gasoline direct injection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_Camry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Toyota Camry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet_Corvette", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chevrolet Corvette"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_year", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Model year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuously_variable_transmission", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Continuously variable transmission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda_Civic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Honda Civic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horsepower", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Horsepower"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Barra", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mary Barra"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Toyota"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Parts_and_Accessories", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Parts and Accessories", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Models", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Models", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://s1.cdn.autoevolution.com/images/news/chevrolet-malibu-will-be-discontinued-this-fall-next-gen-chevrolet-bolt-coming-late-2025-233613_1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550899", "eventUri": "eng-9550899", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

Professional stock car racers used the Malibu body between 1973 and 1977 for NASCAR competitions, helping drivers win 25 different titles, according to Motor Trend magazine. At its height, the Malibu won Motor Trend Car of the Year 1997 because of its smooth ride, fuel economy and luxury interior.\n\nBut sales of the Malibu, a midsize sedan, declined in the early 2000s as Americans' preferences turned toward SUVs and pickup trucks. Hoping to jump start sales, GM did a redesign of the Malibu in 2015-16 complete with a lighter 1.5-Liter four-cylinder engine, honeycomb grille and jeweled LED headlights. Sales rose to nearly 230,000 after a redesign for the 2016 model year, but much of those were at low profits to rental car companies.\n\nLast year, midsize cars made up only 8% of U.S. new vehicle sales, down from 22% in 2007, according to Motorintelligence.com. Americans bought 1.3 million sedans last year in a segment that's been dominated lately by the Toyota Camry and Honda Accord.\n\nGM sold just over 130,000 Malibus in 2023, 8.5% fewer than in 2022.

GM recalled more than 140,000 Malibus in 2014 because a software problem in the brake control computer could disable the power brakes. The Michigan automaker recalled nearly 92,000 Malibus in 2015 because the car's sunroof could close inadvertently.", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "General Motors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malibu,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Malibu, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Malibu, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet_Malibu", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chevrolet Malibu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid-size_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mid-size car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_Trend_Car_of_the_Year", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Motor Trend Car of the Year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_Trend", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Motor Trend"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASCAR", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NASCAR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel_economy_in_automobiles", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fuel economy in automobiles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedan_(automobile)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sedan (automobile)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SUV", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "SUV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straight-four_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Straight-four engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grille_(car)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grille (car)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet_Bolt", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chevrolet Bolt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda_Accord", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Honda Accord"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_Camry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Toyota Camry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headlamp", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Headlamp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_year", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Model year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pickup_truck", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pickup truck"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadillac_XT4", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cadillac XT4"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelley_Blue_Book", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kelley Blue Book"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunroof", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sunroof"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_line", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assembly line"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electric car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City,_Kansas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City, Kansas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kansas City, Kansas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Automotive", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Automotive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Autos", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Autos", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/05/09/c02485a2-2a35-4caa-ac57-95eb4a7fd010/thumbnail/1200x630/dd90581dd1851321dbc2357bdf165023/gettyimages-1372691569.jpg?v=218688c1357f974b9630d4fa8914721c", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550899", "eventUri": "eng-9550899", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

But its sales started to decline in the early 2000s as the SUV became more prominent and pickup truck sales grew.\n\nNow the U.S. auto market is dominated by SUVs and trucks. Full-size pickups from Ford, Chevrolet and Ram are the top selling vehicles in America, and the top-selling non pickup is Toyota's RAV4 small SUV.\n\nLast year midsize cars made up only 8% of U.S. new vehicle sales, but it was 22% as recently as 2007, according to Motorintelligence.com. Still, Americans bought 1.3 million of the cars last year in a segment dominated by the Toyota Camry and Honda Accord.\n\nGM sold just over 130,000 Malibus last year, 8.5% fewer than in 2022. Sales rose to nearly 230,000 after a redesign for the 2016 model year, but much of those were at low profits to rental car companies.\n\nFILE - A Chevrolet logo is shown at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit, Sept. 13, 2023.

The plant will get a $390 million retooling to make a new version of the Chevrolet Bolt small electric car.\n\nThe plant will begin producing the Bolt and XT4 on the same assembly line in late 2025, giving the plant the flexibility to respond to customer demands, the company said.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported the demise of the Malibu on Wednesday.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SUV", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SUV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "General Motors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pickup_truck", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pickup truck"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid-size_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mid-size car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet_Malibu", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chevrolet Malibu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Automotive industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-size_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Full-size car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chevrolet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedan_(automobile)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sedan (automobile)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Motor_Company", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ford Motor Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truck", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Truck"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_International_Auto_Show", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "North American International Auto Show"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda_Accord", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Honda Accord"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_Camry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Toyota Camry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_RAV4", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Toyota RAV4"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_year", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Model year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadillac_XT4", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cadillac XT4"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet_Bolt", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chevrolet Bolt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_line", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assembly line"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Wall Street Journal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electric car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City,_Kansas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City, Kansas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kansas City, Kansas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Automotive", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Automotive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Autos", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Autos", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Parts_and_Accessories", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Parts and Accessories", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/05/09/17/wire-84670777-1715271067-196_636x382.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550899", "eventUri": "eng-9550899", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2013-09-", "textStart": 1234, "textEnd": 1242}], "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

After that, the plant will be updated to produce the Bolt in addition to the Cadillac XT4 it already makes.\n\nGM confirmed the move to Techopedia. In a statement, it said the move would help install \"tooling and other plant modifications\" for the Bolt. Production will pause for the XT4 in January 2025, and will start up for both the new Bolt and the XT4 late that year.\n\nThe company had already committed to a $390 million investment in Fairfax for the sake of the Bolt.\n\nThe new Bolt EV is based on the Ultium platform that underpins GM's modern electric cars, including the Chevy Blazer EV, Cadillac Lyriq and GMC Hummer EV. It was introduced in part as a response to concerns that the old Bolt's end would take away an affordable option for all-electric driving.\n\nGM's decision wasn't surprising. The brand has been phasing out hatchbacks and sedans, and the Chevy Malibu's popularity (it was a bestseller in 2023) kept it alive where models like the Impala were discontinued years earlier.\n\nAs with competitors like Ford, GM has responded to a tougher-than-expected EV market by shifting some of its attention toward hybrids. However, the decision to axe the Chevy Malibu in favor of the Bolt EV indicates that electrification is still important.

The decision follows GM's plan to halt production of the Chevy Malibu sedan this fall and retool the Fairfax plant for the new Bolt. The move will also involve a temporary pause in Cadillac XT4 production as the plant is prepared for Bolt production, following up on GM's $391 million investment in new tooling and facility modifications.\n\nThe upcoming Bolt will utilize GM's advanced Ultium battery platform, replacing the previous generation's Voltec-based architecture. The previous-generation Bolt, which was built at the GM Lake Orion Assembly plant in Michigan, delivers 200 horsepower and 266 pound-feet of torque, which reaches the pavement exclusively through the front wheels. With Ultium, GM expects even better performance and affordability.\n\nDuring an interview published in March, GM CEO Mary Barra emphasized that the upcoming Bolt would arrive in \"a little more than a year\" and praised its strong brand recognition and customer satisfaction ratings. After facing criticism for discontinuing the Bolt in 2023, GM revisited its decision and opted to reintroduce the Bolt with Ultium. Barra assured that the next-gen 2026 Chevy Bolt will be \"even more affordable,\" and based on the CEO's latest statements, the next-gen Bolt is expected to arrive during the Summer or Fall of the 2025 calendar year.\n\nThe arrival of the new 2026 Chevy Bolt coincides with a wide range of new GM EVs expected by midyear, including luxury vehicles from Cadillac, and other affordable options from Chevrolet.\n\nPrior to production of the next-generation 2026 Chevy Bolt, production at the GM Fairfax facility will be paused as the automaker implements new tooling and other upgrades. When it goes back online, the Fairfax Assembly plant will handle both Bolt and XT4 production simultaneously, giving GM flexibility in responding to market demand.

The iconic General Motors sedan was brought back to life in 1997, but now, the company is phasing it out yet again -- and this time, it looks like it's for good. \"To facilitate the installation of tooling and other plant modifications, after nine generations and over 10 million global sales, GM will end production of the Chevrolet Malibu in November 2024,\" a GM spokesperson told the Detroit News, via Edmunds. The rep adds that production will also cease in January on the Cadillac XT4 luxury SUV.\n\nEdmunds reports that GM is clearing out the Malibus to make way for more production of electric vehicles, like the next-gen Chevy Bolt, at its plant in Kansas City, Kansas. Per the New York Times, the Malibu is the last sedan sold by Chevy in the US. It was also Chevy's last gas-powered car, other than the Corvette; GM's Cadillac brand still makes two gas-powered sedans. The Times notes that the dumping of the Malibu reflects a wider trend of consumers backing away from sedans, hatchbacks, and compact cars, opting instead for larger vehicles like SUVs and pickup trucks. Overseas companies like Honda, Hyundai, and Toyota are the ones continuing to sell hundreds of thousands of those smaller cars annually.\n\nThe Malibu debuted in 1964 and was marketed as a higher-end family sedan. When GM downsized in 1983, the Malibu ended up on the chopping block, but it was brought back in 1997. The Wall Street Journal notes that GM hoped the revived Malibu would rule the midsize market roost, but it earned \"tepid\" reviews and never quite caught on as well as its Honda Accord and Toyota Camry competitors. Last year, GM sold 130,000 Malibus; for context, 200,000 Malibus had flown out of factories and into consumer driveways a decade earlier. GM isn't the only major car company to start ditching its sedan lineup: Ford no longer makes sedans, and Stellantis has been focusing on churning out trucks, SUVs, and minivans.

Cruze production ended in 2019 and the Impala bit the bullet in 2020, Even its small hatchbacks weren't safe; the poor Sonic and Spark both met similar fates.\n\nBut the Malibu managed to stick around about as long as GM had originally predicted, despite the aforementioned uncertainty. A quick glance at the sales charts explains why: the midsize family sedan was one of Chevy's best sellers in 2023. The only two models that outsold it were the Equinox CUV and the Silverado. While we suspect many of those Malibus were going to fleets, an annual volume of 130,000 units is nothing to sneeze at.\n\nThe Malibu is one of Chevy's oldest nameplates and dates to 1964, however it took a hiatus from 1984-1996. Filling in during its absence were the front-wheel drive-Chevy Celebrity and later the Lumina. The latter overlapped with the revived Malibu for several years before itself being killed off in 2001.\n\nThe sedan's departure will make way for a new vehicle -- another small one, in fact. The Fairfax Assembly facility in Kansas will be retooled to build the replacement Chevrolet Bolt. Fairfax is also home to the Cadillac XT4; production of the small Caddy crossover will be put on hold during retooling as well, but it will resume alongside the Bolt once the upgrade is complete, a GM spokesperson confirmed to the News.\n\nAutoblog reached out to GM for comment.

Well, here's what we hope the next-gen Bolt EV would look like.\n\nThe Malibu's Long Run Comes To An End, Courtesy Of The Bolt EV\n\nAs unceremonious as it sounds, the Bolt EV has forced the Malibu to make way for it. The Malibu has been a standalone nameplate since 1983 after serving as the Chevelle's top trim for nearly two decades before that. Just to be clear, the next-gen Malibu will be coming back in a few years, but for now, the next-gen Bolt EV will take up its place in the Fairfax Assembly.\n\n\"To facilitate the installation of tooling and other plant modifications, after nine generations and over 10 million global sales, GM will end production of the Chevrolet Malibu in November 2024 and pause production of the Cadillac XT4 after January 2025,\"\n\n- GM Spokesperson.\n\nGM has sold over 10 million Malibus globally to date, making it one of the most successful nameplates in the automaker's history.

I always considered it as the underdog in this segment. Unfortunately, as good as the ninth-generation model was, past, non-competitive generations have heavily tarnished the car's reputation.\n\nAdd TopSpeed to your Google News feed.\n\nFollow On\n\nGoogle News\n\nRelated 10 Things A New Chevy Bolt EUV Needs Will Chevy make a new Bolt EUV? If so, what could make this tiny electric crossover a much better SUV? Here are ten things that we can think of.\n\nThe Next-Gen Bolt EV Could Spice Up The Budget EV Segment\n\nClose\n\nThe pricing is obviously not confirmed yet, but the next-gen Bolt EV, like its predecessor, will slot at the entry-level in not just the automaker's portfolio, but the segment as a whole. Roughly a year back, GM pulled the plug (pun unintended) on the Bolt EV, but soon announced that it will be returning for another run in 2025. For now, it's only been told that the Bolt will return as the EUV model, which means we'll get a compact crossover over a hatchback.\n\nThe previous Bolt twins didn't have the smoothest ride when they were around. The car suffered from recalls for battery issues and fire concerns, and this could have played a part in the Chevy starting afresh with the Bolt EV. This is what Mary Barra had to say about the Bolt's return:\n\n\"Our prior portfolio plans included several newly designed vehicles in the entry-level segments and a capital commitment of $5 billion over the next several years. However, by leveraging the best attributes of today's Bolt EUV, as well as our Ultium platform, our software, and NACS, we will deliver an even better driving, charging, and ownership experience with a vehicle we know customers love.\"\n\nDetails about the upcoming Bolt are scarce, but here's what the previous model looked like in terms of specs:\n\n2023 Chevrolet Bolt EV

Chevrolet stopped making its Mustang competitor, the Camaro, last year.\n\nTraditional cars - vehicles that are not SUVs, trucks or vans - make up less than 20% of US auto sales, according to Cox Automotive. The last generation of the Malibu was first introduced in 2016, making it much older than competitors such as the relatively popular Honda Accord and Toyota Camry. A new version of the Camry, now available only as a hybrid, just went into production. Still, GM sold more than 130,000 Malibus last year, a 13% increase from the year before.\n\nThe Malibu was introduced back in the 1960s as a more luxurious version of the Chevrolet Chevelle, called the Chevelle Malibu. By the 1970s, it had become its own distinct model.

General Motors will also pause, but not end, production of the Cadillac XT4 luxury SUV, which is built on the same platform in the same Kansas City factory.\n\nThe media can't agree on what the move means. Car and Driver says the move is coming \"as the company continues to transition to a more EV-focused lineup.\" But The New York Times notes that Americans \"have moved away from cars to roomier SUVs and pickup trucks,\" and automakers \"have helped that trend by offering more of those larger vehicles, which yield bigger profits than sedans and compacts.\"\n\nBoth motivations can be true.\n\nGeneral Motors will retool the plant that produces the Malibu to build the next version of the Chevrolet Bolt electric vehicle (EV) instead. Chevy ceased building the Bolt last year despite its sales success, planning to relaunch the vehicle on a new platform shared with other GM EVs.\n\nGM sees a mostly electric future for itself sometime in the 2030s as EV infrastructure improves and prices come down.\n\nBut, for now, SUVs and pickups drive GM's profits. That leaves little room for the traditional Detroit sedan.\n\nThe Malibu proved one of history's more successful nameplates. Chevrolet built Malibu models from 1964 to 1983 and again from 1997 to 2024. It lasted through eight generations and, at least for now, holds the title of \"the last Chevrolet sedan.\"\n\nIt's nearly Detroit's last sedan.\n\nFord got out of the sedan business altogether in 2020. Chrysler recently ended production of its 300 sedan, leaving it with nothing but a minivan to its name. Dodge built its final Charger sedan last year. The company brought out a 2-door replacement, though it plans a 4-door version soon.\n\nWith Chevrolet out of the sedan business, Cadillac's CT4 and CT5 are the last gas-powered 4-door cars built by the Detroit Three. The sedan, however, may not die when the internal combustion engine does.\n\nAutomakers build EVs on \"skateboard platforms\" - nearly flat combinations of batteries, electric motors, suspension, and steering components that can easily be repurposed into different kinds of vehicles at a fairly low cost. Now that Chevrolet has a series of electric SUVs built on its Ultium skateboard platform, bringing out an electric sedan would not be particularly costly for the company.\n\nGM has already introduced one EV sedan -- the high-dollar Cadillac Celestiq. An electric Malibu revival would make a logical future step to do battle with EVs like the Tesla Model 3 and Hyundai Ioniq 6.\n\nThe Malibu will remain on dealer lots until the last models sell, likely in early 2025. They may be great buying opportunities.\n\nKelley Blue Book expert test driver Russ Heaps says the Malibu \"still delivers reliable transportation in a handsome package. Passenger comfort ranks high on its reasons-to-buy list, as does its trunk space.\"\n\nDealers are often willing to take lower offers for a car once its demise has been confirmed to create space on the sales lot for something still advertised.", "source": {"uri": "kbb.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Kbb.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sean_tucker@kbb.com", "name": "Sean Tucker", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chevrolet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "General Motors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedan_(automobile)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sedan (automobile)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malibu,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Malibu, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Malibu, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SUV", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "SUV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet_Bolt", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chevrolet Bolt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pickup_truck", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pickup truck"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luxury_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Luxury car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadillac_XT4", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cadillac XT4"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car_and_Driver", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Car and Driver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City,_Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City, Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kansas City, Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodge_Charger", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dodge Charger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodge", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dodge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minivan", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minivan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrysler", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chrysler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Motor_Company", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ford Motor Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyundai_Ioniq_6", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hyundai Ioniq 6"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultium", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ultium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadillac_Celestiq", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cadillac Celestiq"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadillac_CT5", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cadillac CT5"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadillac_CT4", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cadillac CT4"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car_suspension", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Car suspension"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelley_Blue_Book", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kelley Blue Book"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Autos", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Autos", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Parts_and_Accessories", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Parts and Accessories", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Wholesale_and_Distribution", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Wholesale and Distribution", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://www.kbb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2024-chevrolet-malibu-front-3qtr.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550899", "eventUri": "eng-9550899", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

Here's what we're watching on TheStreet today.\n\nWall Street was handed another mixed bag on Wednesday. The Dow finished in the green for the sixth consecutive day, but the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq both finished fractionally down.\n\nInvestors are digesting the release of the weekly jobless claims report. The Department of Labor said 231,000 Americans filed for unemployment benefits for the week ending on May 4th. That's an increase of 22,000 from the week before. Wall Street is also looking ahead to consumer sentiment data due on Friday.\n\nIn other news, after 60 years, 9 generations, and more than 10 million cars sold, General Motors says it is shutting down production of the Chevy Malibu. The first Malibu was introduced in 1964, but was phased out in the early 1980s as GM switched its focus to selling trucks. The Malibu made a comeback in 1997 and has been in Chevy showrooms ever since. The final Malibu will roll off the production line in November.\n\nWatch More Videos:\n\nAside from struggling to make the car more fashionable over the last several years, GM wants to focus on electric vehicles.

The Camaro, by the way, is still rolling off factory floors, but it too, will be phased out sometime in 2024.\n\nAs for GM's EV strategy, the company fell short of its goal to sell 400,000 EVs between 2022 and the middle of 2024. And even with the industry facing tepid EV demand, GM said it's on track to produce between 200,000 and 300,000 EVs in North America by the end of the year.\n\nThat'll do it for your daily briefing.

Please whitelist our site in your adblocker, refresh the page, and enjoy!\n\nProduction of the Cadillac XT4 compact crossover will be paused for much of calendar 2025 according to the latest information from GM, as the factory where it is produced is retooled to add the revamped Chevy Bolt EV to the lineup of vehicles assembled at the facility.\n\nThe automaker plans to \"pause production of the Cadillac XT4 after January 2025\" according to GM spokesperson Kevin Kelly. This halt, and that of the Chevy Malibu, will \"facilitate the installation of tooling and other plant modifications\" for the purpose of adding more models to the facility's production capabilities.\n\nThe pause in Cadillac XT4 production starting in February 2025 will continue for most of the year, with late 2025 as the current approximate date for the crossovers to resume assembly. The workers building XT4 units will be laid off for the duration of the pause, but will be \"supported according to the provisions of the UAW-GM agreement\" according to Kevin Kelly.\n\nThe GM spokesman added that \"Fairfax will produce both the Bolt EV and XT4 on the same assembly line, which gives GM flexibility to respond to changes in customer demand.\" Relatedly, Cadillac has said it no longer intends to have an EV-only vehicle lineup by 2030, but will continue making ICE models while increasing the number of EVs in its portfolio.\n\nAs a reminder, the XT4 is motivated by a single powerplant choice, the turbocharged 2.0L I4 LSY gasoline engine developing 235 horsepower and 258 pound-feet of torque. Output reaches the wheels via the GM nine-speed automatic transmission, with available drivetrains including both FWD and AWD.", "source": {"uri": "gmauthority.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GM Authority"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rhian_hunt@gmauthority.com", "name": "Rhian Hunt", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadillac_XT4", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cadillac XT4"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "General Motors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet_Bolt", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chevrolet Bolt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossover_(automobile)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Crossover (automobile)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet_Malibu", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chevrolet Malibu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Automotive industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straight-four_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Straight-four engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-wheel_drive", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "All-wheel drive"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GM_Ecotec_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "GM Ecotec engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petrol_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Petrol engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadillac", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cadillac"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_line", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assembly line"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front-wheel_drive", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Front-wheel drive"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horsepower", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Horsepower"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbocharger", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Turbocharger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_transmission", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Automatic transmission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_combustion_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internal combustion engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torque", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Torque"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business", "label": "dmoz/Business", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Dating", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Dating", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Consumer_Goods_and_Services/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Business/Consumer Goods and Services/Recreation", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Advertising", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Advertising", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Contract_Manufacturing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Contract Manufacturing", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 58}], "image": "https://gmauthority.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-Cadillac-XT4-Sport-Mexico-Press-Photos-Exterior-005-side-front-three-quarters.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550899", "eventUri": "eng-9550899", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

But the category started to see a sales decline in the early 2000s as the SUV became more prominent and pickup truck sales grew.\n\nNow the U.S. auto market is dominated by the larger vehicles. Full-size pickups from Ford, Chevrolet and Ram are the top-sellers in America, and the top-selling non-pickup is Toyota's RAV4 small SUV.\n\nLast year midsize cars made up only 8 percent of U.S. new vehicle sales, but it was 22 percent as recently as 2007, according to Motorintelligence.com.

"AS automakers make room on the production line for all-electric variants, one American automaker axes a 60-year-old legacy.\n\nThis time around, the automaker says the discontinuation is permanent.\n\nThe Chevrolet Malibu was first introduced in 1964 as a subseries to the esteemed Chevelle muscle car to appeal to those who like the style and culture of the Chevelle but wanted a more family-friendly approach.\n\nIt came in several variations, like the four-door sedan, a two-door hardtop, a two-door convertible, and a station wagon.\n\nThe Malibu took on a sportier look for the second generation debuting in 1968 before it was changed again to be a family car in the 1970s thanks to the gas crisis.\n\nIt was discontinued in 1983 despite its popularity to put a heavier focus on the automaker's growing truck market and prioritize producing the Blazer and Silverado.\n\nThen it was revived in 1997 as gas-saving sedans became popular to compete against strong Japanese cars like the Toyota Camry or Honda Accord.\n\nThis year, the Malibu is on the chopping block once again - for good, this time - to make room for EVs on the production line.\n\nThe Malibu stands as the automaker's only gas-powered sedan sold in the United States, as Chevy's lineup is generally comprised of SUVs and trucks.\n\nIt was also the automaker's last gas-powered car in production since they quickly shifted to EVs.\n\nThe only hybrid made by Chevy is the hybridized Corvette.\n\nCadillac is the only brand under General Motors to make gas-powered cars with two sedans.\n\n\"To facilitate the installation of tooling and other plant modifications, after nine generations and over 10 million global sales, GM will end production of the Chevrolet Malibu in November 2024,\" wrote a GM spokesperson in an email to Detroit News, quoted by Newser.\n\nThe Cadillac XT4 SUV will also end in January, the spokesperson said.\n\nEnding production on the Malibu will allow the automaker to focus its efforts on the refreshed Chevy Bolt and electric Silverado.\n\nAccording to the New York Times, Chevy wasn't happy with the sales figures compared to its Camry or Honda competitors.\n\nWithout a hybrid version to bat against the Malibu didn't stand a chance.\n\nThe outlet reported that Chevy sold just 130,000 units last year, while 10 years ago, the average figure was 200,000 cars per year.\n\nChevy isn't the only brand to stop producing sedans to prioritize larger vehicles.\n\nFord no longer produces the Ford Taurus or the Fusion despite hybrid versions of both, for instance.\n\nStellantis, the parent company of Jeep, Dodge, Ram, Fiat, and Chrysler, no longer produces sedans, either.\n\nSubaru recently announced that their Legacy all-wheel drive sedan will no longer be produced after 2025.\n\nStaying ahead of the competition, Hyundai, Kia, Toyota, Lexus, Mazda, Acura, Nissan, and Honda have not announced any plans to end production of their flagship sedans.\n\nOther European brands, like BMW, Mercedez, Alfa Romeo, Audi, Bentley, Jaguar, Maserati, Porsche, Volkswagen, and Volvo continue to produce their popular sedans alongside upcoming EVs and hybrids.", "source": {"uri": "the-sun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The US Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kristen_brown@the-sun.com", "name": "Kristen Brown", "type": "author", "isAgency":

Here's what we're watching on TheStreet today.\n\nWall Street was handed another mixed bag on Wednesday. The Dow finished in the green for the sixth consecutive day, but the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq both finished fractionally down.\n\nInvestors are digesting the release of the weekly jobless claims report. The Department of Labor said 231,000 Americans filed for unemployment benefits for the week ending on May 4th. That's an increase of 22,000 from the week before. Wall Street is also looking ahead to consumer sentiment data due on Friday.\n\nIn other news, after 60 years, 9 generations, and more than 10 million cars sold, General Motors says it is shutting down production of the Chevy Malibu. The first Malibu was introduced in 1964, but was phased out in the early 1980s as GM switched its focus to selling trucks. The Malibu made a comeback in 1997 and has been in Chevy showrooms ever since. The final Malibu will roll off the production line in November.\n\nWatch More Videos:\n\nNew dyslexia treatment aims to overcome biggest hurdle in cognitive healthcareHow this YouTuber built a huge audience by playing slotsYes, there are fewer chips in the bag: Shrinkflation, explained\n\nAside from struggling to make the car more fashionable over the last several years, GM wants to focus on electric vehicles. Its Fairfax Assembly Plant in Kansas will shift production to two other GM vehicles - the Chevy Bolt and the Cadillac XT4. The company has invested $390 million to revamp the Chevy Bolt, which saw production halted in April of last year.\n\nWith the phasing out of the Malibu, Chevrolet has just one gas-powered car remaining - the Corvette. The Camaro, by the way, is still rolling off factory floors, but it too, will be phased out sometime in 2024.\n\nAs for GM's EV strategy, the company fell short of its goal to sell 400,000 EVs between 2022 and the middle of 2024. And even with the industry facing tepid EV demand, GM said it's on track to produce between 200,000 and 300,000 EVs in North America by the end of the year.\n\nThat'll do it for your daily briefing.

Will Retire the Chevrolet Malibu to Make More Electric Cars", "body": "The gasoline-powered Malibu was the last affordable sedan sold by Chevrolet, the General Motors brand, in the United States.\n\nGeneral Motors said on Wednesday that it would stop making the Chevrolet Malibu, the last affordable sedan in its U.S. model lineup and a venerable nameplate that was introduced in the 1960s when the company was a dominant force in the U.S. economy.\n\nFor years, American drivers have been gravitating toward sport-utility vehicles and away from sedans, compacts and hatchbacks. G.M.'s two Detroit rivals, Stellantis and Ford, have also largely wiped their slates clean of cars in the United States.\n\nForeign automakers such as Toyota, Honda and Hyundai still sell hundreds of thousands of sedans and compacts each year, but far fewer than in previous decades when the Toyota Camry and Honda Accord ranked among the most popular vehicles on American roads. Last month, Subaru, a Japanese automaker, said that it would stop making its Legacy sedan next year.\n\nG.M. produces the Malibu at a plant in Fairfax, Kan., and will continue to manufacture the car until later this year, when it plans to retool the factory to make a new version of the Chevrolet Bolt, an electric car, and the Cadillac XT4, a luxury S.U.V.\n\nConsumers have moved away from cars to roomier S.U.V.s and pickup trucks to haul children and recreational gear like bikes and kayaks. Automakers have helped grow that trend by offering more of those larger vehicles, which yield bigger profits than sedans and compacts.\n\nThe Malibu was first introduced in 1964 as an upscale family sedan. Four years later, G.M. added a sporty, muscle-car version -- the Malibu SS. G.M. stopped making the Malibu in 1983 as the company was forced to downsize by growing foreign competition. It reintroduced the Malibu in 1997, but the model has almost always trailed the Camry and Accord in sales.\n\nSince its introduction, G.M. has sold more than 10 million Malibus. But sales have slumped in recent years. In 2023, G.M. sold 130,000 Malibus, and deliveries fell 47 percent in the final three months of the year. A decade earlier, G.M. typically sold about 200,000 Malibus a year.\n\nIn 2023, G.M. announced that it would stop production of the Chevrolet Camaro, a sports car. It continues to make the Chevrolet Corvette. Its Cadillac brand makes two gasoline-powered sedans and has plans to start selling a high-end electric car this year. All other models that G.M. makes for the U.S. market are now trucks or S.U.V.s.\n\nSeveral years ago, Ford eliminated sedans from its lineup. The Mustang is the only car that Ford makes for the U.S. market. Stellantis, the owner of Chrysler, now focuses mainly on trucks, S.U.V.s and minivans, though the company has said that it would start making an electric version of its Dodge Challenger muscle car in 2025.\n\nThe Malibu could, of course, return some day, perhaps as an electric vehicle. Automakers have often resurrected and repurposed old model names, especially those that buyers remember fondly.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "General Motors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedan_(automobile)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sedan (automobile)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malibu,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Malibu, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Malibu, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SUV", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "SUV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyundai_Motor_Company", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hyundai Motor Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_Camry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toyota Camry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet_Malibu", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chevrolet Malibu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chevrolet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatchback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hatchback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Honda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toyota"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Motor_Company", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ford Motor Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellantis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stellantis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadillac_XT4", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cadillac XT4"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet_Bolt", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chevrolet Bolt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda_Accord", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Honda Accord"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subaru", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Subaru"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pickup_truck", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pickup truck"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electric car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Automotive industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Muscle car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodge_Challenger", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dodge Challenger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet_Camaro", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chevrolet Camaro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet_Corvette", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chevrolet Corvette"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minivan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minivan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrysler", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chrysler"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Automotive", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Automotive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Autos", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Autos", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Parts_and_Accessories", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Parts and Accessories", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/05/08/business/08chevy-malibu/08chevy-malibu-videoSixteenByNine3000.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550899", "eventUri": "eng-9550899", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 143, "relevance": 1}

Only Cadillac is still clinging to sedans.\n\nSecondly, the Malibu is not part of General Motors' plans for an electrified future. There was briefly a hybrid version of the Malibu, but that wasn't enough to stay its sentence.

But, hey - there's a new paint shade for 2025.\n\nWe know, we know; hold your excitement. According to the brand's fleet order guide, the 2025 Malibu will be offered in Night Shade Metallic, though a compact spare tire will not be available with an FDR order type which is a reference to Fleet Daily Rental and not a former president of the United States.\n\nThis is clearly the type of heady information which keeps the B&B clicking on our website.\n\nRecall the Malibu hasn't had any meaningful updates since Adam was an oakum picker, powered solely by the 1.5-liter turbocharged engine making 163 horsepower and 184 lb-ft of torque funneled to the earth via a CVT. Even headed into this, its final model year, there are a quartet of trims (LS, RS, 1LT, 2LT) plus an LS for fleet customers which relegates otherwise standard features like the Driver Confidence Package to an options sheet. Guess they figure rental drivers are confident enough already (actually, it's rear park assist and some other minor tripe which would actually be handy given the abuse some rentals endure).\n\nBack on the shop floor, GM says production of the Malibu will end in November 2024, making way for assembly of the next-gen Chevy Bolt. The little Cadillac XT4 will also be impacted by this change, with production of that model being paused in January 2025 while the place is being prepped for the Bolt. The General is promising the plant will return to an online status later that calendar year, cranking out XT4s and Bolts as it sees fit to meet demand. The facility opened in 1987 to build the Grand Prix and now employs about 2,000 souls.", "source": {"uri": "thetruthaboutcars.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Truth About Cars"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malibu,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Malibu, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Malibu, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexus_LS", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lexus LS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General Motors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_D._Roosevelt", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Franklin D.

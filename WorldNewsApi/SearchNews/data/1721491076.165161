But new data shows that hundreds of thousands of Scots are carers for elderly family members. The cohort \u2013 dubbed \u2018carents\u2019 \u2013 is the biggest single group of carers in the UK. In the whole of Britain, it is estimated that there are around four million adults in the role. And ahead of Carers Week, the founder of a network created to offer support and guidance for Britain\u2019s \u2018carents\u2019 has shared her top tips for anybody who find themselves suddenly caring for older relatives. Dr Jackie Gray, a former GP and NHS leader, launched The Carents Room following her own experience caring for her dad. She\u2019s now shared her top tips to help others caring for loved ones. 1) Have the talk \u2018It isn\u2019t easy to sit down with someone you love to talk about what will happen as they get older,\u201d admits Jackie. \u201cBut you must; The reality is the UK is aging quickly \u2013 the number of elderly people are expected to double within 15 years \u2013 and while it is lovely that the people you love are around for longer, independent living can become harder to manage as you get older. \u201cSo sit down with your older relatives, make a cuppa and just gently ask the question.\u201d Additionally, despite the forecast that more people will be caring for older relatives, around 50 per cent of Brits believe they\u2019ll never need to care. As such, Jackie said it is sensible that you both know where you stand. \u201cUltimately you may be the person having to pick up the slack with this if they lose their ability to live independently,\u201d she added. \u201cIf they want to live with you, that can be a lovely experience, but it can also be physically and mentally draining especially if they have extra needs which require round-the-clock care. \u201cAlternatively, while professional care can help ease the strain, it isn\u2019t free to everyone \u2013 and can actually be extremely expensive \u2013 so get a plan in place early and make a decision together.\u201d 2) Get your house in order According to Dr Gray, one of the most frequent issues carents encounter involves securing lasting powers of attorney. \u201cOften people are reactive when it comes to powers of attorney \u2013 you need to be as proactive as possible,\u201d she added. \u201cTime and time again, it pops up as something our carents wish they\u2019d have got in place earlier on as there can often be significant delays and obstacles you need to overcome before it is in place. Lasting powers of attorney allows you to legally act on behalf of someone, usually a relative, should they be unable to look after their own affairs. It means you can make crucial decisions about their wellbeing on their behalf \u2013 from finances and medical care to their daily routine \u2013 and is often a crucial piece of the jigsaw when it comes to caring for someone who needs extra support. 3) Don\u2019t be shy One of the most surprising things carents encounter, according to Jackie, is how much you often have to fight to get help for those you love. \u201cPeople naturally assume services will automatically rally around them, but sadly, that isn\u2019t the case. \u201cDon\u2019t assume it will be offered \u2013 but know that it is there. \u201cGP surgeries and councils all have support services in place for people will health problems, and even their carers. \u201cEven banks and your utility providers, be it your gas or electric, are legally required to provide extra help.\u201d Given carents themselves are often middle-aged or older, Dr Gray realised many struggled to navigate what she claims can be a \u201clabyrinth\u201d of grants, benefits and other financial support available to help out. As such, she compiled everything on The Carents Room website, which she hopes will effectively be a one-stop-shop for adult carers to see what they can \u2013 and can\u2019t claim. \u201cA lot of people are pleasantly surprised about what they are actually able to claim, and in many cases, it can prove a real lifeline \u2013 but the biggest problem is often navigating the system, and that\u2019s where we hope to be able to help the millions of people who can potentially benefit from it,\u201d added Jackie. 4) Don\u2019t suffer in silence Having chatted with hundreds of carents, one heartbreaking theme keeps emerging. Loneliness. \u201cSadly, caring for an older relative can sometimes cut people off socially,\u201d said Jackie. \u201cIf a relative needs round-the-clock care and companionship, sometimes you just don\u2019t have a minute to spare for someone else, whilst if they have more complex needs like dementia and there\u2019s nobody else to help ease the load it can become consuming.\u201d In recognition of that, Dr Gray helped launch The Carents Lounge, an online network for carents to come together. Stories and experiences are regularly shared, with The Carents Lounge also operating as a space for people to seek advice from those who have walked in their shoes \u2013 or simply to have a vent. \u201cBeing a carent can be an emotional rollercoaster, so having a sympathetic ear \u2013 even if it is just a virtual one \u2013 can be invaluable,\u201d Dr Gray added. 5) Be kind to yourself Research carried out ahead of Carers Week revealed the toll the role can take on the UK\u2019s four million carents. The poll found over 60 per cent of carents admitted the role had impacted their mental health \u2013 whilst over half revealed it had a detrimental effect on them physically. \u201cBeing a carent can be rewarding, and an experience filled with love \u2013 but it isn\u2019t easy,\u201d admitted Dr Gray. \u201cAnd the cruel irony is that the work they are doing by caring for elderly relatives takes an enormous strain off the NHS \u2013 yet they are absorbing that strain into their own health and wellbeing. \u201cOften they do the role whilst juggling jobs and their family, which can take a huge toll. \u201cMore support is urgently needed for the UK\u2019s four million carents, but there are definite steps they can take to help themselves.\u201d Basics like a good diet and exercise can play big roles, but the top tip? Keep moving. \u201cEven if you can\u2019t get to a fitness class or gym due to your caring commitments, there\u2019s plenty you can do in the home \u2013 from stretching to just standing, which burns twice as many calories as sitting,\u201d she added. \u201cAll of this can help with both your physical and mental health, which we found is sadly being neglected by so many carents.\u201d For more information about Carents, please visit https://carents.co.uk", "summary": "Hundreds of thousands of Scots are 'hidden' carers.They are often employed, and middle-aged, yet spend much of their free time caring for older relatives such as their parents.It is Scotland's biggest caring cohort.

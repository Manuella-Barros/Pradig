In view of the fact that the petitioner has been forced to shift accommodation and fend for himself in the last seven years and has been put to extreme mental agony, this court is inclined to direct the NBCC to pay a sum of Rs. 5 lakh to the petitioner,\" the court ordered.\n\n\"This is a classic case of extreme hardships suffered by a home buyer who has been made to run from pillar to post after having spent his entire life savings... Respondent has been exceedingly unfair in treating the home buyers in this manner,\" the court observed.\n\nNBCC accused the petitioner of \"forum shopping\", stating he has already approached the fora under the RERA Act and the Consumer Protection Act, and therefore the petition should not be entertained by the high court.\n\nThe court said in the present case, the act of approaching various fora stemmed from \"desperation\" rather than any strategy.\n\nThe behaviour, it added, arises out of a sense of frustration, helplessness and lack of legal knowledge.\n\n\"In the present case, the petitioner entered into the agreement way back in the year 2012. In five years, the petitioner has pumped in over Rs 76 lakh. A 'No Dues Certificate' has been given to the petitioner. Structural defects have been found out in the construction after certain persons started occupying the flats. Petitioners and several other persons have been left in lurch and have been forced to knock the doors of various forums,\" the court said.\n\n\"Such a person faces financial crunch to ensure proper education to his children and such a situation he has no other option but to knock on the doors of various forums hoping to get relief and in such a situation the contention of the State that the person is guilty of forum shopping cannot be accepted at all,\" it added.\n\nThe court further said that when builders fail to deliver what was promised, they shatter the trust and financial security of homebuyers and put them in a situation where they may face immense stress, anxiety, uncertainty and ultimately be forced to navigate legal channels for seeking recourse.\n\n\"The emotional toll of living in limbo, uncertain about the future of their investment and the stability of their living arrangements cannot be understated.

Petitioners and several other persons have been left in lurch and have been forced to knock the doors of various forums,\" the court said.\n\n\"Such a person faces financial crunch to ensure proper education to his children and such a situation he has no other option but to knock on the doors of various forums hoping to get relief and in such a situation the contention of the State that the person is guilty of forum shopping cannot be accepted at all,\" it added.\n\nThe court further said that when builders fail to deliver what was promised, they shatter the trust and financial security of homebuyers and put them in a situation where they may face immense stress, anxiety, uncertainty and ultimately be forced to navigate legal channels for seeking recourse.\n\n\"The emotional toll of living in limbo, uncertain about the future of their investment and the stability of their living arrangements cannot be understated. Compensating wronged homebuyers is not just a matter of rectifying past injustices but also about deterring future misconduct,\" the court observed.

Unfortunately, the number of victims may still increase,\" he said.\n\nThe Head of State emphasized that our cities and communities suffer from such Russian strikes every day .\n\n\"But there are ways to overcome it: to destroy terrorists where they are, to destroy Russian missile launchers, to provide long-range missiles and modern air defense systems to Ukraine. I am grateful to all partners who are helping. And the decisions we need must be accelerated.

Prosecutors and law enforcement officers are working on the spot. Russian war criminals will be punished. The only effective way to stop the aggressor is to strengthen Ukraine's defense with weapons and air defense. Russia is a terrorist country that understands force only. A strong Ukrainian army means protection from such crimes not only for Ukraine but for the entire civilized world,\" he emphasized.\n\nEmergency services and law enforcement officers are working at the scene to record another war crime committed by the Russian Federation. A pre-trial investigation into the violation of the laws and customs of war combined with premeditated murder (Part 2 of Article 438 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine) has been initiated.\n\nMinister of Internal Affairs Ihor Klymenko noted that the occupiers were targeting civilians in a cynical and cruel manner, as always, namely in the middle of a weekend.\n\nAs of 20:15, 7 people were killed, including 2 children.

leaving large craters and killing seven\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has renewed his appeal for more long-range weapons and air defences after a missile attack killed seven people including two children.\n\nThe Russian attack on the town of Vilniansk, near the southeastern city of Zaporizhzhia, also injured 31 others, Ukrainian officials said.\n\nIn total, at least 11 civilians were killed and a further 37 wounded in missile attacks across Ukraine on Saturday, Reuters reported.\n\n\"Our cities and communities suffer daily from such Russian strikes,\" Mr Zelensky wrote in a post on Telegram.\n\nBut he added that there were \"ways to overcome this\", including \"destroying Russian missile launchers, striking with real long-range capability and increasing the number of modern air defence systems\".\n\nHe posted images from Vilniansk showing a large crater near a smouldering building, as well as several bodies laid out on the ground.\n\nUkraine's Prosecutor General Andriy Kostin said two missiles hit the town, damaging infrastructure, a shop and residential buildings.\n\nThe Russian defence ministry has not publicly commented on the attack.\n\nOn its own Telegram channel, it posted footage of a missile strike on a railway it claimed was near the settlement of Ukrainka - less than six miles (10km) from Vilniansk - and was being used by Ukrainian forces to unload arms and military equipment.\n\nMr Kostin also said four people were killed and seven wounded in artillery strikes on three villages near the frontline in the eastern Donetsk region.\n\nWestern allies have already supplied Ukraine with a number of long-range weapons - including Scalp missiles from France, Storm Shadow from the UK and ATACMS from the US - as well as US-made Patriot air defence systems.\n\nHowever, the flow of weapons from the US - Ukraine's largest arms supplier by far - falterered earlier in 2024 after a bill designating further military aid was held up in Congress.\n\nThe legislation was eventually passed in April, and air defence systems and long-range missiles were arriving on front lines the following month.\n\nBut Ukraine has blamed losses of life and Russian territorial gains in the interim on shortages of ammunition and air defence missiles the delay caused, while Mr Zelensky has continued to call for further support to win the war.\n\nOn Telegram, he thanked allies for their help, but said decisions to send further weaponry \"must be accelerated\" as \"any delay in decisions in this war means the loss of human lives.\"\n\nIf you have any stories or news that you would like to share with the global online community, please feel free to share it with us by contacting us directly at [email protected]",

Ukraine's Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko said trade pavilions, households and vehicles also caught fire as a result.\n\nSpeaking to the National Police, one local resident who witnessed the strike said: \"It was a weekend, everyone was having a rest ... it wasn't even late, it wasn't dark, a missile hit.\"\n\nShe continued: \"Children died, children were injured.

So did adults. For no reason. The children had a graduation party, they were graduating from school. They were planning their future,\" according to CNN.\n\nPresident Zelenskyy expressed condolences, acknowledging the \"pain\" and loss felt by those affected. He emphasised the urgent need for enhanced defensive capabilities, stating, \"We need to strike with real long-range capability and to increase the number of advanced air defence systems in Ukraine.\" Zelenskyy underscored the necessity of swift decision-making to prevent further loss of life, stressing that delays \"mean losing human lives.\"\n\nRecent military developments have seen Russia making incremental gains across multiple fronts in Ukraine. In the Donetsk region, Russian forces have advanced towards the strategically important town of Chasiv Yar. These developments highlight Ukraine's vulnerabilities, including stretched manpower and logistical delays in receiving critical supplies from Western allies.\n\nThe tragedy in Vilniansk has reignited calls for robust international intervention and solidarity with Ukraine in its struggle against Russian aggression. The international community continues to monitor developments closely, with humanitarian concerns mounting as civilian casualties rise. The urgency of bolstering Ukraine's defences and providing humanitarian assistance remains paramount as the conflict escalates and exacts a devastating toll on civilian populations.\n\nOleksiy Goncharenko, a Ukrainian politician, expressed concerns over potential shifts in U.S. policy towards Ukraine based on the outcome of the upcoming presidential election. Reflecting on past remarks, he stated, \"We're very concerned because we, more or less, understand what it means for Ukraine, [a] Biden presidency, and we really don't know what it means for Ukraine, a Trump presidency. It can be very good, it can be very bad. We just don't know. And that's definitely concerning,\" CNN reported.

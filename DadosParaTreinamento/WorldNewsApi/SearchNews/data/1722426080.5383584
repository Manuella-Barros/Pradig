The training was aimed at deepening renewable energy transition among the women. As a renewable energy workforce technology company, Instollar said the training aligned with its specialities in identifying, vetting, training and connecting qualified solar workforce with renewable energy companies. With the use of advanced technology, Instollar ensures that solar companies can find the right technical workforce at the click of a button, streamlining the process, enhancing the efficiency of solar installations nationwide, reducing solar project implementation costs and providing jobs to otherwise unemployed but qualified workforce in underserved, rural and peri urban regions. Instollar Technologies, according to the co-founder and Chief Executive Officer of the company, Mrs Chinwe Udo-Davis, at the graduation of the trainees in Lagos recently, was founded with a vision to revolutionise the renewable energy workforce. \u201cOur mission is to bridge the gap between skilled professionals and renewable energy projects, fostering a more robust and accessible solar industry. \u201cWe provide a comprehensive platform where the green collar workforce and renewable energy companies can connect seamlessly. This platform not only simplifies the process of finding technical solar workforce, but also ensures that projects are staffed with highly qualified and vetted professionals, thereby guaranteeing the highest standards of quality and safety in solar installations.\u201d On the InstallHER initiative which saw several women passed through three weeks training to become renewable energy experts, she said; \u201cDespite our successes in connecting skilled workforce with solar projects, we noticed a glaring disparity in our database: less than 1% of the workforce were women. \u201cThis significant underrepresentation of women in the solar workforce prompted us to take action. In response, we launched the InstallHER Solar Training Initiative, a groundbreaking program aimed at empowering women with the skills and knowledge needed to thrive in the renewable energy sector. \u201cThe InstallHER initiative was borne out of a necessity to create a more inclusive and diverse workforce in the renewable energy industry. By providing targeted training for women, we aim to break down barriers and offer new opportunities for women to enter and excel in this field. The initiative is designed not only to equip women with technical skills but also to boost their confidence and provide them with the necessary tools to succeed in a traditionally male-dominated industry.\u201d She explained the depth of the training, saying; \u201cThe InstallHER training program is comprehensive, spanning three weeks of intensive theory and practical sessions. Participants are trained in various aspects of solar home systems, including installation, maintenance and design. The curriculum covers essential modules such as Introduction to Solar Home Systems; Basic Electricity Concepts; Analysis of Power Consumption; Types and Layout of Solar Home Systems, and Selection of Solar Panels for Solar Home Systems. \u201cAdditionally, the program includes hands-on sessions where participants work with real solar equipment, and training sessions conducted by solar company partners who teach the specifics of their products. \u201cTo ensure that the trainees can fully commit to the program, we provide local transportation stipends and cover their meals during the training period. Furthermore, the top-performing participants will now have the opportunity to intern with leading solar companies, gaining invaluable industry experience. Upon completion, all trainees receive certification and are onboarded onto the Instollar platform, where they can access further training and job opportunities,\u201d said. Addressing the trainees at their graduation, Mrs Udo-Davis said: \u201cTo our graduates, you are the pioneers of this vision. You have shown incredible determination, resilience, and passion over the past months. You have learned not just the technical skills needed to install and maintain solar home systems, but also the power of collaboration, problem-solving, and innovation. You have proven that with the right opportunities and determination, there is no limit to what women can achieve. \u201cYour journey has not been easy. Balancing family, work, and training requires immense dedication and sacrifice. Yet, you stood tall and committed to your goals. You have broken barriers, defied stereotypes, and paved the way for future generations of women in the solar industry. Each of you has become a beacon of hope and inspiration in your communities.\u201d Meanwhile, the four top performing graduands spoke to the media on their experiences and prospects. Akanni Khadijah Ajoke, who studied Agricultural Bio-Resources at the Federal University of Technology, Minna (FUT-Minna), said; \u201cI came regularly for the programme because I attached so much importance to it and I hope to be one of the interns because I need it so much. \u201cI believe the training from which we are graduating from today has equipped me with the right knowledge to go far in this exciting field.\u201d On her own, Bakare Mariam Olamide, a graduate of Mechanical Engineering from the Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife, said she was appreciative of Instollar and the other partners for the training, saying she would make the best of the opportunity presented to her. \u201cWhen I was told of this training, I vowed that I want to be part of it because I have the willingness to learn more and get more knowledge and skills. I thank those who made it possible \u201cThis training has afforded me the chance to do what I have always wanted to do,\u201d she said. Stella Adeyemi, who studied Animal Production at the Olabisi Onabanjo University (OOU), said her coming to the training was by chance. \u201cI never knew I was going to be part of the training because I live in Ogun State but a friend told me about it; I later relocated to have it. \u201cIt is worth the efforts and I am happy that I am today graduating from it because I have been equipped,\u201d she said. On her own, Ayomide Osho, a graduate of Crop Production form the same OOU, said the training, to an extent, aligned with part of her courses called \u2018Solar Tracking in Plants\u2019, saying it was another chance to delve more into solar energy. She said the training was another opportunity to deepen her knowledge of solar energy through installations, assuring that she was going to make things happen through the knowledge learnt. Meanwhile, some of the facilitators appraised the training and the opportunities that have been presented to the graduands. Speaking to journalists, a facilitator, Mr Emmanuel Adedeji, said given the course designs, the ladies have been presented with opportunities to further themselves. \u201cBecause of the design of the training which is tripartite, they can start off on themselves,\u201d he said. \u201cThey can also be gainfully employed by solar companies where they will earn livings. As well, they can be added to solar platforms where they can get job offers from clients. \u201cThere are enormous opportunities for them going forward and as the lead facilitator, I can tell you that most of the ladies are ready to soar.\u201d Also speaking, another facilitator, Engr. Shobo Olufemi, said the training was educating and practical, saying it had equipped them with soft skills, knowledge of the work and administering the work. \u201cIt is a new exciting ground for them to move ahead. They can effectively work as solar maintenance experts, work as installers, market solar products, among so many others. It is a wide range of opportunities for them,\u201d he said.", "summary": "<div style=\"margin-bottom:20px;\"><img width=\"696\" height=\"519\" src=\"https://independent.ng/wp-content/uploads/C4DE0E31-4077-4FC7-885F-207C17ADA5C0.jpeg\" class=\"attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" srcset=\"https://independent.ng/wp-content/uploads/C4DE0E31-4077-4FC7-885F-207C17ADA5C0.jpeg 696w, https://independent.ng/wp-content/uploads/C4DE0E31-4077-4FC7-885F-207C17ADA5C0-300x224.jpeg 300w, https://independent.ng/wp-content/uploads/C4DE0E31-4077-4FC7-885F-207C17ADA5C0-86x64.jpeg 86w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px\" /></div>Foremost renewable energy firm, Instollar, has empowered rural women with skills and competencies during a three-week training tagged, \u2018InstallHER Initiative\u2019.

Mukerjea, a British national, had sought permission to travel to Britain and Spain to manage her bank account and property.\n\nIn her application filed on July 18, Mukerjea stated that she needed to be present in Spain to execute documents related to her bank account at Banco Sabadell and to update her will regarding her property in Spain, which required her physical presence before a notary. The application also requested permission for Mukerjea to travel to the United Kingdom, given her UK citizenship.\n\nThe court has permitted Mukerjea to travel abroad for ten days between two consecutive trial dates within the next three months. She must report to the CBI before her departure and after her return and deposit a cash security of \u20b92 lakh. Previously, a similar request to travel abroad was made, but her passport had been damaged while in court custody.\n\nIndrani Mukerjea was arrested in 2015 for the alleged abduction and murder of her daughter, Sheena Bora, in 2012. Mukerjea, her ex-husband Sanjeev Khanna, and driver Shyamwar Rai are accused of killing Sheena on April 24, 2012, and disposing of her body in a forest in Raigad district the next day.\n\nThe CBI alleges that Indrani Mukerjea killed Sheena Bora due to her relationship with Rahul Mukerjea, the son of former media mogul Peter Mukerjea, who is also charged in the case.

Bowness has announced his retirement from coaching after 38 seasons in the NHL. THE CANADIAN PRESS/John WoodsWinnipeg Jets head coach Rick Bowness has announced his retirement from coaching after 38 seasons in the NHL. The Moncton, NB., native led the Jets to a 98-57-9 record during his two seasons at the helm, leading the team to back-to-back appearances in the Stanley Cup playoffs. Under the 69-year-old's watch in 2023-24, Winnipeg finished second in both the Central Division and the Western Conference while matching a franchise record with 52 wins before ultimately falling to Colorado in the opening round of the post-season. Bowness was named a finalist for the Jack Adams Award, recognizing the top head coach in the NHL. He served as a coach for eight different franchises and was behind the bench for 17 playoff appearances, including trips to the Stanley Cup Finals as an associate coach with the Vancouver Canucks in 2011, as an assistant with the Tampa Bay Lightning in 2015, and as head coach of the Dallas Stars in 2020. Bowness is one of only three head coaches - along with Scotty Bowman and Pat Quinn - to serve behind the bench in five different decades. His 2,726 games as an NHL coach are the most by anyone in league history.

The team announced Bowness\u00b4 decision Monday, roughly a week since being eliminated in the first round by Colorado.\n\nThe Moncton, New Brunswick, native worked 2,726 games as a coach in some capacity, the vast majority of it as an assistant across numerous roles dating to 1984. He is one of just three to coach across five decades, along with Hall of Famers Scotty Bowman and Pat Quinn.\n\nBowness and general manager Kevin Cheveldayoff are expected to speak with reporters later in the day in Winnipeg to discuss Bowness' retirement. It was not immediately clear if associate coach Scott Arniel, who filled in for several games this season when Bowness was away for personal reasons, would be considered as a potential successor.\n\nThat was Bowness many times, taking over as a midseason replacement for the original Winnipeg Jets, New York Islanders, Phoenix Coyotes and then the Stars in late 2019. He also coached the Boston Bruins and Ottawa Senators and had lengthy stints as an assistant for the Vancouver Canucks and Tampa Bay Lightning that included long playoff runs.\n\nWinnipeg Jets head coach Rick Bowness speaks during an NHL hockey press conference in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Thursday, May 2, 2024.

The team announced Bowness' decision Monday, roughly a week since being eliminated in the first round by Colorado.\n\nThe Moncton, New Brunswick, native worked 2,726 games as a coach in some capacity, the vast majority of it as an assistant across numerous roles dating to 1984. He is one of just three to coach across five decades, along with Hall of Famers Scotty Bowman and Pat Quinn.\n\nBowness and general manager Kevin Cheveldayoff are expected to speak with reporters later in the day in Winnipeg to discuss Bowness' retirement. It was not immediately clear if associate coach Scott Arniel, who filled in for several games this season when Bowness was away for personal reasons, would be considered as a potential successor.\n\nThat was Bowness many times, taking over as a midseason replacement for the original Winnipeg Jets, New York Islanders, Phoenix Coyotes and then the Stars in late 2019. He also coached the Boston Bruins and Ottawa Senators and had lengthy stints as an assistant for the Vancouver Canucks and Tampa Bay Lightning that included long playoff runs.\n\nAP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/nhl", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Beckley Register-Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@register-herald.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Bowness", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rick Bowness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Hockey League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winnipeg", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Winnipeg"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Winnipeg"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Adams_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jack Adams Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Stars", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Stars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hockey_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hockey Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moncton", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Moncton"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Moncton"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Quinn_(ice_hockey)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pat Quinn (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotty_Bowman", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scotty Bowman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Arniel", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scott Arniel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Islanders", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Islanders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancouver_Canucks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vancouver Canucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Cheveldayoff", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Cheveldayoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottawa_Senators", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ottawa Senators"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Bruins", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boston Bruins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_Coyotes", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arizona Coyotes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Lightning", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tampa Bay Lightning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cheerleading/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cheerleading/Organizations", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Archery", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Archery", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/register-herald.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/2/e8/2e877715-7a56-5bf5-bc67-92d8f6c35bdc/6638fe12b4d65.image.jpg?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C124&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543221", "eventUri": "eng-9543221", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 222, "relevance": 1}

Speaking to reporters last week, Bowness said the team hadn't yet decided on whether or not to exercise its option and needed to talk with his family and the team about his future.\n\nAfter a 40-year career behind NHL benches as a head coach and assistant, Bowness was named a finalist for the Jack Adams Award for the first time last week. He guided Winnipeg to a second-place finish in the Central Division this season with 110 points and 52 wins, the latter of which tied for the most in Jets/Thrashers franchise history.\n\nBowness began his time in the NHL as a player. After being selected in the second round of the 1975 NHL Amateur Draft by the Atlanta Flames, Bowness made his NHL debut the following season. The right winger didn't establish himself as an everyday NHLer until a move to the Red Wings in 1977, who acquired him for cash that summer. He played a career-high 61 games that season before spending the next three seasons as a major-league/minor-league tweener with the Blues and Jets organization, last suiting up in the NHL for the previous incarnation of Winnipeg with 25 points in 45 games in the 1980-81 campaign.\n\nStill playing in the Jets organization, Bowness began his career in coaching as a player-coach for AHL Sherbrooke in 1982-83. He didn't coach the team during his final season as a player with Sherbrooke in 1983-84 but took a job as an NHL assistant with the Jets immediately after retiring. He remained in an assistant role in Winnipeg until 1987 when the organization reassigned him to the minors to become the head coach of their new AHL affiliate in Moncton. A year and a half later, Bowness was back in the NHL - this time getting his first shot as a head coach in the majors. He was the interim boss for the back half of the 1988-89 campaign after Winnipeg fired Dan Maloney midseason. It wasn't terribly successful, though, and he wasn't brought back after finishing the season with an 8-17-3 record.\n\nBowness immediately landed with the Bruins organization and spent the following three seasons there -- two as the head coach of AHL Maine and one as Boston's head coach. He guided the team to a 36-32-12 record in 1991-92 and a Conference Final loss to the Penguins, the eventual Stanley Cup champions.\n\nIn the summer of 1992, he headed to the expansion Senators to serve as the first coach in franchise history. Nobody could have bolstered one of the most poorly assembled rosters in league history, though, and Bowness led the struggling franchise to a 39-178-18 record (.204 points percentage) before being let go midway through his fourth season in Canada's capital.\n\nBowness spent the next 20-plus years working for the Islanders, Coyotes, Canucks, Lightning and Stars, mainly serving as an assistant or associate. He was briefly the head coach of the Isles for a time in 1997 and 1998 and served as the interim bench boss for the Coyotes in 2003-04 for the final 20 games of the season.\n\nAfter going 2-12-3-3 down the stretch with Phoenix, Bowness wouldn't get another try as a head coach for another 15 years. He took over as interim for Dallas midway through the 2019-20 campaign after Jim Montgomery was dismissed due to unprofessional conduct, later revealed to be an alcohol-related incident that led Montgomery to seek treatment for alcoholism and eventually return behind the bench for the Bruins last year. Going 20-13-5 until COVID paused the season, Bowness returned in the bubble playoffs and oversaw the Stars' first appearance in the Stanley Cup Final in 20 years.\n\nDallas fell to the Lightning and missed the playoffs the following shortened season but returned to postseason play under Bowness in 2022. After going 46-30-6 and losing in the first round to the Flames, though, the Stars and Bowness mutually parted ways, paving the way for him to return to where his coaching career started in Winnipeg.\n\nBowness ended his career on a high note, posting a 98-57-9 record and guiding the Jets to back-to-back playoff appearances, even though they both resulted in quick first-round exits. He officially exits the game after 38 seasons behind an NHL bench, with parts of 14 coming as a head coach. His career record stands at 310-408-48-37 in 803 games, a .439 points percentage.\n\nWinnipeg now becomes the seventh team with an active head coach vacancy. No candidates have been linked to the job yet.\n\nPHR wishes Bowness and his family all the best in retirement and congratulations him on one of the lengthiest coaching careers in league history.",

Jennings Trophy this season for allowing the fewest number of goals against (199).\n\nThe Jets also tied a franchise record for wins in a season (52) and set a franchise record for road wins (25) this season, with Bowness earning the nod as one of four head coaches selected to participate in the NHL All-Star festivities in Toronto.\n\nBowness helped the Jets move forward with a transition of the leadership group, stripping Blake Wheeler of the captaincy shortly after he was hired and naming Adam Lowry captain last summer.\n\n\"So, they brought me in to do what? Change the culture. We had to change the culture. This organization, this team, had a bad reputation. We've improved that. We fixed that,\" Bowness said last week.\n\n\"We had to give the team a better identity that gave them a chance to win. We did that. We had to get this team back in the playoffs, because it missed the playoffs. We did that. That all being said, so we did all those. We're still very disappointed we came up short.\n\n\"We've made huge strides. Is there more to go? Yes, there is. But those are the reasons they brought me in. We've accomplished that. But now we have to take it to the next level.\"\n\nWhen he spoke to reporters last Thursday as the Jets were holding exit interviews, tears were welling up in Bowness' eyes, especially when asked about how tough this past season was -- when he was away from the Jets for a month to be with his wife, Judy, after she suffered a seizure, and later when he left the team for a few days to have a minor medical procedure.\n\n\"This game has given us a tremendous lifestyle that we ever could have dreamed of as kids. Still love it. Still have the passion for it,\" said Bowness. \"Listen, as I tell the players: every day in this league is a blessing. It is. We're treated so well. We're in the best league in the world. Never ever, every take a day for granted in this league. And I never have and I never will. I just love this game. It's been my life.\"\n\nBowness was vague about his future, though he sounded like someone who was interested in coming back to finish what he'd started.\n\n\"I know what I want to do. That will come out,\" said Bowness. \"We will let you know.\"\n\nTrue to his word, Bowness let folks know on Monday morning and he will hold a press conference with Jets general manager Kevin Cheveldayoff at 2 p.m. CT.\n\nWhile the focus will be on providing Bowness with a proper sendoff, the Jets' coaching search quickly becomes top of mind.\n\nWill the Jets look to promote associate coach Scott Arniel, who did an excellent job in Bowness' absence during the past two seasons or will they go through an expansive interview process?\n\nPlayoff success may have eluded Bowness in his two seasons, as the Jets were bounced in five games by the Avalanche and Vegas Golden Knights.\n\nBut while Bowness certainly shares in the blame the on-ice execution was nowhere near where it needed to be, despite winning the series opener in each of those series.\n\n\"I take full responsibility for that playoff performance. I do. Our team did not play well. The standards that I had set for the team and myself, we didn't reach that standard,\" Bowness said last week. \"I put the onus on me to make sure that doesn't happen again. I have to get more out of the players. It's my responsibility to get those guys to the next level. Again, you learn, every game you can learn something from your players, you can learn something new about them. So we just learned a lot about our players. That helps.\"\n\nAlthough Bowness won't be behind the bench to help in the next step of the process, that learning is going to be valuable for Arniel or whoever is the head coach next fall.\n\nBowness first joined the Jets during the 1980-81 season, which was split between the NHL and the Tulsa Oilers of the CHL.\n\nHe later became a player-head coach with the Sherbrooke Jets during the 1982-83 season.\n\nBowness was promoted to assistant coach with the Winnipeg Jets in 1984-85 and took over from Dan Maloney as head coach in 1989.\n\nBowness's 2,726 games as an NHL coach are the most in league history, and his lasting legacy is that he is universally loved around the game.\n\nAlthough he never captured the Stanley Cup that he covets, Bowness' parting gift is that he's leaving the Jets organization in a better place than it was when he arrived.", "source": {"uri": "winnipegfreepress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Winnipeg Free Press"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowness,_Calgary", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bowness, Calgary"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bowness, Calgary"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Captain (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Hockey League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NHL_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NHL All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Brunette", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Brunette"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_M._Jennings_Trophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "William M.

He guided the Jets to a 52-win campaign that saw them finish with 110 points before they lost in the Western Conference quarterfinal round to the Colorado Avalanche in five games.\n\nLeading the Jets to one of the NHL's best records led to Bowness being named one of the three finalists for the Jack Adams Award which goes to the coach who is \"adjudged to have contributed the most to his team's success.\"\n\nShortly before announcing his retirement, the Jets posted a video on X with the caption, \"Hockey won't be the same without you, Bones.\"\n\nInitially drafted in the NHL and the WHA, Bowness was a forward who scored 18 goals and 55 points in 173 NHL games with the Atlanta Flames, Detroit Red Wings, St. Louis Blues and the original Jets.\n\nHe was a player-coach with the Jets' AHL affiliate in 1982-83 and became a Jets assistant once the 1983-84 season was finished.\n\nThat would send Bowness down a path that led to him spending an NHL record 2,726 games behind a bench either as a head coach or as an assistant. His first NHL job was an assistant for the original Jets franchise for three seasons before he was named head coach for 28 games during the 1988-89 season.\n\nBowness returned to the NHL during the 1991-92 season when he was the head coach of the Boston Bruins for one year. He led the Bruins to a 36-win season and guided them to the Eastern Conference final where they lost to the Pittsburgh Penguins.\n\nThe Bruins did not bring Bowness back, but he was then named the first coach of the then-expansion franchise Ottawa Senators in 1992. Bowness coached the Sens for three-plus season and was fired 19 games into the 1995-96 season.\n\nHe was then hired as an associate coach for the New York Islanders and remained in that role until he was promoted to head coach as a mid-year replacement in the 1996-97 season. The Isles went 16-18-3 in 37 games only to see Bowness get fired the next year after 63 games.\n\nBowness came back to the league in the 1999-2000 season as a Phoenix Coyotes assistant. He was with the franchise for six years which saw him serve as a caretaker during the 2003-04 season when they fired Bobby Francis.\n\nHe would then join the Canucks as an assistant in the 2006-07 season which saw him play an instrumental role in what proved to be one of the franchise's golden periods. Bowness spent seven seasons in Vancouver and was part of the staff that reached the 2011 Stanley Cup final.\n\nIn 2013-14, the Tampa Bay Lightning hired Bowness to serve as an associate head coach for then-first-year coach Jon Cooper. Bowness spent five years with the Lightning before the Dallas Stars hired him as an assistant in the 2018-19 season.\n\nBowness was later elevated to head coach in December 2019 after the Stars parted ways with Jim Montgomery. Bowness led the Stars to the Stanley Cup final in the Edmonton bubble where they lost to the Lightning. The Stars would miss the playoffs a year later before returning to the postseason in the 2021-22 season.\n\nThe Jets hired Bowness before the start of the 2022-23 season. His first year saw them win 46 games and finish fourth in the Central Division before losing to the eventual Stanley Cup champion Vegas Golden Knights in the first round.\n\nWhat ultimately became his final season in Winnipeg saw Bowness lead the Jets to the sort of success that led to him being named a coach at the NHL All-Star Game for the first time in his career. Earlier this season, Bowness took a temporary leave of absence to be with his wife, Judy, after she had a seizure. In March, Bowness took another brief leave to have what the Jets said at the time was \"a minor medical procedure\" which saw him return later that month.\n\nBowness finishes his career with a 310-408-48-37 record having made five playoff appearances.", "source": {"uri": "espn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ESPN.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Bowness -- known as a no-nonsense but caring coach -- inherited a team with a poor culture and lack of identity but made a positive impact almost immediately, installing a stout defensive style and establishing an accountability structure. The next head coach will be in a much better situation than Bowness was in when he arrived.\n\nBowness led the Jets to a 98-57-9 record during his two seasons behind the bench and a 52-win campaign this season, which ties a 2.0 record. Unfortunately, he couldn't get them past the first round in the postseason as they lost in five games to the Vegas Golden Knights last spring and in five games to the Colorado Avalanche last month. He had an option in his contract for a third season.\n\nBowness took a monthlong leave of absence early into this season to be with his wife Judy, who suffered a seizure. He also missed some time in March for a medical procedure of his own.\n\nBowness' career as a coach spans 38 seasons and five decades; his coaching experience started in 1984-85 with the Jets 1.0, a team he also played for. He served as a coach for eight different franchises and head coach for six, reaching the Stanley Cup Final three times: with the Vancouver Canucks in 2011 as an associate coach, with the Tampa Bay Lighting in 2015 as an assistant coach, and with the Dallas Stars in 2020 as their head coach.\n\nHis 2,726 games as an NHL coach are the most by anyone in league history, the Jets noted in a news release.

The 69-year-old began coaching as a National Hockey League assistant in 1984, and he leaves the game exactly four decades later as a Jack Adams Award finalist.\n\n\"Hockey won't be the same without you, Bones,\" the Jets' social media team wrote, while posting an emotional tribute to the longtime bench boss:\n\n\"For the last seven years, since my last year in Tampa, every year I sit there and I talk to Judy, I talk to the kids, I'll talk to 'Chipper' [Jets chairman Mark Chipman] and 'Chevy' [general manager Kevin Cheveldayoff],\" Bowness said last week, per NHL.com.\n\n\"I know what I'm going to do. I know what I want to do, but that will come up. This game has given us a tremendous lifestyle that we never could have dreamed of as kids. We still love it, still have the passion for it. Listen, as I tell the players, every day in this league is a blessing. We're treated so well. We're in the best hockey league in the world. Never, ever, ever take a day for granted in this league. I never have and I never will. I just love the game. It's been my life.\"\n\nAn incredible career for the longtime veteran, who has coached six different NHL teams -- including the Jets twice.\n\nRick Bowness was a staple in the NHL coaching world\n\nBowness had a terrific year with the Jets in 2023-24, coaching the team to a 52-24-6 record, good for second place in the Central Division. And after four decades of coaching, he was honored with a first-time finalist nod for the Jack Adams, given to the NHL coach of the year.\n\nAlthough it was a tough ending -- Winnipeg bowed out to the Colorado Avalanche in five games in Round 1 -- Bowness has proved time and again his mettle as a coach in the NHL. He's been around the game for decades, playing 173 games as a member of the Atlanta Flames, St. Louis Blues and Jets before retiring and beginning his coaching career in 1984.\n\nBowness was never able to capture an elusive Stanley Cup, but he went to the sport's ultimate series as an associate coach with the Vancouver Canucks in 2011 and again with the Tampa Bay Lightning in 2015. In 2020, he was the head coach of the Dallas Stars team that came within two wins of a championship.\n\n\"His 2,726 games as head coach, associate or assistant are the most in NHL history, and he's one of three coaches (Scotty Bowman and Pat Quinn) to work in five different decades and the last active coach to guide an NHL team in the 1980s,\" wrote NHL.com.\n\nAfter coaching the Stars for three seasons, Bowness returned to Winnipeg to replace now-Florida Panthers bench boss Paul Maurice, who has nothing but good things to say about his colleague.\n\n\"That's a guy you want to talk hockey with because he's got a perspective and experience from players, different leagues, assistant coach -- I mean, just everything,\" Maurice said recently, per NHL.com.\n\n\"A lifetime. I'm happy that he has the rare opportunity as a coach to call your shot. He did a marvellous, marvellous job with that team over the last two years. They played exceptional. I hope he's appreciated for the work he did there. I know the people there appreciate him, but he did a really strong job.\"\n\nThe Jets will now be one of three NHL teams without a full-time bench boss, and it won't be easy to find a head coach who can step into the enormous shoes that Rick Bowness will leave behind.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "colin_gallant@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Colin Gallant", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Bowness", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rick Bowness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Hockey League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Adams_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jack Adams Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winnipeg_Jets", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Winnipeg Jets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Chipman", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mark Chipman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Cheveldayoff", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Cheveldayoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tampa, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tampa, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Adams", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jack Adams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Division_(NHL)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Central Division (NHL)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Avalanche", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Avalanche"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winnipeg", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Winnipeg"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Winnipeg"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Quinn_(ice_hockey)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pat Quinn (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotty_Bowman", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scotty Bowman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Flames", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Flames"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Maurice", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paul Maurice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancouver_Canucks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vancouver Canucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Stars", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Stars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis_Blues", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis Blues"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Lightning", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tampa Bay Lightning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/Ice_Hockey", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/Ice Hockey", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 36}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 35}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Jets-news-Winnipegs-retirement-message-to-Rick-Bowness-after-over-2600-NHL-games.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543221", "eventUri": "eng-9543221", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 207, "relevance": 1}

Bowness, 69, had a 98-57-9 record in his two seasons as head coach, bringing the Jets back to the playoffs and losing in the first round against Vegas in 2023 and Colorado in 2024. He's a finalist for the Jack Adams Award this season.\n\nWhen the Jets hired him in 2022, Bowness inherited a team that missed the playoffs. Paul Maurice had resigned early in the 2021-22 season and Dave Lowry had taken over as interim coach. At the end of that season, Paul Stastny famously talked about a lack of respect, Blake Wheeler spoke critically of the team's commitment to a 200-foot game, PL Dubois didn't want to be a Jet and Mark Scheifele and Connor Hellebuyck were both unclear about their plans for 2024 free agency.\n\nBowness spent that summer talking to his new players at length and asking them -- not telling them -- what the Jets needed most. At summer's end, he changed the Jets' leadership group, removing Wheeler's captaincy and ultimately paving the way for his summer 2023 buyout. The locker room was democratized -- instead of belonging to Wheeler and the veterans, Bowness made sure more players' voices were heard. Sources have told The Athletic that the impact of this was substantial -- that players who didn't feel as comfortable speaking up in the previous era found their voice in Bowness' first season.\n\nOn the ice, Bowness and his new coaching staff -- associate coach, Scott Arniel, plus assistants Marty Johnston and Brad Lauer -- changed the way Winnipeg defended. A man-to-man/zone hybrid was tossed. In came zone defense with a greater emphasis on protecting the \"guts of the ice\" between the faceoff dots, all the way up the ice. And Bowness held people accountable for it, reducing Winnipeg's goals against from the 253 it allowed in 2021-22 before him to 224 in his first season. This year, the Jets allowed a league-best 198 goals against, not including shootout goals, while winning 52 games and finishing with 110 points.\n\nThat's a massive step forward for an organization in two seasons. It's remarkable that Bowness and his staff achieved this while also making concessions for Bowness' health and for him to be away from the team, with his wife Judy, when she suffered a seizure in October.\n\nArniel took the reins at that time, with substantial long-distance input from Bowness, guiding the Jets to a 9-2-2 record. Later in the season, Arniel took over again when Bowness underwent a minor medical procedure. Arniel is one option to become Winnipeg's next head coach, although one expects a formal search to begin soon.\n\nSome of Bowness' decisions telegraphed his exit. Arniel and his assistants ran most Jets drills in Denver during the playoffs, as one example, and were heavily relied upon during Bowness' full tenure. Assistants would sometimes speak to the media in Bowness' stead. This was proactive on Bowness' part, giving his staff a chance to grow, and would have been proactive whether Bowness retired now or next summer.\n\nThe Athletic also learned that Bowness didn't participate in players' end-of-season meetings last week, suggesting he knew his plans even at that time.\n\nBowness coached for eight different franchises and was behind the bench for 17 playoff appearances, including trips to the final as an associate coach with Vancouver in 2011, an assistant with Tampa Bay in 2015 and as Dallas Stars head coach in 2020.\n\nHe's one of only three head coaches, along with Scotty Bowman and Pat Quinn, to serve behind the bench in five different decades. His 2,726 games as an NHL coach are the most by anyone in league history.", "source": {"uri": "theathletic.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Athletic"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Paul Maurice had resigned early in the 2021-22 season and Dave Lowry had taken over as interim coach. At the end of that season, Paul Stastny famously talked about a lack of respect, Blake Wheeler spoke critically of the team's commitment to a 200-foot game, PL Dubois didn't want to be a Jet and Mark Scheifele and Connor Hellebuyck were both unclear about their plans for 2024 free agency.\n\nBowness spent that summer talking to his new players at length and asking them -- not telling them -- what the Jets needed most. At summer's end, he changed the Jets' leadership group, removing Wheeler's captaincy and ultimately paving the way for his summer 2023 buyout. The locker room was democratized -- instead of belonging to Wheeler and the veterans, Bowness made sure more players' voices were heard. Sources have told The Athletic that the impact of this was substantial -- that players who didn't feel as comfortable speaking up in the previous era found their voice in Bowness' first season.\n\nOn the ice, Bowness and his new coaching staff -- associate coach Scott Arniel plus assistants Marty Johnston and Brad Lauer -- changed the way Winnipeg defended. A man-to-man/zone hybrid was tossed. In came zone defense with a greater emphasis on protecting the \"guts of the ice\" between the faceoff dots, all the way up the ice. And Bowness held people accountable for it, reducing Winnipeg's goals against from the 253 it allowed in 2021-22 before him to 224 in his first season. This year, the Jets allowed a league-best 198 goals against, not including shootout goals, while winning 52 games and finishing with 110 points.\n\nThat's a massive step forward for an organization in two seasons. Remarkably, Bowness and his staff achieved this while also making concessions for Bowness' health and for him to be away from the team, with his wife Judy, when she suffered a seizure in October.\n\nArniel took the reins at that time, with substantial long-distance input from Bowness, guiding the Jets to a 9-2-2 record. Later in the season, Arniel took over again when Bowness underwent a minor medical procedure. Arniel is one option to become Winnipeg's next head coach, although one expects a formal search to begin soon.\n\nSome of Bowness' decisions telegraphed his exit. Arniel and his assistants ran most Jets drills in Denver during the playoffs, as one example, and were heavily relied upon during Bowness' full tenure. Assistants would sometimes speak to the media in Bowness' stead. This was proactive on Bowness' part, giving his staff a chance to grow, and would have been proactive whether Bowness retired now or next summer.\n\nThe Athletic also learned that Bowness didn't participate in players' end-of-season meetings last week, suggesting he knew his plans even at that time.\n\nBowness coached for eight different franchises and was behind the bench for 17 playoff appearances, including trips to the Final as an associate coach with Vancouver in 2011, an assistant with Tampa Bay in 2015 and as Dallas Stars head coach in 2020.\n\nHe's one of only three head coaches, along with Scotty Bowman and Pat Quinn, to serve behind the bench in five different decades. His 2,726 games as an NHL coach are the most by anyone in league history.\n\nRequired reading", "source": {"uri": "theathletic.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Athletic"}, "authors": [{"uri": "murat_ates@theathletic.com", "name": "Murat Ates", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowness,_Calgary", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bowness, Calgary"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bowness, Calgary"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Arniel", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Scott Arniel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blake_Wheeler", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Blake Wheeler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Lowry", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dave Lowry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Stastny", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paul Stastny"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Maurice", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paul Maurice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connor_Hellebuyck", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Connor Hellebuyck"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Scheifele", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mark Scheifele"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Captain (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winnipeg", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Winnipeg"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Winnipeg"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre-Luc_Dubois", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pierre-Luc Dubois"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face-off", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Face-off"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Forward (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Quinn_(ice_hockey)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pat Quinn (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotty_Bowman", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scotty Bowman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Stars", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Stars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Lightning", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tampa Bay Lightning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Hockey League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancouver", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vancouver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Vancouver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Archery", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Archery", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Archery", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Archery", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2024/05/06115751/USATSI_22922945-scaled-e1715012289736.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543221", "eventUri": "eng-9543221", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

Bowness announced his retirement after 38 season on Monday. Fred Greenslade/The Canadian Press via AP\n\nWinnipeg Jets Coach Rick Bowness is retiring after 38 seasons in the NHL, a career that included leading the Dallas Stars to the Stanley Cup Final in 2020 and more time spent behind the bench than anyone else in league history.\n\nAt 69, the oldest with a head role in the NHL, Bowness is a finalist for the Jack Adams Award as coach of the year for the first time after leading the Jets to a franchise-record 52 wins and a second consecutive postseason appearance in as many seasons on the job. The team announced Bowness' decision Monday, roughly a week since being eliminated in the first round by Colorado.\n\nThe Moncton, New Brunswick, native worked 2,726 games as a coach in some capacity, the vast majority of it as an assistant across numerous roles dating to 1984. He is one of just three to coach across five decades, along with Hall of Famers Scotty Bowman and Pat Quinn. He coached the AHL Maine Mariners in 1989-90 and 90-91.\n\nIt was not immediately clear if associate coach Scott Arniel, who filled in for several games this season when Bowness was away for personal reasons, would be considered as a potential successor.\n\nThat was Bowness many times, taking over as a midseason replacement for the original Winnipeg Jets, New York Islanders, Phoenix Coyotes and then the Stars in late 2019. He also coached the Boston Bruins and Ottawa Senators and had lengthy stints as an assistant for the Vancouver Canucks and Tampa Bay Lightning that included long playoff runs.\n\nSTARS: Coach Pete DeBoer had so many emotions to process after a Game 7 victory over his former team.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere were those mixed feelings still from last year, when the Vegas Golden Knights beat Dallas in the Western Conference Final and that team for which he had such a great affection went on to win its first Stanley Cup. And there was just the tremendous joy of getting past them in his second postseason chance with the Stars.\n\n\"Obviously, really wanted to win this series. I mean, we wanted our turn,\" DeBoer said after the series-ending 2-1 victory Sunday night. \"We felt we did all the right things all year in order to get the first seed. And then you draw a team like Vegas, which I honestly think they've got a deeper team than they had last year. And to plow through the adversity of being down 2-0, there's a lot there to unpack.\"\n\nAfter losing those first two games at home, the Stars came back to win a tight series. Both teams scored 16 goals, and the margin was never more than two goals at any point.\n\n\"I don't think either team could sit here and say they were dominating the series, or were truly at their best the whole time,\" said Bruce Cassidy, who two years ago replaced DeBoer as the Vegas coach. \"I don't think you saw either team truly get to its max. But some of that credit has to go to the opposition.\"\n\nThe Stars now have a quick turnaround, though they get to stay home. Game 1 of their second-round series against Colorado is Tuesday night, a week after the Avalanche wrapped up their opening round with a Game 5 win over Winnipeg.\n\nCopy the Story Link\n\nInvalid username/password.\n\nPlease check your email to confirm and complete your registration.\n\nCreate a commenting profile by providing an email address, password and display name.

Darren Dreger, our hockey Insider. So what can you tell us about the future of Rick Bowness in Winnipeg?\n\nDreger: \"Well, and then obviously Jay, that's the big question, right? And the assembled media wanted to know and find out whether or not you know, they could expect the veteran head coach to be back on the bench with Winnipeg Jets.\n\nMy gut tells me that that's unlikely. I don't think that Rick Bowness will be back. I don't know that for sure. But I do take stock of the season that it's been.\n\nNHL Rumors: Victor Hedman, Anthony Duclair, Matt Dumba, and Jon Cooper\n\nI mean, this man is as deeply invested as any coach that I can remember. No different this year, but he also had family issues that he had to pay attention to. You know, his wife Judy went through a tough time. He had the leave of absence to look after Judy. He had his own health issues near the end of the regular season.\n\nTwo things I know about Rick Bowness. One priority, top of the list is his family and two, he loves to coach. In this case I think that the family is going to win out. He's going to slide back into retirement again, unofficial, we'll see.\n\nBut what a way to go out. I mean, he has to be has to be in the Jack Adams conversation. That's the job that Rick Bowness did this year in Winnipeg.\n\nOnrait: \"And, it's interesting to hear Connor Hellebuyck's comments. You know, he can't do it alone. It was an eventful offseason last year in Winnipeg. How eventful is it going to be this offseason in Winnipeg?\n\nDreger: \"Yeah. I mean, there'll be changes organically. There'll be changes. I mean, you look at the unrestricted free agent list in Winnipeg. What's going to happen was Sean Monahan who was acquired from Montreal Canadiens? What about Tyler Toffoli, who came in from the New Jersey Devils? That stuff will look after itself.\n\nBut then you take stock of what you've got. And it was interesting, there wasn't a lot of attention paid to the core of the Winnipeg Jets as part of the media availability and that's what I'm most interested in. You know, again, to, to analyze, maybe some of the weakness. I looked at the top four defense of the Jets and that feels like an area that Kevin Cheveldayoff the GM is going to want to try and improve.\n\nBut here's a newsflash for you, Jay. Unless you draft those pieces, they're incredibly hard to acquire. You know, Winnipeg struggles when it comes to convincing unrestricted free agents to come into the small market. So how do you acquire that piece? And that's where I think it's going to get interesting.\n\nNHL Rumors: Washington Capitals, Ottawa Senators, and the Seattle Kraken\n\nDoes Cheveldayoff use, say a forward like Nikolaj Ehlers who will go into his final year of his contract as a trade asset to acquire that defense?\n\nSo I'm not saying that's going to happen either, it's just I think those are the conversations hockey operations has to have in Winnipeg to move forward.", "source": {"uri": "nhlrumors.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "nhlrumors.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mark_easson@nhlrumors.com", "name": "Mark Easson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Bowness", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rick Bowness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darren_Dreger", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Darren Dreger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winnipeg_Jets", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Winnipeg Jets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winnipeg", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Winnipeg"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Winnipeg"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Dumba", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Matt Dumba"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Duclair", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Duclair"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Cooper_(ice_hockey)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jon Cooper (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sports_Network", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Sports Network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Hedman", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Victor Hedman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Adams", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jack Adams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connor_Hellebuyck", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Connor Hellebuyck"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Hockey League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Kraken", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Seattle Kraken"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Toffoli", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tyler Toffoli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Monahan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sean Monahan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikolaj_Ehlers", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nikolaj Ehlers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Cheveldayoff", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Cheveldayoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottawa_Senators", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ottawa Senators"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey_Devils", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Jersey Devils"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montreal_Canadiens", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Montreal Canadiens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Capitals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington Capitals"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://s22929.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/USATSI_23017092_168395535_lowres.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543221", "eventUri": "eng-9543221", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

Meanwhile, there could be changes at the top for the Toronto Maple Leafs, specifically when it comes to Brendan Shanahan. There is also chatter the Leafs are ready to move on from some names, but are also looking to extend a few players, including defenseman Jake McCabe. Finally, what's next for the Vegas Golden Knights after spending huge at the trade deadline and failing to move past the first round of the playoffs?\n\nTSN's Darren Dreger reported on Monday: \"Coaching news out of Winnipeg this morning. It's expected @NHLJets Head Coach Rick Bowness will announce his retirement today. Bowness has coached over 2600 games in the NHL and is a Jack Adams Award finalist for the first time. Great man. Great career.\" Not long after, the Winnipeg Jets posted a thank you video and confirmed the news with a statement.\n\nPierre LeBrun notes that Bowness was leaning towards retirement in 2022 after leaving Dallas but the lure to coach Winnipeg was too great for him.\n\nAs for what happens with the Jets' roster this summer, Murat Ates of The Athletic believes the team has several untouchables. Nikolaj Ehlers is not among them. He will be shopped and likely moved before the NHL Draft on June 28-29. He writes:\n\nWinnipeg has floated Ehlers' name in trade talks before. Now, with one year left on his deal and at least some concern about the team's ability to retain him, I think Ehlers is Winnipeg's best trade chip for repairing its defence and/or picking up a first-round pick in the draft.\n\nHe also believes that Tyler Toffoli is not returning and the Jets are OK with that. He started the playoffs strong but didn't finish strong and committing to him is not in the cards.\n\nElliotte Friedman said on a recent 32 Thoughts podcast that the Maple Leafs are looking at changes, specifically how the top management hierarchy is structured. Brendan Shanahan won't necessarily be replaced, but he could be gone. That would give more autonomy to Brad Treliving without the overriding approval of a President of Hockey Ops.\n\nFriedman also thinks there's a mutual interest in Tyler Bertuzzi and Max Domi staying, he said the Leafs' organization loves Jake McCabe both on and off the ice and wouldn't be shocked to see them offer him an extension. \"Lots of the \"us against the world\" attitude when they were down 3-1 came from him\". Sheldon Keefe could be let go and Craig Berube is a front-runner to replace him, and both Mitch Marner and the team may be ready to move on.\n\nTSN's Chris Johnston noted that \"all bets are off\" in Toronto where several things could happen this offseason. He added that Marner is going to take the most heat for the team's failures.\n\nESPN.com's Ryan S. Clark and Kristen Shilton believe Vegas Golden Knights general manager Kelly McCrimmon has some big decisions to make this summer. Always a team that moves pieces around, there are questions about what they do with pending unrestricted free agents Jonathan Marchessault and Chandler Stephenson.\n\nMarchessault is a former Conn Smythe Trophy Winner and productive piece that will attract plenty of off-season interest. He'll be in line for a significant raise, but the Golden Knights committed big money to players they acquired, such as Tomas Hertl and Noah Hanifin. They have limited cap space -- less than $900k of projected cap space with 20 active roster players under contract.\n\nThey are in a similar situation with Stephenson, who's proven himself as a solid two-way forward.", "source": {"uri": "thehockeywriters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hockey Writers"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jim_parsons@thehockeywriters.com", "name": "Jim Parsons", "type":

I love this league. I respect the league.\"\n\nHealth issues of his own and his wife, Judy, played a role in his decision, which went beyond disappointment over losing to Colorado in five games. After all, Bowness did a good enough job the rest of the time to be a finalist for the Jack Adams Award as coach of the year for the first time for leading the Jets to a franchise-record 52 wins and a second consecutive postseason appearance in as many seasons on the job.\n\nBowness was planning to retire in the summer of 2022 before Winnipeg general manager Kevin Cheveldayoff called to try to persuade him to take one more shot at winning the Stanley Cup. He didn't return that call right away but eventually decided to give it a go.\n\n\"We asked them to put their lives on hold to come here to Winnipeg to help give us, this group, a different voice, a different path, some strong structure,\" Cheveldayoff said. \"Just really wanted to thank Rick for the two years that he came and gave us here.\"\n\n\"We asked them to put their lives on hold to come here to Winnipeg to help give us, this group, a different voice, a different path, some strong structure,\" Cheveldayoff said. \"Just really wanted to thank Rick for the two years that he came and gave us here.\"\n\nBowness at 69 was the oldest head coach in the league. Word of his retirement led to plenty of well-wishes from those he has gotten to know around the game for several decades.\n\n\"I'm hearing today from guys I played with, and that's a long time ago, and from all over the world -- just people you coached,\" Bowness said. \"They're over in Europe and I'm getting texts from them. It's the friendships and the people you meet.\"\n\nThe Moncton, New Brunswick, native worked 2,726 games as a coach in some capacity, the vast majority of it as an assistant across numerous roles dating to 1984. He is one of just three to coach across five decades, along with Hall of Famers Scotty Bowman and Pat Quinn.\n\n\"A lifetime in hockey and obviously well-respected by all of the coaching peers but also the players he's had an effect on over their careers, especially the young defensemen in the league,\" said Peter DeBoer, who succeeded Bowness as Stars coach. \"It's a who's-who list of the last 20 years. Great career, and I feel fortunate to have coached against him, and I just want him to enjoy his retirement and congratulate him on a great run.\"\n\nIt was not immediately clear if associate coach Scott Arniel, who filled in for several games this season when Bowness was away for personal reasons, would be considered as a potential successor.\n\nThat was Bowness many times, taking over as a midseason replacement for the original Winnipeg Jets, New York Islanders, Phoenix Coyotes and then the Stars in late 2019. He also coached the Boston Bruins and Ottawa Senators and had lengthy stints as an assistant for the Vancouver Canucks and Tampa Bay Lightning that included long playoff runs.\n\nThe closest Bowness got to the Cup was Game 7 of the 2011 final with Vancouver on Alain Vigneault's staff. As a head coach, his Dallas team fell two victories short of the Cup against Tampa Bay while playing in the Edmonton \"bubble\" in 2020.\n\n\"It's not winning the Stanley Cup: It's always been important, but over the years as you age, you hope you have an impact on your players' lives off the ice, on the ice and that's been more important to me over the last 10 years,\" Bowness said. \"I've had some runs at the Stanley Cup and things happen that are out of your control with injuries and everything, and then you lose the Cup and, OK, things happen out of your control. What is in your control every day is the impact that you can have on your players on and off the ice.\"\n\nAP Sports Writer Stephen Hawkins in Frisco, Texas, contributed to this report.\n\nAP NHL:

In a very short time, he completed those goals and left a lasting impact on the Jets organization.\n\nBowness officially announced his retirement on Monday, May 6, wrapping up a stellar 38-year career as a coach in the NHL. Bowness' impact on hockey will be dearly missed, but even more so, he will be remembered for the respect he has earned league-wide for being an incredible human being and giving his respect to others.\n\nBowness' 2,726 games coached are the most in NHL history, 802 of which he was the head coach for his teams. He was the head coach for the Jets, Dallas Stars, New York Islanders, Ottawa Senators, Boston Bruins, and Arizona Coyotes over the span of his 38-year career as coach. In his press conference, he mentioned how important his relationships with his players were to him as he reached the later stages of his career.\n\n\"I just loved the game,\" Bowness said while fighting back tears during his press conference. \"Right? And I respected the game. I love this league, I respect the league. I hope over my career, it's not about winning the Stanley Cup, that's important too. Over the years, as you age, you hope you have an impact on your player's lives. Off the ice, on the ice, and that's been more important to me over the last 10 years.\"\n\nA big part of changing that culture was the decision to strip Blake Wheeler of the captaincy and go without a captain for a season, before handing the 'C' to Adam Lowry. Lowry was in attendance for Bowness' retirement press conference, and shared the respect he had for his head coach of the past two seasons.\n\n\"Most games coached, ever,\" Lowry said on Bowness' career. \"You talk about someone who left better than when he came in, I think Rick really embodies that.\"\n\nRelated: Jets Head Coach Rick Bowness Announces Retirement\n\nLowry also took the time to explain how often Bowness checks in on him and the players throughout the room, and expressed the importance of having a coach who consistently shows that they care. Bowness mentioned this as being something that was within his control as a head coach, and it's something he took great pride in.\n\n\"I've had some runs at the Stanley Cup, and things happen that are out of your control. What is in your control every day is the impact that you can have on your players, on and off the ice. That is within a coach's control, and I've always taken great pride in that.\"\n\nIn a short period of time, Bowness changed the way the Jets play hockey. He often referred to a strong defensive effort as \"Winnipeg Jets hockey\", which became a trademark for how they wanted to play.\n\nFormer Bowness-coached players who now play against the Jets have referred to this as \"Bones hockey\", further showing his impact on this roster and his ability to get players to buy in defensively. Look no further than the 2023-24 William M. Jennings trophy, given to the team with the fewest goals allowed during the regular season, as a testament to what he coached into his players.\n\n\"I couldn't have picked a better place to come back to and finish my career, Bowness said on Monday afternoon. \"It's been a real honour for me to coach the Winnipeg Jets again.\"\n\nThis past season, Winnipeg set a long list of franchise records. Their 52-24-26 record tied a franchise record for wins in a season from 2017-18 (52), 25 of which were road wins, which was also a franchise record. two franchise-record winning streaks of eight games, and a point streak of 14 games. Along with those, they set a franchise record and tied an NHL record, by going 35 straight games allowing three goals or fewer.\n\nBowness was also named a finalist for the Jack Adams Award for the first time in his career in 2023-24, which goes to show the respect he and the Jets were given throughout the regular season. His record as Jets' head coach (98-57-9) is an indication of his impact, as the Jets finished fourth-best in the NHL in 2023-24, and first place in regulation wins (46).\n\nThe Jets now are left with a vacant head coaching position which they will look to fill over the offseason. It could be current associate coach Scott Arniel, or an outside candidate, but General Manager Kevin Cheveldayoff remained non-committal on the approach they will take to choosing their next coach, given the fresh nature of this change. Because of Rick Bowness, the new head coach will be stepping into a locker room culture that has drastically improved over the past two seasons, and the expectation that the Jets remain a playoff team, year in and year out.", "source": {"uri": "thehockeywriters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hockey Writers"}, "authors": [{"uri": "connor_hrabchak@thehockeywriters.com", "name": "Connor Hrabchak", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Lowry", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Adam Lowry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Bowness", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rick Bowness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winnipeg_Jets", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Winnipeg Jets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Hockey League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Islanders", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Islanders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Stars", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Stars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottawa_Senators", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ottawa Senators"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Bruins", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston Bruins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Captain (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_Coyotes", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arizona Coyotes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blake_Wheeler", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Blake Wheeler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Adams_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jack Adams Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Arniel", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scott Arniel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Cheveldayoff", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Cheveldayoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winnipeg", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Winnipeg"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Winnipeg"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/Ice_Hockey", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/Ice Hockey", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Careers", "label": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Careers", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://s3951.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Rick-Bowness-Jets-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543221", "eventUri": "eng-9543221", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-06", "textStart": 355, "textEnd": 360}], "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 452726067, "relevance": 2}], "totalResults": 42, "page": 1, "count": 1, "pages": 42}}}

I love this league. I respect the league.\"\n\nHealth issues of his own and his wife, Judy, played a role in his decision, which went beyond disappointment over losing to Colorado in five games. After all, Bowness did a good enough job the rest of the time to be a finalist for the Jack Adams Award as coach of the year for the first time for leading the Jets to a franchise-record 52 wins and a second consecutive postseason appearance in as many seasons on the job.\n\nBowness was planning to retire in the summer of 2022 before Winnipeg general manager Kevin Cheveldayoff called to try to persuade him to take one more shot at winning the Stanley Cup. He didn't return that call right away but eventually decided to give it a go.\n\n\"We asked them to put their lives on hold to come here to Winnipeg to help give us, this group, a different voice, a different path, some strong structure,\" Cheveldayoff said. \"Just really wanted to thank Rick for the two years that he came and gave us here.\"\n\n\"We asked them to put their lives on hold to come here to Winnipeg to help give us, this group, a different voice, a different path, some strong structure,\" Cheveldayoff said. \"Just really wanted to thank Rick for the two years that he came and gave us here.\"\n\nBowness at 69 was the oldest head coach in the league. Word of his retirement led to plenty of well-wishes from those he has gotten to know around the game for several decades.\n\n\"I'm hearing today from guys I played with, and that's a long time ago, and from all over the world -- just people you coached,\" Bowness said. \"They're over in Europe and I'm getting texts from them. It's the friendships and the people you meet.\"\n\nThe Moncton, New Brunswick, native worked 2,726 games as a coach in some capacity, the vast majority of it as an assistant across numerous roles dating to 1984. He is one of just three to coach across five decades, along with Hall of Famers Scotty Bowman and Pat Quinn.\n\n\"A lifetime in hockey and obviously well-respected by all of the coaching peers but also the players he's had an effect on over their careers, especially the young defensemen in the league,\" said Peter DeBoer, who succeeded Bowness as Stars coach. \"It's a who's-who list of the last 20 years. Great career, and I feel fortunate to have coached against him, and I just want him to enjoy his retirement and congratulate him on a great run.\"\n\nIt was not immediately clear if associate coach Scott Arniel, who filled in for several games this season when Bowness was away for personal reasons, would be considered as a potential successor.\n\nThat was Bowness many times, taking over as a midseason replacement for the original Winnipeg Jets, New York Islanders, Phoenix Coyotes and then the Stars in late 2019. He also coached the Boston Bruins and Ottawa Senators and had lengthy stints as an assistant for the Vancouver Canucks and Tampa Bay Lightning that included long playoff runs.\n\nThe closest Bowness got to the Cup was Game 7 of the 2011 final with Vancouver on Alain Vigneault's staff. As a head coach, his Dallas team fell two victories short of the Cup against Tampa Bay while playing in the Edmonton \"bubble\" in 2020.\n\n\"It's not winning the Stanley Cup: It's always been important, but over the years as you age, you hope you have an impact on your players' lives off the ice, on the ice and that's been more important to me over the last 10 years,\" Bowness said. \"I've had some runs at the Stanley Cup and things happen that are out of your control with injuries and everything, and then you lose the Cup and, OK, things happen out of your control. What is in your control every day is the impact that you can have on your players on and off the ice.\"", "source": {"uri": "triblive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TribLIVE"}, "authors":

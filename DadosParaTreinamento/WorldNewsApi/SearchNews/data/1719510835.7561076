That\u2019s why tunes and training are a hit combination: there are playlists, classes and even entire fledgling genres promising to help you push for the burn. Broadly speaking, there are two ways music can help you mid-workout. First, by helping you dissociate from any discomfort you\u2019re experiencing and, second, by improving the quality of the training itself. The former seems to work especially well for long, slow efforts. \u201cLet\u2019s say you\u2019re going on a run,\u201d says Dr Matthew Stork, a research scientist who studies the effects of music on training, \u201cand there are lots of what we call \u2018interoceptive\u2019 cues happening \u2013 your muscles are sore, your heart rate\u2019s going up, you\u2019re sweating, and so on. Music shifts your attentional focus away from those things, reducing your perceived exertion.\u201d But you might not even need anything tuneful on your headphones for these effects to kick in. \u201cThe introduction of other common audio formats has really shaken up our knowledge of how we think about music and exercise,\u201d says Dr Christopher Ballman, associate professor of kinesiology at the University of Alabama. \u201cThere are individuals now who will perform better listening to podcasts or even audio books \u2013 these help people dissociate from discomfort.\u201d As you up the intensity, the unpleasantness becomes tougher to ignore \u2013 but here, music might help you to push through. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve found in supermaximal tests \u2013 where volunteers are basically pushing themselves as hard as they possibly can \u2013 is that power output goes up with music,\u201d says Stork. \u201cIn those efforts, it seems to be more beneficial as a motivational tool. Think about a piece like Darude\u2019s Sandstorm \u2013 we\u2019ve seen that just the anticipation of the beat drop can influence how ready you are for exercise.\u201d As for how music can actually improve your workout, improvements in technology have made this easier to quantify. \u201cWe now know that music influences not just our heart rate, blood pressure and breathing rate, but also electrical activity in the brain,\u201d says\u201cA good analogy might be that if you\u2019re running and every time you get to a junction, you encounter a green light, that would be the same as working out synchronously with music \u2013 if you\u2019re listening to music out of time, or don\u2019t have any music at all, it\u2019s like constantly stopping at red lights. You\u2019re juddering along, out of pace.\u201d For cardio-style workouts, an optimal workout tempo is 120-140BPM (beats per minute) for most people, where it\u2019s likely to match the heart rate they experience. At the same time, at least one study suggests that we spontaneously modify our cadence to match the tempo of the music we\u2019re listening to, suggesting that differently paced tunes might help runners or rowers change their pacing. Rhythm is also important. \u201cA predictable, not-too-complex musical rhythm seems to work best,\u201d says Karageorghis. \u201cClassical music and rock, for instance, are often characterised by rallentandos and accelerandos \u2013 basically, slowing down and speeding up \u2013 which isn\u2019t very good if you\u2019re trying to synchronise your performance with the beat.\u201d Rhythmic workouts, rock and classical music also share what researchers call \u201ciconic cues\u201d. \u201cThese are basically a way of conjuring imagery through the nature of the music,\u201d says Karageorghis. \u201cSo if you take something like Beethoven\u2019s Eroica Symphony, that might conjure images of transcendence and overcoming adversity \u2013 whereas a piece like Eye of the Tiger has a guitar riff that comes at you like a boxer\u2019s jab and encourages you to match that intensity.\u201d You\u2019d also expect Survivor\u2019s masterful wordplay to play a part \u2013 but the role of lyrics is one of the least well-understood elements of music\u2019s effects. \u201cIn a study that we\u2019ve recently completed, but not yet published, we asked volunteers to pick their favourite music for a weightlifting effort, then asked them to listen to either a regular or instrumental version,\u201d says Ballman. \u201cWe didn\u2019t really see any differences in actual performance, but people enjoyed the session more and were more motivated, if they were listening to the lyrical version.\u201d \u201cDuring our formative years, we tend to form quite secure bonds with certain music and lyrics that we personally find meaningful,\u201d says Karageorghis. \u201cAnd so a particular song can be very individual, but there can also be pieces of music that through peer group influence or sheer cultural impact can have a powerful bearing on our psychology. It\u2019s really about matching the person to the situation, the intensity and the mode of exercise.\u201d All of this brings us to the crucial point that playlists, personal trainers and spin instructors often miss: workout music works much better if you actually like it. \u201cTo get the most out of your training you need to actually like what you\u2019re listening to,\u201d says Ballman. \u201cWe\u2019ve published around 15 papers now, which show that if you don\u2019t like the music being played, you perform worse \u2013 in some cases worse than you would with no music at all.\u201d In fact, maybe the most important thing music can do is make the entire experience of working out more enjoyable \u2013 independent of any personal bests you set or aching legs you experience. That\u2019s crucial, because enjoying workouts might be the best way to make them a permanent part of your life. \u201cUntil fairly recently, scientists were trying to apply a form of science known as cognitivism to getting people engaged in physical activity \u2013 asking them to think about the benefits,\u201d explains Karageorghis. \u201cBut there\u2019s a scientific movement towards promoting hedonism as a more modern approach to getting people to habitually engage in physical activity \u2013 the core of that is fundamentally making sure they enjoy what they\u2019re doing and music can play a huge part in that.\u201d With this in mind, maybe the best thing any coach can do is cater to their clientele: not just to hype them up, but to keep them coming back. It\u2019s an approach that\u2019s paying off for a new breed of music-centric fitness classes that tailor their tunes to the work rate required. \u201cYou have to know when to go slow and when to go high,\u201d says Sophie Ritchie, creator of ballet-inspired workout Disco Barre. \u201cWe play a mix of underground disco, house, boogie, funk, pop, Balearic, Italo and acid \u2013 if you can do it right, people forget how hard they\u2019re working.\u201d Other trainers take recommendations directly from their trainees. \u201cMy clients are all of a certain age and my playlists tend to be based on music from when they were younger,\u201d says Feel Good Fitness coach Susannah Simmons. \u201cIt helps motivate them and also gets conversation going \u2013 while newer music tends to have the opposite effect. It\u2019s important to remember it\u2019s about them, not you.\u201d So you just need to find a class that lets you listen to Metallica\u2019s One and you\u2019re sorted? Perhaps not: some research suggests that overfamiliarity can mute the buzz any one song gives you. \u201cI look at familiarity with music as a sort of inverted-U principle,\u201d says Stork. \u201cYou\u2019re probably not going to get to an optimal state to work out from hearing a piece of music once or twice, but once you\u2019ve heard something on the radio a thousand times, it\u2019s not going to elicit the same emotional response any more. So there may be a kind of sweet spot.\u201d There\u2019s one final wrinkle here, which is the question of whether there are times it\u2019s better to turn off the music \u2013 or leave the headphones at home entirely. \u201cIf your goal is to keep an easy pace or complete a recovery run, music could get in the way,\u201d says Brady Holmer, a researcher at examine.com and sub-three-hour marathon runner. \u201cHeadphones can remove the feedback from your steps and your breathing rate, so you might not perceive effort correctly. Listening to songs that motivate you or with a tempo that\u2019s too fast can also push you to run faster than you\u2019d like. I save my music playlists for hard or fast workouts and listen to podcasts or audiobooks \u2013 if anything at all \u2013 for my easy runs.\u201d For most workouts, then, keep things fairly simple: choose music you like, keep the rhythms simple and the tempo moderately high. Save a few favourite songs for tougher efforts \u2013 in theory, you\u2019ll come to associate them with the fun and endorphin rush of a good workout. Above all, remember that maybe the most powerful thing music can do isn\u2019t push you to do a bit better in one individual workout, but keep you coming back again and again.", "summary": "<p>Finding tunes with a tempo and rhythm to match your heart rate can help you  keep the pace when you exercise \u2013 and make it more enjoyable</p><p>Anyone who\u2019s ever hefted a dumbbell or laced up a running shoe understands that music, on some level, makes the process more enjoyable.

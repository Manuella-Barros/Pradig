{"id": 231339988, "title": "Tories Pledge to \u2018Reverse\u2019 Outer London ULEZ and Block Wales-Style 20MPH Limits", "text": "Roads chiefs will block blanket 20mph zones and scrap outer London\u2019s Ultra Low Emission Zone (ULEZ) if the Conservatives are re-elected. Top Tories would table a \u201cBacking Drivers Bill,\u201d which they say would \u201cprotect drivers from the draconian policies of local Labour politicians,\u201d the party said in a statement. With General Election campaigns underway, Transport Secretary Mark Harper said: \u201cWe will reverse Sadiq Khan\u2019s unfair ULEZ expansion and rule out any blanket 20-mile-an-hour zones because we are on the drivers\u2019 side. And we will rule out any pay-per-mile road tax to keep costs for drivers down. \u201cThere\u2019s a clear choice at this election\u2014Labour who will continue to penalise drivers or the Conservatives who will back drivers.\u201d Prime Minister Rishi Sunak took aim at Labour leaders in Westminster and Cardiff Bay, who he accused of launching a \u201cwar on drivers.\u201d Drivers of the most polluting vehicles must pay a \u00a312.50 daily charge if they use almost any road within Greater London, on top of any tolls or the inner London Congestion Charge. Drivers of ULEZ-compliant vehicles do not have to pay the fee. According to Mayor of London figures from October last year, 95 percent of vehicles on the capital\u2019s roads are \u201ccompliant with clean air standards\u201d\u2014up from 39 percent in 2017. Imperial College London, commissioned by City Hall, found that \u201ctoxic air\u201d contributed to around 4,000 premature deaths in the capital. But the policy proved controversial when Labour Mayor of London Sadiq Khan fronted its expansion to cover outer London boroughs last year\u2014into areas such as Bromley, Croydon, Heathrow Airport, and Wembley. It previously covered the area between the A406 North Circular and A205 South Circular roads. Vandals are known to have damaged ULEZ cameras and signage, while anti-ULEZ protesters have gathered on several occasions in Parliament Square, Trafalgar Square, and Strand. The Welsh Government reduced the restricted roads \u201cdefault\u201d speed from 30mph to 20mph in December last year, in built-up areas including villages, towns, and cities. Labour\u2019s Cabinet Secretary for Transport, Ken Skates, \u201cis undertaking a programme of listening\u201d between April and July this year, according to the Welsh Government, and will produce new policy guidance for the autumn. \u201cWe still believe that 20mph is right, but we want to make sure we are getting the right speeds on the right roads,\u201d a Welsh Government webpage reads.", "summary": "As part of their general election campaign, Mark Harper and Rishi Sunak have accused Labour of having launched a \u2018war on drivers\u2019.", "url": "https://www.theepochtimes.com/world/tories-pledge-to-reverse-outer-london-ulez-and-block-wales-style-20mph-limits-5665028", "image": "https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/06/08/id5665083-featureimage-300x180.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 16:40:20", "author": "Pa Media", "authors": ["Pa Media"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.292}

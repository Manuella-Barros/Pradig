announced a new ground and air assault in several refugee camps in central Gaza, pursuing Hamas militants it says have regrouped there.\n\nIt is the latest instance of troops sweeping back into sections of the Gaza Strip they have previously attacked.\n\nWitnesses and hospital officials said the pre-dawn strike hit the al-Sardi School, run by the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees known by the acronym UNRWA.\n\nThe school was filled with Palestinians who had fled Israeli offensives and bombardment in northern Gaza, they said.\n\nAyman Rashed, a man displaced from Gaza City who was sheltering at the school, said the missiles hit classrooms on the second and third floor where families were sheltering.\n\nThe Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in the nearby town of Deir al-Balah received at least 33 dead from the strike, including 14 children and nine women, according to hospital records and an Associated Press reporter at the hospital.\n\nAnother strike on a house overnight killed six people, according to the records.\n\nBoth strikes occurred in Nuseirat.\n\nMohammed al-Kareem, a displaced Palestinian sheltering near the hospital, described chaotic scenes outside the facility.\n\nHe said vehicles arrived one after the other, as distressed people rushed wounded people into the emergency department.\n\nFootage showed bodies wrapped in blankets or plastic bags being laid out in lines in the courtyard of the hospital, which was largely dark as staff try to conserve limited fuel for electricity.\n\nMr Al-Kareem said he saw people searching for their

the second and third floor where it claimed militants were located.\n\nIt said it took steps before the strike \"to reduce the risk of harming uninvolved civilians ... including conducting aerial

unaware of civilian casualties from the strike.\n\nUNRWA schools across Gaza have functioned as shelters since the start of the war, which has driven most of the territory's population of 2.3 million Palestinians from their homes.\n\nIsrael launched its campaign in Gaza after Hamas's October 7 terrorist attack into Israel, in which militants killed some 1,200 people and took another 250 hostage.\n\nIsrael's offensive has killed at least 36,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and civilians in its figures.\n\nIsrael blames civilian deaths on Hamas because it positions fighters, tunnels and rocket launchers in residential areas.\n\nThe US has thrown its weight behind a phased ceasefire and hostage release outlined by President Joe Biden last week.\n\nBut Israel says it won't end the war without destroying Hamas, while the militant group is demanding a lasting ceasefire and the full withdrawal of Israeli forces.\n\nThe Israeli military said on Wednesday local time that forces were operating \"both above and below ground\" in eastern parts of Deir al-Balah and the Bureij refugee camp in central

The Israeli military said Hamas militants were operating from within the school.\n\nThe strike came after the military announced a new ground and air assault in several refugee camps in central Gaza, pursuing Hamas militants it says have regrouped there. It's the latest instance of troops sweeping back into sections of the Gaza Strip they have previously invaded, underscoring the resilience of the militant group despite Israel's nearly eight-month onslaught in the territory.\n\nWitnesses and hospital officials said the predawn strike hit the al-Sardi School, run by the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees known by the acronym UNRWA. The school was filled with Palestinians who had fled Israeli offensives and bombardment in northern Gaza, they said.\n\nAyman Rashed, a man displaced from Gaza City who was sheltering at the school, said the missiles hit classrooms on the second and third floor where families were sheltering. He said he helped carry out five dead, including an old man and two children, one with his head shattered open. \"It was dark, with no electricity, and we struggled to get out the victims,\" Rashed said.\n\nThe Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in the nearby town of Deir al-Balah received at least 33 dead from the strike, including 14 children and nine women, according to hospital records and an Associated Press reporter at the hospital. Another strike on a house overnight killed six people, according to the records. Both strikes occurred in Nuseirat, one of several built-up refugee camps in Gaza dating to the 1948 war surrounding Israel's creation, when hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were driven from their homes in what became the new state.\n\nMohammed al-Kareem, a displaced Palestinian sheltering near the hospital, described chaotic scenes outside the facility. He said vehicles arrived one after the other, as distressed people rushed wounded people into the emergency department. Videos circulating online appeared to show several wounded people being treated on the floor of the hospital, a common scene in Gaza's overwhelmed medical wards.\n\nFootage showed bodies wrapped in blankets or plastic bags being laid out in lines in the courtyard of the hospital, which was largely dark as staff try to conserve limited fuel for electricity. Al-Kareem said he saw people searching for their loved ones among bodies, and that one woman kept asking medical workers to open the wraps on the bodies to see if her son was inside.\n\n\"The situation is tragic,\" he said.\n\nThe Israeli military said Hamas had embedded a \"compound\" within the school and that Hamas and Islamic Jihad militants inside were using it as a shelter where they were planning attacks against Israeli troops, though it did not immediately offer evidence.

The hospital, which was treating some 700 wounded and sick people before the latest strikes, said Wednesday that one of its two electrical generators had stopped working, threatening its ability to keep operating ventilators and incubators for premature babies.\n\nIsrael has routinely launched airstrikes in all parts of Gaza since the start of the war and has carried out massive ground operations in the territory's two largest cities, Gaza City and Khan Younis, that left much of them in ruins.\n\nThe military waged an offensive earlier this year for several weeks in Bureij and several other nearby refugee camps in central Gaza.\n\nTroops pulled out of the Jabaliya camp in northern Gaza last Friday after weeks of fighting caused widespread destruction. First responders have recovered the bodies of 360 people, mostly women and children, killed during the battles.\n\nIsrael sent troops into Rafah in May in what it said was a limited incursion, but those forces are now operating in central parts of Gaza's southernmost city. More than 1 million people have fled Rafah since the start of the operation, with many heading toward central Gaza.\n\nMagdy reported from Cairo.\n\nFollow AP's coverage at

Hamas-run media had earlier reported a higher toll from the strike on the school.\n\nThe Israeli military said Thursday its fighter jets struck the school run by the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees, known by the acronym UNRWA. The Israeli military claimed, without immediately offering evidence, that Hamas and the Islamic Jihad used the school as cover for their operations.\n\nUNRWA schools across Gaza have functioned as shelters since the start of the war, which has displaced most of the territory's population of 2.3 million Palestinians.\n\n\"Before the strike, a number of steps were taken to reduce the risk of harming uninvolved civilians during the strike, including conducting aerial surveillance, and additional intelligence information,\" the Israeli military said.\n\nBoth strikes occurred in Nuseirat, one of several built-up refugee camps in Gaza dating back to the 1948 war surrounding Israel's creation, when hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were driven from their homes in what became the new state.\n\nThe latest war began with Hamas' Oct. 7 attack into Israel, in which militants killed some 1,200 people and took another 250 hostage. Israel's offensive has killed at least 36,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and civilians in its figures.\n\nThe military said Wednesday that forces were operating \"both above and below ground\" in eastern parts of Deir al-Balah and the Bureij refugee camp in central Gaza. It said the operation began with airstrikes on militant infrastructure, after which troops began a \"targeted daylight operation\" in both areas.\n\nDoctors Without Borders said at least 70 bodies and 300 wounded people, mostly women and children, were brought to a hospital in central Gaza on Tuesday and Wednesday after a wave of Israeli strikes.\n\nThe international charity said Wednesday in a post on X that Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir al-Balah is struggling to treat \"a huge influx of patients, many of them arriving with severe burns, shrapnel wounds, fractures, and other traumatic injuries.\"\n\nIsrael has routinely launched airstrikes in all parts of Gaza since the start of the war and has carried out massive ground operations in the territory's two largest cities, Gaza City and Khan Younis, that left much of them in ruins.\n\nThe military waged an offensive earlier this year for several weeks in Bureij and several other nearby refugee camps in central Gaza.\n\nTroops pulled out of the Jabaliya camp in northern Gaza last Friday after weeks of fighting caused widespread destruction. First responders have recovered the bodies of 360 people, mostly women and children, killed during the battles.\n\nIsrael sent troops into Rafah last month in what it said was a limited incursion, but those forces are now operating in central parts of Gaza's southernmost city. More than 1 million people have fled Rafah since the start of the operation, with many heading toward central Gaza.", "source": {"uri": "santamariatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Santa Maria

The school was filled with Palestinians who had fled Israeli offensives and bombardment in northern Gaza, they said.\n\nAyman Rashed, a man displaced from Gaza City who was sheltering at the school, said the missiles hit classrooms on the second and third floor where families were sheltering.\n\nThe Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in the nearby town of Deir al-Balah received at least 33 dead from the strike, including 14 children and nine women, according to hospital records and an Associated Press reporter at the hospital.\n\nAnother strike on a house overnight killed six people, according to the records. Both strikes occurred in Nuseirat, one of several built-up refugee camps in Gaza dating to the 1948 war surrounding Israel's creation, when hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were driven from their homes in what became the new state.\n\nOnline footage showed bodies wrapped in blankets or plastic bags being laid out in lines in the courtyard of the hospital, which was largely dark as staff try to conserve limited fuel for electricity.\n\nMohammed al-Kareem, a displaced Palestinian sheltering near the hospital, said he saw people searching for their loved ones among the bodies, adding: \"The situation is tragic.\"\n\nThe Israeli military said Hamas had embedded a \"compound\" in the school and that Hamas and Islamic Jihad militants inside were using it as a shelter where they were planning attacks against Israeli troops.\n\nIt released a photo of the school, pointing to classrooms on the second and third floor where it claimed militants were located.\n\nIt said it took steps before the strike \"to reduce the risk of harming uninvolved civilians... including conducting aerial surveillance, and additional intelligence information\".\n\nUNRWA schools across Gaza have functioned as shelters since the start of the war, which has driven most of the territory's population of 2.3 million Palestinians from their homes.\n\nIsrael launched its campaign in Gaza after Hamas's October 7 attack into Israel, in which militants killed 1,200 people and took another 250 hostage.\n\nIsrael's offensive has killed at least 36,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and civilians in its figures.\n\nIsrael blames civilian deaths on Hamas because it positions fighters, tunnels and rocket launchers in residential areas.\n\nThe US has thrown its weight behind a phased ceasefire and hostage release outlined by President Joe Biden last week, but Israel says it will not end the war without destroying Hamas, while the militant group is demanding a lasting ceasefire and the full withdrawal of Israeli forces.\n\nThe military said on Wednesday that forces were operating \"both above and below ground\" in eastern parts of Deir al-Balah and the Bureij refugee camp in central Gaza.

Military claims it was being used by Hamas", "body": "DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) -- An Israeli strike early Thursday on a school sheltering displaced Palestinians in central Gaza killed more than 30 people, including 23 women and children, according to local health officials. The Israeli military said Hamas militants were operating from within the school.\n\nThe strike came after the military announced a new ground and air assault in several refugee camps in central Gaza, pursuing Hamas militants it says have regrouped there. It's the latest instance of troops sweeping back into sections of the Gaza Strip they have previously invaded, underscoring the resilience of the militant group despite Israel's nearly eight-month onslaught in the territory.\n\nWitnesses and hospital officials said the predawn strike hit the al-Sardi School, run by the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees known by the acronym UNRWA. The school was filled with Palestinians who had fled Israeli offensives and bombardment in northern Gaza, they said.\n\nAyman Rashed, a man displaced from Gaza City who was sheltering at the school, said the missiles hit classrooms on the second and third floor where families were sheltering. He said he helped carry out five dead, including an old man and two children, one with his head shattered open. \"It was dark, with no electricity, and we struggled to get out the victims,\" Rashed said.\n\nThe Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in the nearby town of Deir al-Balah received at least 33 dead from the strike, including 14 children and nine women, according to hospital records and an Associated Press reporter at the hospital. Another strike on a house overnight killed six people, according to the records. Both strikes occurred in Nuseirat, one of several built-up refugee camps in Gaza dating to the 1948 war surrounding Israel's creation, when hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were driven from their homes in what became the new state.\n\nMohammed al-Kareem, a displaced Palestinian sheltering near the hospital, described chaotic scenes outside the facility. He said vehicles arrived one after the other, as distressed people rushed wounded people into the emergency department. Videos circulating online appeared to show several wounded people being treated on the floor of the hospital, a common scene in Gaza's overwhelmed medical wards.\n\nFootage showed bodies wrapped in blankets or plastic bags being laid out in lines in the courtyard of the hospital, which was largely dark as staff try to conserve limited fuel for electricity. Al-Kareem said he saw people searching for their loved ones among bodies, and that one woman kept asking medical workers to open the wraps on the bodies to see if her son was inside.\n\n\"The situation is tragic,\" he said.\n\nThe Israeli military said Hamas had embedded a \"compound\" within the school and that Hamas and Islamic Jihad militants inside were using it as a shelter where they were planning attacks against Israeli troops, though it did not immediately offer evidence. It released a photo of the school, pointing to classrooms on the second and third floor where it claimed militants were located.\n\nIt said it took steps before the strike \"to reduce the risk of harming uninvolved civilians ... including conducting aerial surveillance, and additional intelligence information.\"\n\nUNRWA schools across Gaza have functioned as shelters since the start of the war, which has driven most of the territory's population of 2.3 million Palestinians from their homes.\n\nIsrael launched its campaign in Gaza after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack into Israel, in which militants killed some 1,200 people and took another 250 hostage. Israel's offensive has killed at least 36,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and civilians in its figures.\n\nIsrael blames civilian deaths on Hamas because it positions fighters, tunnels and rocket launchers in residential areas.\n\nThe United States has thrown its weight behind a phased cease-fire and hostage release outlined by President Joe Biden last week. But Israel says it won't end the war without destroying Hamas, while the militant group is demanding a lasting cease-fire and the full withdrawal of Israeli forces.\n\nThe military said Wednesday that forces were operating \"both above and below ground\" in eastern parts of Deir al-Balah and the Bureij refugee camp in central Gaza. It said the operation began with airstrikes on militant infrastructure, after which troops began a \"targeted daylight operation\" in both areas.\n\nDoctors Without Borders said at least 70 bodies and 300 wounded people, mostly women and children, were brought to a hospital in central Gaza on Tuesday and Wednesday after a wave of Israeli strikes.\n\nThe international charity said Wednesday in a post on X that Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital is struggling to treat \"a huge influx of patients, many of them arriving with severe burns, shrapnel wounds, fractures, and other traumatic injuries.\"\n\nGaza's health system has nearly collapsed through almost eight months of war. The hospital, which was treating some 700 wounded and sick people before the latest strikes, said Wednesday that one of its two electrical generators had stopped working, threatening its ability to keep operating ventilators and incubators for premature babies.\n\nIsrael has routinely launched airstrikes in all parts of Gaza since the start of the war and has carried out massive ground operations in the territory's two largest cities, Gaza City and Khan Younis, that left much of them in ruins.\n\nThe military waged an offensive earlier this year for several weeks in Bureij and several other nearby refugee camps in central Gaza.\n\nTroops pulled out of the Jabaliya camp in northern Gaza last Friday after weeks of fighting caused widespread destruction. First responders have recovered the bodies of 360 people, mostly women and children, killed during the battles.\n\nIsrael sent troops into Rafah in May in what it said was a limited incursion, but those forces are now operating in central parts of Gaza's southernmost city. More than 1 million people have fled Rafah since the start of the operation, with many heading toward central Gaza.\n\nMagdy reported from Cairo.\n\nFollow AP's coverage at

The latest operations appear to mark a widening of Israel's nearly eight-month offensive, launched after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack.\n\nThe Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir al-Balah received at least 30 bodies from the strike on the school and another six from a separate strike on a home, according to hospital records and an Associated Press reporter at the hospital. Hamas-run media had earlier reported a higher toll from the strike on the school.\n\nThe Israeli military said its fighter jets struck the school run by the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees, known by the acronym UNRWA.

Israel's offensive has killed at least 36,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and civilians in its figures.\n\nThe United States has thrown its weight behind a phased cease-fire and hostage release outlined by President Joe Biden last week. But Israel says it won't end the war without destroying Hamas, while the militant group is demanding a lasting cease-fire and the full withdrawal of Israeli forces.\n\nThe military said Wednesday that forces were operating \"both above and below ground\" in eastern parts of Deir al-Balah and the Bureij refugee camp in central Gaza. It said the operation began with airstrikes on militant infrastructure, after which troops began a \"targeted daylight operation\" in both areas.\n\nDoctors Without Borders said at least 70 bodies and 300 wounded people, mostly women and children, were brought to a hospital in central Gaza on Tuesday and Wednesday after a wave of Israeli strikes.\n\nThe international charity said Wednesday in a post on X that Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital is struggling to treat \"a huge influx of patients, many of them arriving with severe burns, shrapnel wounds, fractures, and other traumatic injuries.\"\n\nGaza's health system has nearly collapsed through almost eight months of war. The hospital, which was treating some 700 wounded and sick people before the latest strikes, said Wednesday that one of its two electrical generators had stopped working, threatening its ability to keep operating ventilators and incubators for premature babies.\n\nIsrael has routinely launched airstrikes in all parts of Gaza since the start of the war and has carried out massive ground operations in the territory's two largest cities, Gaza City and Khan Younis, that left much of them in ruins.\n\nThe military waged an offensive earlier this year for several weeks in Bureij and several other nearby refugee camps in central Gaza.\n\nTroops pulled out of the Jabaliya camp in northern Gaza last Friday after weeks of fighting caused widespread destruction. First responders have recovered the bodies of 360 people, mostly women and children, killed during the battles.\n\nIsrael sent troops into Rafah last month in what it said was a limited incursion, but those forces are now operating in central parts of Gaza's southernmost city. More than 1 million people have fled Rafah since the start of the operation, with many heading toward central Gaza.\n\nMagdy reported from Cairo.\n\nFollow AP's coverage at

The Israeli military said that Hamas militants were operating from within the school.\n\nIt was the latest instance of mass casualties among Palestinians trying to find refuge as Israel expands its offensives in the Gaza Strip. A day earlier, the military announced a a new ground and air assault in central Gaza, pursuing Hamas militants it says have regrouped there. Troops repeatedly have swept back into sections of the Gaza Strip they have previously invaded, underscoring the resilience of the militant group despite Israel's nearly eight-month onslaught in the territory.\n\nWitnesses and hospital officials said the predawn strike hit the al-Sardi School, run by the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees known by the acronym UNRWA. The school was filled with Palestinians who had fled Israeli offensives and bombardment in northern Gaza, they said.\n\nAyman Rashed, a man displaced from Gaza City who was sheltering at the school, said the missiles hit classrooms on the second and third floor where families were sheltering. He said he helped carry out five dead, including an old man and two children, one with his head shattered open. \"It was dark, with no electricity, and we struggled to get out the victims,\" Rashed said.\n\nCasualties from school strike arrived at the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in nearby Deir al-Balah, which had already been overwhelmed by a stream of constant ambulances since the central Gaza incursion began 24 hours earlier, said Omar al-Derawi, a photographer working for the hospital. Videos circulating online appeared to show several wounded people being treated on the floor of the hospital, a common scene in Gaza's overwhelmed medical wards. Electricity in much of the hospital is out because staff are rationing fuel supplies for the generator.\n\n\"You can't walk in the hospital -- there's so many people. Women from the victims' families are massed in the hallways, crying,\" he said.\n\nHospital records and an Associated Press reporter at the hospital recorded at least 33 dead from the strike, including 14 children and nine women. Another strike on a house overnight killed six people, according to the records. Both strikes occurred in Nuseirat, one of several built-up refugee camps in Gaza dating to the 1948 war surrounding Israel's creation, when hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were driven from their homes in what became the new state.\n\nFootage showed bodies wrapped in blankets or plastic bags being laid out in lines in the courtyard of the hospital. Mohammed al-Kareem, a displaced Palestinian sheltering near the hospital, said he saw people searching for their loved ones among bodies, and that one woman kept asking medical workers to open the wraps on the bodies to see if her son was inside.\n\n\"The situation is tragic,\" he said.\n\nThe Israeli military said Hamas had embedded a \"compound\" within the school and that Hamas and Islamic Jihad militants inside were using it as a shelter where they were planning attacks against Israeli troops, though it didn't immediately offer evidence. It released a photo of the school, pointing to classrooms on the second and third floor where it claimed militants were located.\n\nIt said it took steps before the strike \"to reduce the risk of harming uninvolved civilians ... including conducting aerial surveillance, and additional intelligence information.\"\n\nUNRWA schools across Gaza have functioned as shelters since the start of the war, which has driven most of the territory's population of 2.3 million Palestinians from their homes.\n\nLast week, Israeli strikes hit near an UNRWA facility in the southern city of Rafah, saying they were targeting Hamas militants. An inferno that followed ripped through tents nearby housing displaced families , killing at least 45 people. The deaths triggered international outrage, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the fire was the result of a \"tragic mishap.\" The military said the fire may have been caused by secondary explosions. The cause of the explosions has not been determined.\n\nIsrael sent troops into Rafah in early May in what it said was a limited incursion, but those forces are now operating in central parts of the city. More than 1 million people have fled Rafah since the start of the operation, scattering across southern and central Gaza into new tent camps or crowding into schools and homes.\n\nIsrael launched its campaign in Gaza after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack into Israel, in which militants killed some 1,200 people and took another 250 hostage. Israel's offensive has killed at least 36,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and civilians in its figures.\n\nIsrael blames civilian deaths on Hamas because it positions fighters, tunnels and rocket launchers in residential areas.\n\nThe United States has thrown its weight behind a phased cease-fire and hostage release outlined by President Joe Biden last week. But Israel says it won't end the war without destroying Hamas, while the militant group is demanding a lasting cease-fire and the full withdrawal of Israeli forces.\n\nFar-right members of Netanyahu's government have threatened to bring down the coalition if he signs onto a cease-fire deal. On Wednesday, National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, a leading hard-liner, spoke at an annual march through Jerusalem's Old City, saying, \"We are delivering a message from here to Hamas: Jerusalem is ours. Damascus Gate is ours\" -- referring to a main gate into the Arab-majority section of the city -- \"And with God's help total victory is ours.\"\n\nThe annual march commemorates \"Jerusalem Day,\" which marks Israel's capture of east Jerusalem, including the Old City and its holy sites sacred to Jews, Christians and Muslims, in the 1967 Middle East war.\n\nIsrael has routinely launched airstrikes in all parts of Gaza since the start of the war and has carried out massive ground operations in the territory's two largest cities, Gaza City and Khan Younis, that left much of them in ruins.\n\nThe military waged an offensive earlier this year for several weeks in Bureij and several other nearby refugee camps in central Gaza.\n\nTroops pulled out of the Jabaliya camp in northern Gaza last Friday after weeks of fighting caused widespread destruction.

An Israeli strike early Thursday on a school sheltering displaced Palestinians in central Gaza killed more than 30 people, including 23 women and children, according to local health officials. The Israeli military said that Hamas militants were operating from within the school. (AP Photo/Jehad Alshrafi)\n\nDEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) -- An Israeli strike earlier today on a school sheltering displaced Palestinians in central Gaza killed more than 30 people, including 23 women and children, according to local health officials. The Israeli military said that Hamas militants were operating from within the school.\n\nIt was the latest instance of mass casualties among Palestinians trying to find refuge as Israel expands its offensive. A day earlier, the military announced a new ground and air assault in central Gaza, pursuing Hamas militants it says have regrouped there. Troops repeatedly have swept back into parts of the Gaza Strip they have previously invaded, underscoring the resilience of the militant group despite Israel's nearly eight-month onslaught.\n\nWitnesses and hospital officials said the predawn strike hit the al-Sardi School, run by the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees known by the acronym UNRWA. The school was filled with Palestinians who had fled Israeli operations and bombardment in northern Gaza, they said.\n\nAyman Rashed, a man displaced from Gaza City who was sheltering at the school, said the missiles hit classrooms on the second and third floor where families were sheltering. He said he helped carry out five dead, including an old man and two children, one with his head shattered open. \"It was dark, with no electricity, and we struggled to get out the victims,\" Rashed said.\n\nCasualties from school strike arrived at the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in nearby Deir al-Balah, which had already been overwhelmed by a stream of constant ambulances since the central Gaza incursion began 24 hours earlier, said Omar al-Derawi, a photographer working for the hospital.\n\nVideos circulating online appeared to show several wounded people being treated on the floor of the hospital, a common scene in Gaza's overwhelmed medical wards. Electricity in much of the hospital is out because staff are rationing fuel supplies for the generator.\n\n\"You can't walk in the hospital -- there's so many people. Women from the victims' families are massed in the hallways, crying,\" he said.\n\nHospital records and an Associated Press reporter at the hospital recorded at least 33 dead from the strike, including 14 children and nine women. Another strike on a house overnight killed six people, according to the records. Both strikes occurred in Nuseirat, one of several built-up refugee camps in Gaza dating to the 1948 war surrounding Israel's creation, when hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were driven from their homes in what became the new state.\n\nFootage showed bodies wrapped in blankets or plastic bags being laid out in lines in the courtyard of the hospital. Mohammed al-Kareem, a displaced Palestinian sheltering near the hospital, said he saw people searching for their loved ones among bodies, and that one woman kept asking medical workers to open the wraps on the bodies to see if her son was inside.\n\n\"The situation is tragic,\" he said.\n\nPhilippe Lazzarini, the commissioner-general of UNRWA, said in a post on X that 6,000 people were sheltering in the school when it was hit without prior warning. He said UNRWA was unable to verify claims that armed groups were inside.\n\nAn Israeli military spokesman, Lt. Col. Peter Lerner, said that the army wasn't aware of any civilian casualties in the strike. He said that intelligence indicated that militants had used the school compound to orchestrate some of the attacks on Oct. 7 and that at least 20 militants there were using it currently as a \"staging realm\" to launch attacks on Israeli soldiers. The military gave no evidence for its claims and released a photo of the school, pointing to classrooms on the second and third floor where it claimed militants were located.\n\nThe military said it took steps before the strike \"to reduce the risk of harming uninvolved civilians ... including conducting aerial surveillance, and additional intelligence information.\"\n\nUNRWA schools across Gaza have functioned as shelters since the start of the war, which has driven most of the territory's population of 2.3 million Palestinians from their homes.\n\nLast week, Israeli strikes hit near an UNRWA facility in the southern city of Rafah, saying they were targeting Hamas militants. An inferno ripped through tents nearby housing displaced families , killing at least 45 people. The deaths triggered international outrage, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the fire was the result of a \"tragic mishap.\" The military said the fire may have been caused by secondary explosions. The cause of the explosions has not been determined.\n\nIsrael sent troops into Rafah in early May in what it said was a limited incursion, but those forces are now operating in central parts of the city. More than 1 million people have fled Rafah since the start of the operation, scattering across southern and central Gaza into new tent camps or crowding into schools and homes.\n\nIsrael launched its campaign in Gaza after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack into Israel, in which militants killed some 1,200 people and took another 250 hostage. Israel's offensive has killed at least 36,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and civilians in its figures.\n\nIsrael blames civilian deaths on Hamas because it positions fighters, tunnels and rocket launchers in residential areas.\n\nThe United States has thrown its weight behind a phased cease-fire and hostage release outlined by President Joe Biden last week. But Israel says it won't end the war without destroying Hamas, while the militant group is demanding a lasting cease-fire and the full withdrawal of Israeli forces.\n\nFar-right members of Netanyahu's government have threatened to bring down the coalition if he signs onto a cease-fire deal.\n\nIsrael has routinely launched airstrikes in all parts of Gaza since the start of the war and has carried out massive ground operations in the territory's two largest cities, Gaza City and Khan Younis, that left much of them in ruins.\n\nThe military waged an offensive earlier this year for several weeks in Bureij and several other nearby refugee camps in central Gaza.\n\nTroops pulled out of the Jabaliya camp in northern Gaza last Friday after weeks of fighting caused widespread destruction. First responders have recovered the bodies of 360 people, mostly women and children, killed during the battles.", "source": {"uri": "vindy.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Vindicator"},

It said the operation began with air strikes on militant infrastructure, after which troops began a \"targeted daylight operation\" in both areas.\n\nDoctors Without Borders said at least 70 bodies and 300 wounded people, mostly women and children, were taken to a hospital in central Gaza on Tuesday and Wednesday after a wave of Israeli strikes.\n\nThe international charity said on Wednesday that Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital was struggling to treat \"a huge influx of patients, many of them arriving with severe burns, shrapnel wounds, fractures, and other traumatic injuries\".", "source":

The Israeli military said that Hamas militants were operating from within the school.\n\nIt was the latest instance of mass casualties among Palestinians trying to find refuge as Israel expands its offensives in the Gaza Strip. A day earlier, the military announced a new ground and air assault in central Gaza, pursuing Hamas militants it says have regrouped there. Troops repeatedly have swept back into sections of the Gaza Strip they have previously invaded, underscoring the resilience of the militant group despite Israel's nearly eight-month onslaught in the territory.\n\nWitnesses and hospital officials said the predawn strike hit the al-Sardi School, run by the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees known by the acronym UNRWA. The school was filled with Palestinians who had fled Israeli offensives and bombardment in northern Gaza, they said.\n\nAyman Rashed, a man displaced from Gaza City who was sheltering at the school, said the missiles hit classrooms on the second and third floor where families were sheltering. He said he helped carry out five dead, including an old man and two children, one with his head shattered open. \"It was dark, with no electricity, and we struggled to get out the victims,\" Rashed said.\n\nCasualties from school strike arrived at the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in nearby Deir al-Balah, which had already been overwhelmed by a stream of constant ambulances since the central Gaza incursion began 24 hours earlier, said Omar al-Derawi, a photographer working for the hospital. Videos circulating online appeared to show several wounded people being treated on the floor of the hospital, a common scene in Gaza's overwhelmed medical wards. Electricity in much of the hospital is out because staff are rationing fuel supplies for the generator.\n\n\"You can't walk in the hospital -- there's so many people. Women from the victims' families are massed in the hallways, crying,\" he said.\n\nHospital records and an Associated Press reporter at the hospital recorded at least 33 dead from the strike, including 14 children and nine women. Another strike on a house overnight killed six people, according to the records. Both strikes occurred in Nuseirat, one of several built-up refugee camps in Gaza dating to the 1948 war surrounding Israel's creation, when hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were driven from their homes in what became the new state.\n\nFootage showed bodies wrapped in blankets or plastic bags being laid out in lines in the courtyard of the hospital. Mohammed al-Kareem, a displaced Palestinian sheltering near the hospital, said he saw people searching for their loved ones among bodies, and that one woman kept asking medical workers to open the wraps on the bodies to see if her son was inside.\n\n\"The situation is tragic,\" he said.\n\nAn Israeli military spokesman, Lt. Col. Peter Lerner, said that the army wasn't aware of any civilian casualties in the strike. He said that intelligence indicated that militants had used the school compound to orchestrate some of the attacks on Oct. 7 and that at least 20 militants there were using it currently as a \"staging realm\" to launch attacks on Israeli soldiers. The military gave no evidence for its claims and released a photo of the school, pointing to classrooms on the second and third floor where it claimed militants were located.\n\nThe miltiary said it took steps before the strike \"to reduce the risk of harming uninvolved civilians ... including conducting aerial surveillance, and additional intelligence information.\"\n\nUNRWA schools across Gaza have functioned as shelters since the start of the war, which has driven most of the territory's population of 2.3 million Palestinians from their homes.\n\nLast week, Israeli strikes hit near an UNRWA facility in the southern city of Rafah, saying they were targeting Hamas militants. An inferno that followed ripped through tents nearby housing displaced families , killing at least 45 people. The deaths triggered international outrage, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the fire was the result of a \"tragic mishap.\" The military said the fire may have been caused by secondary explosions. The cause of the explosions has not been determined.\n\nIsrael sent troops into Rafah in early May in what it said was a limited incursion, but those forces are now operating in central parts of the city. More than 1 million people have fled Rafah since the start of the operation, scattering across southern and central Gaza into new tent camps or crowding into schools and homes.\n\nIsrael launched its campaign in Gaza after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack into Israel, in which militants killed some 1,200 people and took another 250 hostage. Israel's offensive has killed at least 36,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and civilians in its figures.\n\nIsrael blames civilian deaths on Hamas because it positions fighters, tunnels and rocket launchers in residential areas.\n\nThe United States has thrown its weight behind a phased cease-fire and hostage release outlined by President Joe Biden last week. But Israel says it won't end the war without destroying Hamas, while the militant group is demanding a lasting cease-fire and the full withdrawal of Israeli forces.\n\nFar-right members of Netanyahu's government have threatened to bring down the coalition if he signs onto a cease-fire deal. On Wednesday, National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, a leading hard-liner, spoke at an annual march through Jerusalem's Old City, saying, \"We are delivering a message from here to Hamas: Jerusalem is ours. Damascus Gate is ours\" -- referring to a main gate into the Arab-majority section of the city -- \"And with God's help total victory is ours.\"\n\nThe annual march commemorates \"Jerusalem Day,\" which marks Israel's capture of east Jerusalem, including the Old City and its holy sites sacred to Jews, Christians and Muslims, in the 1967 Middle East war.\n\nIsrael has routinely launched airstrikes in all parts of Gaza since the start of the war and has carried out massive ground operations in the territory's two largest cities, Gaza City and Khan Younis, that left much of them in ruins.\n\nThe military waged an offensive earlier this year for several weeks in Bureij and several other nearby refugee camps in central Gaza.\n\nTroops pulled out of the Jabaliya camp in northern Gaza last Friday after weeks of fighting caused widespread destruction. First responders have recovered the bodies of 360 people, mostly women and children, killed during the battles.\n\nSamy Magdy reported from Cairo.\n\nFollow AP's coverage at

(AP Photo/Abdel Kareem Hana)DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) - An Israeli strike on a school in central Gaza that the military said was being used as a \"Hamas compound\" killed at least 30 people, according to local health officials. The overnight strike, which came after the military said it was launching new air and ground operations in central Gaza and and international medical group reported soaring casualties from strikes in the area. The Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir al-Balah received at least 30 bodies from the strike on the school and another six from a separate strike on a home, according to hospital records and an Associated Press reporter at the hospital. Hamas-run media had earlier reported a higher toll from the strike on the school. The Israeli military said Thursday its fighter jets struck the school run by the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees, known by the acronym UNRWA. The Israeli military claimed, without immediately offering evidence, that Hamas and the Islamic Jihad used the school as cover for their operations. UNRWA schools across Gaza have functioned as shelters since the start of the war, which has displaced most of the territory's population of 2.3 million Palestinians. \"Before the strike, a number of steps were taken to reduce the risk of harming uninvolved civilians during the strike, including conducting aerial surveillance, and additional intelligence information,\"\u009d the Israeli military said. Both strikes occurred in Nuseirat, one of several built-up refugee camps in Gaza dating back to the 1948 war surrounding Israel's creation, when hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were driven from their homes in what became the new state. The latest war began with Hamas' Oct. 7 attack into Israel, in which militants killed some 1,200 people and took another 250 hostage. Israel's offensive has killed at least 36,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and civilians in its figures. The military said Wednesday that forces were operating \"both above and below ground\"\u009d in eastern parts of Deir al-Balah and the Bureij refugee camp in central Gaza. It said the operation began with airstrikes on militant infrastructure, after which troops began a \"targeted daylight operation\"\u009d in both areas. Doctors Without Borders said at least 70 bodies and 300 wounded people, mostly women and children, were brought to a hospital in central Gaza on Tuesday and Wednesday after a wave of Israeli strikes. The international charity said Wednesday in a post on X that Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir al-Balah is struggling to treat \"a huge influx of patients, many of them arriving with severe burns, shrapnel wounds, fractures, and other traumatic injuries.\"\u009d Israel has routinely launched airstrikes in all parts of Gaza since the start of the war and has carried out massive ground operations in the territory's two largest cities, Gaza City and Khan Younis, that left much of them in ruins. The military waged an offensive earlier this year for several weeks in Bureij and several other nearby refugee camps in central Gaza. Troops pulled out of the Jabaliya camp in northern Gaza last Friday after weeks of fighting caused widespread destruction. First responders have recovered the bodies of 360 people, mostly women and children, killed during the battles. Israel sent troops into Rafah last month in what it said was a limited incursion, but those forces are now operating in central parts of Gaza's southernmost city. More than 1 million people have fled Rafah since the start of the operation, with many heading toward central Gaza.", "source": {"uri": "medicinehatnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Medicine Hat News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "canadian_press@medicinehatnews.com", "name": "Canadian Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNRWA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "UNRWA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deir_al-Balah", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Deir al-Balah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Deir al-Balah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuseirat_Camp", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nuseirat Camp"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nuseirat Camp"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugee_camp", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Refugee camp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_Mount", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Temple Mount"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_Islamic_Jihad", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian Islamic Jihad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_refugees", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian refugees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_System", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Nations System"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internally_displaced_person", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Internally displaced person"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airstrike", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Airstrike"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Health,_Palestine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Health, Palestine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M\u00e9decins_Sans_Fronti\u00e8res", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_City", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureij", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bureij"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bureij"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jabalia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jabalia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jabalia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khan_Yunis", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Khan Yunis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Khan Yunis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafah", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 49}], "image": "https://medicinehatnews.com/wp-content/uploads/cp/20240605230648-6661322e86a65799deebe33fjpeg.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9626324", "eventUri": "eng-9626324", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 1988, "textEnd": 1994}], "sentiment": -0.2941176470588235, "wgt": 201, "relevance": 1}

The army claimed that the school housed a \"Hamas compound\".\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces posted on X, \"several Hamas and Islamic Jihad terrorists who embedded themselves inside of an @UNRWA school.\" It said, \"IAF fighter jets conducted a precise strike on a Hamas compound embedded inside the school in the area of Nuseirat.\"\n\nThe Israeli military said that Hamas militants were operating from within the school. It further claimed that the terrorists belonged to the Nukhba Forces and participated in the October 7 massacre. It added that several terrorists were \"eliminated\" in the strike.\n\nThe IDF also clarified that a number of steps were taken to reduce the risk of harming uninvolved civilians during the strike,\" including conducting aerial surveillance, and additional intelligence information.\"\n\nAt least 33 were reported dead from the strike, including 14 children and nine women, news agency the Associated Press reported while citing the hospital records. Another strike on a house overnight killed six people, according to the records.\n\nBoth strikes occurred in Nuseirat, one of several built-up refugee camps in Gaza dating to the 1948 war surrounding Israel's creation, when hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were driven from their homes in what became the new state.\n\nWitnesses and hospital officials said the predawn strike hit the al-Sardi School, run by the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees known by the acronym UNRWA. The school was filled with Palestinians who had fled Israeli offensives and bombardment in northern Gaza, they said.\n\nAyman Rashed, a man displaced from Gaza City who was sheltering at the school, said the missiles hit classrooms on the second and third floor where families were sheltering.\n\nHe said he helped carry out five dead, including an old man and two children, one with his head shattered open. \"It was dark, with no electricity, and we struggled to get out the victims,\" Rashed was quoted by the Associated Press as saying.\n\nCasualties from school strike arrived at the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in nearby Deir al-Balah, which had already been overwhelmed by a stream of constant ambulances since the central Gaza incursion began 24 hours earlier, said Omar al-Derawi, a photographer working for the hospital.\n\nVideos circulating online appeared to show several wounded people being treated on the floor of the hospital, a common scene in Gaza's overwhelmed medical wards. Electricity in much of the hospital is out because staff are rationing fuel supplies for the generator.\n\nAn Israeli military spokesman, Lt Col Peter Lerner, said that the army wasn't aware of any civilian casualties in the strike. He said that intelligence indicated that militants had used the school compound to orchestrate some of the attacks on October 7 and that at least 20 militants there were using it currently as a \"staging realm\" to launch attacks on Israeli soldiers.\n\nThe military gave no evidence for its claims and released a photo of the school, pointing to classrooms on the second and third floor where it claimed militants were located.\n\nThe military said it took steps before the strike \"to reduce the risk of harming uninvolved civilians ... including conducting aerial surveillance, and additional intelligence information.\"\n\nUNRWA schools across Gaza have functioned as shelters since the start of the war, which has driven most of the territory's population of 2.3 million Palestinians from their homes.\n\nIsrael sent troops into Rafah in early May in what it said was a limited incursion, but those forces are now operating in central parts of the city. More than 1 million people have fled Rafah since the start of the operation, scattering across southern and central Gaza into new tent camps or crowding into schools and homes.\n\nIsrael launched its campaign in Gaza after Hamas' October 7 attack into Israel, in which militants killed some 1,200 people and took another 250 hostage. Israel's offensive has killed at least 36,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and civilians in its figures.\n\nIsrael blames civilian deaths on Hamas because it positions fighters, tunnels and rocket launchers in residential areas.\n\nIsrael has routinely launched airstrikes in all parts of Gaza since the start of the war and has carried out massive ground operations in the territory's two largest cities, Gaza City and Khan Younis, that left much of them in ruins.\n\nThe military waged an offensive earlier this year for several weeks in Bureij and several other nearby refugee camps in central Gaza.\n\nTroops pulled out of the Jabaliya camp in northern Gaza last Friday after weeks of fighting caused widespread destruction. First responders have recovered the bodies of 360 people, mostly women and children, killed during the battles.\n\nYou are on Mint! India's #1 news destination (Source: Press Gazette).

Abdel Kareem Hana/Associated Press\n\nDEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip -- An Israeli strike early Thursday on a school sheltering displaced Palestinians in central Gaza killed more than 30 people, including 23 women and children, according to local health officials. The Israeli military said that Hamas militants were operating from within the school.\n\nIt was the latest instance of mass casualties among Palestinians trying to find refuge as Israel expands its offensives in the Gaza Strip. A day earlier, the military announced a new ground and air assault in central Gaza, pursuing Hamas militants it says have regrouped there. Troops repeatedly have swept back into sections of the Gaza Strip they have previously invaded, underscoring the resilience of the militant group despite Israel's nearly eight-month onslaught in the territory.\n\nWitnesses and hospital officials said the predawn strike hit the al-Sardi School, run by the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees known by the acronym UNRWA. The school was filled with Palestinians who had fled Israeli offensives and bombardment in northern Gaza, they said.\n\nAyman Rashed, a man displaced from Gaza City who was sheltering at the school, said the missiles hit classrooms on the second and third floor where families were sheltering.

Electricity in much of the hospital is out because staff are rationing fuel supplies for the generator.\n\n\"You can't walk in the hospital - there's so many people. Women from the victims' families are massed in the hallways, crying,\" he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHospital records and an Associated Press reporter at the hospital recorded at least 33 dead from the strike, including 14 children and nine women. Another strike on a house overnight killed six people, according to the records. Both strikes occurred in Nuseirat, one of several built-up refugee camps in Gaza dating to the 1948 war surrounding Israel's creation, when hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were driven from their homes in what became the new state.\n\nFootage showed bodies wrapped in blankets or plastic bags being laid out in lines in the courtyard of the hospital. Mohammed al-Kareem, a displaced Palestinian sheltering near the hospital, said he saw people searching for their loved ones among bodies, and that one woman kept asking medical workers to open the wraps on the bodies to see if her son was inside.\n\n\"The situation is tragic,\" he said.\n\nPalestinians look at the aftermath of the Israeli strike on a U.N.-run school that killed dozens of people Thursday in the Nusseirat refugee camp in the Gaza Strip. Abdel Kareem Hana/Associated Press\n\nAn Israeli military spokesman, Lt. Col. Peter Lerner, said that the army wasn't aware of any civilian casualties in the strike. He said that intelligence indicated that militants had used the school compound to orchestrate some of the attacks on Oct. 7 and that at least 20 militants there were using it currently as a \"staging realm\" to launch attacks on Israeli soldiers.

An inferno that followed ripped through tents nearby housing displaced families, killing at least 45 people. The deaths triggered international outrage, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the fire was the result of a \"tragic mishap.\" The military said the fire may have been caused by secondary explosions. The cause of the explosions has not been determined.\n\nIsrael sent troops into Rafah in early May in what it said was a limited incursion, but those forces are now operating in central parts of the city. More than 1 million people have fled Rafah since the start of the operation, scattering across southern and central Gaza into new tent camps or crowding into schools and homes.\n\nIsrael launched its campaign in Gaza after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack into Israel, in which militants killed some 1,200 people and took another 250 hostage.

But Israel says it won't end the war without destroying Hamas, while the militant group is demanding a lasting cease-fire and the full withdrawal of Israeli forces.\n\nFar-right members of Netanyahu's government have threatened to bring down the coalition if he signs onto a cease-fire deal. On Wednesday, National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, a leading hard-liner, spoke at an annual march through Jerusalem's Old City, saying, \"We are delivering a message from here to Hamas: Jerusalem is ours. Damascus Gate is ours\" - referring to a main gate into the Arab-majority section of the city - \"And with God's help total victory is ours.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe annual march commemorates \"Jerusalem Day,\" which marks Israel's capture of east Jerusalem, including the Old City and its holy sites sacred to Jews, Christians and Muslims, in the 1967 Middle East war.\n\nIsrael has routinely launched airstrikes in all parts of Gaza since the start of the war and has carried out massive ground operations in the territory's two largest cities, Gaza City and Khan Younis, that left much of them in ruins.\n\nThe military waged an offensive earlier this year for several weeks in Bureij and several other nearby refugee camps in central Gaza.\n\nTroops pulled out of the Jabaliya camp in northern Gaza last Friday after weeks of fighting caused widespread destruction.

The Israeli military said that Hamas militants were operating from within the school.\n\nIt was the latest instance of mass casualties among Palestinians trying to find refuge as Israel expands its offensives in the Gaza Strip. A day earlier, the military announced a new ground and air assault in central Gaza, pursuing Hamas militants it says have regrouped there. Troops repeatedly have swept back into sections of the Gaza Strip they have previously invaded, underscoring the resilience of the militant group despite Israel's nearly eight-month onslaught in the territory.\n\nWitnesses and hospital officials said the predawn strike hit the al-Sardi School, run by the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees known by the acronym UNRWA. The school was filled with Palestinians who had fled Israeli offensives and bombardment in northern Gaza, they said.\n\nAyman Rashed, a man displaced from Gaza City who was sheltering at the school, said the missiles hit classrooms on the second and third floor where families were sheltering. He said he helped carry out five dead, including an old man and two children, one with his head shattered open. \"It was dark, with no electricity, and we struggled to get out the victims,\" Rashed said.\n\nCasualties from school strike arrived at the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in nearby Deir al-Balah, which had already been overwhelmed by a stream of constant ambulances since the central Gaza incursion began 24 hours earlier, said Omar al-Derawi, a photographer working for the hospital. Videos circulating online appeared to show several wounded people being treated on the floor of the hospital, a common scene in Gaza's overwhelmed medical wards. Electricity in much of the hospital is out because staff are rationing fuel supplies for the generator.\n\n\"You can't walk in the hospital -- there's so many people. Women from the victims' families are massed in the hallways, crying,\" he said.\n\nHospital records and an Associated Press reporter at the hospital recorded at least 33 dead from the strike, including 14 children and nine women. Another strike on a house overnight killed six people, according to the records. Both strikes occurred in Nuseirat, one of several built-up refugee camps in Gaza dating to the 1948 war surrounding Israel's creation, when hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were driven from their homes in what became the new state.\n\nFootage showed bodies wrapped in blankets or plastic bags being laid out in lines in the courtyard of the hospital. Mohammed al-Kareem, a displaced Palestinian sheltering near the hospital, said he saw people searching for their loved ones among bodies, and that one woman kept asking medical workers to open the wraps on the bodies to see if her son was inside.\n\n\"The situation is tragic,\" he said.\n\nAn Israeli military spokesman, Lt. Col. Peter Lerner, said that the army wasn't aware of any civilian casualties in the strike. He said that intelligence indicated that militants had used the school compound to orchestrate some of the attacks on Oct. 7 and that at least 20 militants there were using it currently as a \"staging realm\" to launch attacks on Israeli soldiers. The military gave no evidence for its claims and released a photo of the school, pointing to classrooms on the second and third floor where it claimed militants were located.\n\nThe military said it took steps before the strike \"to reduce the risk of harming uninvolved civilians ... including conducting aerial surveillance, and additional intelligence information.\"\n\nUNRWA schools across Gaza have functioned as shelters since the start of the war, which has driven most of the territory's population of 2.3 million Palestinians from their homes.\n\nLast week, Israeli strikes hit near an UNRWA facility in the southern city of Rafah, saying they were targeting Hamas militants. An inferno that followed ripped through tents nearby housing displaced families , killing at least 45 people. The deaths triggered international outrage, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the fire was the result of a \"tragic mishap.\" The military said the fire may have been caused by secondary explosions. The cause of the explosions has not been determined.\n\nIsrael sent troops into Rafah in early May in what it said was a limited incursion, but those forces are now operating in central parts of the city. More than 1 million people have fled Rafah since the start of the operation, scattering across southern and central Gaza into new tent camps or crowding into schools and homes.\n\nIsrael launched its campaign in Gaza after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack into Israel, in which militants killed some 1,200 people and took another 250 hostage. Israel's offensive has killed at least 36,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and civilians in its figures.\n\nIsrael blames civilian deaths on Hamas because it positions fighters, tunnels and rocket launchers in residential areas.\n\nThe United States has thrown its weight behind a phased cease-fire and hostage release outlined by President Joe Biden last week. But Israel says it won't end the war without destroying Hamas, while the militant group is demanding a lasting cease-fire and the full withdrawal of Israeli forces.\n\nFar-right members of Netanyahu's government have threatened to bring down the coalition if he signs onto a cease-fire deal. On Wednesday, National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, a leading hard-liner, spoke at an annual march through Jerusalem's Old City, saying, \"We are delivering a message from here to Hamas: Jerusalem is ours. Damascus Gate is ours\" -- referring to a main gate into the Arab-majority section of the city -- \"And with God's help total victory is ours.\"\n\nThe annual march commemorates \"Jerusalem Day,\" which marks Israel's capture of east Jerusalem, including the Old City and its holy sites sacred to Jews, Christians and Muslims, in the 1967 Middle East war.\n\nIsrael has routinely launched airstrikes in all parts of Gaza since the start of the war and has carried out massive ground operations in the territory's two largest cities, Gaza City and Khan Younis, that left much of them in ruins.\n\nThe military waged an offensive earlier this year for several weeks in Bureij and several other nearby refugee camps in central Gaza.\n\nTroops pulled out of the Jabaliya camp in northern Gaza last Friday after weeks of fighting caused widespread destruction. First responders have recovered the bodies of 360 people, mostly women and children, killed during the battles.\n\n___\n\nSamy Magdy reported from Cairo.\n\n___\n\nFollow AP's coverage at

It is a built-up Palestinian refugee camp in central Gaza dating back to the 1948 Arab-Israeli war.\n\nThe Israeli military published a graphic of the school, which clearly had 'UN' written on its roof. The graphic described the strikes targeting two areas of the building on its upper floors.\n\nThe war began with Hamas' October 7 attack inside Israel that killed at least 1,200 people with 250 others taken hostage.\n\nThe Israeli military campaign in the Gaza Strip has killed at least 36,000 Palestinians, with hundreds of others killed in operations in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.\n\nThe Israeli military said on Wednesday that forces were operating \"both above and below ground\" in eastern parts of Deir al-Balah and the Bureij refugee camp in central Gaza.\n\nIt said the operation began with airstrikes on militant infrastructure, after which troops began a \"targeted daylight operation\" in both areas.\n\nDoctors Without Borders said at least 70 bodies and 300 wounded people, mostly women and children, were brought to a hospital in central Gaza on Tuesday and Wednesday after a wave of Israeli strikes.\n\nThe international charity said on Wednesday in a post on X that Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir al-Balah is struggling to treat \"a huge influx of patients, many of them arriving with severe burns, shrapnel wounds, fractures, and other traumatic injuries\".\n\nIsrael has routinely launched airstrikes in all parts of Gaza since the start of the war and has carried out massive ground operations in the territory's two largest cities, Gaza City and Khan Younis, that left much of them in ruins\n\nThe military waged an offensive earlier this year for several weeks in Bureij and several other nearby refugee camps in central Gaza.\n\nTroops pulled out of the Jabaliya camp in northern Gaza last Friday after weeks of fighting caused widespread destruction.\n\nFirst responders have recovered the bodies of 360 people, mostly women and children, killed during the battles.\n\nIsrael sent troops into Rafah last month in what it said was a limited incursion, but those forces are now operating in central parts of Gaza's southernmost city.\n\nMore than one million people have fled Rafah since the start of the operation, with many heading towards central Gaza.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

The Israeli military said that Hamas militants were operating from within the school.\n\nIt was the latest instance of mass casualties among Palestinians trying to find refuge as Israel expands its offensives in the Gaza Strip. A day earlier, the military announced a a new ground and air assault in central Gaza, pursuing Hamas militants it says have regrouped there. Troops repeatedly have swept back into sections of the Gaza Strip they have previously invaded, underscoring the resilience of the militant group despite Israel's nearly eight-month onslaught in the territory.\n\nWitnesses and hospital officials said the predawn strike hit the al-Sardi School, run by the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees known by the acronym UNRWA. The school was filled with Palestinians who had fled Israeli offensives and bombardment in northern Gaza, they said.\n\nAyman Rashed, a man displaced from Gaza City who was sheltering at the school, said the missiles hit classrooms on the second and third floor where families were sheltering. He said he helped carry out five dead, including an old man and two children, one with his head shattered open. \"It was dark, with no electricity, and we struggled to get out the victims,\" Rashed said.\n\nCasualties from school strike arrived at the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in nearby Deir al-Balah, which had already been overwhelmed by a stream of constant ambulances since the central Gaza incursion began 24 hours earlier, said Omar al-Derawi, a photographer working for the hospital. Videos circulating online appeared to show several wounded people being treated on the floor of the hospital, a common scene in Gaza's overwhelmed medical wards. Electricity in much of the hospital is out because staff are rationing fuel supplies for the generator.\n\n\"You can't walk in the hospital -- there's so many people. Women from the victims' families are massed in the hallways, crying,\" he said.\n\nHospital records and an Associated Press reporter at the hospital recorded at least 33 dead from the strike, including 14 children and nine women. Another strike on a house overnight killed six people, according to the records. Both strikes occurred in Nuseirat, one of several built-up refugee camps in Gaza dating to the 1948 war surrounding Israel's creation, when hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were driven from their homes in what became the new state.\n\nFootage showed bodies wrapped in blankets or plastic bags being laid out in lines in the courtyard of the hospital. Mohammed al-Kareem, a displaced Palestinian sheltering near the hospital, said he saw people searching for their loved ones among bodies, and that one woman kept asking medical workers to open the wraps on the bodies to see if her son was inside.\n\n\"The situation is tragic,\" he said.\n\nThe Israeli military said Hamas had embedded a \"compound\" within the school and that Hamas and Islamic Jihad militants inside were using it as a shelter where they were planning attacks against Israeli troops, though it didn't immediately offer evidence. It released a photo of the school, pointing to classrooms on the second and third floor where it claimed militants were located.\n\nIt said it took steps before the strike \"to reduce the risk of harming uninvolved civilians ... including conducting aerial surveillance, and additional intelligence information.\"\n\nUNRWA schools across Gaza have functioned as shelters since the start of the war, which has driven most of the territory's population of 2.3 million Palestinians from their homes.\n\nLast week, Israeli strikes hit near an UNRWA facility in the southern city of Rafah, saying they were targeting Hamas militants. An inferno that followed ripped through tents nearby housing displaced families , killing at least 45 people. The deaths triggered international outrage, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the fire was the result of a \"tragic mishap.\" The military said the fire may have been caused by secondary explosions. The cause of the explosions has not been determined.\n\nIsrael sent troops into Rafah in early May in what it said was a limited incursion, but those forces are now operating in central parts of the city. More than 1 million people have fled Rafah since the start of the operation, scattering across southern and central Gaza into new tent camps or crowding into schools and homes.\n\nIsrael launched its campaign in Gaza after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack into Israel, in which militants killed some 1,200 people and took another 250 hostage. Israel's offensive has killed at least 36,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and civilians in its figures.\n\nIsrael blames civilian deaths on Hamas because it positions fighters, tunnels and rocket launchers in residential areas.\n\nThe United States has thrown its weight behind a phased cease-fire and hostage release outlined by President Joe Biden last week. But Israel says it won't end the war without destroying Hamas, while the militant group is demanding a lasting cease-fire and the full withdrawal of Israeli forces.\n\nFar-right members of Netanyahu's government have threatened to bring down the coalition if he signs onto a cease-fire deal. On Wednesday, National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, a leading hard-liner, spoke at an annual march through Jerusalem's Old City, saying, \"We are delivering a message from here to Hamas: Jerusalem is ours. Damascus Gate is ours\" -- referring to a main gate into the Arab-majority section of the city -- \"And with God's help total victory is ours.\"\n\nThe annual march commemorates \"Jerusalem Day,\" which marks Israel's capture of east Jerusalem, including the Old City and its holy sites sacred to Jews, Christians and Muslims, in the 1967 Middle East war.\n\nIsrael has routinely launched airstrikes in all parts of Gaza since the start of the war and has carried out massive ground operations in the territory's two largest cities, Gaza City and Khan Younis, that left much of them in ruins.\n\nThe military waged an offensive earlier this year for several weeks in Bureij and several other nearby refugee camps in central Gaza.\n\nTroops pulled out of the Jabaliya camp in northern Gaza last Friday after weeks of fighting caused widespread destruction. First responders have recovered the bodies of 360 people, mostly women and children, killed during the battles.\n\nSamy Magdy reported from Cairo.\n\nFollow AP's coverage at

The latest operations appear to mark a widening of Israel's nearly eight-month offensive, launched after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack.\n\nAlso read | UNICEF finds 90% of Gaza's children lack food needed for proper growth\n\nThe Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir al-Balah received at least 30 bodies from the strike on the school and another six from a separate strike on a home, according to hospital records and an Associated Press reporter at the hospital. Hamas-run media had earlier reported a higher toll from the strike on the school.\n\nThe Israeli military said its fighter jets struck the school run by the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees, known by the acronym UNRWA. The Israeli military claimed, without immediately offering evidence, that Hamas and the Islamic Jihad used the school as cover for their operations.\n\nUNRWA schools across Gaza have functioned as shelters since the start of the war, which has displaced most of the territory's population of 2.3 million Palestinians.\n\n\"Before the strike, a number of steps were taken to reduce the risk of harming uninvolved civilians during the strike, including conducting aerial surveillance, and additional intelligence information,\" the Israeli military said.\n\nBoth strikes occurred in Nuseirat, one of several built-up refugee camps in Gaza dating back to the 1948 war surrounding Israel's creation, when hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were driven from their homes in what became the new state.\n\nThe latest war began with Hamas' Oct. 7 attack into Israel, in which militants killed some 1,200 people and took another 250 hostage. Israel's offensive has killed at least 36,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and civilians in its figures.\n\nIsrael steps up military offensive in Gaza as US presses for ceasefire\n\nThe United States has thrown its weight behind a phased cease-fire and hostage release outlined by President Joe Biden last week. But Israel says it won't end the war without destroying Hamas, while the militant group is demanding a lasting cease-fire and the full withdrawal of Israeli forces.\n\nThe military said Wednesday that forces were operating \"both above and below ground\" in eastern parts of Deir al-Balah and the Bureij refugee camp in central Gaza. It said the operation began with airstrikes on militant infrastructure, after which troops began a \"targeted daylight operation\" in both areas.\n\nDoctors Without Borders said at least 70 bodies and 300 wounded people, mostly women and children, were brought to a hospital in central Gaza on Tuesday and Wednesday after a wave of Israeli strikes.\n\nThe international charity said Wednesday in a post on X that Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital is struggling to treat \"a huge influx of patients, many of them arriving with severe burns, shrapnel wounds, fractures, and other traumatic injuries.\"\n\nGaza's health system has nearly collapsed through almost eight months of war. The hospital, which was treating some 700 wounded and sick people before the latest strikes, said Wednesday that one of its two electrical generators had stopped working, threatening its ability to keep operating ventilators and incubators for premature babies.\n\nIsrael has routinely launched airstrikes in all parts of Gaza since the start of the war and has carried out massive ground operations in the territory's two largest cities, Gaza City and Khan Younis, that left much of them in ruins.\n\nThe military waged an offensive earlier this year for several weeks in Bureij and several other nearby refugee camps in central Gaza.\n\nTroops pulled out of the Jabaliya camp in northern Gaza last Friday after weeks of fighting caused widespread destruction. First responders have recovered the bodies of 360 people, mostly women and children, killed during the battles.\n\nIsrael sent troops into Rafah last month in what it said was a limited incursion, but those forces are now operating in central parts of Gaza's southernmost city. More than 1 million people have fled Rafah since the start of the operation, with many heading toward central Gaza.\n\nWatch | Israel's Rafah invasion | Explained Read Comments", "source": {"uri":

The Israeli military said that Hamas was operating from within the school.\n\nIt was the latest instance of mass casualties among Palestinians trying to find refuge as Israel expands its offensive. A day earlier, the military announced a new ground and air assault in central Gaza, pursuing Hamas fighters it says have regrouped there. Troops repeatedly have swept back into parts of the Gaza Strip they have previously invaded, underscoring the resilience of the group despite Israel's nearly eight-month onslaught.\n\nHamas has been designated as a terrorist organization by the United States, Canada and the European Union.\n\nWitnesses and hospital officials said the predawn strike hit the al-Sardi School, run by the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees known by the acronym UNRWA. The school was filled with Palestinians who had fled Israeli operations and bombardment in northern Gaza, they said.\n\nAyman Rashed, a man displaced from Gaza City who was sheltering at the school, said the missiles hit classrooms on the second and third floor where families were sheltering. He said he helped carry out five dead, including an old man and two children, one with his head shattered open. \"It was dark, with no electricity, and we struggled to get out the victims,\" Rashed said.\n\nCasualties from the school strike arrived at the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in nearby Deir al-Balah, which had already been overwhelmed by a stream of constant ambulances since the central Gaza incursion began 24 hours earlier, said Omar al-Derawi, a photographer working for the hospital.\n\nVideos circulating online appeared to show several wounded people being treated on the floor of the hospital, a common scene in Gaza's overwhelmed medical wards. Electricity in much of the hospital is out because staff are rationing fuel supplies for the generator.\n\n\"You can't walk in the hospital -- there's so many people. Women from the victims' families are massed in the hallways, crying,\" he said.\n\nHospital records and an Associated Press reporter at the hospital recorded at least 33 dead from the strike, including 14 children and nine women. Another strike on a house overnight killed six people, according to the records. Both strikes occurred in Nuseirat, one of several built-up refugee camps in Gaza dating to the 1948 war surrounding Israel's creation, when hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were driven from their homes in what became the new state.\n\nFootage showed bodies wrapped in blankets or plastic bags being laid out in lines in the courtyard of the hospital. Mohammed al-Kareem, a displaced Palestinian sheltering near the hospital, said he saw people searching for their loved ones among bodies, and that one woman kept asking medical workers to open the wraps on the bodies to see if her son was inside.\n\n\"The situation is tragic,\" he said.\n\nPhilippe Lazzarini, the commissioner-general of UNRWA, said in a post on X that 6,000 people were sheltering in the school when it was hit without prior warning. He said UNRWA was unable to verify claims that armed groups were inside.\n\nAn Israeli military spokesman, Lt. Col. Peter Lerner, said that the army wasn't aware of any civilian casualties in the strike. He said that intelligence indicated that combatants had used the school compound to orchestrate some of the attacks on Oct. 7 and that at least 20 fighters there were using it currently as a \"staging realm\" to launch attacks on Israeli soldiers. The military gave no evidence for its claims and released a photo of the school, pointing to classrooms on the second and third floor where it claimed combatants were located.\n\nThe military said it took steps before the strike \"to reduce the risk of harming uninvolved civilians ... including conducting aerial surveillance, and additional intelligence information.\"\n\nUNRWA schools across Gaza have functioned as shelters since the start of the war, which has driven most of the territory's population of 2.3 million Palestinians from their homes.\n\nLast week, Israeli strikes hit near an UNRWA facility in the southern city of Rafah, saying they were targeting Hamas. An inferno ripped through tents nearby housing displaced families , killing at least 45 people. The deaths triggered international outrage, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the fire was the result of a \"tragic mishap.\" The military said the fire may have been caused by secondary explosions. The cause of the explosions has not been determined.\n\nIsrael sent troops into Rafah in early May in what it said was a limited incursion, but those forces are now operating in central parts of the city. More than 1 million people have fled Rafah since the start of the operation, scattering across southern and central Gaza into new tent camps or crowding into schools and homes.\n\nIsrael launched its campaign in Gaza after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack into Israel, in which combatants killed some 1,200 people and took another 250 hostage. Israel's offensive has killed at least 36,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and civilians in its figures.\n\nIsrael blames civilian deaths on Hamas because it positions fighters, tunnels and rocket launchers in residential areas.\n\nThe United States has thrown its weight behind a phased cease-fire and hostage release outlined by President Joe Biden last week.

The school was filled with Palestinians who had fled Israeli offensives and bombardment in northern Gaza, they said.\n\nAyman Rashed, a man displaced from Gaza City who was sheltering at the school, said the missiles hit classrooms on the second and third floor where families were sheltering.\n\nThe Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in the nearby town of Deir al-Balah received at least 33 dead from the strike, including 14 children and nine women, according to hospital records and an Associated Press reporter at the hospital.\n\nAnother strike on a house overnight killed six people, according to the records. Both strikes occurred in Nuseirat, one of several built-up refugee camps in Gaza dating to the 1948 war surrounding Israel's creation, when hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were driven from their homes in what became the new state.\n\nOnline footage showed bodies wrapped in blankets or plastic bags being laid out in lines in the courtyard of the hospital, which was largely dark as staff try to conserve limited fuel for electricity.\n\nPalestinians mourn in front of the morgue of Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir al-Balah (Abdel Kareem Hana/AP)\n\nMohammed al-Kareem, a displaced Palestinian sheltering near the hospital, said he saw people searching for their loved ones among the bodies, adding: \"The situation is tragic.\"\n\nThe Israeli military said Hamas had embedded a \"compound\" in the school and that Hamas and Islamic Jihad militants inside were using it as a shelter where they were planning attacks against Israeli troops.\n\nIt released a photo of the school, pointing to classrooms on the second and third floor where it claimed militants were located.\n\nIt said it took steps before the strike \"to reduce the risk of harming uninvolved civilians... including conducting aerial surveillance, and additional intelligence information\".\n\nUNRWA schools across Gaza have functioned as shelters since the start of the war, which has driven most of the territory's population of 2.3 million Palestinians from their homes.\n\nIsrael launched its campaign in Gaza after Hamas's October 7 attack into Israel, in which militants killed 1,200 people and took another 250 hostage.\n\nDisplaced Palestinians inspect their tents destroyed by Israel\u00b4s bombardment of an UNRWA facility west of Rafah city (Jehad Alshrafi/AP)\n\nIsrael's offensive has killed at least 36,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and civilians in its figures.\n\nIsrael blames civilian deaths on Hamas because it positions fighters, tunnels and rocket launchers in residential areas.\n\nThe US has thrown its weight behind a phased ceasefire and hostage release outlined by President Joe Biden last week, but Israel says it will not end the war without destroying Hamas, while the militant group is demanding a lasting ceasefire and the full withdrawal of Israeli forces.\n\nThe military said on Wednesday that forces were operating \"both above and below ground\" in eastern parts of Deir al-Balah and the Bureij refugee camp in central Gaza. It said the operation began with air strikes on militant infrastructure, after which troops began a \"targeted daylight operation\" in both areas.\n\nDoctors Without Borders said at least 70 bodies and 300 wounded people, mostly women and children, were taken to a hospital in central Gaza on Tuesday and Wednesday after a wave of Israeli strikes.\n\nThe international charity said on Wednesday that Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital was struggling to treat \"a huge influx of patients, many of them arriving with severe burns, shrapnel wounds, fractures, and other traumatic injuries\".", "source":

An international medical charity had reported soaring casualties even before Thursday's strike.\n\nThe Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir al-Balah received at least 30 bodies from the strike on the school run by the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees -- known by the acronym UNRWA -- and another six from a separate strike on a home, according to hospital records and an Associated Press reporter at the hospital. Hamas-run TV had earlier reported a higher toll.\n\nMohammed al-Kareem, a displaced Palestinian sheltering near the hospital, described chaotic scenes outside the facility. He said vehicles arrived one after the other, as distressed people rushed wounded people into the emergency department. Videos circulating online appeared to show several wounded people being treated on the floor of the hospital, a common scene in Gaza's overwhelmed medical wards.\n\nLater, he saw people searching for their loved ones among bodies wrapped in white shrouds in the hospital courtyard. He said one woman kept asking medical workers to open them up to see if her son was inside.\n\n\"The situation is tragic,\" he said.\n\nThe Israeli military said its fighter jets struck the school that it claimed, without immediately offering evidence, that Hamas and the Islamic Jihad used as cover for their operations.\n\nUNRWA schools across Gaza have functioned as shelters since the start of the war, which has displaced most of the territory's population of 2.3 million Palestinians.\n\n\"Before the strike, a number of steps were taken to reduce the risk of harming uninvolved civilians during the strike, including conducting aerial surveillance, and additional intelligence information,\" the Israeli military said.\n\nBoth strikes occurred in Nuseirat, one of several built-up refugee camps in Gaza dating back to the 1948 war surrounding Israel's creation, when hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were driven from their homes in what became the new state.\n\nThe latest war began with Hamas' Oct. 7 attack into Israel, in which militants killed some 1,200 people and took another 250 hostage. Israel's offensive has killed at least 36,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and civilians in its figures.\n\nIsrael says it takes measures to avoid harming civilians and blames their deaths of Hamas because it positions fighters, tunnels and rocket launchers in residential areas. The military rarely comments on individual strikes, which often kill women and children.\n\nThe United States has thrown its weight behind a phased cease-fire and hostage release outlined by President Joe Biden last week. But Israel says it won't end the war without destroying Hamas, while the militant group is demanding a lasting cease-fire and the full withdrawal of Israeli forces.\n\nThe military said Wednesday that forces were operating \"both above and below ground\" in eastern parts of Deir al-Balah and the Bureij refugee camp in central Gaza. It said the operation began with airstrikes on militant infrastructure, after which troops began a \"targeted daylight operation\" in both areas.\n\nDoctors Without Borders said at least 70 bodies and 300 wounded people, mostly women and children, were brought to a hospital in central Gaza on Tuesday and Wednesday after a wave of Israeli strikes.\n\nThe international charity said Wednesday in a post on X that Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital is struggling to treat \"a huge influx of patients, many of them arriving with severe burns, shrapnel wounds, fractures, and other traumatic injuries.\"\n\nGaza's health system has nearly collapsed through almost eight months of war. The hospital, which was treating some 700 wounded and sick people before the latest strikes, said Wednesday that one of its two electrical generators had stopped working, threatening its ability to keep operating ventilators and incubators for premature babies.\n\nIsrael has routinely launched airstrikes in all parts of Gaza since the start of the war and has carried out massive ground operations in the territory's two largest cities, Gaza City and Khan Younis, that left much of them in ruins.\n\nThe military waged an offensive earlier this year for several weeks in Bureij and several other nearby refugee camps in central Gaza.\n\nTroops pulled out of the Jabaliya camp in northern Gaza last Friday after weeks of fighting caused widespread destruction. First responders have recovered the bodies of 360 people, mostly women and children, killed during the battles.\n\nIsrael sent troops into Rafah in May in what it said was a limited incursion, but those forces are now operating in central parts of Gaza's southernmost city. More than 1 million people have fled Rafah since the start of the operation, with many heading toward central Gaza.", "source": {"uri": "kion546.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KION546"},

The Israeli military said that Hamas militants were operating from within the school.\n\nIt was the latest instance of mass casualties among Palestinians trying to find refuge as Israel expands its offensive. A day earlier, the military announced a new ground and air assault in central Gaza, pursuing Hamas militants it says have regrouped there. Troops repeatedly have swept back into parts of the Gaza Strip they have previously invaded, underscoring the resilience of the militant group despite Israel's nearly eight-month onslaught.\n\nWitnesses and hospital officials said the predawn strike hit the al-Sardi School, run by the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees known by the acronym UNRWA. The school was filled with Palestinians who had fled Israeli operations and bombardment in northern Gaza, they said.\n\nAyman Rashed, a man displaced from Gaza City who was sheltering at the school, said the missiles hit classrooms on the second and third floor where families were sheltering. He said he helped carry out five dead, including an old man and two children, one with his head shattered open. \"It was dark, with no electricity, and we struggled to get out the victims,\" Rashed said.\n\nCasualties from school strike arrived at the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in nearby Deir al-Balah, which had already been overwhelmed by a stream of constant ambulances since the central Gaza incursion began 24 hours earlier, said Omar al-Derawi, a photographer working for the hospital.\n\nVideos circulating online appeared to show several wounded people being treated on the floor of the hospital, a common scene in Gaza's overwhelmed medical wards. Electricity in much of the hospital is out because staff are rationing fuel supplies for the generator.\n\n\"You can't walk in the hospital -- there's so many people. Women from the victims' families are massed in the hallways, crying,\" he said.\n\nHospital records and an Associated Press reporter at the hospital recorded at least 33 dead from the strike, including 14 children and nine women. Another strike on a house overnight killed six people, according to the records. Both strikes occurred in Nuseirat, one of several built-up refugee camps in Gaza dating to the 1948 war surrounding Israel's creation, when hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were driven from their homes in what became the new state.\n\nFootage showed bodies wrapped in blankets or plastic bags being laid out in lines in the courtyard of the hospital. Mohammed al-Kareem, a displaced Palestinian sheltering near the hospital, said he saw people searching for their loved ones among bodies, and that one woman kept asking medical workers to open the wraps on the bodies to see if her son was inside.\n\n\"The situation is tragic,\" he said.\n\nPhilippe Lazzarini, the commissioner-general of UNRWA, said in a post on X that 6,000 people were sheltering in the school when it was hit without prior warning. He said UNRWA was unable to verify claims that armed groups were inside.\n\nAn Israeli military spokesman, Lt. Col. Peter Lerner, said that the army wasn't aware of any civilian casualties in the strike. He said that intelligence indicated that militants had used the school compound to orchestrate some of the attacks on Oct. 7 and that at least 20 militants there were using it currently as a \"staging realm\" to launch attacks on Israeli soldiers. The military gave no evidence for its claims and released a photo of the school, pointing to classrooms on the second and third floor where it claimed militants were located.\n\nThe military said it took steps before the strike \"to reduce the risk of harming uninvolved civilians ... including conducting aerial surveillance, and additional intelligence information.\"\n\nUNRWA schools across Gaza have functioned as shelters since the start of the war, which has driven most of the territory's population of 2.3 million Palestinians from their homes.\n\nLast week, Israeli strikes hit near an UNRWA facility in the southern city of Rafah, saying they were targeting Hamas militants. An inferno ripped through tents nearby housing displaced families , killing at least 45 people. The deaths triggered international outrage, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the fire was the result of a \"tragic mishap.\" The military said the fire may have been caused by secondary explosions. The cause of the explosions has not been determined.\n\nIsrael sent troops into Rafah in early May in what it said was a limited incursion, but those forces are now operating in central parts of the city. More than 1 million people have fled Rafah since the start of the operation, scattering across southern and central Gaza into new tent camps or crowding into schools and homes.\n\nIsrael launched its campaign in Gaza after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack into Israel, in which militants killed some 1,200 people and took another 250 hostage. Israel's offensive has killed at least 36,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and civilians in its figures.\n\nIsrael blames civilian deaths on Hamas because it positions fighters, tunnels and rocket launchers in residential areas.\n\nThe United States has thrown its weight behind a phased cease-fire and hostage release outlined by President Joe Biden last week. But Israel says it won't end the war without destroying Hamas, while the militant group is demanding a lasting cease-fire and the full withdrawal of Israeli forces.\n\nFar-right members of Netanyahu's government have threatened to bring down the coalition if he signs onto a cease-fire deal.\n\nIsrael has routinely launched airstrikes in all parts of Gaza since the start of the war and has carried out massive ground operations in the territory's two largest cities, Gaza City and Khan Younis, that left much of them in ruins.\n\nThe military waged an offensive earlier this year for several weeks in Bureij and several other nearby refugee camps in central Gaza.\n\nTroops pulled out of the Jabaliya camp in northern Gaza last Friday after weeks of fighting caused widespread destruction.

Both strikes occurred in Nuseirat, one of several built-up refugee camps in Gaza dating to the 1948 war surrounding Israel's creation, when hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were driven from their homes in what became the new state.\n\nFootage showed bodies wrapped in blankets or plastic bags being laid out in lines in the courtyard of the hospital. Mohammed al-Kareem, a displaced Palestinian sheltering near the hospital, said he saw people searching for their loved ones among bodies, and that one woman kept asking medical workers to open the wraps on the bodies to see if her son was inside.\n\n\"The situation is tragic,\" he said.\n\nAn Israeli military spokesman, Lt. Col. Peter Lerner, said that the army wasn't aware of any civilian casualties in the strike. He said that intelligence indicated that Hamas had used the school compound to orchestrate some of the attacks on Oct. 7 and that at least 20 fighters there were using it currently as a \"staging realm\" to launch attacks on Israeli soldiers. The military gave no evidence for its claims and released a photo of the school, pointing to classrooms on the second and third floor where it claimed Hamas fighters were located.\n\nThe miltiary said it took steps before the strike \"to reduce the risk of harming uninvolved civilians ... including conducting aerial surveillance, and additional intelligence information.\"\n\nUNRWA schools across Gaza have functioned as shelters since the start of the war, which has driven most of the territory's population of 2.3 million Palestinians from their homes.\n\nLast week, Israeli strikes hit near an UNRWA facility in the southern city of Rafah, saying they were targeting Hamas fighters . An inferno that followed ripped through tents nearby housing displaced families , killing at least 45 people. The deaths triggered international outrage, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the fire was the result of a \"tragic mishap.\" The military said the fire may have been caused by secondary explosions. The cause of the explosions has not been determined.\n\nIsrael sent troops into Rafah in early May in what it said was a limited incursion, but those forces are now operating in central parts of the city. More than 1 million people have fled Rafah since the start of the operation, scattering across southern and central Gaza into new tent camps or crowding into schools and homes.\n\nIsrael launched its campaign in Gaza after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack into Israel, in which Hamas killed some 1,200 people and took another 250 hostage. Israel's offensive has killed at least 36,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and civilians in its figures.\n\nIsrael blames civilian deaths on Hamas because it positions fighters, tunnels and rocket launchers in residential areas.\n\nThe United States has thrown its weight behind a phased cease-fire and hostage release outlined by President Joe Biden last week. But Israel says it won't end the war without destroying Hamas, while the group is demanding a lasting cease-fire and the full withdrawal of Israeli forces.\n\nFar-right members of Netanyahu's government have threatened to bring down the coalition if he signs onto a cease-fire deal. On Wednesday, National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, a leading hard-liner, spoke at an annual march through Jerusalem's Old City, saying, \"We are delivering a message from here to Hamas: Jerusalem is ours.

He said he helped carry out five dead, including an old man and two children, one with his head shattered open. \"It was dark, with no electricity, and we struggled to get out the victims,\" Rashed said.\n\nCasualties from school strike arrived at the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in nearby Deir al-Balah, which had already been overwhelmed by a stream of constant ambulances since the central Gaza incursion began 24 hours earlier, said Omar al-Derawi, a photographer working for the hospital. Videos circulating online appeared to show several wounded people being treated on the floor of the hospital, a common scene in Gaza's overwhelmed medical wards. Electricity in much of the hospital is out because staff are rationing fuel supplies for the generator.\n\n\"You can't walk in the hospital -- there's so many people. Women from the victims' families are massed in the hallways, crying,\" he said.\n\nHospital records and an Associated Press reporter at the hospital recorded at least 33 dead from the strike, including 14 children and nine women. Another strike on a house overnight killed six people, according to the records. Both strikes occurred in Nuseirat, one of several built-up refugee camps in Gaza dating to the 1948 war surrounding Israel's creation, when hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were driven from their homes in what became the new state.\n\nFootage showed bodies wrapped in blankets or plastic bags being laid out in lines in the courtyard of the hospital. Mohammed al-Kareem, a displaced Palestinian sheltering near the hospital, said he saw people searching for their loved ones among bodies, and that one woman kept asking medical workers to open the wraps on the bodies to see if her son was inside.\n\n\"The situation is tragic,\" he said.\n\nAn Israeli military spokesman, Lt. Col. Peter Lerner, said that the army wasn't aware of any civilian casualties in the strike. He said that intelligence indicated that militants had used the school compound to orchestrate some of the attacks on Oct. 7 and that at least 20 militants there were using it currently as a \"staging realm\" to launch attacks on Israeli soldiers. The military gave no evidence for its claims and released a photo of the school, pointing to classrooms on the second and third floor where it claimed militants were located.\n\nThe military said it took steps before the strike \"to reduce the risk of harming uninvolved civilians ... including conducting aerial surveillance, and additional intelligence information.\"\n\nUNRWA schools across Gaza have functioned as shelters since the start of the war, which has driven most of the territory's population of 2.3 million Palestinians from their homes.\n\nLast week, Israeli strikes hit near an UNRWA facility in the southern city of Rafah, saying they were targeting Hamas militants. An inferno that followed ripped through tents nearby housing displaced families , killing at least 45 people. The deaths triggered international outrage, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the fire was the result of a \"tragic mishap.\" The military said the fire may have been caused by secondary explosions. The cause of the explosions has not been determined.\n\nIsrael sent troops into Rafah in early May in what it said was a limited incursion, but those forces are now operating in central parts of the city. More than 1 million people have fled Rafah since the start of the operation, scattering across southern and central Gaza into new tent camps or crowding into schools and homes.\n\nIsrael launched its campaign in Gaza after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack into Israel, in which militants killed some 1,200 people and took another 250 hostage. Israel's offensive has killed at least 36,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and civilians in its figures.\n\nIsrael blames civilian deaths on Hamas because it positions fighters, tunnels and rocket launchers in residential areas.\n\nThe United States has thrown its weight behind a phased cease-fire and hostage release outlined by President Joe Biden last week. But Israel says it won't end the war without destroying Hamas, while the militant group is demanding a lasting cease-fire and the full withdrawal of Israeli forces.\n\nFar-right members of Netanyahu's government have threatened to bring down the coalition if he signs onto a cease-fire deal. On Wednesday, National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, a leading hard-liner, spoke at an annual march through Jerusalem's Old City, saying, \"We are delivering a message from here to Hamas: Jerusalem is ours. Damascus Gate is ours\" -- referring to a main gate into the Arab-majority section of the city -- \"And with God's help total victory is ours.\"\n\nThe annual march commemorates \"Jerusalem Day,\" which marks Israel's capture of east Jerusalem, including the Old City and its holy sites sacred to Jews, Christians and Muslims, in the 1967 Middle East war.\n\nIsrael has routinely launched airstrikes in all parts of Gaza since the start of the war and has carried out massive ground operations in the territory's two largest cities, Gaza City and Khan Younis, that left much of them in ruins.\n\nThe military waged an offensive earlier this year for several weeks in Bureij and several other nearby refugee camps in central Gaza.\n\nTroops pulled out of the Jabaliya camp in northern Gaza last Friday after weeks of fighting caused widespread destruction. First responders have recovered the bodies of 360 people, mostly women and children, killed during the battles.\n\nSamy Magdy reported from Cairo.\n\nFollow AP's coverage at

An international medical charity had reported soaring casualties even before Thursday's strike.\n\nThe Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir al-Balah received at least 30 bodies from the strike on the school run by the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees -- known by the acronym UNRWA -- and another six from a separate strike on a home, according to hospital records and an Associated Press reporter at the hospital. Hamas-run TV had earlier reported a higher toll.\n\nMohammed al-Kareem, a displaced Palestinian sheltering near the hospital, described chaotic scenes outside the facility. He said vehicles arrived one after the other, as distressed people rushed wounded people into the emergency department. Videos circulating online appeared to show several wounded people being treated on the floor of the hospital, a common scene in Gaza's overwhelmed medical wards.\n\nLater, he saw people searching for their loved ones among bodies wrapped in white shrouds in the hospital courtyard.

It said the operation began with airstrikes on militant infrastructure, after which troops began a \"targeted daylight operation\" in both areas.\n\nDoctors Without Borders said at least 70 bodies and 300 wounded people, mostly women and children, were brought to a hospital in central Gaza on Tuesday and Wednesday after a wave of Israeli strikes.\n\nThe international charity said Wednesday in a post on X that Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital is struggling to treat \"a huge influx of patients, many of them arriving with severe burns, shrapnel wounds, fractures, and other traumatic injuries.\"\n\nGaza's health system has nearly collapsed through almost eight months of war. The hospital, which was treating some 700 wounded and sick people before the latest strikes, said Wednesday that one of its two electrical generators had stopped working, threatening its ability to keep operating ventilators and incubators for premature babies.\n\nIsrael has routinely launched airstrikes in all parts of Gaza since the start of the war and has carried out massive ground operations in the territory's two largest cities, Gaza City and Khan Younis, that left much of them in ruins.\n\nThe military waged an offensive earlier this year for several weeks in Bureij and several other nearby refugee camps in central Gaza.\n\nTroops pulled out of the Jabaliya camp in northern Gaza last Friday after weeks of fighting caused widespread destruction.

The Israeli military said that Hamas militants were operating from within the school.\n\nIt was the latest instance of mass casualties among Palestinians trying to find refuge as Israel expands its offensives in the Gaza Strip. A day earlier, the military announced a new ground and air assault in central Gaza, pursuing Hamas militants it says have regrouped there. Troops repeatedly have swept back into sections of the Gaza Strip they have previously invaded, underscoring the resilience of the militant group despite Israel's nearly eight-month onslaught in the territory.\n\nWitnesses and hospital officials said the predawn strike hit the al-Sardi School, run by the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees known by the acronym UNRWA. The school was filled with Palestinians who had fled Israeli offensives and bombardment in northern Gaza, they said.\n\nAyman Rashed, a man displaced from Gaza City who was sheltering at the school, said the missiles hit classrooms on the second and third floor where families were sheltering. He said he helped carry out five dead, including an old man and two children, one with his head shattered open. \"It was dark, with no electricity, and we struggled to get out the victims,\" Rashed said.\n\nCasualties from school strike arrived at the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in nearby Deir al-Balah, which had already been overwhelmed by a stream of constant ambulances since the central Gaza incursion began 24 hours earlier, said Omar al-Derawi, a photographer working for the hospital. Videos circulating online appeared to show several wounded people being treated on the floor of the hospital, a common scene in Gaza's overwhelmed medical wards. Electricity in much of the hospital is out because staff are rationing fuel supplies for the generator.\n\n\"You can't walk in the hospital -- there's so many people. Women from the victims' families are massed in the hallways, crying,\" he said.\n\nHospital records and an Associated Press reporter at the hospital recorded at least 33 dead from the strike, including 14 children and nine women. Another strike on a house overnight killed six people, according to the records. Both strikes occurred in Nuseirat, one of several built-up refugee camps in Gaza dating to the 1948 war surrounding Israel's creation, when hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were driven from their homes in what became the new state.\n\nFootage showed bodies wrapped in blankets or plastic bags being laid out in lines in the courtyard of the hospital. Mohammed al-Kareem, a displaced Palestinian sheltering near the hospital, said he saw people searching for their loved ones among bodies, and that one woman kept asking medical workers to open the wraps on the bodies to see if her son was inside.\n\n\"The situation is tragic,\" he said.\n\nAn Israeli military spokesman, Lt. Col. Peter Lerner, said that the army wasn't aware of any civilian casualties in the strike. He said that intelligence indicated that militants had used the school compound to orchestrate some of the attacks on Oct. 7 and that at least 20 militants there were using it currently as a \"staging realm\" to launch attacks on Israeli soldiers. The military gave no evidence for its claims and released a photo of the school, pointing to classrooms on the second and third floor where it claimed militants were located.\n\nThe miltiary said it took steps before the strike \"to reduce the risk of harming uninvolved civilians ... including conducting aerial surveillance, and additional intelligence information.\"\n\nUNRWA schools across Gaza have functioned as shelters since the start of the war, which has driven most of the territory's population of 2.3 million Palestinians from their homes.\n\nLast week, Israeli strikes hit near an UNRWA facility in the southern city of Rafah, saying they were targeting Hamas militants. An inferno that followed ripped through tents nearby housing displaced families , killing at least 45 people. The deaths triggered international outrage, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the fire was the result of a \"tragic mishap.\" The military said the fire may have been caused by secondary explosions. The cause of the explosions has not been determined.\n\nIsrael sent troops into Rafah in early May in what it said was a limited incursion, but those forces are now operating in central parts of the city. More than 1 million people have fled Rafah since the start of the operation, scattering across southern and central Gaza into new tent camps or crowding into schools and homes.\n\nIsrael launched its campaign in Gaza after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack into Israel, in which militants killed some 1,200 people and took another 250 hostage. Israel's offensive has killed at least 36,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and civilians in its figures.\n\nIsrael blames civilian deaths on Hamas because it positions fighters, tunnels and rocket launchers in residential areas.\n\nThe United States has thrown its weight behind a phased cease-fire and hostage release outlined by President Joe Biden last week. But Israel says it won't end the war without destroying Hamas, while the militant group is demanding a lasting cease-fire and the full withdrawal of Israeli forces.\n\nFar-right members of Netanyahu's government have threatened to bring down the coalition if he signs onto a cease-fire deal. On Wednesday, National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, a leading hard-liner, spoke at an annual march through Jerusalem's Old City, saying, \"We are delivering a message from here to Hamas: Jerusalem is ours. Damascus Gate is ours\" -- referring to a main gate into the Arab-majority section of the city -- \"And with God's help total victory is ours.\"\n\nThe annual march commemorates \"Jerusalem Day,\" which marks Israel's capture of east Jerusalem, including the Old City and its holy sites sacred to Jews, Christians and Muslims, in the 1967 Middle East war.\n\nIsrael has routinely launched airstrikes in all parts of Gaza since the start of the war and has carried out massive ground operations in the territory's two largest cities, Gaza City and Khan Younis, that left much of them in ruins.\n\nThe military waged an offensive earlier this year for several weeks in Bureij and several other nearby refugee camps in central Gaza.\n\nTroops pulled out of the Jabaliya camp in northern Gaza last Friday after weeks of fighting caused widespread destruction. First responders have recovered the bodies of 360 people, mostly women and children, killed during the battles.", "source": {"uri": "krcrtv.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KRCR"}, "authors":

The latest operations appear to mark a widening of Israel's nearly eight-month offensive, launched after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack.\n\nThe Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir al-Balah received at least 30 bodies from the strike on the school and another six from a separate strike on a home, according to hospital records and an Associated Press reporter at the hospital.

The Israeli military said that Hamas militants were operating from within the school.\n\nIt was the latest instance of mass casualties among Palestinians trying to find refuge as Israel expands its offensives in the Gaza Strip. A day earlier, the military announced a new ground and air assault in central Gaza, pursuing Hamas militants it says have regrouped there. Troops repeatedly have swept back into sections of the Gaza Strip they have previously invaded, underscoring the resilience of the militant group despite Israel's nearly eight-month onslaught in the territory.\n\nWitnesses and hospital officials said the predawn strike hit the al-Sardi School, run by the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees known by the acronym UNRWA. The school was filled with Palestinians who had fled Israeli offensives and bombardment in northern Gaza, they said.\n\nAyman Rashed, a man displaced from Gaza City who was sheltering at the school, said the missiles hit classrooms on the second and third floor where families were sheltering. He said he helped carry out five dead, including an old man and two children, one with his head shattered open. \"It was dark, with no electricity, and we struggled to get out the victims,\" Rashed said.\n\nCasualties from school strike arrived at the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in nearby Deir al-Balah, which had already been overwhelmed by a stream of constant ambulances since the central Gaza incursion began 24 hours earlier, said Omar al-Derawi, a photographer working for the hospital. Videos circulating online appeared to show several wounded people being treated on the floor of the hospital, a common scene in Gaza's overwhelmed medical wards. Electricity in much of the hospital is out because staff are rationing fuel supplies for the generator.\n\n\"You can't walk in the hospital -- there's so many people. Women from the victims' families are massed in the hallways, crying,\" he said.\n\nHospital records and an Associated Press reporter at the hospital recorded at least 33 dead from the strike, including 14 children and nine women. Another strike on a house overnight killed six people, according to the records. Both strikes occurred in Nuseirat, one of several built-up refugee camps in Gaza dating to the 1948 war surrounding Israel's creation, when hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were driven from their homes in what became the new state.\n\nFootage showed bodies wrapped in blankets or plastic bags being laid out in lines in the courtyard of the hospital. Mohammed al-Kareem, a displaced Palestinian sheltering near the hospital, said he saw people searching for their loved ones among bodies, and that one woman kept asking medical workers to open the wraps on the bodies to see if her son was inside.\n\n\"The situation is tragic,\" he said.\n\nAn Israeli military spokesman, Lt. Col. Peter Lerner, said that the army wasn't aware of any civilian casualties in the strike. He said that intelligence indicated that militants had used the school compound to orchestrate some of the attacks on Oct. 7 and that at least 20 militants there were using it currently as a \"staging realm\" to launch attacks on Israeli soldiers. The military gave no evidence for its claims and released a photo of the school, pointing to classrooms on the second and third floor where it claimed militants were located.\n\nThe miltiary said it took steps before the strike \"to reduce the risk of harming uninvolved civilians ... including conducting aerial surveillance, and additional intelligence information.\"\n\nUNRWA schools across Gaza have functioned as shelters since the start of the war, which has driven most of the territory's population of 2.3 million Palestinians from their homes.\n\nLast week, Israeli strikes hit near an UNRWA facility in the southern city of Rafah, saying they were targeting Hamas militants. An inferno that followed ripped through tents nearby housing displaced families , killing at least 45 people. The deaths triggered international outrage, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the fire was the result of a \"tragic mishap.\" The military said the fire may have been caused by secondary explosions. The cause of the explosions has not been determined.\n\nIsrael sent troops into Rafah in early May in what it said was a limited incursion, but those forces are now operating in central parts of the city. More than 1 million people have fled Rafah since the start of the operation, scattering across southern and central Gaza into new tent camps or crowding into schools and homes.\n\nIsrael launched its campaign in Gaza after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack into Israel, in which militants killed some 1,200 people and took another 250 hostage. Israel's offensive has killed at least 36,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and civilians in its figures.\n\nIsrael blames civilian deaths on Hamas because it positions fighters, tunnels and rocket launchers in residential areas.\n\nThe United States has thrown its weight behind a phased cease-fire and hostage release outlined by President Joe Biden last week. But Israel says it won't end the war without destroying Hamas, while the militant group is demanding a lasting cease-fire and the full withdrawal of Israeli forces.\n\nFar-right members of Netanyahu's government have threatened to bring down the coalition if he signs onto a cease-fire deal. On Wednesday, National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, a leading hard-liner, spoke at an annual march through Jerusalem's Old City, saying, \"We are delivering a message from here to Hamas: Jerusalem is ours. Damascus Gate is ours\" -- referring to a main gate into the Arab-majority section of the city -- \"And with God's help total victory is ours.\"\n\nThe annual march commemorates \"Jerusalem Day,\" which marks Israel's capture of east Jerusalem, including the Old City and its holy sites sacred to Jews, Christians and Muslims, in the 1967 Middle East war.\n\nIsrael has routinely launched airstrikes in all parts of Gaza since the start of the war and has carried out massive ground operations in the territory's two largest cities, Gaza City and Khan Younis, that left much of them in ruins.\n\nThe military waged an offensive earlier this year for several weeks in Bureij and several other nearby refugee camps in central Gaza.\n\nTroops pulled out of the Jabaliya camp in northern Gaza last Friday after weeks of fighting caused widespread destruction.

A day earlier, the military announced a new ground and air assault in central Gaza, pursuing Hamas militants it says have regrouped there.\n\nTroops repeatedly have swept back into sections of the Gaza Strip they have previously invaded, underscoring the resilience of the militant group despite Israel's nearly eight-month onslaught in the territory.\n\nAlso Read | Norway: Man Dies After Falling From Famous Preikestolen Cliff Aka Pulpit Rock That Featured Tom Cruise's 'Mission Impossible' Movie.\n\nWitnesses and hospital officials said the predawn strike hit the al-Sardi School, run by the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees known by the acronym UNRWA. The school was filled with Palestinians who had fled Israeli offensives and bombardment in northern Gaza, they said.\n\nAyman Rashed, a man displaced from Gaza City who was sheltering at the school, said the missiles hit classrooms on the second and third floor where families were sheltering. He said he helped carry out five dead, including an old man and two children, one with his head shattered open. \"It was dark, with no electricity, and we struggled to get out the victims,\" Rashed said.\n\nCasualties from school strike arrived at the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in nearby Deir al-Balah, which had already been overwhelmed by a stream of constant ambulances since the central Gaza incursion began 24 hours earlier, said Omar al-Derawi, a photographer working for the hospital.\n\nVideos circulating online appeared to show several wounded people being treated on the floor of the hospital, a common scene in Gaza's overwhelmed medical wards. Electricity in much of the hospital is out because staff are rationing fuel supplies for the generator.\n\n\"You can't walk in the hospital -- there's so many people. Women from the victims' families are massed in the hallways, crying,\" he said.\n\nHospital records and an Associated Press reporter at the hospital recorded at least 33 dead from the strike, including 14 children and nine women. Another strike on a house overnight killed six people, according to the records. Both strikes occurred in Nuseirat, one of several built-up refugee camps in Gaza dating to the 1948 war surrounding Israel's creation, when hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were driven from their homes in what became the new state.\n\nFootage showed bodies wrapped in blankets or plastic bags being laid out in lines in the courtyard of the hospital. Mohammed al-Kareem, a displaced Palestinian sheltering near the hospital, said he saw people searching for their loved ones among bodies, and that one woman kept asking medical workers to open the wraps on the bodies to see if her son was inside.\n\n\"The situation is tragic,\" he said.\n\nAn Israeli military spokesman, Lt Col Peter Lerner, said that the army wasn't aware of any civilian casualties in the strike. He said that intelligence indicated that militants had used the school compound to orchestrate some of the attacks on October 7 and that at least 20 militants there were using it currently as a \"staging realm\" to launch attacks on Israeli soldiers.\n\nThe military gave no evidence for its claims and released a photo of the school, pointing to classrooms on the second and third floor where it claimed militants were located.\n\nThe military said it took steps before the strike \"to reduce the risk of harming uninvolved civilians ... including conducting aerial surveillance, and additional intelligence information.\"\n\nUNRWA schools across Gaza have functioned as shelters since the start of the war, which has driven most of the territory's population of 2.3 million Palestinians from their homes.\n\nLast week, Israeli strikes hit near an UNRWA facility in the southern city of Rafah, saying they were targeting Hamas militants. An inferno that followed ripped through tents nearby housing displaced families , killing at least 45 people.\n\nThe deaths triggered international outrage, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the fire was the result of a \"tragic mishap.\" The military said the fire may have been caused by secondary explosions. The cause of the explosions has not been determined.\n\nIsrael sent troops into Rafah in early May in what it said was a limited incursion, but those forces are now operating in central parts of the city. More than 1 million people have fled Rafah since the start of the operation, scattering across southern and central Gaza into new tent camps or crowding into schools and homes.\n\nIsrael launched its campaign in Gaza after Hamas' October 7 attack into Israel, in which militants killed some 1,200 people and took another 250 hostage. Israel's offensive has killed at least 36,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and civilians in its figures.\n\nIsrael blames civilian deaths on Hamas because it positions fighters, tunnels and rocket launchers in residential areas.\n\nThe United States has thrown its weight behind a phased cease-fire and hostage release outlined by President Joe Biden last week. But Israel says it won't end the war without destroying Hamas, while the militant group is demanding a lasting cease-fire and the full withdrawal of Israeli forces.\n\nFar-right members of Netanyahu's government have threatened to bring down the coalition if he signs onto a cease-fire deal.

Damascus Gate is ours\" -- referring to a main gate into the Arab-majority section of the city -- \"And with God's help total victory is ours.\"\n\nThe annual march commemorates \"Jerusalem Day,\" which marks Israel's capture of east Jerusalem, including the Old City and its holy sites sacred to Jews, Christians and Muslims, in the 1967 Middle East war.\n\nIsrael has routinely launched airstrikes in all parts of Gaza since the start of the war and has carried out massive ground operations in the territory's two largest cities, Gaza City and Khan Younis, that left much of them in ruins.\n\nThe military waged an offensive earlier this year for several weeks in Bureij and several other nearby refugee camps in central Gaza.\n\nTroops pulled out of the Jabaliya camp in northern Gaza last Friday after weeks of fighting caused widespread destruction.

(AP Photo/Abdel Kareem Hana)JERUSALEM (AP) - Israel's military said Thursday it targeted what it called a \"Hamas compound\"\u009d inside of a school in the Gaza Strip, an attack Hamas-affiliated media reported killed at least 32 people and wounded dozens. Information about the strike in the Nuseirat area remained contradictory Thursday morning, and The Associated Press could not immediately independently confirm details about the strike. Hamas' al-Aqsa television broadcaster reported at least 39 dead, without offering a source for the figures. The Palestinian news agency WAFA said at least 32 people were killed and dozens of others wounded. The Israeli military said its fighter jets struck the school run by the United Nations agency providing aid to the Palestinians, known by the acronym UNRWA. The Israeli military claimed, without immediately offering evidence, that Hamas and the Islamic Jihad used the school as cover for their operations. \"Before the strike, a number of steps were taken to reduce the risk of harming uninvolved civilians during the strike, including conducting aerial surveillance, and additional intelligence information,\"\u009d the Israeli military claimed. The Nuseirat refugee camp is in the middle of the Gaza Strip. It is a built-up Palestinian refugee camp in central Gaza dating back to the 1948 Arab-Israeli war. The Israeli military published a graphic of the school, which clearly had \"UN\"\u009d on its roof. The graphic described the strikes targeting two areas of the building on its upper floors. The war began with Hamas' Oct. 7 attack inside Israel that killed at least 1,200 people with 250 others taken hostage. The Israeli military campaign in the Gaza Strip has killed at least 36,000 Palestinians, with hundreds of others killed in operations in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.", "source": {"uri": "medicinehatnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Medicine Hat News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "canadian_press@medicinehatnews.com", "name": "Canadian Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuseirat_Camp", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nuseirat Camp"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nuseirat Camp"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNRWA", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "UNRWA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deir_al-Balah", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Deir al-Balah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Deir al-Balah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugee_camp", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Refugee camp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_Islamic_Jihad", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian Islamic Jihad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wafa", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wafa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_occupation_of_the_West_Bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israeli occupation of the West Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_refugees", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian refugees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_citizens_of_Israel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arab citizens of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}], "categories": [], "image": "https://medicinehatnews.com/wp-content/uploads/cp/20240605230648-6661322e86a65799deebe33fjpeg.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9626324", "eventUri": "eng-9626324", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 1802, "textEnd": 1808}], "sentiment": -0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

Later, al-Kareem said he saw people searching for their loved ones among bodies wrapped in white shrouds in the hospital courtyard.\n\nHe said one woman kept asking medical workers to open them up to see if her son was inside.\n\n\"The situation is tragic,\" he added. The Israeli military said its fighter jets struck the school that it claimed - without immediately offering evidence - that Hamas and the Islamic Jihad used as cover for their operations. UNRWA schools across Gaza have functioned as shelters since the start of the war, which has displaced most of the territory's population of 2.3 million Palestinians. \"Before the strike, a number of steps were taken to reduce the risk of harming uninvolved civilians during the strike, including conducting aerial surveillance, and additional intelligence information,\" the Israeli military said.\n\nBoth strikes occurred in Nuseirat, one of several built-up refugee camps in Gaza dating back to the 1948 war surrounding Israel's creation, when hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were driven from their homes in what became the new state. The latest war was triggered by Hamas's October 7 attack on Israel, in which militants killed some 1,200 people and took another 250 hostage.\n\nIsrael's offensive has killed at least 36,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and civilians in its figures. Israel says it takes measures to avoid harming civilians and blames their deaths of Hamas because it positions fighters, tunnels and rocket launchers in residential areas. The military rarely comments on individual strikes, which often kill women and children. The United States has thrown its weight behind a phased ceasefire and hostage release outlined by President Joe Biden last week.\n\nIsrael says it won't end the war without destroying Hamas, however, while the militant group is demanding a lasting ceasefire and the full withdrawal of Israeli forces. The military said Wednesday that forces were operating \"both above and below ground\" in eastern parts of Deir al-Balah and the Bureij refugee camp in central Gaza. It said the operation began with airstrikes on militant infrastructure, after which troops began a \"targeted daylight operation\" in both areas. Doctors Without Borders said at least 70 bodies and 300 wounded people, mostly women and children, were brought to a hospital in central Gaza on Tuesday and Wednesday after a wave of Israeli strikes. The international charity said Wednesday in a post on X that Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital is struggling to treat \"a huge influx of patients, many of them arriving with severe burns, shrapnel wounds, fractures, and other traumatic injuries\".", "source": {"uri": "itv.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ITV Hub"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type":

The blood of victims can be seen soaking into the concrete behind them.\n\nIsrael's military said it took steps to reduce the risk of harm to civilians prior to the strike, but that Hamas officials were directing operations from within the compound.\n\nIsmail Al-Thawabta, the director of the Hamas-run government media office, rejected Israel's claims, declaring: 'The occupation uses lying to the public opinion through false fabricated stories to justify the brutal crime it conducted against dozens of displaced people.'\n\nPalestinian boy shows the damaged walls of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) school sheltering thousands of people in Nuseirat Refugee Camp after Israeli army hit the school in Gaza Strip, Gaza on June 06, 2024\n\nAt least 39 people were killed in the strike according to local officials\n\nBlood stains are seen amid the rubble as Palestinian children pick through the remains of the school\n\nThe IDF issued a statement declaring Hamas commanders were operating from the school\n\nPalestinians inspect the damage following an Israeli air strike in Al Nuseirat refugee camp, central Gaza Strip, 03 June 2024\n\nA view of a destroyed building following an Israeli air strike in Al Nuseirat refugee camp, central Gaza Strip, 03 June 2024\n\nSmoke rises over the Gaza Strip, following an Israeli air strike, amid the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas, near the Israel-Gaza border, as seen from Israel, June 5, 2024\n\nThis latest attack comes after dozens more people were killed in Israeli strikes on Tuesday and Wednesday, with Doctors Without Borders reporting at least 70 bodies and 300 wounded people, mostly women and children, were brought to a hospital in central Gaza in the past 48 hours.\n\nIsrael has said there will be no halt to fighting during ceasefire talks as it battles a group of Hamas fighters relying on hit-and-run insurgency tactics, even as peace talks continue.\n\nIn an apparent blow to a truce proposal touted last week by US President Joe Biden, the leader of Hamas on Wednesday said the group would demand a permanent end to the war in Gaza and Israeli withdrawal as part of a ceasefire plan.\n\nThe remarks by Ismail Haniyeh appeared to deliver the Palestinian militant group's reply to the proposal that Biden unveiled last week.\n\nWashington had said it was waiting to hear an answer from Hamas to what Biden described as an Israeli initiative.\n\n'The movement and factions of the resistance will deal seriously and positively with any agreement that is based on a comprehensive ending of the aggression and the complete withdrawal and prisoners swap,' Haniyeh said.\n\nSince a brief week-long truce in November, all attempts to arrange a ceasefire have failed, with Hamas insisting on its demand for a permanent end to the conflict, while Israel says it is prepared to discuss only temporary pauses until the militant group is defeated.\n\nWashington is still pressing hard to reach an agreement. CIA director William Burns met senior officials from mediators Qatar and Egypt on Wednesday in Doha to discuss the ceasefire proposal.\n\nBiden has repeatedly declared that ceasefires were close over the past several months, only for no truce to materialise.\n\nPalestinians are seen around at the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) school sheltering thousands of people in Nuseirat Refugee Camp after Israeli army hit the school in Gaza Strip\n\nA Palestinian youth pushes a bicycle past a garbage dump at al-Maghazi refugee camp in the central Gaza Strip on June 5, 2024\n\nInternally displaced Palestinians walk next to destroyed buildings in Khan Younis, southern Gaza Strip, 05 June 2024\n\nA man mourns by the body of a relative reportedly killed in an Israeli strike on the western Rimal neighbourhood, at Al-Ahli hospital in Gaza City's al-Zaitoun neighbourhood on June 5, 2024\n\nA view of destroyed buildings following an Israeli air strike in Al Nuseirat refugee camp, central Gaza Strip, 03 June 2024\n\nPalestinian residents living in the region inspects the destroyed buildings following an Israeli attack on Abu Nar family's building at al-Nuseirat Refugee Camp in Deir al-Balah, Gaza on June 3, 2024\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu attends a Cabinet meeting at the Bible Lands Museum in Jerusalem on Wednesday, June 5, 2024\n\nPalestinian group Hamas' top leader, Ismail Haniyeh speaks during a press conference in Tehran, Iran, March 26, 2024\n\nLast week's announcement came with far greater fanfare from the White House, and at a time when Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is under mounting domestic political pressure to chart a path to end the eight-month-old war and negotiate the release of Israeli hostages held by Hamas.\n\nAlthough Biden described the ceasefire proposal as an Israeli offer, Israel's government has been lukewarm in public. A top Netanyahu aide confirmed on Sunday that Israel had made the proposal even though it was 'not a good deal'.\n\nFar-right members of Netanyahu's government have pledged to quit if he agrees to a peace deal that leaves Hamas in place, a move that could force a new election and end the political career of Israel's longest-serving leader.\n\nCentrist opponents who joined Netanyahu's war cabinet in a show of unity at the outset of the conflict have also threatened to quit, saying his government has no plan.\n\nMeanwhile, Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said there would be no let-up in Israel's offensive while negotiations over the ceasefire proposal were underway.\n\n'Any negotiations with Hamas would be conducted only under fire,' Gallant said in remarks carried by Israeli media after he flew aboard a warplane to inspect the Gaza front.\n\nThe armed wings of Hamas and Islamic Jihad said they had fought gun battles with Israeli forces on Wednesday in areas throughout the enclave and fired anti-tank rockets and shells.\n\nPalestinian residents living in the region inspects the destroyed buildings following an Israeli attack on Abu Nar family's building at al-Nuseirat Refugee Camp

last hospitals functioning in Gaza.\n\nMourners said the children had been killed along with their mother, who had been unable to leave when others in the neighbourhood did.\n\n'This is not war, it is destruction that words are unable to express,' said their father Abu Mohammed Abu Saif.\n\nHamas, which rules Gaza, precipitated the war by attacking Israeli territory on October 7, killing around 1,200 people and capturing more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.\n\nAround half of the hostages were freed in the war's only truce so far, which lasted a week in November.\n\nIsrael's military assault on Gaza has killed more than 36,000 people, according to health officials in the territory, who say thousands more dead are feared buried under the rubble.\n\nMeanwhile, a conflict between Israel and the Lebanon-based Hezbollah is threatening to escalate, with the US State Department warning against a full-blown war.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news",

Both strikes occurred in Nuseirat, one of several built-up refugee camps in Gaza dating to the 1948 war surrounding Israel's creation, when hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were driven from their homes in what became the new state.\n\nMohammed al-Kareem, a displaced Palestinian sheltering near the hospital, described chaotic scenes outside the facility. He said vehicles arrived one after the other as distressed people rushed wounded people into the emergency department. Videos circulating online appeared to show several wounded people being treated on the floor of the hospital, a common scene in Gaza's overwhelmed medical wards.\n\nFootage showed bodies wrapped in blankets or plastic bags being laid out in lines in the courtyard of the hospital, which was largely dark as staff try to conserve limited fuel for electricity. Al-Kareem said he saw people searching for their loved ones among bodies and that one woman kept asking medical workers to open the wraps on the bodies to see if her son was inside.\n\n\"The situation is tragic,\" he said.\n\nUNRWA schools across Gaza have functioned as shelters since the start of the war, which has driven most of the territory's 2.3 million Palestinians from their homes.\n\nIsrael launched its campaign in Gaza after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack in Israel, in which militants killed some 1,200 people and took about 250 others hostage. About 80 of those individuals are still believed to be alive and held captive in Gaza.\n\nIsrael's offensive has killed more than 36,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Hamas-run Health Ministry, which doesn't distinguish between fighters and civilians in its figures.\n\nIsrael blames civilian deaths on Hamas, accusing it of consistently positioning fighters, tunnels and rocket launchers in residential areas and buildings.\n\nDoctors Without Borders said at least 70 bodies and 300 wounded people, mostly women and children, were brought to a hospital in central Gaza on Tuesday and Wednesday after a wave of Israeli strikes.\n\nThe international charity said Wednesday in a post on X that Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital is struggling to treat \"a huge influx of patients, many of them arriving with severe burns, shrapnel wounds, fractures, and other traumatic injuries.\"\n\nGaza's health system has nearly collapsed through almost eight months of war. The hospital, which was treating some 700 wounded and sick people before the latest strikes, said Wednesday that one of its two electric generators had stopped working, threatening its ability to keep operating ventilators and incubators for premature babies.\n\nIsrael has routinely launched airstrikes in all parts of Gaza since the start of the war and has carried out massive ground operations in the territory's two largest cities, Gaza City and Khan Younis, that left much of them in ruins.\n\nIsrael sent troops into the southern city of Rafah in May in what it said was a limited incursion, but those forces are now operating in central parts of the city on Gaza's southern border with Egypt. More than 1 million people have fled Rafah since the start of the operation, with many heading toward central Gaza, where Israel's operations have ramped up in recent days.", "source": {"uri":

The Israeli military said that Hamas militants were operating from within the school.\n\nIt was the latest instance of mass casualties among Palestinians trying to find refuge as Israel expands its offensives in the Gaza Strip. A day earlier, the military announced a a new ground and air assault in central Gaza, pursuing Hamas militants it says have regrouped there. Troops repeatedly have swept back into sections of the Gaza Strip they have previously invaded, underscoring the resilience of the militant group despite Israel's nearly eight-month onslaught in the territory.\n\n\u00d7\n\nAlready a Subscriber? Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nWitnesses and hospital officials said the predawn strike hit the al-Sardi School, run by the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees known by the acronym UNRWA. The school was filled with Palestinians who had fled Israeli offensives and bombardment in northern Gaza, they said.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nAyman Rashed, a man displaced from Gaza City who was sheltering at the school, said the missiles hit classrooms on the second and third floor where families were sheltering. He said he helped carry out five dead, including an old man and two children, one with his head shattered open. \"It was dark, with no electricity, and we struggled to get out the victims,\" Rashed said.\n\nCasualties from school strike arrived at the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in nearby Deir al-Balah, which had already been overwhelmed by a stream of constant ambulances since the central Gaza incursion began 24 hours earlier, said Omar al-Derawi, a photographer working for the hospital. Videos circulating online appeared to show several wounded people being treated on the floor of the hospital, a common scene in Gaza's overwhelmed medical wards. Electricity in much of the hospital is out because staff are rationing fuel supplies for the generator.\n\n\"You can't walk in the hospital -- there's so many people. Women from the victims' families are massed in the hallways, crying,\" he said.\n\nHospital records and an Associated Press reporter at the hospital recorded at least 33 dead from the strike, including 14 children and nine women.

It released a photo of the school, pointing to classrooms on the second and third floor where it claimed militants were located.\n\nIt said it took steps before the strike \"to reduce the risk of harming uninvolved civilians ... including conducting aerial surveillance, and additional intelligence information.\"\n\nUNRWA schools across Gaza have functioned as shelters since the start of the war, which has driven most of the territory's population of 2.3 million Palestinians from their homes.\n\nLast week, Israeli strikes hit near an UNRWA facility in the southern city of Rafah, saying they were targeting Hamas militants. An inferno that followed ripped through tents nearby housing displaced families , killing at least 45 people. The deaths triggered international outrage, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the fire was the result of a \"tragic mishap.\" The military said the fire may have been caused by secondary explosions. The cause of the explosions has not been determined.\n\nIsrael sent troops into Rafah in early May in what it said was a limited incursion, but those forces are now operating in central parts of the city. More than 1 million people have fled Rafah since the start of the operation, scattering across southern and central Gaza into new tent camps or crowding into schools and homes.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nIsrael launched its campaign in Gaza after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack into Israel, in which militants killed some 1,200 people and took another 250 hostage.

But Israel says it won't end the war without destroying Hamas, while the militant group is demanding a lasting cease-fire and the full withdrawal of Israeli forces.\n\nFar-right members of Netanyahu's government have threatened to bring down the coalition if he signs onto a cease-fire deal. On Wednesday, National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, a leading hard-liner, spoke at an annual march through Jerusalem's Old City, saying, \"We are delivering a message from here to Hamas: Jerusalem is ours. Damascus Gate is ours\" -- referring to a main gate into the Arab-majority section of the city -- \"And with God's help total victory is ours.\"\n\nThe annual march commemorates \"Jerusalem Day,\" which marks Israel's capture of east Jerusalem, including the Old City and its holy sites sacred to Jews, Christians and Muslims, in the 1967 Middle East war.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nIsrael has routinely launched airstrikes in all parts of Gaza since the start of the war and has carried out massive ground operations in the territory's two largest cities, Gaza City and Khan Younis, that left much of them in ruins.\n\nThe military waged an offensive earlier this year for several weeks in Bureij and several other nearby refugee camps in central Gaza.\n\nTroops pulled out of the Jabaliya camp in northern Gaza last Friday after weeks of fighting caused widespread destruction.

The UN school was currently turned into a shelter. The military claimed the school was being used as a Hamas compound. The attack resulted in at least 30 deaths, including five children, as reported by local health officials. This strike followed the Israeli military's announcement of new air and ground operations in central Gaza, marking an escalation in their nearly eight-month offensive. This offensive was initiated after Hamas' attack on Israel on October 7.\n\nThe Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir al-Balah received at least 30 bodies from the school strike and six more from a separate strike on a home. Mohammed al-Kareem, a displaced Palestinian near the hospital, described the chaotic scenes as vehicles arrived continuously with wounded people. Videos online showed injured individuals being treated on the hospital floor, highlighting the overwhelmed state of Gaza's medical facilities. People were seen searching for their loved ones among bodies wrapped in white shrouds in the hospital courtyard.\n\nThe Israeli military stated that fighter jets targeted the school after conducting aerial surveillance and gathering additional intelligence, aiming to reduce civilian harm. However, the school was a shelter run by the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA), which has been providing refuge since the start of the war.\n\nNuseirat, where the strikes occurred, is one of the several refugee camps in Gaza dating back to the 1948 war that led to the creation of Israel, displacing hundreds of thousands of Palestinians.\n\nHamas' attack on October 7 killed around 1,200 people in Israel and took 250 hostages, prompting Israel's military response, which has resulted in at least 36,000 Palestinian deaths, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. The figures include both fighters and civilians. Israel insists it targets militants and their infrastructure, accusing Hamas of positioning itself in residential areas.\n\nThe U.S. has supported a phased cease-fire and hostage release proposed by President Joe Biden. However, Israel aims to continue its operations until Hamas is destroyed, while Hamas demands a lasting cease-fire and the withdrawal of Israeli forces.\n\nIn central Gaza, the Israeli military reported operations both above and below ground in Deir al-Balah and the Bureij refugee camp, involving airstrikes followed by ground troop actions.\n\nDoctors Without Borders reported at least 70 bodies and 300 injured people, mostly women and children, brought to a central Gaza hospital after recent strikes. The Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital struggles to treat the influx of patients, facing severe resource shortages, including a failing generator crucial for operating medical equipment.\n\nThroughout the war, Israel has conducted airstrikes across Gaza and ground operations in major cities like Gaza City and Khan Younis, leading to significant destruction. Troops have also engaged in previous offensives in refugee camps and recently pulled out of the Jabaliya camp after intense fighting.\n\n(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by DNA

The Israeli military said that Hamas militants were operating from within the school.\n\nIt was the latest instance of mass casualties among Palestinians trying to find refuge as Israel expands its offensives in the Gaza Strip. A day earlier, the military announced a new ground and air assault in central Gaza, pursuing Hamas militants it says have regrouped there. Troops repeatedly have swept back into sections of the Gaza Strip they have previously invaded, underscoring the resilience of the militant group despite Israel's nearly eight-month onslaught in the territory.\n\n\u00d7\n\nAlready a Subscriber? Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nWitnesses and hospital officials said the predawn strike hit the al-Sardi School, run by the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees known by the acronym UNRWA. The school was filled with Palestinians who had fled Israeli offensives and bombardment in northern Gaza, they said.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nAyman Rashed, a man displaced from Gaza City who was sheltering at the school, said the missiles hit classrooms on the second and third floor where families were sheltering. He said he helped carry out five dead, including an old man and two children, one with his head shattered open. \"It was dark, with no electricity, and we struggled to get out the victims,\" Rashed said.\n\nCasualties from school strike arrived at the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in nearby Deir al-Balah, which had already been overwhelmed by a stream of constant ambulances since the central Gaza incursion began 24 hours earlier, said Omar al-Derawi, a photographer working for the hospital. Videos circulating online appeared to show several wounded people being treated on the floor of the hospital, a common scene in Gaza's overwhelmed medical wards. Electricity in much of the hospital is out because staff are rationing fuel supplies for the generator.\n\n\"You can't walk in the hospital -- there's so many people. Women from the victims' families are massed in the hallways, crying,\" he said.\n\nHospital records and an Associated Press reporter at the hospital recorded at least 33 dead from the strike, including 14 children and nine women. Another strike on a house overnight killed six people, according to the records. Both strikes occurred in Nuseirat, one of several built-up refugee camps in Gaza dating to the 1948 war surrounding Israel's creation, when hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were driven from their homes in what became the new state.\n\nFootage showed bodies wrapped in blankets or plastic bags being laid out in lines in the courtyard of the hospital. Mohammed al-Kareem, a displaced Palestinian sheltering near the hospital, said he saw people searching for their loved ones among bodies, and that one woman kept asking medical workers to open the wraps on the bodies to see if her son was inside.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"The situation is tragic,\" he said.\n\nAn Israeli military spokesman, Lt. Col. Peter Lerner, said that the army wasn't aware of any civilian casualties in the strike. He said that intelligence indicated that militants had used the school compound to orchestrate some of the attacks on Oct. 7 and that at least 20 militants there were using it currently as a \"staging realm\" to launch attacks on Israeli soldiers. The military gave no evidence for its claims and released a photo of the school, pointing to classrooms on the second and third floor where it claimed militants were located.\n\nThe military said it took steps before the strike \"to reduce the risk of harming uninvolved civilians ... including conducting aerial surveillance, and additional intelligence information.\"\n\nUNRWA schools across Gaza have functioned as shelters since the start of the war, which has driven most of the territory's population of 2.3 million Palestinians from their homes.\n\nLast week, Israeli strikes hit near an UNRWA facility in the southern city of Rafah, saying they were targeting Hamas militants. An inferno that followed ripped through tents nearby housing displaced families , killing at least 45 people. The deaths triggered international outrage, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the fire was the result of a \"tragic mishap.\" The military said the fire may have been caused by secondary explosions. The cause of the explosions has not been determined.\n\nIsrael sent troops into Rafah in early May in what it said was a limited incursion, but those forces are now operating in central parts of the city. More than 1 million people have fled Rafah since the start of the operation, scattering across southern and central Gaza into new tent camps or crowding into schools and homes.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nIsrael launched its campaign in Gaza after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack into Israel, in which militants killed some 1,200 people and took another 250 hostage. Israel's offensive has killed at least 36,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and civilians in its figures.\n\nIsrael blames civilian deaths on Hamas because it positions fighters, tunnels and rocket launchers in residential areas.\n\nThe United States has thrown its weight behind a phased cease-fire and hostage release outlined by President Joe Biden last week. But Israel says it won't end the war without destroying Hamas, while the militant group is demanding a lasting cease-fire and the full withdrawal of Israeli forces.\n\nFar-right members of Netanyahu's government have threatened to bring down the coalition if he signs onto a cease-fire deal. On Wednesday, National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, a leading hard-liner, spoke at an annual march through Jerusalem's Old City, saying, \"We are delivering a message from here to Hamas: Jerusalem is ours. Damascus Gate is ours\" -- referring to a main gate into the Arab-majority section of the city -- \"And with God's help total victory is ours.\"\n\nThe annual march commemorates \"Jerusalem Day,\" which marks Israel's capture of east Jerusalem, including the Old City and its holy sites sacred to Jews, Christians and Muslims, in the 1967 Middle East war.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nIsrael has routinely launched airstrikes in all parts of Gaza since the start of the war and has carried out massive ground operations in the territory's two largest cities, Gaza City and Khan Younis, that left much of them in ruins.\n\nThe military waged an offensive earlier this year for several weeks in Bureij and several other nearby refugee camps in central Gaza.\n\nTroops pulled out of the Jabaliya camp in northern Gaza last Friday after weeks of fighting caused widespread destruction. First responders have recovered the bodies of 360 people, mostly women and children, killed during the battles.\n\n___\n\nSamy Magdy reported from Cairo.\n\n___\n\nFollow AP's coverage at

Israel's military said the attack had targeted Hamas operatives but Palestinian officials said it had killed civilians.\n\nThe strike was the latest in a deadly surge in fighting in central Gaza, where Israeli forces have announced an offensive against what they describe as a renewed insurgency by Hamas militants.\n\nThe bodies of more than 40 people killed in the attack were brought to Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in the central Gaza city of Deir al-Balah, a spokesperson for the medical facility, Khalil Daqran, said Thursday morning. At least some of the victims were women, children and older people, he added, although he declined to provide a precise figure.\n\nLt. Col. Peter Lerner, an Israeli military spokesperson, said he was \"not aware of any civilian casualties\" as a result of the strike. \"We conducted a precise strike against the terrorists where they were,\" he said.\n\nAt least 140 Palestinians have been killed and hundreds more wounded in recent days during the Israeli offensive in central Gaza, Daqran said, severely taxing the hospital's already depleted resources.\n\n\"Wounded patients are lying on the ground in the hallways and in tents outside,\" he said. \"And our capability to treat them at this point is extremely limited.\"\n\nThe renewed offensive comes as cease-fire talks between Israel and Hamas remain stuck, with senior officials on both sides expressing deep concerns over a proposal endorsed by President Joe Biden to pause the fighting in exchange for the release of hostages held in Gaza.\n\nThe Biden administration dispatched top officials this week to Egypt and Qatar, which have been mediating the talks, but Israeli officials including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have signaled they are not ready to wind down their eight-month war in Gaza, which has killed more than 36,000 people, according to Palestinian health officials in the enclave.\n\nThe Israeli strike overnight hit a compound in Nuseirat that had been operated by UNRWA, the main U.N. body that aids Palestinians in Gaza. About 6,000 displaced Palestinians were sheltering in the complex when the strike took place, said Juliette Touma, an UNRWA spokesperson.\n\nThe Israeli military said its fighter jets had targeted three classrooms in a school building that held 20 to 30 Palestinian militants affiliated with Hamas or Palestinian Islamic Jihad, a smaller militia also backed by Iran. Israeli forces had twice postponed the strike so as to reduce civilian casualties, the military said.\n\nLerner said the militants were \"effectively operating under the U.N. flag\" in an attempt to avoid Israeli fire, in what he said was the fifth such incident in the past month. He said the militants had used the compound to plan attacks on Israeli forces, although he did not provide specific evidence.\n\nUNRWA said it could not verify Israel's claim that Hamas had used the school's premises for military purposes. At least 450 people have been killed while sheltering in schools and other facilities run by UNRWA since the beginning of the war, according to the agency.\n\nIn mid-April, UNRWA said in a report that the Israeli military had committed the majority of \"attacks and actions\" that had damaged or harmed its facilities, but that Palestinian armed groups had been responsible for some as well.\n\nIsrael has campaigned to isolate the U.N. agency, claiming that hundreds of UNRWA employees are members of Palestinian militant groups. Israeli officials have also said that at least 12 agency employees participated in the Hamas-led Oct. 7 attack on Israel or its aftermath. At least 17 countries, including the United States, suspended funding in response, and UNRWA fired several of the workers that Israel accused of involvement in the attack.\n\nA U.N. review later found that Israel had presented no evidence to support its allegation that hundreds of UNRWA employees are affiliated with militant groups. Many countries have renewed their support for the agency.\n\nHuman rights groups have repeatedly criticized the Israeli military for failing to sufficiently protect civilians from its airstrikes. Israeli officials say they make efforts to limit civilian casualties, but that Hamas and other Palestinian militants deliberately hide among ordinary civilians.\n\nIn late May, the Israeli military struck a building in southern Gaza in an area where displaced people had been sheltering, saying it had targeted two Hamas commanders there. At least 45 people were killed in that strike and a resulting fire, according to Gaza health officials. Netanyahu called the civilian deaths in the strike \"a tragic accident.\"", "source": {"uri": "fresnobee.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Fresno Bee"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

EPA-Yonhap\n\nA Gaza hospital said at least 37 people were killed in an Israeli strike Thursday on a U.N.-run school that the Israeli military alleged housed a \"Hamas compound.\"\n\nThe raid came after U.S., Qatari and Egyptian mediators resumed talks aimed at securing a truce and hostage-prisoner swap in the nearly eight-month war triggered by Hamas's Oct. 7 attack on Israel.\n\nThe military said it had \"eliminated\" several militants in a \"precise strike on a Hamas compound embedded inside an UNRWA school\" just before 2:00 a.m. in the Nuseirat area of central Gaza.\n\nIsrael accuses Hamas and its allies in Gaza of using schools, hospitals and other civilian infrastructure including facilities run by UNRWA, the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, as operational centers -- charges the militants deny.\n\nThe Al-Aqsa Martyrs hospital in Deir al-Balah, near Nuseirat, said it had received the bodies of at least \"37 martyrs\" from the strike.\n\nAn AFP photographer saw Palestinians removing blood-stained mattresses and examining damage to the school where displaced Gazans had been sheltering, parts of it littered with broken concrete slabs.\n\nHamas in a statement decried a \"new crime... against our people,\" urging international pressure on Israel to stop \"these brutal massacres.\"\n\nA medic at the hospital said another Israeli pre-dawn strike killed six people in a house in Nuseirat refugee camp, while witnesses reported intense shelling in the Bureij and Al-Maghazi camps in the same area.\n\nIsraeli warplanes also carried out strikes in parts of Rafah, a source in Gaza's southernmost city told AFP.\n\nSpain joins ICJ case\n\nThe military said troops killed three suspects who had tried to breach the Gaza border fence in the Rafah area, adding no militants had crossed into Israel.\n\nIt also said a soldier was killed in Gaza on Thursday, bringing to 295 the overall death toll since the start of its ground offensive in the Palestinian territory on Oct. 27.\n\nThe war was sparked by Hamas's Oct. 7 attack, which resulted in the deaths of 1,194 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures.\n\nMilitants also took 251 hostages, 120 of whom remain in Gaza, including 41 the army says are dead.\n\nIsrael's retaliatory military offensive has killed at least 36,654 people in Gaza, also mostly civilians, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry.\n\nSixty-eight of them were killed in the past 24 hours, the ministry said.\n\nAs the fighting has raged on, Israel has faced growing diplomatic isolation, with international court cases accusing it of war crimes and several European countries recognising a Palestinian state.\n\nSpain, which last week sparked Israeli fury by formally recognising Palestinian statehood, said Thursday it would become the latest country to join South Africa's case at the International Court of Justice accusing Israel of \"genocide\" against Palestinians in Gaza.\n\nForeign Minister Jose Manuel Albares said Madrid's \"sole goal is to put an end to the war and to advance\" a two-state solution to the conflict.\n\n'Tired and exhausted'\n\nThe situation on the ground remains dire for people like Muhammad al-Najjar, a 35-year-old man from northern Gaza twice displaced by the war.\n\n\"As far as we are concerned, we are tired and exhausted. We just want to... end the catastrophic situation that we are living,\" he told AFP.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden last week outlined what he called a three-phase Israeli plan to halt the fighting for six weeks while hostages are exchanged for Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails and the delivery of aid into Gaza is stepped up.\n\nG7 powers and Arab states have backed the proposal. Major sticking points remain, however, with Hamas insisting on a permanent truce and full Israeli withdrawal -- demands Israel has rejected.\n\nA source with knowledge of the negotiations told AFP senior Qatari and Egyptian officials met Hamas representatives in Doha on Wednesday \"to discuss a deal for a truce in Gaza and the exchange of hostages and prisoners.\"\n\nBiden has sent CIA chief Bill Burns to Qatar, where Hamas's political office is based, for a renewed push after months of stalled negotiations.\n\nHamas has accused Israel of dragging its feet in the talks, and leader Ismail Haniyeh said the Islamist movement would \"deal seriously and positively\" with any offer meeting its key demands.\n\nSuhail al-Hindi, a Hamas official, said there would be \"no agreement\" without \"a ceasefire and the withdrawal of the (Israeli) occupation.\"\n\n\"The ball is in the occupation's court, and we await their response.\"\n\nLebanon 'escalation'\n\nThe war has sent regional tensions soaring, with violence on the rise involving Israel and its allies on the one hand, and Iran-backed armed groups on the other.\n\nRegular cross-border clashes between Israeli forces and Lebanon's Hezbollah movement, which have forced mass evacuations on both sides, have intensified in recent days, causing more deaths and igniting wildfires.\n\nThe Israeli military on Thursday announced a soldier was killed in a Hezbollah drone strike the day before on the town of Hurfeish.\n\nIsraeli politicians have threatened more intense fighting against Hezbollah, which last fought a major war with Israel in 2006.\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday said Israel was \"prepared for a very intense operation\" along the border with Lebanon and that \"one way or another, we will restore security to the north.\"\n\nThe United States appeared to warn Israel against taking action, with State Department spokesman Matthew Miller saying any \"escalation\" in Lebanon would \"greatly harm Israel's overall security.\" (AFP)", "source": {"uri": "koreatimes.co.kr", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Korea Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Israel's military later said it was not aware of any civilian casualties in the strike on the school in Nuseirat refugee camp.\n\nCasualties from the school strike -- including 14 children and nine women -- were taken to a hospital in nearby Deir al-Balah, as documented by hospital records and an Associated Press journalist. The hospital has already been overwhelmed by a stream of ambulances since Israeli forces launched a new offensive in central Gaza this week.\n\nInternational pressure has been mounting on Israel to limit civilian bloodshed in its war against Hamas in Gaza. Spain's foreign minister announced Thursday that the country would ask a United Nations court for permission to join South Africa's case accusing Israel of genocide in Gaza. Israel strongly denies the accusation.\n\nMore than 36,000 Palestinians have been killed by eight months of Israeli bombardments and ground offensives in Gaza, according to the Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians.\n\nThe war has largely cut off the flow of food, medicine and other supplies to Palestinians who are facing widespread hunger. United Nations agencies say over 1 million in Gaza could experience the highest level of starvation by mid-July.\n\nIsrael launched the war after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack, in which militants stormed into southern Israel, killed some 1,200 people -- mostly civilians -- and abducted about 250. Around 80 hostages captured on Oct. 7 are believed to still be alive in Gaza, alongside the remains of 43 others.\n\nCurrently:\n\n-- Israeli strike kills at least 33 people at a Gaza school the military claims was being used by Hamas.\n\nFollow AP's coverage of the war in Gaza at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war\n\nHere's the latest:\n\nJERUSALEM -- The Palestinian Health Ministry says three Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire in the occupied West Bank.\n\nThe Israeli military said forces carrying out an arrest raid in the northern West Bank city of Jenin on Thursday opened fire at three individuals who had thrown explosives at them and that a helicopter struck the area. It said the forces also arrested a suspected militant.\n\nViolence has surged in the Israeli-occupied West Bank since Hamas' Oct. 7 attack triggered the war in Gaza. Israel has carried out frequent arrest raids that often ignite gunbattles. Settler violence and Palestinian attacks on Israelis have also been on the rise.\n\nThe Health Ministry, part of the Western-backed Palestinian Authority, says around 530 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank since the start of the Gaza war.\n\nIsrael captured the West Bank, the Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem in the 1967 Mideast war. The Palestinians want all three territories for their future state.\n\nThe 3 million Palestinians in the West Bank live under seemingly open-ended Israeli military rule, while the more than 500,000 Jewish settlers in the territory have Israeli citizenship.\n\nWASHINGTON -- More than a dozen countries joined the U.S. in a statement Thursday to show support for U.S. President Joe Biden's proposed deal to release the remaining hostages in Gaza and end the grinding Mideast war.\n\nThe statement was signed by the leaders of Argentina, Austria, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, Colombia, Denmark, France, Germany, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Serbia, Spain, Thailand and the United Kingdom as well as the United States.\n\n\"As leaders of countries deeply concerned for the hostages held by Hamas in Gaza, including many of our own citizens, we fully support the movement towards a ceasefire and hostage release deal now on the table and as outlined by President Biden on May 31, 2024,\" the statement said. \"There is no time to lose.\"\n\nThe United States has thrown its weight behind the phased cease-fire and hostage release outlined by Biden last week. But Israel says it won't end the war without destroying Hamas, while the militant group is demanding a lasting cease-fire and the full withdrawal of Israeli forces.\n\nFar-right members of Netanyahu's government have threatened to bring down the coalition if he signs onto a cease-fire deal.\n\nJERUSALEM -- The Israeli military says it traded fire with Palestinian militants in southern Gaza some 300 meters (yards) from the Israeli border.\n\nThe fighters appeared to have infiltrated a heavily guarded buffer zone.\n\nLt. Col. Peter Lerner, an Israeli military spokesman, said the gunbattle erupted before dawn on Thursday. He said two militants were killed from the air and a third in a tank strike.\n\nIsraeli media later reported that an Israeli soldier was killed in the shootout. The military confirmed that a soldier was killed during a confrontation with militants in southern Gaza early Thursday but declined to say whether it was linked to the infiltration attempt.\n\nSatellite photos earlier this year showed extensive demolition inside Gaza along the border. Israel appears to have established a buffer zone despite international objections.\n\nThe United States, which has provided key military aid for Israel's nearly eight-month offensive, has said Gaza's territory should not shrink. Israel says it needs a buffer zone to prevent Hamas from carrying out another attack into southern Israel like the one on Oct. 7 that ignited the war.\n\nJERUSALEM -- Israel's representative on the panel of judges hearing the genocide case against Israel at the world's top court resigned from his post, citing personal reasons, according to a letter he sent to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu seen by The Associated Press on Thursday.\n\nJustice Aharon Barak, a former attorney general and peace negotiator who served as chief justice of Israel's highest court from 1995 to 2006, wrote Tuesday to Netanyahu, telling him that he had sent the president of the International Court of Justice a resignation letter.\n\n\"My resignation is for personal and family reasons,\" he wrote to Netanyahu. \"Thank you for the trust placed in me.\"\n\nBarak was one of four justices on the court who said the ICJ's ruling that Israel cease operations in Rafah, Gaza's southernmost city, did not mean Israel needed to stop operations there entirely. He said Israel could still operate in Gaza but needed to avoid causing undue harm to Palestinian civilians and contravening Israel's obligations under the Genocide Convention.\n\nIsraeli President Isaac Herzog, whose position is largely ceremonial, thanked Barak on Thursday for serving on the court in a statement posted to X, adding: \"We will continue to stand firm against the evil, the hypocrisy and the false accusations leveled against the State of Israel and the IDF,\" using an acronym for Israel's military.\n\nJERUSALEM -- Israel's military said Thursday that a drone strike on a village in northern Israel the day before killed an Israeli reserve soldier.\n\nThe Lebanese militant group Hezbollah said it launched an attack toward a gathering of military officials in response to an earlier Israeli cross-border attack.\n\nIsrael's military said two explosive drones were fired toward Hurfeish, a northern village in Israel.\n\nAir raid sirens did not go off ahead of the strike, and Israeli authorities said that the strike wounded over 10 people in addition to the one soldier killed. The military identified the fallen soldier as Staff Sgt. (res.) Refael Kauders, 39.\n\nWith Kaunders' death, 16 soldiers have been killed in Israel's north since October, along with 10 civilians.\n\nMore 400 people have been killed in Lebanon, including more than 70 civilians and noncombatants.\n\nIsrael and Hezbollah have been exchanging fire daily since a day after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack, which set off the war in Gaza. The deadly fighting has displaced tens of thousands of people on both sides of the Israel-Lebanon border and sparked fears of a wider regional war.\n\nJERUSALEM -- Israel's military said Thursday it was not aware of any civilian casualties in a strike that killed at least 33 Palestinians, including 23 women and children, according to local officials and an AP reporter at the hospital that received the bodies.\n\nThe strike occurred early Thursday on a United Nations school sheltering displaced Palestinians in central Gaza. Israeli military spokesperson Lt. Col. Peter Lerner said intelligence indicated that militants had used the school compound to orchestrate some of the attacks on Oct. 7 and that at least 20 militants there were using it currently as a \"staging realm\" to launch attacks on Israeli soldiers.\n\n\"I'm not aware of civilians being caught up in this. We will be looking at the data and intelligence that comes out in the next few hours or day,\" Lerner told journalists.\n\nHe declined to say whether the military would investigate the strike, as it did in May when an Israeli strike nearby a tent camp sheltering displaced people killed dozens in Rafah, Gaza's southernmost city.\n\nMADRID -- Spain will ask a United Nations court for permission to join South Africa's case accusing Israel of genocide in Gaza, its foreign minister announced Thursday.\n\nSpain is the first European country to take the step after South Africa filed its case with the International Court of Justice in late 2023. It alleged that Israel was breaching the genocide convention in its military assault that has laid waste to large swaths of Gaza.\n\nMexico, Colombia, Nicaragua, Libya and the Palestinians have already requested to join the case currently being heard at the court in The Hague, Netherlands.\n\nThe court has ordered Israel to immediately halt its military offensive in the southern Gaza city of Rafah but stopped short of ordering a cease-fire for the enclave. Israel has not complied.\n\nSpain's request to join the case is the latest move by the government of Socialist Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez to support peacemaking efforts in Gaza.\n\nIsrael denies it is committing genocide in its military operation to crush Hamas triggered by its deadly Oct. 7 attacks in southern Israel.\n\nHamas killed 1,200 people and took 250 more hostage in the surprise attacks. Israel's air and land attacks have killed 36,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which doesn't distinguish between combatants and civilians.\n\nDEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip -- An Israeli strike early Thursday on a school-turned-shelter in central Gaza that the military claimed was being used as a Hamas compound killed at least 30 people, including five children, according to local health officials.\n\nThe strike came after the military said it was launching new air and ground operations in central Gaza in an apparent widening of its nearly eight-month offensive, launched after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack. An international medical charity had reported soaring casualties even before Thursday's strike.\n\nThe Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir al-Balah received at least 30 bodies from the strike on the school run by the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees -- known by the acronym UNRWA -- and another six from a separate strike on a home, according to hospital records and an Associated Press reporter at the hospital. Hamas-run TV had earlier reported a higher toll.\n\nThe Israeli military claimed, without immediately offering evidence, that Hamas and the Islamic Jihad used the school as cover for their operations and that risk reduction steps were taken before the strike.\n\nThe war began with Hamas' Oct. 7 attack inside Israel that killed at least 1,200 people with 250 others taken hostage. The Israeli military campaign in the Gaza Strip has killed at least 36,000 Palestinians, with hundreds of others killed in operations in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.\n\nDUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Yemen's Houthi rebels have unveiled a new, solid-fuel missile in their arsenal that resembles aspects of one earlier displayed by Iran that Tehran described as flying at hypersonic speeds.\n\nThe rebels fired their new \"Palestine\" missile, complete with a warhead painted like a Palestinian keffiyeh checkered scarf, at the southern Gulf of Aqaba port of Eilat in Israel on Monday. The attack set off air raid sirens but caused no reported damage or injuries.\n\nFootage released by the Houthis late Wednesday showed the Palestine being raised on what appeared to be a mobile launcher and rising quickly into the air with plumes of white smoke coming from its engine. White smoke is common with solid-fuel missiles.\n\nSolid-fuel missiles can be set up and fired faster than those containing liquid fuel. That's a key concern for the Houthis as their missile launch sites have been repeatedly targeted by U.S. and allied forces in recent months over the rebels' attacks on shipping through the Red Sea corridor. One such strike hit the Houthis even before they were able to launch their missile.", "source": {"uri": "hosted.ap.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Associated Press"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Israel's military later said it was not aware of any civilian casualties in the strike on the school in Nuseirat refugee camp.\n\nCasualties from the school strike -- including 14 children and nine women -- were taken to a hospital in nearby Deir al-Balah, as documented by hospital records and an Associated Press journalist. The hospital has already been overwhelmed by a stream of ambulances since Israeli forces launched a new offensive in central Gaza this week.\n\nInternational pressure has been mounting on Israel to limit civilian bloodshed in its war against Hamas in Gaza. Spain's foreign minister announced Thursday that the country would ask a United Nations court for permission to join South Africa's case accusing Israel of genocide in Gaza. Israel strongly denies the accusation.\n\nMore than 36,000 Palestinians have been killed by eight months of Israeli bombardments and ground offensives in Gaza, according to the Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians.\n\nThe war has largely cut off the flow of food, medicine and other supplies to Palestinians who are facing widespread hunger. United Nations agencies say over 1 million in Gaza could experience the highest level of starvation by mid-July.\n\nIsrael launched the war after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack, in which militants stormed into southern Israel, killed some 1,200 people -- mostly civilians -- and abducted about 250. Around 80 hostages captured on Oct. 7 are believed to still be alive in Gaza, alongside the remains of 43 others.\n\nCurrently:\n\n-- Israeli strike kills at least 33 people at a Gaza school the military claims was being used by Hamas.\n\n-- Spain applies to join South Africa's case at top the U.N. court accusing Israel of genocide.\n\n-- A social media effort to draw attention to Rafah surges.\n\n-- Israeli settlers in the West Bank were hit with international sanctions.

It said the forces also arrested a suspected militant.\n\nViolence has surged in the Israeli-occupied West Bank since Hamas' Oct. 7 attack triggered the war in Gaza. Israel has carried out frequent arrest raids that often ignite gunbattles. Settler violence and Palestinian attacks on Israelis have also been on the rise.\n\nThe Health Ministry, part of the Western-backed Palestinian Authority, says around 530 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank since the start of the Gaza war.\n\nIsrael captured the West Bank, the Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem in the 1967 Mideast war. The Palestinians want all three territories for their future state.\n\nThe 3 million Palestinians in the West Bank live under seemingly open-ended Israeli military rule, while the more than 500,000 Jewish settlers in the territory have Israeli citizenship.\n\nMORE THAN A DOZEN COUNTRIES JOIN U.S. IN STATEMENT SUPPORTING BIDEN'S GAZA PLAN\n\nWASHINGTON -- More than a dozen countries joined the U.S. in a statement Thursday to show support for U.S. President Joe Biden's proposed deal to release the remaining hostages in Gaza and end the grinding Mideast war.\n\nThe statement was signed by the leaders of Argentina, Austria, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, Colombia, Denmark, France, Germany, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Serbia, Spain, Thailand and the United Kingdom as well as the United States.\n\n\"As leaders of countries deeply concerned for the hostages held by Hamas in Gaza, including many of our own citizens, we fully support the movement towards a ceasefire and hostage release deal now on the table and as outlined by President Biden on May 31, 2024,\" the statement said. \"There is no time to lose.\"\n\nThe United States has thrown its weight behind the phased cease-fire and hostage release outlined by Biden last week. But Israel says it won't end the war without destroying Hamas, while the militant group is demanding a lasting cease-fire and the full withdrawal of Israeli forces.\n\nFar-right members of Netanyahu's government have threatened to bring down the coalition if he signs onto a cease-fire deal.\n\nISRAEL'S MILITARY SAYS IT TRADED FIRE WITH PALESTINIAN MILITANTS JUST YARDS FROM GAZA BORDER\n\nJERUSALEM -- The Israeli military says it traded fire with Palestinian militants in southern Gaza some 300 meters (yards) from the Israeli border.\n\nThe fighters appeared to have infiltrated a heavily guarded buffer zone.\n\nLt. Col. Peter Lerner, an Israeli military spokesman, said the gunbattle erupted before dawn on Thursday. He said two militants were killed from the air and a third in a tank strike.\n\nIsraeli media later reported that an Israeli soldier was killed in the shootout. The military confirmed that a soldier was killed during a confrontation with militants in southern Gaza early Thursday but declined to say whether it was linked to the infiltration attempt.\n\nSatellite photos earlier this year showed extensive demolition inside Gaza along the border. Israel appears to have established a buffer zone despite international objections.\n\nThe United States, which has provided key military aid for Israel's nearly eight-month offensive, has said Gaza's territory should not shrink. Israel says it needs a buffer zone to prevent Hamas from carrying out another attack into southern Israel like the one on Oct. 7 that ignited the war.\n\nISRAEL'S REPRESENTATIVE RESIGNS FROM ICJ JUDGE PANEL OVERSEEING GENOCIDE CASE\n\nJERUSALEM -- Israel's representative on the panel of judges hearing the genocide case against Israel at the world's top court resigned from his post, citing personal reasons, according to a letter he sent to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu seen by The Associated Press on Thursday.\n\nJustice Aharon Barak, a former attorney general and peace negotiator who served as chief justice of Israel's highest court from 1995 to 2006, wrote Tuesday to Netanyahu, telling him that he had sent the president of the International Court of Justice a resignation letter.\n\n\"My resignation is for personal and family reasons,\" he wrote to Netanyahu. \"Thank you for the trust placed in me.\"\n\nBarak was one of four justices on the court who said the ICJ's ruling that Israel cease operations in Rafah, Gaza's southernmost city, did not mean Israel needed to stop operations there entirely. He said Israel could still operate in Gaza but needed to avoid causing undue harm to Palestinian civilians and contravening Israel's obligations under the Genocide Convention.\n\nIsraeli President Isaac Herzog, whose position is largely ceremonial, thanked Barak on Thursday for serving on the court in a statement posted to X, adding: \"We will continue to stand firm against the evil, the hypocrisy and the false accusations leveled against the State of Israel and the IDF,\" using an acronym for Israel's military.\n\nRECENT DRONE STRIKE IN NORTHERN ISRAEL KILLED A RESERVE SOLDIER, MILITARY SAYS\n\nJERUSALEM -- Israel's military said Thursday that a drone strike on a village in northern Israel the day before killed an Israeli reserve soldier.\n\nThe Lebanese militant group Hezbollah said it launched an attack toward a gathering of military officials in response to an earlier Israeli cross-border attack.\n\nIsrael's military said two explosive drones were fired toward Hurfeish, a northern village in Israel.\n\nAir raid sirens did not go off ahead of the strike, and Israeli authorities said that the strike wounded over 10 people in addition to the one soldier killed. The military identified the fallen soldier as Staff Sgt. (res.) Refael Kauders, 39.\n\nWith Kaunders' death, 16 soldiers have been killed in Israel's north since October, along with 10 civilians.\n\nMore 400 people have been killed in Lebanon, including more than 70 civilians and noncombatants.\n\nIsrael and Hezbollah have been exchanging fire daily since a day after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack, which set off the war in Gaza. The deadly fighting has displaced tens of thousands of people on both sides of the Israel-Lebanon border and sparked fears of a wider regional war.\n\nISRAELI MILITARY SAYS IT'S NOT AWARE OF ANY CIVILIAN CASUALTIES IN ITS STRIKE ON A SCHOOL\n\nJERUSALEM -- Israel's military said Thursday it was not aware of any civilian casualties in a strike that killed at least 33 Palestinians, including 23 women and children, according to local officials and an AP reporter at the hospital that received the bodies.\n\nThe strike occurred early Thursday on a United Nations school sheltering displaced Palestinians in central Gaza. Israeli military spokesperson Lt. Col. Peter Lerner said intelligence indicated that militants had used the school compound to orchestrate some of the attacks on Oct. 7 and that at least 20 militants there were using it currently as a \"staging realm\" to launch attacks on Israeli soldiers.\n\n\"I'm not aware of civilians being caught up in this. We will be looking at the data and intelligence that comes out in the next few hours or day,\" Lerner told journalists.\n\nHe declined to say whether the military would investigate the strike, as it did in May when an Israeli strike nearby a tent camp sheltering displaced people killed dozens in Rafah, Gaza's southernmost city.\n\nSPAIN APPLIES TO JOIN SOUTH AFRICA'S CASE ACCUSING ISRAEL OF GENOCIDE\n\nMADRID -- Spain will ask a United Nations court for permission to join South Africa's case accusing Israel of genocide in Gaza, its foreign minister announced Thursday.\n\nSpain is the first European country to take the step after South Africa filed its case with the International Court of Justice in late 2023. It alleged that Israel was breaching the genocide convention in its military assault that has laid waste to large swaths of Gaza.\n\nMexico, Colombia, Nicaragua, Libya and the Palestinians have already requested to join the case currently being heard at the court in The Hague, Netherlands.\n\nThe court has ordered Israel to immediately halt its military offensive in the southern Gaza city of Rafah but stopped short of ordering a cease-fire for the enclave. Israel has not complied.\n\nSpain's request to join the case is the latest move by the government of Socialist Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez to support peacemaking efforts in Gaza.\n\nIsrael denies it is committing genocide in its military operation to crush Hamas triggered by its deadly Oct. 7 attacks in southern Israel.\n\nHamas killed 1,200 people and took 250 more hostage in the surprise attacks. Israel's air and land attacks have killed 36,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which doesn't distinguish between combatants and civilians.\n\nISRAELI STRIKE KILLS DOZENS AT A SCHOOL-TURNED-SHELTER IN GAZA\n\nDEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip -- An Israeli strike early Thursday on a school-turned-shelter in central Gaza that the military claimed was being used as a Hamas compound killed at least 30 people, including five children, according to local health officials.\n\nThe strike came after the military said it was launching new air and ground operations in central Gaza in an apparent widening of its nearly eight-month offensive, launched after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack. An international medical charity had reported soaring casualties even before Thursday's strike.\n\nThe Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir al-Balah received at least 30 bodies from the strike on the school run by the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees -- known by the acronym UNRWA -- and another six from a separate strike on a home, according to hospital records and an Associated Press reporter at the hospital. Hamas-run TV had earlier reported a higher toll.\n\nThe Israeli military claimed, without immediately offering evidence, that Hamas and the Islamic Jihad used the school as cover for their operations and that risk reduction steps were taken before the strike.\n\nThe war began with Hamas' Oct. 7 attack inside Israel that killed at least 1,200 people with 250 others taken hostage. The Israeli military campaign in the Gaza Strip has killed at least 36,000 Palestinians, with hundreds of others killed in operations in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.\n\nYEMEN'S HOUTHI REBELS UNVEIL A NEW SOLID-FUEL MISSILE\n\nDUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Yemen's Houthi rebels have unveiled a new, solid-fuel missile in their arsenal that resembles aspects of one earlier displayed by Iran that Tehran described as flying at hypersonic speeds.\n\nThe rebels fired their new \"Palestine\" missile, complete with a warhead painted like a Palestinian keffiyeh checkered scarf, at the southern Gulf of Aqaba port of Eilat in Israel on Monday. The attack set off air raid sirens but caused no reported damage or injuries.\n\nFootage released by the Houthis late Wednesday showed the Palestine being raised on what appeared to be a mobile launcher and rising quickly into the air with plumes of white smoke coming from its engine. White smoke is common with solid-fuel missiles.\n\nSolid-fuel missiles can be set up and fired faster than those containing liquid fuel. That's a key concern for the Houthis as their missile launch sites have been repeatedly targeted by U.S. and allied forces in recent months over the rebels' attacks on shipping through the Red Sea corridor. One such strike hit the Houthis even before they were able to launch their missile.", "source": {"uri": "santamariatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Santa Maria Times"}, "authors": [{"uri":

What have we done for them to bomb us?\n\n\"We've fled from place to place. There is no safe place. No UNRWA school is safe. No tent is safe. There is no safe place.\"\n\nHamas in a statement decried a \"new crime... against our people\", urging international pressure on Israel to stop \"these brutal massacres\".\n\nThe EU's foreign policy chief Josep Borrell called for the strike to be \"independently investigated\".\n\nA medic at the hospital said another Israeli pre-dawn strike killed six people in a house in Nuseirat refugee camp, while witnesses reported intense shelling in the Bureij and Al-Maghazi camps in the same area.\n\nIsraeli warplanes also carried out strikes in parts of Rafah, a source in Gaza's southernmost city told AFP.\n\n- Spain joins ICJ case -\n\nThe military said troops killed three suspects who had tried to breach the Gaza border fence in the Rafah area, adding no militants had crossed into Israel.\n\nIt also said a soldier was killed in Gaza on Thursday, bringing to 295 the overall death toll since the start of its ground offensive in the Palestinian territory on October 27.\n\nThe war was sparked by Hamas's October 7 attack, which resulted in the deaths of 1,194 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures.\n\nMilitants also took 251 hostages, 120 of whom remain in Gaza, including 41 the army says are dead.\n\nIsrael's retaliatory military offensive has killed at least 36,654 people in Gaza, also mostly civilians, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry.\n\nAs the fighting has raged on, Israel has faced growing diplomatic isolation, with international court cases accusing it of war crimes and several European countries recognising a Palestinian state.\n\nSpain, which last week sparked Israeli fury by formally recognising Palestinian statehood, said Thursday it would become the latest country to join South Africa's case at the International Court of Justice accusing Israel of \"genocide\" against Palestinians in Gaza.\n\nForeign Minister Jose Manuel Albares said Madrid's \"sole goal is to put an end to the war and to advance\" a two-state solution to the conflict.\n\n- Peace push -\n\nUS President Joe Biden last week outlined what he called a three-phase Israeli plan to halt the fighting for six weeks while hostages are exchanged for Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails and the delivery of aid into Gaza is stepped up.\n\nG7 powers and Arab states have backed the proposal and on Wednesday 16 world leaders including key European and Latin American players signed alongside Biden calling for Hamas to accept the deal.\n\n\"There is no time to lose. We call on Hamas to close this agreement,\" said the statement issued by the White House.\n\nMajor sticking points remain, however, with Hamas insisting on a permanent truce and full Israeli withdrawal -- demands Israel has rejected.\n\nEgypt's state-linked Al-Qahera news quoted a high-level source on Thursday saying that Cairo had \"received positive signs from the Palestinian movement signalling its aspiration for a ceasefire\".\n\nThe unnamed source said a response was expected from the militant group in the coming days.\n\nMeanwhile, the White House's Middle East coordinator Brett McGurk met Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry in Cairo where the two discussed the talks.\n\nHamas has accused Israel of dragging its feet in the negotiations, and leader Ismail Haniyeh said the Islamist movement would \"deal seriously and positively\" with any offer meeting its key demands.\n\n- Lebanon 'escalation' -\n\nThe war has sent regional tensions soaring, with violence on the rise involving Israel and its allies on the one hand, and Iran-backed armed groups on the other.\n\nRegular cross-border clashes between Israeli forces and Lebanon's Hezbollah movement, which have forced mass evacuations on both sides, have intensified in recent days.\n\nThe Israeli military on Thursday announced a soldier was killed in a Hezbollah drone strike the day before on the town of Hurfeish.\n\nIsraeli politicians have threatened more intense fighting against Hezbollah, which last fought a major war with Israel in 2006.\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday said Israel was \"prepared for a very intense operation\" along the border with Lebanon and that \"one way or another, we will restore security to the north\".\n\nThe United States appeared to warn Israel against acting, with State Department spokesman Matthew Miller saying any \"escalation\" in Lebanon would \"greatly harm Israel's overall security\".", "source": {"uri": "al-monitor.com", "dataType":

They said the death toll may rise as victims are still being brought to the hospital.\n\nThe Israeli army, for its part, admitted hitting the UNRWA school in the Nuseirat refugee camp, claiming Hamas fighters were hiding inside.\n\nThe strike took place at a sensitive moment in mediated negotiations on a cease-fire agreement entailing the release of hostages seized by Hamas on Oct. 7 and some of the Palestinians held in Israeli jails. Hamas seeks a permanent end to the war. Israel says it must destroy the resistance group first.\n\nThe United States issued a joint statement with other countries Thursday calling on Israel and Hamas to make whatever compromises were necessary to finalize a deal as the two sides gave contradictory accounts of the school attack.\n\nIsmail al-Thawabta, the director of the government media office, rejected Israel's assertion that the U.N. school in Nuseirat, in central Gaza, had hidden a Hamas command post.\n\n\"The occupation uses ... false fabricated stories to justify the brutal crime it conducted against dozens of displaced people,\" Thawabta told Reuters.\n\nIsrael's military said its fighter jets had carried out a \"precise strike\" and circulated satellite photos highlighting two parts of a building where it said the fighters were based.\n\n\"We're very confident in the intelligence,\" military spokesperson Lt Col. Peter Lerner told a briefing with reporters, accusing Hamas and Islamic Jihad members of deliberately using U.N. facilities as operational bases.\n\nHe alleged 20-30 members were located in the compound and many of them had been killed, but had no precise details as intelligence assessments were being carried out.\n\n\"I'm not aware of any civilian casualties and I'd be very, very cautious of accepting anything that Hamas puts out,\" he said.\n\nThe school, run by the U.N. Palestinian refugee agency (UNRWA), may have been hit several times, said the agency's communications director, Juliette Touma.\n\nShe said she could not confirm the death toll at this stage. Local media had earlier put the toll at 35-40. Thawabta and a medical source said 40 had been killed, including 14 children and nine women.\n\nIsrael announced a new military campaign in central Gaza on Wednesday. It says there will be no halt to fighting during cease-fire talks, which have intensified since U.S. President Joe Biden outlined a proposal on Friday.\n\nSince a weeklong truce in November, all attempts to arrange a cease-fire have failed, with each side blaming the other.\n\n\"At this decisive moment, we call on the leaders of Israel as well as Hamas to make whatever final compromises are necessary to close this deal,\" said the statement issued by the White House jointly with Argentina, Austria, Brazil, Britain, Canada and others.\n\nCIA Director William Burns met senior officials from mediators Qatar and Egypt on Wednesday in Doha to discuss the cease-fire proposal. Two Egyptian security sources said talks continued Thursday but had shown no sign of breakthrough.\n\nBiden has repeatedly declared that cease-fires were close over the past several months, only for no truce to materialize.\n\nLast week's high-profile announcement coincides with intense domestic political pressure on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to chart a path to end the eight-month-old war and negotiate the release of Israeli captives held by Hamas.\n\nThe conflict was triggered by the Oct. 7 Hamas incursion, which resulted in the death of more than 1,170 people in Israel, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.\n\nOut of 252 people taken hostage that day, 128 are still being held inside the Gaza Strip, including at least 37 who the army says are dead.\n\nIsrael has killed over 36,600 Palestinians, mostly women and children, in the Gaza Strip since, according to the Gazan Health Ministry\n\nAbout half of Hamas' forces have been wiped out in eight months of fighting, U.S. and Israeli officials told Reuters.\n\nHamas has been reduced to 9,000 to 12,000 fighters, according to three senior U.S. officials familiar with battlefield developments, down from American estimates of 20,000-25,000 before the conflict. Israel says it has lost almost 300 troops in the Gaza campaign.\n\nMeanwhile, Israel on Thursday mounted attack on southern Lebanon, where Hezbollah is based, with the U.S. State Department warning against a full-blown war.\n\nAlthough Biden described the cease-fire proposal as an Israeli offer, Israel's government has been lukewarm in public. A top Netanyahu aide confirmed Sunday that Israel had made the proposal even though it was \"not a good deal.\"\n\nFar-right members of Netanyahu's government have pledged to quit if he agrees to a peace deal that leaves Hamas in place, a move that could force a new election and end the political career of Israel's longest-serving leader.\n\nCentrist opponents who joined Netanyahu's war cabinet in a show of unity at the outset of the conflict have also threatened to quit, saying his government has no plan.", "source": {"uri": "dailysabah.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Sabah"}, "authors": [{"uri": "daily_sabah@dailysabah.com", "name": "Daily Sabah", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_refugees", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian refugees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNRWA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "UNRWA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuseirat_Camp", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nuseirat Camp"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nuseirat Camp"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internally_displaced_person", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Internally displaced person"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resistance_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Resistance movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_Mount", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Temple Mount"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massacre", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Massacre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocide", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Genocide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hostage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_Islamic_Jihad", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian Islamic Jihad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_J._Burns_(diplomat)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "William J.

There is no safe place.\"\n\nHamas in a statement decried a \"new crime... against our people\", urging international pressure on Israel to stop \"these brutal massacres\".\n\nThe EU's foreign policy chief Josep Borrell called for the strike to be \"independently investigated\".\n\nA medic at the hospital said another Israeli pre-dawn strike killed six people in a house in Nuseirat refugee camp, while witnesses reported intense shelling in the Bureij and Al-Maghazi camps in the same area.\n\nIsraeli warplanes also carried out strikes in parts of Rafah, a source in Gaza's southernmost city told AFP.\n\n- Spain joins ICJ case -\n\nThe military said troops killed three suspects who had tried to breach the Gaza border fence in the Rafah area, adding no militants had crossed into Israel.\n\nIt also said a soldier was killed in Gaza on Thursday, bringing to 295 the overall death toll since the start of its ground offensive in the Palestinian territory on October 27.\n\nThe war was sparked by Hamas's October 7 attack, which resulted in the deaths of 1,194 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures.\n\nMilitants also took 251 hostages, 120 of whom remain in Gaza, including 41 the army says are dead.\n\nIsrael's retaliatory military offensive has killed at least 36,654 people in Gaza, also mostly civilians, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry.\n\nAs the fighting has raged on, Israel has faced growing diplomatic isolation, with international court cases accusing it of war crimes and several European countries recognising a Palestinian state.\n\nSpain, which last week sparked Israeli fury by formally recognising Palestinian statehood, said Thursday it would become the latest country to join South Africa's case at the International Court of Justice accusing Israel of \"genocide\" against Palestinians in Gaza.\n\nForeign Minister Jose Manuel Albares said Madrid's \"sole goal is to put an end to the war and to advance\" a two-state solution to the conflict.\n\n- Peace push -\n\nUS President Joe Biden last week outlined what he called a three-phase Israeli plan to halt the fighting for six weeks while hostages are exchanged for Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails and the delivery of aid into Gaza is stepped up.\n\nG7 powers and Arab states have backed the proposal and on Wednesday 16 world leaders including key European and Latin American players signed alongside Biden calling for Hamas to accept the deal.\n\n\"There is no time to lose. We call on Hamas to close this agreement,\" said the statement issued by the White House.\n\nMajor sticking points remain, however, with Hamas insisting on a permanent truce and full Israeli withdrawal -- demands Israel has rejected.\n\nEgypt's state-linked Al-Qahera news quoted a high-level source on Thursday saying that Cairo had \"received positive signs from the Palestinian movement signalling its aspiration for a ceasefire\".\n\nThe unnamed source said a response was expected from the militant group in the coming days.\n\nMeanwhile, the White House's Middle East coordinator Brett McGurk met Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry in Cairo where the two discussed the talks.\n\nHamas has accused Israel of dragging its feet in the negotiations, and leader Ismail Haniyeh said the Islamist movement would \"deal seriously and positively\" with any offer meeting its key demands.\n\n- Lebanon 'escalation' -\n\nThe war has sent regional tensions soaring, with violence on the rise involving Israel and its allies on the one hand, and Iran-backed armed groups on the other.\n\nRegular cross-border clashes between Israeli forces and Lebanon's Hezbollah movement, which have forced mass evacuations on both sides, have intensified in recent days.\n\nThe Israeli military on Thursday announced a soldier was killed in a Hezbollah drone strike the day before on the town of Hurfeish.\n\nIsraeli politicians have threatened more intense fighting against Hezbollah, which last fought a major war with Israel in 2006.\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday said Israel was \"prepared for a very intense operation\" along the border with Lebanon and that \"one way or another, we will restore security to the north\".\n\nThe United States appeared to warn Israel against acting, with State Department spokesman Matthew Miller saying any \"escalation\" in Lebanon would \"greatly harm Israel's overall security\".", "source": {"uri":

Spain's foreign minister announced Thursday that the country would ask a United Nations court for permission to join South Africa's case accusing Israel of genocide in Gaza.

United Nations agencies say over 1 million in Gaza could experience the highest level of starvation by mid-July.\n\nIsrael launched the war after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack, in which militants stormed into southern Israel, killed some 1,200 people -- mostly civilians -- and abducted about 250.

It alleged that Israel was breaching the genocide convention in its military assault that has laid waste to large swaths of Gaza.\n\nMexico, Colombia, Nicaragua, Libya and the Palestinians have already requested to join the case currently being heard at the court in The Hague, Netherlands.\n\nThe court has ordered Israel to immediately halt its military offensive in the southern Gaza city of Rafah but stopped short of ordering a cease-fire for the enclave. Israel has not complied.\n\nSpain's request to join the case is the latest move by the government of Socialist Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez to support peacemaking efforts in Gaza.\n\nIsrael denies it is committing genocide in its military operation to crush Hamas triggered by its deadly Oct. 7 attacks in southern Israel.\n\nHamas killed 1,200 people and took 250 more hostage in the surprise attacks. Israel's air and land attacks have killed 36,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which doesn't distinguish between combatants and civilians.\n\nDEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip -- An Israeli strike early Thursday on a school-turned-shelter in central Gaza that the military claimed was being used as a Hamas compound killed at least 30 people, including five children, according to local health officials.\n\nThe strike came after the military said it was launching new air and ground operations in central Gaza in an apparent widening of its nearly eight-month offensive, launched after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack. An international medical charity had reported soaring casualties even before Thursday's strike.\n\nThe Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir al-Balah received at least 30 bodies from the strike on the school run by the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees -- known by the acronym UNRWA -- and another six from a separate strike on a home, according to hospital records and an Associated Press reporter at the hospital. Hamas-run TV had earlier reported a higher toll.\n\nThe Israeli military claimed, without immediately offering evidence, that Hamas and the Islamic Jihad used the school as cover for their operations and that risk reduction steps were taken before the strike.\n\nThe war began with Hamas' Oct. 7 attack inside Israel that killed at least 1,200 people with 250 others taken hostage. The Israeli military campaign in the Gaza Strip has killed at least 36,000 Palestinians, with hundreds of others killed in operations in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.\n\nDUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Yemen's Houthi rebels have unveiled a new, solid-fuel missile in their arsenal that resembles aspects of one earlier displayed by Iran that Tehran described as flying at hypersonic speeds.\n\nThe rebels fired their new \"Palestine\" missile, complete with a warhead painted like a Palestinian keffiyeh checkered scarf, at the southern Gulf of Aqaba port of Eilat in Israel on Monday. The attack set off air raid sirens but caused no reported damage or injuries.\n\nFootage released by the Houthis late Wednesday showed the Palestine being raised on what appeared to be a mobile launcher and rising quickly into the air with plumes of white smoke coming from its engine. White smoke is common with solid-fuel missiles.\n\nSolid-fuel missiles can be set up and fired faster than those containing liquid fuel. That's a key concern for the Houthis as their missile launch sites have been repeatedly targeted by U.S. and allied forces in recent months over the rebels' attacks on shipping through the Red Sea corridor. One such strike hit the Houthis even before they were able to launch their missile.", "source": {"uri": "wivb.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "wivb4"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

There is no safe place.\"\n\nHamas in a statement decried a \"new crime... against our people\", urging international pressure on Israel to stop \"these brutal massacres\".\n\nThe EU's foreign policy chief Josep Borrell called for the strike to be \"independently investigated\".\n\nA medic at the hospital said another Israeli pre-dawn strike killed six people in a house in Nuseirat refugee camp, while witnesses reported intense shelling in the Bureij and Al-Maghazi camps in the same area.\n\nIsraeli warplanes also carried out strikes in parts of Rafah, a source in Gaza's southernmost city told AFP.\n\n- Spain joins ICJ case -\n\nThe military said troops killed three suspects who had tried to breach the Gaza border fence in the Rafah area, adding no militants had crossed into Israel.\n\nIt also said a soldier was killed in Gaza on Thursday, bringing to 295 the overall death toll since the start of its ground offensive in the Palestinian territory on October 27.\n\nThe war was sparked by Hamas's October 7 attack, which resulted in the deaths of 1,194 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures.\n\nMilitants also took 251 hostages, 120 of whom remain in Gaza, including 41 the army says are dead.\n\nIsrael's retaliatory military offensive has killed at least 36,654 people in Gaza, also mostly civilians, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry.\n\nAs the fighting has raged on, Israel has faced growing diplomatic isolation, with international court cases accusing it of war crimes and several European countries recognising a Palestinian state.\n\nMore from this section Philippines: Kanlaon Volcano Eruption - Lahar Roars Through Town In La Castellana 4 Americans Skeptical About Switching to EVs Amid Challenges Rihanna Unveils Fenty Hair for Diverse Hair Needs\n\nSpain, which last week sparked Israeli fury by formally recognising Palestinian statehood, said Thursday it would become the latest country to join South Africa's case at the International Court of Justice accusing Israel of \"genocide\" against Palestinians in Gaza.\n\nForeign Minister Jose Manuel Albares said Madrid's \"sole goal is to put an end to the war and to advance\" a two-state solution to the conflict.\n\n- Peace push -\n\nUS President Joe Biden last week outlined what he called a three-phase Israeli plan to halt the fighting for six weeks while hostages are exchanged for Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails and the delivery of aid into Gaza is stepped up.\n\nG7 powers and Arab states have backed the proposal and on Wednesday 16 world leaders including key European and Latin American players signed alongside Biden calling for Hamas to accept the deal.\n\n\"There is no time to lose. We call on Hamas to close this agreement,\" said the statement issued by the White House.\n\nMajor sticking points remain, however, with Hamas insisting on a permanent truce and full Israeli withdrawal -- demands Israel has rejected.\n\nEgypt's state-linked Al-Qahera news quoted a high-level source on Thursday saying that Cairo had \"received positive signs from the Palestinian movement signalling its aspiration for a ceasefire\".\n\nThe unnamed source said a response was expected from the militant group in the coming days.\n\nMeanwhile, the White House's Middle East coordinator Brett McGurk met Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry in Cairo where the two discussed the talks.\n\nHamas has accused Israel of dragging its feet in the negotiations, and leader Ismail Haniyeh said the Islamist movement would \"deal seriously and positively\" with any offer meeting its key demands.\n\n- Lebanon 'escalation' -\n\nThe war has sent regional tensions soaring, with violence on the rise involving Israel and its allies on the one hand, and Iran-backed armed groups on the other.\n\nRegular cross-border clashes between Israeli forces and Lebanon's Hezbollah movement, which have forced mass evacuations on both sides, have intensified in recent days.\n\nThe Israeli military on Thursday announced a soldier was killed in a Hezbollah drone strike the day before on the town of Hurfeish.\n\nIsraeli politicians have threatened more intense fighting against Hezbollah, which last fought a major war with Israel in 2006.\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday said Israel was \"prepared for a very intense operation\" along the border with Lebanon and that \"one way or another, we will restore security to the north\".\n\nThe United States appeared to warn Israel against acting, with State Department spokesman Matthew Miller saying any \"escalation\" in Lebanon would \"greatly harm Israel's overall security\".\n\nburs-dcp/dv", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com",

The school was filled with Palestinians who had fled Israeli offensives and bombardment in northern Gaza, they said.\n\nFootage showed bodies wrapped in blankets or plastic bags being laid out in lines in the courtyard of the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, which was largely dark as staff tried to conserve limited fuel for electricity.\n\nThe hospital, the nearby town of Deir al-Balah, received at least 37 dead from the strike, including 14 children and nine women, according to Agence France-Presse, who received the tally from the hospital.\n\nThe strike came after the military announced a new ground and air assault in several refugee camps in central Gaza, pursuing Hamas militants it says have regrouped there. It's the latest instance of troops sweeping back into sections of the Gaza Strip they have previously invaded, underscoring the resilience of the militant group despite Israel's nearly eight-month onslaught in the territory.\n\nThe Israeli military said Hamas had embedded a \"compound\" within the school and that Hamas and Islamic Jihad militants inside were using it as a shelter where they were planning attacks against Israeli troops, though it did not immediately offer evidence.

Israel's military later said it was not aware of any civilian casualties in the strike on the school in Nuseirat refugee camp.\n\nCasualties from the school strike -- including 14 children and nine women -- were taken to a hospital in nearby Deir al-Balah, as documented by hospital records and an Associated Press journalist. The hospital has already been overwhelmed by a stream of ambulances since Israeli forces launched a new offensive in central Gaza this week.\n\nInternational pressure has been mounting on Israel to limit civilian bloodshed in its war against Hamas in Gaza. Spain's foreign minister announced Thursday that the country would ask a United Nations court for permission to join South Africa's case accusing Israel of genocide in Gaza. Israel strongly denies the accusation.\n\nMore than 36,000 Palestinians have been killed by eight months of Israeli bombardments and ground offensives in Gaza, according to the Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians.\n\nThe war has largely cut off the flow of food, medicine and other supplies to Palestinians who are facing widespread hunger. United Nations agencies say over 1 million in Gaza could experience the highest level of starvation by mid-July.\n\nIsrael launched the war after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack, in which militants stormed into southern Israel, killed some 1,200 people -- mostly civilians -- and abducted about 250.

It said the forces also arrested a suspected militant.\n\nViolence has surged in the Israeli-occupied West Bank since Hamas' Oct. 7 attack triggered the war in Gaza. Israel has carried out frequent arrest raids that often ignite gunbattles. Settler violence and Palestinian attacks on Israelis have also been on the rise.\n\nThe Health Ministry, part of the Western-backed Palestinian Authority, says around 530 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank since the start of the Gaza war.\n\nIsrael captured the West Bank, the Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem in the 1967 Mideast war. The Palestinians want all three territories for their future state.\n\nThe 3 million Palestinians in the West Bank live under seemingly open-ended Israeli military rule, while the more than 500,000 Jewish settlers in the territory have Israeli citizenship.\n\nMORE THAN A DOZEN COUNTRIES JOIN U.S. IN STATEMENT SUPPORTING BIDEN'S GAZA PLAN\n\nWASHINGTON -- More than a dozen countries joined the U.S. in a statement Thursday to show support for U.S. President Joe Biden's proposed deal to release the remaining hostages in Gaza and end the grinding Mideast war.\n\nThe statement was signed by the leaders of Argentina, Austria, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, Colombia, Denmark, France, Germany, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Serbia, Spain, Thailand and the United Kingdom as well as the United States.\n\n\"As leaders of countries deeply concerned for the hostages held by Hamas in Gaza, including many of our own citizens, we fully support the movement towards a ceasefire and hostage release deal now on the table and as outlined by President Biden on May 31, 2024,\" the statement said. \"There is no time to lose.\"\n\nThe United States has thrown its weight behind the phased cease-fire and hostage release outlined by Biden last week. But Israel says it won't end the war without destroying Hamas, while the militant group is demanding a lasting cease-fire and the full withdrawal of Israeli forces.\n\nFar-right members of Netanyahu's government have threatened to bring down the coalition if he signs onto a cease-fire deal.\n\nISRAEL'S MILITARY SAYS IT TRADED FIRE WITH PALESTINIAN MILITANTS JUST YARDS FROM GAZA BORDER\n\nJERUSALEM -- The Israeli military says it traded fire with Palestinian militants in southern Gaza some 300 meters (yards) from the Israeli border.\n\nThe fighters appeared to have infiltrated a heavily guarded buffer zone.\n\nLt. Col. Peter Lerner, an Israeli military spokesman, said the gunbattle erupted before dawn on Thursday. He said two militants were killed from the air and a third in a tank strike.\n\nIsraeli media later reported that an Israeli soldier was killed in the shootout. The military confirmed that a soldier was killed during a confrontation with militants in southern Gaza early Thursday but declined to say whether it was linked to the infiltration attempt.\n\nSatellite photos earlier this year showed extensive demolition inside Gaza along the border. Israel appears to have established a buffer zone despite international objections.\n\nThe United States, which has provided key military aid for Israel's nearly eight-month offensive, has said Gaza's territory should not shrink. Israel says it needs a buffer zone to prevent Hamas from carrying out another attack into southern Israel like the one on Oct. 7 that ignited the war.\n\nISRAEL'S REPRESENTATIVE RESIGNS FROM ICJ JUDGE PANEL OVERSEEING GENOCIDE CASE\n\nJERUSALEM -- Israel's representative on the panel of judges hearing the genocide case against Israel at the world's top court resigned from his post, citing personal reasons, according to a letter he sent to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu seen by The Associated Press on Thursday.\n\nJustice Aharon Barak, a former attorney general and peace negotiator who served as chief justice of Israel's highest court from 1995 to 2006, wrote Tuesday to Netanyahu, telling him that he had sent the president of the International Court of Justice a resignation letter.\n\n\"My resignation is for personal and family reasons,\" he wrote to Netanyahu. \"Thank you for the trust placed in me.\"\n\nBarak was one of four justices on the court who said the ICJ's ruling that Israel cease operations in Rafah, Gaza's southernmost city, did not mean Israel needed to stop operations there entirely. He said Israel could still operate in Gaza but needed to avoid causing undue harm to Palestinian civilians and contravening Israel's obligations under the Genocide Convention.\n\nIsraeli President Isaac Herzog, whose position is largely ceremonial, thanked Barak on Thursday for serving on the court in a statement posted to X, adding: \"We will continue to stand firm against the evil, the hypocrisy and the false accusations leveled against the State of Israel and the IDF,\" using an acronym for Israel's military.\n\nRECENT DRONE STRIKE IN NORTHERN ISRAEL KILLED A RESERVE SOLDIER, MILITARY SAYS\n\nJERUSALEM -- Israel's military said Thursday that a drone strike on a village in northern Israel the day before killed an Israeli reserve soldier.\n\nThe Lebanese militant group Hezbollah said it launched an attack toward a gathering of military officials in response to an earlier Israeli cross-border attack.\n\nIsrael's military said two explosive drones were fired toward Hurfeish, a northern village in Israel.\n\nAir raid sirens did not go off ahead of the strike, and Israeli authorities said that the strike wounded over 10 people in addition to the one soldier killed. The military identified the fallen soldier as Staff Sgt. (res.) Refael Kauders, 39.\n\nWith Kaunders' death, 16 soldiers have been killed in Israel's north since October, along with 10 civilians.\n\nMore 400 people have been killed in Lebanon, including more than 70 civilians and noncombatants.\n\nIsrael and Hezbollah have been exchanging fire daily since a day after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack, which set off the war in Gaza. The deadly fighting has displaced tens of thousands of people on both sides of the Israel-Lebanon border and sparked fears of a wider regional war.\n\nISRAELI MILITARY SAYS IT'S NOT AWARE OF ANY CIVILIAN CASUALTIES IN ITS STRIKE ON A SCHOOL\n\nJERUSALEM -- Israel's military said Thursday it was not aware of any civilian casualties in a strike that killed at least 33 Palestinians, including 23 women and children, according to local officials and an AP reporter at the hospital that received the bodies.\n\nThe strike occurred early Thursday on a United Nations school sheltering displaced Palestinians in central Gaza. Israeli military spokesperson Lt. Col. Peter Lerner said intelligence indicated that militants had used the school compound to orchestrate some of the attacks on Oct. 7 and that at least 20 militants there were using it currently as a \"staging realm\" to launch attacks on Israeli soldiers.\n\n\"I'm not aware of civilians being caught up in this. We will be looking at the data and intelligence that comes out in the next few hours or day,\" Lerner told journalists.\n\nHe declined to say whether the military would investigate the strike, as it did in May when an Israeli strike nearby a tent camp sheltering displaced people killed dozens in Rafah, Gaza's southernmost city.\n\nSPAIN APPLIES TO JOIN SOUTH AFRICA'S CASE ACCUSING ISRAEL OF GENOCIDE\n\nMADRID -- Spain will ask a United Nations court for permission to join South Africa's case accusing Israel of genocide in Gaza, its foreign minister announced Thursday.\n\nSpain is the first European country to take the step after South Africa filed its case with the International Court of Justice in late 2023. It alleged that Israel was breaching the genocide convention in its military assault that has laid waste to large swaths of Gaza.\n\nMexico, Colombia, Nicaragua, Libya and the Palestinians have already requested to join the case currently being heard at the court in The Hague, Netherlands.\n\nThe court has ordered Israel to immediately halt its military offensive in the southern Gaza city of Rafah but stopped short of ordering a cease-fire for the enclave. Israel has not complied.\n\nSpain's request to join the case is the latest move by the government of Socialist Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez to support peacemaking efforts in Gaza.\n\nIsrael denies it is committing genocide in its military operation to crush Hamas triggered by its deadly Oct. 7 attacks in southern Israel.\n\nHamas killed 1,200 people and took 250 more hostage in the surprise attacks. Israel's air and land attacks have killed 36,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which doesn't distinguish between combatants and civilians.\n\nISRAELI STRIKE KILLS DOZENS AT A SCHOOL-TURNED-SHELTER IN GAZA\n\nDEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip -- An Israeli strike early Thursday on a school-turned-shelter in central Gaza that the military claimed was being used as a Hamas compound killed at least 30 people, including five children, according to local health officials.\n\nThe strike came after the military said it was launching new air and ground operations in central Gaza in an apparent widening of its nearly eight-month offensive, launched after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack. An international medical charity had reported soaring casualties even before Thursday's strike.\n\nThe Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir al-Balah received at least 30 bodies from the strike on the school run by the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees -- known by the acronym UNRWA -- and another six from a separate strike on a home, according to hospital records and an Associated Press reporter at the hospital. Hamas-run TV had earlier reported a higher toll.\n\nThe Israeli military claimed, without immediately offering evidence, that Hamas and the Islamic Jihad used the school as cover for their operations and that risk reduction steps were taken before the strike.\n\nThe war began with Hamas' Oct. 7 attack inside Israel that killed at least 1,200 people with 250 others taken hostage. The Israeli military campaign in the Gaza Strip has killed at least 36,000 Palestinians, with hundreds of others killed in operations in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.\n\nYEMEN'S HOUTHI REBELS UNVEIL A NEW SOLID-FUEL MISSILE\n\nDUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Yemen's Houthi rebels have unveiled a new, solid-fuel missile in their arsenal that resembles aspects of one earlier displayed by Iran that Tehran described as flying at hypersonic speeds.\n\nThe rebels fired their new \"Palestine\" missile, complete with a warhead painted like a Palestinian keffiyeh checkered scarf, at the southern Gulf of Aqaba port of Eilat in Israel on Monday. The attack set off air raid sirens but caused no reported damage or injuries.\n\nFootage released by the Houthis late Wednesday showed the Palestine being raised on what appeared to be a mobile launcher and rising quickly into the air with plumes of white smoke coming from its engine. White smoke is common with solid-fuel missiles.\n\nSolid-fuel missiles can be set up and fired faster than those containing liquid fuel. That's a key concern for the Houthis as their missile launch sites have been repeatedly targeted by U.S. and allied forces in recent months over the rebels' attacks on shipping through the Red Sea corridor.

Military claims it was being used by Hamas", "body": "DEIR AL-BALAH: An Israeli strike early Thursday on a school sheltering displaced Palestinians in central Gaza killed more than 30 people, including 23 women and children, according to local health officials. The Israeli military said Hamas militants were operating from within the school.\n\nThe strike came after the military announced a new ground and air assault in several refugee camps in central Gaza, pursuing Hamas militants it says have regrouped there. It's the latest instance of troops sweeping back into sections of the Gaza Strip they have previously invaded, underscoring the resilience of the militant group despite Israel's nearly eight-month onslaught in the territory.\n\nWitnesses and hospital officials said the predawn strike hit the al-Sardi School, run by the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees known by the acronym UNRWA. The school was filled with Palestinians who had fled Israeli offensives and bombardment in northern Gaza, they said.\n\nAyman Rashed, a man displaced from Gaza City who was sheltering at the school, said the missiles hit classrooms on the second and third floor where families were sheltering. He said he helped carry out five dead, including an old man and two children, one with his head shattered open. \"It was dark, with no electricity, and we struggled to get out the victims,\" Rashed said.\n\nThe Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in the nearby town of Deir al-Balah received at least 33 dead from the strike, including 14 children and nine women, according to hospital records and an Associated Press reporter at the hospital. Another strike on a house overnight killed six people, according to the records. Both strikes occurred in Nuseirat, one of several built-up refugee camps in Gaza dating to the 1948 war surrounding Israel's creation, when hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were driven from their homes in what became the new state.\n\nMohammed al-Kareem, a displaced Palestinian sheltering near the hospital, described chaotic scenes outside the facility. He said vehicles arrived one after the other, as distressed people rushed wounded people into the emergency department. Videos circulating online appeared to show several wounded people being treated on the floor of the hospital, a common scene in Gaza's overwhelmed medical wards.\n\nFootage showed bodies wrapped in blankets or plastic bags being laid out in lines in the courtyard of the hospital, which was largely dark as staff try to conserve limited fuel for electricity. Al-Kareem said he saw people searching for their loved ones among bodies, and that one woman kept asking medical workers to open the wraps on the bodies to see if her son was inside.\n\n\"The situation is tragic,\" he said.\n\nThe Israeli military said Hamas had embedded a \"compound\" within the school and that Hamas and Islamic Jihad militants inside were using it as a shelter where they were planning attacks against Israeli troops, though it did not immediately offer evidence. It released a photo of the school, pointing to classrooms on the second and third floor where it claimed militants were located.", "source": {"uri": "newindianexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New Indian Express"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@newindianexpress.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Izz_ad-Din_al-Qassam_Brigades", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_City", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_refugees", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian refugees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internally_displaced_person", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internally displaced person"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugee_camp", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Refugee camp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNRWA", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UNRWA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuseirat_Camp", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nuseirat Camp"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nuseirat Camp"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deir_al-Balah", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Deir al-Balah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Deir al-Balah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_Mount", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Temple Mount"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acronym", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Acronym"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_Islamic_Jihad", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian Islamic Jihad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Facilities", "label": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Facilities", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Hospitality/Education_and_Training", "label": "dmoz/Business/Hospitality/Education and Training", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Refugees", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Refugees", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Nutrition/School_Meals", "label": "dmoz/Health/Nutrition/School Meals", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 50}], "image": "https://media.assettype.com/newindianexpress%2F2024-06%2F1b6ad718-64c6-4cdb-a296-bf6d1098441c%2FAP24158073469665.jpg?w=1200&ar=40%3A21&auto=format%2Ccompress&ogImage=true&mode=crop&enlarge=true&overlay=false&overlay_position=bottom&overlay_width=100", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9626324", "eventUri": "eng-9626324", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3333333333333334, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

Spain's foreign minister announced Thursday that the country would ask a United Nations court for permission to join South Africa's case accusing Israel of genocide in Gaza. United States President Joe Biden's administration has launched an intense drive to persuade Hamas and Israel to accept a new cease-fire and hostage release proposal, which has raised hopes of ending the war.\n\nIsrael's war against Hamas in Gaza has killed more than 36,000 Palestinians, according to the Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians.\n\nThe eight-month war in Gaza has largely cut off the flow of food, medicine and other supplies to Palestinians who are facing widespread hunger. United Nations agencies say over 1 million in Gaza could experience the highest level of starvation by mid-July.\n\nIsrael launched the war after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack, in which militants stormed into southern Israel, killed some 1,200 people -- mostly civilians -- and abducted about 250.

It claimed the bombing \"eliminated terrorists who were planning to carry out attacks\" against its forces.\n\nHamas rejected the Israeli statement.\n\n\"The occupation uses lying to the public opinion through false, fabricated stories to justify the brutal crime it conducted against dozens of displaced people,\" al-Thawabta told the Reuters news agency.\n\nThe attack on al-Sardi comes as Israeli forces stepped up their bombardment of Gaza, and the United States continued to press ahead with an effort to secure a ceasefire deal.\n\nAl Jazeera's Hani Mahmoud, reporting from Deir el-Balah in central Gaza, said prior to the latest attack on Nuseirat, Israeli forces had killed at least 102 people in 24 hours. These included attacks on the Bureij and Maghazi refugee camps, also located in central Gaza.\n\nDoctors Without Borders, in a statement earlier on Wednesday, described the situation in Gaza as \"apocalyptic\". The group, which is known by its French acronym MSF, said the Al-Aqsa Hospital had received 70 dead people and more than 300 injured since Tuesday, and that the majority of the casualties were women and children.\n\n\"The odour of blood in the hospital's emergency room this morning was unbearable. There are people lying everywhere, on the floor, outside ... bodies were being brought in plastic bags. The situation is overwhelming,\" said Karin Huster, an MSF official.\n\nShe said the \"insane escalation of violence\" across the Gaza Strip and the closure of the Rafah border crossing - which has halted most humanitarian deliveries into the Palestinian enclave - has stretched the health system to the \"point of collapse\".\n\n\"This man-made catastrophe needs to stop now,\" she added.\n\nAt least 36,586 Palestinians have been killed and 83,074 have been injured in Israel's eight-month war on Gaza. The brutal assault, which some countries and UN experts say amounts to genocide, began after Hamas fighters launched attacks inside Israel on October 7 of last year, killing at least 1,139 people and taking dozens of others captive.\n\nEfforts to end the war have so far made little headway.\n\nWilliam Burns, the director of the CIA, was in Qatar's capital, Doha, on Wednesday to discuss a three-phase truce proposal touted last week by US President Joe Biden. The first phase calls for a six-week ceasefire, during which Hamas would free some of the captives and Israeli forces would withdraw from Gaza's population centres and negotiations would continue for a permanent truce.\n\nRegional and international powers have backed the proposal, but sticking points remain. Hamas has insisted on a permanent ceasefire and full withdrawal of Israeli troops.\n\nIsrael, however, has rejected those demands, saying it is prepared to discuss only temporary pauses until Hamas is defeated.\n\nIsmail Haniyeh, the leader of Hamas, on Wednesday reiterated the group's stance.\n\n\"The movement and factions of the resistance will deal seriously and positively with any agreement that is based on a comprehensive ending of the aggression and the complete withdrawal and prisoners swap,\" he said.\n\nMeanwhile, Israel's Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said there would be no halt to the fighting as negotiations over the ceasefire proposal continued.\n\n\"Any negotiations with Hamas would be conducted only under fire,\" Gallant was quoted as saying as he flew on board a plane to inspect the Israeli offensive in Gaza.", "source": {"uri": "aljazeera.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Al Jazeera Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Israel claimed Thursday the school was being used as a Hamas compound, without providing evidence.\n\nThe Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir al-Balah received at least 30 bodies from the strike on the school run by the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees -- known by the acronym UNRWA -- and another six from a separate strike on a home. Israel's military later said it was not aware of any civilian casualties in the strike on the school.\n\nInternational pressure has been mounting to limit civilian bloodshed in the Israel-Hamas war. Spain's foreign minister announced Thursday that the country would ask a United Nations court for permission to join South Africa's case accusing Israel of genocide in Gaza. United States President Joe Biden's administration has launched an intense drive to persuade Hamas and Israel to accept a new cease-fire and hostage release proposal, which has raised hopes of ending the war.\n\nIsrael's war against Hamas in Gaza has killed more than 36,000 Palestinians, according to the Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians.\n\nThe eight-month war in Gaza has largely cut off the flow of food, medicine and other supplies to Palestinians who are facing widespread hunger. United Nations agencies say over 1 million in Gaza could experience the highest level of starvation by mid-July.\n\nIsrael launched the war after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack, in which militants stormed into southern Israel, killed some 1,200 people -- mostly civilians -- and abducted about 250. Around 80 hostages captured on Oct. 7 are believed to still be alive in Gaza, alongside the remains of 43 others.\n\nCurrently:\n\n-- Israeli strike on a Gaza school that military says was being used by Hamas kills 30 people.\n\n-- Spain applies to join South Africa's case at top the U.N. court accusing Israel of genocide.\n\n-- One image, millions of eyeballs: A social media effort to draw attention to Rafah surges.\n\n-- Israeli settlers in the West Bank were hit with international sanctions.

The military identified the fallen soldier as Staff Sgt. (res.) Refael Kauders, 39.\n\nWith Kaunders' death, 16 soldiers have been killed in Israel's north since October, along with 10 civilians.\n\nMore 400 people have been killed in Lebanon, including more than 70 civilians and noncombatants.\n\nIsrael and Hezbollah have been exchanging fire daily since a day after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack, which set off the war in Gaza. The deadly fighting has displaced tens of thousands of people on both sides of the Israel-Lebanon border and sparked fears of a wider regional war.\n\nISRAELI MILITARY SAYS IT'S NOT AWARE OF ANY CIVILIAN CASUALTIES IN ITS STRIKE ON A SCHOOL\n\nJERUSALEM -- Israel's military said Thursday it was not aware of any civilian casualties in a strike that killed at least 33 Palestinians, including 23 women and children, according to local officials and an AP reporter at the hospital that received the bodies.\n\nThe strike occurred early Thursday on a United Nations school sheltering displaced Palestinians in central Gaza. Israeli military spokesperson Lt. Col. Peter Lerner said intelligence indicated that militants had used the school compound to orchestrate some of the attacks on Oct. 7 and that at least 20 militants there were using it currently as a \"staging realm\" to launch attacks on Israeli soldiers.\n\n\"I'm not aware of civilians being caught up in this. We will be looking at the data and intelligence that comes out in the next few hours or day,\" Lerner told journalists.\n\nHe declined to say whether the military would investigate the strike, as it did in May when an Israeli strike nearby a tent camp sheltering displaced people killed dozens in Rafah, Gaza's southernmost city.\n\nSPAIN APPLIES TO JOIN SOUTH AFRICA'S CASE ACCUSING ISRAEL OF GENOCIDE\n\nMADRID -- Spain will ask a United Nations court for permission to join South Africa's case accusing Israel of genocide in Gaza, its foreign minister announced Thursday.\n\nSpain is the first European country to take the step after South Africa filed its case with the International Court of Justice in late 2023. It alleged that Israel was breaching the genocide convention in its military assault that has laid waste to large swaths of Gaza.\n\nMexico, Colombia, Nicaragua, Libya and the Palestinians have already requested to join the case currently being heard at the court in The Hague, Netherlands.\n\nThe court has ordered Israel to immediately halt its military offensive in the southern Gaza city of Rafah but stopped short of ordering a cease-fire for the enclave. Israel has not complied.\n\nSpain's request to join the case is the latest move by the government of Socialist Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez to support peacemaking efforts in Gaza.\n\nIsrael denies it is committing genocide in its military operation to crush Hamas triggered by its deadly Oct. 7 attacks in southern Israel.\n\nHamas killed 1,200 people and took 250 more hostage in the surprise attacks. Israel's air and land attacks have killed 36,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which doesn't distinguish between combatants and civilians.\n\nISRAELI STRIKE KILLS DOZENS AT A SCHOOL-TURNED-SHELTER IN GAZA\n\nDEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip -- An Israeli strike early Thursday on a school-turned-shelter in central Gaza that the military claimed was being used as a Hamas compound killed at least 30 people, including five children, according to local health officials.\n\nThe strike came after the military said it was launching new air and ground operations in central Gaza in an apparent widening of its nearly eight-month offensive, launched after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack. An international medical charity had reported soaring casualties even before Thursday's strike.\n\nThe Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir al-Balah received at least 30 bodies from the strike on the school run by the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees -- known by the acronym UNRWA -- and another six from a separate strike on a home, according to hospital records and an Associated Press reporter at the hospital. Hamas-run TV had earlier reported a higher toll.\n\nThe Israeli military claimed, without immediately offering evidence, that Hamas and the Islamic Jihad used the school as cover for their operations and that risk reduction steps were taken before the strike.\n\nThe war began with Hamas' Oct. 7 attack inside Israel that killed at least 1,200 people with 250 others taken hostage. The Israeli military campaign in the Gaza Strip has killed at least 36,000 Palestinians, with hundreds of others killed in operations in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.\n\nYEMEN'S HOUTHI REBELS UNVEIL A NEW SOLID-FUEL MISSILE\n\nDUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Yemen's Houthi rebels have unveiled a new, solid-fuel missile in their arsenal that resembles aspects of one earlier displayed by Iran that Tehran described as flying at hypersonic speeds.\n\nThe rebels fired their new \"Palestine\" missile, complete with a warhead painted like a Palestinian keffiyeh checkered scarf, at the southern Gulf of Aqaba port of Eilat in Israel on Monday. The attack set off air raid sirens but caused no reported damage or injuries.\n\nFootage released by the Houthis late Wednesday showed the Palestine being raised on what appeared to be a mobile launcher and rising quickly into the air with plumes of white smoke coming from its engine. White smoke is common with solid-fuel missiles.\n\nSolid-fuel missiles can be set up and fired faster than those containing liquid fuel. That's a key concern for the Houthis as their missile launch sites have been repeatedly targeted by U.S. and allied forces in recent months over the rebels' attacks on shipping through the Red Sea corridor. One such strike hit the Houthis even before they were able to launch their missile.", "source": {"uri": "ktalnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KTALnews.com"}, "authors": [{"uri":

It claimed the bombing \"eliminated terrorists who were planning to carry out attacks\" against its forces.\n\nHamas rejected the Israeli statement.\n\n\"The occupation uses lying to the public opinion through false, fabricated stories to justify the brutal crime it conducted against dozens of displaced people,\" al-Thawabta told the Reuters news agency.\n\nThe attack on al-Sardi came as Israeli forces stepped up their bombardment of Gaza even as the United States and mediators continued to press ahead with an effort to secure a ceasefire deal.\n\nAl Jazeera's Hani Mahmoud, reporting from Deir el-Balah in central Gaza, said prior to the latest attack on Nuseirat, Israeli forces had killed at least 102 people in 24 hours. These included attacks on the Bureij and Maghazi refugee camps, also located in central Gaza.\n\nDoctors Without Borders, in a statement earlier on Wednesday, described the situation in Gaza as \"apocalyptic\". The group, which is known by its French acronym MSF, said the Al-Aqsa Hospital had received 70 dead people and more than 300 injured since Tuesday, and that the majority of the casualties were women and children.\n\n\"The odour of blood in the hospital's emergency room this morning was unbearable. There are people lying everywhere, on the floor, outside ... bodies were being brought in plastic bags. The situation is overwhelming,\" said Karin Huster, an MSF official.\n\nThe \"insane escalation of violence\" across the Gaza Strip and the closure of the Rafah border crossing - which has halted most humanitarian deliveries into the Palestinian enclave - has stretched the health system to the \"point of collapse\", she said.\n\n\"This man-made catastrophe needs to stop now,\" she added.\n\nAt least 36,586 Palestinians have been killed and 83,074 have been wounded in Israel's eight-month war on Gaza. The brutal assault, which some countries and UN experts say amounts to genocide, began after Hamas fighters launched attacks inside Israel on October 7 of last year, killing at least 1,139 people and taking dozens of others captive.\n\nEfforts to end the war have so far made little headway, however.\n\nWilliam Burns, the director of the CIA, was in Qatar's capital, Doha, on Wednesday to discuss a three-phase truce proposal touted last week by US President Joe Biden. The first phase calls for a six-week ceasefire, during which Hamas would free some of the captives and Israeli forces would withdraw from Gaza's population centres and negotiations would continue for a permanent truce.\n\nRegional and international powers have backed the proposal, but sticking points remain. Hamas has insisted on a permanent ceasefire and full withdrawal of Israeli troops.\n\nIsrael, however, has rejected those demands, saying it is prepared to discuss only temporary pauses until Hamas is defeated.\n\nIsmail Haniyeh, the leader of Hamas, on Wednesday reiterated the group's stance.\n\n\"The movement and factions of the resistance will deal seriously and positively with any agreement that is based on a comprehensive ending of the aggression and the complete withdrawal and prisoners swap,\" he said.\n\nMeanwhile, Israel's Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said there would be no halt to the fighting.\n\n\"Any negotiations with Hamas would be conducted only under fire,\" Gallant was quoted as saying as he flew on board a plane to inspect the Israeli offensive in Gaza.", "source":

THIS IMAGE MAY OFFEND OR DISTURB Palestinians react next to bodies of people killed in an Israeli strike on a UNRWA school sheltering displaced people, amid the Israel-Hamas conflict, in Nuseirat refugee camp in the central Gaza Strip, in this screengrab taken from a video June 6, 2024. REUTERS/Reuters TV\n\nBy Nidal al-Mughrabi and James Mackenzie\n\nCAIRO/JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel hit a Gaza school on Thursday with what it described as a targeted airstrike on up to 30 Hamas fighters inside, and a Hamas official said 40 people including women and children were killed as they sheltered in the U.N. site.\n\nVideo footage showed Palestinians hauling away bodies after the attack, which took place at a sensitive moment in mediated talks on a ceasefire that would involve releasing hostages held by Hamas and some of the Palestinians held in Israeli jails.\n\nThe United States issued a joint statement with other countries on Thursday calling on Israel and Hamas to make whatever compromises were necessary to finalise a deal after eight months of war in the Gaza Strip.\n\nIsmail Al-Thawabta, the director of the Hamas-run government media office, rejected Israel's assertion that the U.N. school in Nuseirat, in central Gaza, had hidden a Hamas command post.\n\n\"The occupation uses ... false fabricated stories to justify the brutal crime it conducted against dozens of displaced people,\" Thawabta told Reuters.\n\nIsrael's military said its fighter jets had carried out a \"precise strike\" and circulated satellite photos highlighting two parts of a building where it said the fighters were based.\n\n\"We're very confident in the intelligence,\" military spokesperson Lt Col. Peter Lerner said, accusing Hamas and Islamic Jihad fighters of deliberately using U.N. facilities as operational bases.\n\nHe said 20-30 fighters were located in the compound, and many of them had been killed, but had no precise details as intelligence assessments were being carried out. \"I'm not aware of any civilian casualties and I'd be very, very cautious of accepting anything that Hamas puts out,\" he said.\n\nAs people at the school cleared rubble from bloodstained classrooms, survivor Huda Abu Dhaher described waking up to the sound of rockets.\n\n\"People's remains were scattered inside the yard and outside. The gas canister exploded,\" she told Reuters.\n\n\"My nephew was martyred (killed), he lost his leg and arm, he was a 10-year-old ... This woman's leg got a fragment in it, her son bled from his mouth and leg, her mother-in-law sustained three injuries.\"\n\nThe school, run by the U.N. Palestinian refugee agency (UNRWA), was sheltering 6,000 displaced people at the time, UNRWA chief Philippe Lazzarini said.\n\n\"At least 35 people were killed and many more injured,\" he wrote on X. \"Claims that armed groups may have been inside the shelter are shocking. We are however unable to verify these claims. Attacking, targeting or using UN buildings for military purposes are a blatant disregard of International Humanitarian law.\"\n\nThawabta and a medical source said 40 had been killed, including 14 children and nine women.\n\nCEASEFIRE EFFORTS\n\nIsrael announced a new military campaign in central Gaza on Wednesday as it battles fighters relying on hit-and-run insurgency tactics. It says there will be no halt to fighting during the ceasefire talks, which have intensified since U.S. President Joe Biden outlined a proposal on Friday.\n\n\"At this decisive moment, we call on the leaders of Israel as well as Hamas to make whatever final compromises are necessary to close this deal,\" said the statement issued by the White House jointly with Argentina, Austria, Brazil, Britain, Canada and others.\n\nHamas seeks a permanent end to the war. Israel says it must destroy the Islamist militant group first.\n\nIn another sensitive development, the Israeli military reported a rare attack near the Israel-Gaza border, saying a squad of Palestinian fighters killed a soldier and three of them were killed in return fire.\n\nA statement by Hamas armed wing, the Al-Qassam Brigades, said its fighters had conducted an operation behind enemy lines in the Rafah area of southern Gaza, a location corresponding to the Israeli military's account.\n\nThe incident was likely to challenge efforts to restore a sense of security in Israeli border communities that were overrun by Hamas-led gunmen on Oct. 7 last year.\n\nCIA director William Burns met senior officials from mediators Qatar and Egypt on Wednesday in Doha to discuss the ceasefire plan. Two Egyptian security sources said talks continued on Thursday but had shown no sign of breakthrough.\n\nBiden has repeatedly declared that ceasefires were close over the past several months, but there has been only one, week-long truce, in November.\n\nLast week's announcement coincides with intense domestic political pressure on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to chart a path to end the eight-month-old war and negotiate the release of hostages held by Hamas.\n\nA centrist party in his emergency coalition government has threatened to quit by Saturday if he does not commit to a post-war plan for Gaza. Far-right members have pledged to quit if he agrees to a peace deal that leaves Hamas in place.\n\nHamas precipitated the war by attacking Israeli territory last Oct. 7, killing around 1,200 people and capturing more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies. About half the hostages were freed in the November truce.\n\nIsrael's military assault on Gaza has killed more than 36,000 people, according to health officials in the territory, who say thousands more dead are feared buried under the rubble.\n\nU.S. and Israeli officials have told Reuters about half of Hamas's forces have been killed in the conflict. Hamas does not disclose fatalities among its fighters and some officials say Israel exaggerated the figures.\n\nIsrael's own military death toll is almost 300.\n\n(Additional reporting by Dan Williams, Clauda Tanios, Henriette Chacar, Mrinmay Dey and Reuters bureaux; Writing by Michael Perry and Philippa Fletcher; Editing by Gerry Doyle and Timothy Heritage)\n\nSign Up for Springs AM Update Your morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

It has also led to widespread hunger and mass displacement.\n\nSome 31 percent of children under two in northern Gaza suffer from acute malnutrition, as do about 10 percent in Rafah in the south.\n\nSouth Africa has accused Israel of genocide at the International Court of Justice and a number of other countries, most recently Spain, have supported it in its accusation.", "source":

The Israeli military claimed Hamas militants were operating from within the school.\n\nIt was the latest instance of mass casualties among Palestinians trying to find refuge as Israel expands its offensives in the Gaza Strip. A day earlier, the military announced a new ground and air assault in central Gaza, pursuing Hamas militants it says have regrouped there. Troops repeatedly have swept back into sections of the Gaza Strip they have previously invaded, underscoring the resilience of the militant group despite Israel's nearly eight-month onslaught in the territory.\n\nWitnesses and hospital officials said the predawn strike hit the al-Sardi School, run by the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees known by the acronym UNRWA. The school was filled with Palestinians who had fled Israeli offensives and bombardment in northern Gaza, they said.\n\nFallout continues for wealthy St. Louis couple accused of poisoning neighbor's trees Masyn Winn's hit streak halts with strategic decision Cardinals manager 'didn't want to make' Pet food maker Purina too 'woke' for Missouri Republican.

Caf\u00e9 Napoli planning to open in Kirkwood\n\nAyman Rashed, a man displaced from Gaza City who was sheltering at the school, said the missiles hit classrooms on the second and third floor where families were sheltering. He said he helped carry out five dead, including an old man and two children, one with his head shattered open. \"It was dark, with no electricity, and we struggled to get out the victims,\" Rashed said.\n\nCasualties from school strike arrived at the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in nearby Deir al-Balah, which had already been overwhelmed by a stream of constant ambulances since the central Gaza incursion began 24 hours earlier, said Omar al-Derawi, a photographer working for the hospital. Videos circulating online appeared to show several wounded people being treated on the floor of the hospital, a common scene in Gaza's overwhelmed medical wards. Electricity in much of the hospital is out because staff are rationing fuel supplies for the generator.\n\n\"You can't walk in the hospital -- there's so many people. Women from the victims' families are massed in the hallways, crying,\" he said.\n\nHospital records and an Associated Press reporter at the hospital recorded at least 33 dead from the strike, including 14 children and nine women. Another strike on a house overnight killed six people, according to the records. Both strikes occurred in Nuseirat, one of several built-up refugee camps in Gaza dating to the 1948 war surrounding Israel's creation, when hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were driven from their homes in what became the new state.\n\nFootage showed bodies wrapped in blankets or plastic bags being laid out in lines in the courtyard of the hospital. Mohammed al-Kareem, a displaced Palestinian sheltering near the hospital, said he saw people searching for their loved ones among bodies, and that one woman kept asking medical workers to open the wraps on the bodies to see if her son was inside.\n\n\"The situation is tragic,\" he said.\n\nAn Israeli military spokesman, Lt. Col. Peter Lerner, said that the army wasn't aware of any civilian casualties in the strike. He said that intelligence indicated that militants had used the school compound to orchestrate some of the attacks on Oct. 7 and that at least 20 militants there were using it currently as a \"staging realm\" to launch attacks on Israeli soldiers. The military gave no evidence for its claims and released a photo of the school, pointing to classrooms on the second and third floor where it claimed militants were located.\n\nThe miltiary said it took steps before the strike \"to reduce the risk of harming uninvolved civilians ... including conducting aerial surveillance, and additional intelligence information.\"\n\nUNRWA schools across Gaza have functioned as shelters since the start of the war, which has driven most of the territory's population of 2.3 million Palestinians from their homes.\n\nLast week, Israeli strikes hit near an UNRWA facility in the southern city of Rafah, saying they were targeting Hamas militants. An inferno that followed ripped through tents nearby housing displaced families , killing at least 45 people. The deaths triggered international outrage, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the fire was the result of a \"tragic mishap.\" The military said the fire may have been caused by secondary explosions. The cause of the explosions has not been determined.\n\nIsrael sent troops into Rafah in early May in what it said was a limited incursion, but those forces are now operating in central parts of the city. More than 1 million people have fled Rafah since the start of the operation, scattering across southern and central Gaza into new tent camps or crowding into schools and homes.\n\nIsrael launched its campaign in Gaza after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack into Israel, in which militants killed some 1,200 people and took another 250 hostage. Israel's offensive has killed at least 36,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and civilians in its figures.\n\nIsrael blames civilian deaths on Hamas because it positions fighters, tunnels and rocket launchers in residential areas.\n\nThe United States has thrown its weight behind a phased cease-fire and hostage release outlined by President Joe Biden last week. But Israel says it won't end the war without destroying Hamas, while the militant group is demanding a lasting cease-fire and the full withdrawal of Israeli forces.\n\nFar-right members of Netanyahu's government have threatened to bring down the coalition if he signs onto a cease-fire deal. On Wednesday, National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, a leading hard-liner, spoke at an annual march through Jerusalem's Old City, saying, \"We are delivering a message from here to Hamas: Jerusalem is ours. Damascus Gate is ours\" -- referring to a main gate into the Arab-majority section of the city -- \"And with God's help total victory is ours.\"\n\nThe annual march commemorates \"Jerusalem Day,\" which marks Israel's capture of east Jerusalem, including the Old City and its holy sites sacred to Jews, Christians and Muslims, in the 1967 Middle East war.\n\nIsrael has routinely launched airstrikes in all parts of Gaza since the start of the war and has carried out massive ground operations in the territory's two largest cities, Gaza City and Khan Younis, that left much of them in ruins.\n\nThe military waged an offensive earlier this year for several weeks in Bureij and several other nearby refugee camps in central Gaza.\n\nTroops pulled out of the Jabaliya camp in northern Gaza last Friday after weeks of fighting caused widespread destruction. First responders have recovered the bodies of 360 people, mostly women and children, killed during the battles.\n\nSamy Magdy reported from Cairo.\n\n0 Comments", "source": {"uri": "stltoday.com",

School in Gaza Was 'Precise Strike'", "body": "Israel says its fighter jets targeted a \"Hamas compound\" embedded inside a school in Gaza early Thursday, but local health officials say over 30 people were killed in the attack including women and children.\n\nThe airstrike hit the al-Sardi School, a facility run by the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) in Nuseirat in central Gaza. Both Western and Palestinian news agencies reported that the school was sheltering people who had been displaced by the almost eight-month war at the time of the strike.\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces in a statement characterized the bombing as a \"precise strike\" which eliminated \"several Hamas and Islamic Jihad terrorists\" who \"participated in the Oct. 7 massacre\" in Israel. The military also claimed that \"a number of steps were taken to reduce the risk of harming uninvolved civilians during the strike\" which involved \"conducting aerial surveillance\" and \"additional intelligence information.\"\n\nAccording to the Associated Press, victims of the school attack were taken to Deir al-Balah's already overwhelmed Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital. The news agency cited one of its reporters at the scene and information from the hospital saying that at least 33 people were killed in the attack, including 14 children and nine women.\n\nThe Palestinian Authority's Wafa news agency reported that 32 died, \"most of them women and children,\" and dozens more were injured, including some seriously.\n\nAyman Rashed, a man displaced from Gaza City who was among those seeking refuge at the school at the time of the strike, told the AP that missiles struck classrooms on the second and third floors of the building where families had been sheltering. He said he'd helped to carry five deceased victims out of the school, including two children and an old man. \"It was dark, with no electricity, and we struggled to get out the victims,\" he said.\n\nThe mass casualty incident comes after at least 45 people died in another UNRWA facility for displaced Palestinians in Rafah in southern Gaza last week. The Israeli military said strikes in that incident were also targeting Hamas militants, with an IDF spokesman later claiming that the type of munitions used could not have started the blaze which broke out in the wake of the attack. They added that the inferno which swept through tents, burning people alive and injuring over 200 others, may have instead been ignited by \"secondary explosions\" due to weapons being stored in the area.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described the disaster as a \"tragic mistake.\" Multiple reports said U.S.-made munitions had been used in the Israeli strike.\n\nSince Israel launched its Gaza offensive in response to the Oct. 7 attacks, over 36,500 people have been killed in the enclave, according to the Gaza health ministry.\n\nOn Wednesday, before the reported influx of patients from the school airstrike, the ministry shared a press release from the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital saying one of the facility's two electricity generators had failed, risking a \"humanitarian catastrophe in which dozens of wounded, sick, and premature babies may fall victim.\"\n\nThe hospital said it was launching a \"distress call to the international community and international organizations\" to \"save the sick, wounded, and children of Gaza from certain death\" by helping to restore the power supply to the hospital \"before it is too late.\"", "source": {"uri":

The school was filled with Palestinians who had fled Israeli offensives and bombardment in northern Gaza, they said.\n\nAyman Rashed, a man displaced from Gaza City who was sheltering at the school, said the missiles hit classrooms on the second and third floor where families were sheltering.\n\nHe said he helped carry out five dead, including an old man and two children, one with his head shattered open. \"It was dark, with no electricity, and we struggled to get out the victims,\" Rashed said.\n\nThe Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in the nearby town of Deir al-Balah received at least 33 dead from the strike, including 14 children and nine women, according to hospital records and an Associated Press reporter at the hospital.\n\nAnother strike on a house overnight killed six people, according to the records. Both strikes occurred in Nuseirat, one of several built-up refugee camps in Gaza dating to the 1948 war surrounding Israel's creation, when hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were driven from their homes in what became the new state.\n\nMohammed al-Kareem, a displaced Palestinian sheltering near the hospital, described chaotic scenes outside the facility. He said vehicles arrived one after the other, as distressed people rushed wounded people into the emergency department.

Israel claimed Thursday the school was being used as a Hamas compound, without providing evidence.\n\nHospital records and an Associated Press reporter at the hospital recorded at least 33 dead from the strike, including 14 children and nine women. Another strike on a house overnight killed six people. Both strikes occurred in Nuseirat, one of several built-up refugee camps in Gaza. Israel's military later said it was not aware of any civilian casualties in the strike on the school.\n\nInternational pressure has been mounting to limit civilian bloodshed in the Israel-Hamas war. Spain's foreign minister announced Thursday that the country would ask a United Nations court for permission to join South Africa's case accusing Israel of genocide in Gaza.

United Nations agencies say over 1 million in Gaza could experience the highest level of starvation by mid-July.\n\nIsrael launched the war after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack, in which militants stormed into southern Israel, killed some 1,200 people -- mostly civilians -- and abducted about 250.

He said Israel could still operate in Gaza but needed to avoid causing undue harm to Palestinian civilians and contravening Israel's obligations under the Genocide Convention.\n\nIsraeli President Isaac Herzog, whose position is largely ceremonial, thanked Barak on Thursday for serving on the court in a statement posted to X, adding: \"We will continue to stand firm against the evil, the hypocrisy and the false accusations leveled against the State of Israel and the IDF,\" using an acronym for Israel's military.\n\nRECENT DRONE STRIKE IN NORTHERN ISRAEL KILLED A RESERVE SOLDIER, MILITARY SAYS\n\nJERUSALEM -- Israel's military said Thursday that a drone strike on a village in northern Israel the day before killed an Israeli reserve soldier.\n\nThe Lebanese militant group Hezbollah said it launched an attack toward a gathering of military officials in response to an earlier Israeli cross-border attack.\n\nIsrael's military said two explosive drones were fired toward Hurfeish, a northern village in Israel.\n\nAir raid sirens did not go off ahead of the strike, and Israeli authorities said that the strike wounded over 10 people in addition to the one soldier killed. The military identified the fallen soldier as Staff Sgt. (res.) Refael Kauders, 39.\n\nWith Kaunders' death, 16 soldiers have been killed in Israel's north since October, along with 10 civilians.\n\nMore 400 people have been killed in Lebanon, including more than 70 civilians and noncombatants.\n\nIsrael and Hezbollah have been exchanging fire daily since a day after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack, which set off the war in Gaza. The deadly fighting has displaced tens of thousands of people on both sides of the Israel-Lebanon border and sparked fears of a wider regional war.\n\nISRAELI MILITARY SAYS IT'S NOT AWARE OF ANY CIVILIAN CASUALTIES IN ITS STRIKE ON A SCHOOL\n\nJERUSALEM -- Israel's military said Thursday it was not aware of any civilian casualties in a strike that killed at least 33 Palestinians, including 23 women and children, according to local officials and an AP reporter at the hospital that received the bodies.\n\nThe strike occurred early Thursday on a United Nations school sheltering displaced Palestinians in central Gaza. Israeli military spokesperson Lt. Col. Peter Lerner said intelligence indicated that militants had used the school compound to orchestrate some of the attacks on Oct. 7 and that at least 20 militants there were using it currently as a \"staging realm\" to launch attacks on Israeli soldiers.\n\n\"I'm not aware of civilians being caught up in this. We will be looking at the data and intelligence that comes out in the next few hours or day,\" Lerner told journalists.\n\nHe declined to say whether the military would investigate the strike, as it did in May when an Israeli strike nearby a tent camp sheltering displaced people killed dozens in Rafah, Gaza's southernmost city.\n\nSPAIN APPLIES TO JOIN SOUTH AFRICA'S CASE ACCUSING ISRAEL OF GENOCIDE\n\nMADRID -- Spain will ask a United Nations court for permission to join South Africa's case accusing Israel of genocide in Gaza, its foreign minister announced Thursday.\n\nSpain is the first European country to take the step after South Africa filed its case with the International Court of Justice in late 2023. It alleged that Israel was breaching the genocide convention in its military assault that has laid waste to large swaths of Gaza.\n\nMexico, Colombia, Nicaragua, Libya and the Palestinians have already requested to join the case currently being heard at the court in The Hague, Netherlands.\n\nThe court has ordered Israel to immediately halt its military offensive in the southern Gaza city of Rafah but stopped short of ordering a cease-fire for the enclave. Israel has not complied.\n\nSpain's request to join the case is the latest move by the government of Socialist Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez to support peacemaking efforts in Gaza.\n\nIsrael denies it is committing genocide in its military operation to crush Hamas triggered by its deadly Oct. 7 attacks in southern Israel.\n\nHamas killed 1,200 people and took 250 more hostage in the surprise attacks. Israel's air and land attacks have killed 36,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which doesn't distinguish between combatants and civilians.\n\nISRAELI STRIKE KILLS DOZENS AT A SCHOOL-TURNED-SHELTER IN GAZA\n\nDEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip -- An Israeli strike early Thursday on a school-turned-shelter in central Gaza that the military claimed was being used as a Hamas compound killed at least 30 people, including five children, according to local health officials.\n\nThe strike came after the military said it was launching new air and ground operations in central Gaza in an apparent widening of its nearly eight-month offensive, launched after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack. An international medical charity had reported soaring casualties even before Thursday's strike.\n\nThe Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir al-Balah received at least 30 bodies from the strike on the school run by the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees -- known by the acronym UNRWA -- and another six from a separate strike on a home, according to hospital records and an Associated Press reporter at the hospital. Hamas-run TV had earlier reported a higher toll.\n\nThe Israeli military claimed, without immediately offering evidence, that Hamas and the Islamic Jihad used the school as cover for their operations and that risk reduction steps were taken before the strike.\n\nThe war began with Hamas' Oct. 7 attack inside Israel that killed at least 1,200 people with 250 others taken hostage. The Israeli military campaign in the Gaza Strip has killed at least 36,000 Palestinians, with hundreds of others killed in operations in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.\n\nYEMEN'S HOUTHI REBELS UNVEIL A NEW SOLID-FUEL MISSILE\n\nDUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Yemen's Houthi rebels have unveiled a new, solid-fuel missile in their arsenal that resembles aspects of one earlier displayed by Iran that Tehran described as flying at hypersonic speeds.\n\nThe rebels fired their new \"Palestine\" missile, complete with a warhead painted like a Palestinian keffiyeh checkered scarf, at the southern Gulf of Aqaba port of Eilat in Israel on Monday. The attack set off air raid sirens but caused no reported damage or injuries.\n\nFootage released by the Houthis late Wednesday showed the Palestine being raised on what appeared to be a mobile launcher and rising quickly into the air with plumes of white smoke coming from its engine. White smoke is common with solid-fuel missiles.\n\nSolid-fuel missiles can be set up and fired faster than those containing liquid fuel. That's a key concern for the Houthis as their missile launch sites have been repeatedly targeted by U.S. and allied forces in recent months over the rebels' attacks on shipping through the Red Sea corridor. One such strike hit the Houthis even before they were able to launch their missile.", "source": {"uri": "tribtown.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Reuters\n\nIsrael hit a Gaza school on Thursday in an airstrike that it said targeted and killed Hamas fighters inside, while a Hamas official said 40 people including women and children were killed as they sheltered in the UN site.\n\nThe strike took place at a sensitive moment in mediated negotiations on a ceasefire agreement entailing the release of hostages seized by Hamas on October 7 and some of the Palestinians held in Israeli jails. Hamas seeks a permanent end to the war. Israel says it must destroy the Islamist group first.\n\nThe United States issued a joint statement with other countries on Thursday calling on Israel and Hamas to make whatever compromises were necessary to finalise a deal as the two sides gave contradictory accounts of the school attack.\n\nIsmail Al-Thawabta, the director of the Hamas-run government media office, rejected Israel's assertion that the UN school in Nuseirat, in central Gaza, had hidden a Hamas command post.\n\n\"The occupation uses... false fabricated stories to justify the brutal crime it conducted against dozens of displaced people,\" Thawabta told Reuters.\n\nIsrael's military said its fighter jets had carried out a \"precise strike\" and circulated satellite photos highlighting two parts of a building where it said the fighters were based.\n\n\"We're very confident in the intelligence,\" military spokesperson Lt Col. Peter Lerner told a briefing with reporters, accusing Hamas and Islamic Jihad fighters of deliberately using UN facilities as operational bases.\n\nHe said 20-30 fighters were located in the compound, and many of them had been killed, but had no precise details as intelligence assessments were being carried out. \"I'm not aware of any civilian casualties and I'd be very, very cautious of accepting anything that Hamas puts out,\" he said.\n\nThe school, run by the UN Palestinian refugee agency (UNRWA), may have been hit several times, said the agency's communications director, Juliette Touma.\n\nShe said she could not confirm the death toll at this stage. Media in Hamas-run Gaza had earlier put the toll at 35-40. Thawabta and a medical source said 40 had been killed, including 14 children and nine women.\n\nCEASEFIRE EFFORTS\n\nIsrael announced a new military campaign in central Gaza on Wednesday as it battles fighters relying on hit-and-run insurgency tactics. It says there will be no halt to fighting during ceasefire talks, which have intensified since US President Joe Biden outlined a proposal on Friday.\n\nSince a week-long truce in November, all attempts to arrange a ceasefire have failed, with each side blaming the other.\n\n\"At this decisive moment, we call on the leaders of Israel as well as Hamas to make whatever final compromises are necessary to close this deal,\" said the statement issued by the White House jointly with Argentina, Austria, Brazil, Britain, Canada and others.\n\nCIA director William Burns met senior officials from mediators Qatar and Egypt on Wednesday in Doha to discuss the ceasefire proposal. Two Egyptian security sources said talks continued on Thursday but had shown no sign of breakthrough.\n\nBiden has repeatedly declared that ceasefires were close over the past several months, only for no truce to materialise.\n\nLast week's high-profile announcement coincides with intense domestic political pressure on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to chart a path to end the eight-month-old war and negotiate the release of Israeli hostages held by Hamas.\n\nHamas, which rules Gaza, precipitated the war by attacking Israeli territory on October 7, killing around 1,200 people and capturing more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies. Around half of the hostages were freed in the November truce.\n\nIsrael's military assault on Gaza has killed more than 36,000 people, according to health officials in the territory, who say thousands more dead are feared buried under the rubble.\n\nAbout half of Hamas's forces have been wiped out in eight months of fighting and the group is relying on insurgent tactics to frustrate Israel's attempts to take control of Gaza, US and Israeli officials told Reuters.\n\nHamas has been reduced to 9,000 to 12,000 fighters, according to three senior US officials familiar with battlefield developments, down from American estimates of 20,000-25,000 before the conflict. Israel says it has lost almost 300 troops in the Gaza campaign.\n\nHamas does not disclose fatalities among its fighters and some officials have described Israel's figures for the number of Hamas fighters killed as exaggerated.\n\nMeanwhile, a conflict between Israel and the Lebanon-based Hezbollah is threatening to escalate, with the US State Department warning against a full-blown war.\n\nAlthough Biden described the ceasefire proposal as an Israeli offer, Israel's government has been lukewarm in public. A top Netanyahu aide confirmed on Sunday that Israel had made the proposal even though it was \"not a good deal\".\n\nFar-right members of Netanyahu's government have pledged to quit if he agrees to a peace deal that leaves Hamas in place, a move that could force a new election and end the political career of Israel's longest-serving leader.\n\nCentrist opponents who joined Netanyahu's war cabinet in a show of unity at the outset of the conflict have also threatened to quit, saying his government has no plan.", "source": {"uri": "kathmandupost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "kathmandupost.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuseirat_Camp", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nuseirat Camp"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nuseirat Camp"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internally_displaced_person", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Internally displaced person"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNRWA", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "UNRWA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostage", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hostage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Islamism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airstrike", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Airstrike"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_Islamic_Jihad", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian Islamic Jihad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_refugees", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian refugees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Military campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurgency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Insurgency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Austria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Austria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_J._Burns_(diplomat)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "William J.

Kauders, 39, was killed during a drone attack launched by the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah toward a gathering of military officials at a village in northern Israel.\n\nAn Israeli strike in central Gaza killed at least 33 people overnight when it hit a United Nations-run school being sheltering displaced Palestinian families.\n\nIsrael claimed Thursday the school was being used as a Hamas compound, without providing evidence. Israel's military later said it was not aware of any civilian casualties in the strike on the school in Nuseirat refugee camp.\n\nCasualties from the school strike -- including 14 children and nine women -- were taken to a hospital in nearby Deir al-Balah, as documented by hospital records and an Associated Press journalist. The hospital has already been overwhelmed by a stream of ambulances since Israeli forces launched a new offensive in central Gaza this week.\n\nInternational pressure has been mounting on Israel to limit civilian bloodshed in its war against Hamas in Gaza. Spain's foreign minister announced Thursday that the country would ask a United Nations court for permission to join South Africa's case accusing Israel of genocide in Gaza. Israel strongly denies the accusation.\n\nMore than 36,000 Palestinians have been killed by eight months of Israeli bombardments and ground offensives in Gaza, according to the Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians.\n\nThe war has largely cut off the flow of food, medicine and other supplies to Palestinians who are facing widespread hunger. United Nations agencies say over 1 million in Gaza could experience the highest level of starvation by mid-July.\n\nIsrael launched the war after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack, in which militants stormed into southern Israel, killed some 1,200 people -- mostly civilians -- and abducted about 250. Around 80 hostages captured on Oct. 7 are believed to still be alive in Gaza, alongside the remains of 43 others.\n\nCurrently:\n\n-- Israeli strike kills at least 33 people at a Gaza school the military claims was being used by Hamas.\n\n-- Spain applies to join South Africa's case at top the U.N. court accusing Israel of genocide.\n\n-- A social media effort to draw attention to Rafah surges.\n\n-- Israeli settlers in the West Bank were hit with international sanctions. It only emboldened them.\n\n-- Yemen's Houthi rebels unveil solid-fuel 'Palestine' missile that resembles Iranian hypersonic.\n\nFollow AP's coverage of the war in Gaza at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war\n\nHere's the latest:\n\nISRAELI FORCES KILL 3 PALESTINIANS IN WEST BANK, HEALTH MINISTRY SAYS\n\nJERUSALEM -- The Palestinian Health Ministry says three Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire in the occupied West Bank.\n\nThe Israeli military said forces carrying out an arrest raid in the northern West Bank city of Jenin on Thursday opened fire at three individuals who had thrown explosives at them and that a helicopter struck the area. It said the forces also arrested a suspected militant.\n\nViolence has surged in the Israeli-occupied West Bank since Hamas' Oct. 7 attack triggered the war in Gaza. Israel has carried out frequent arrest raids that often ignite gunbattles. Settler violence and Palestinian attacks on Israelis have also been on the rise.\n\nThe Health Ministry, part of the Western-backed Palestinian Authority, says around 530 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank since the start of the Gaza war.\n\nIsrael captured the West Bank, the Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem in the 1967 Mideast war. The Palestinians want all three territories for their future state.\n\nThe 3 million Palestinians in the West Bank live under seemingly open-ended Israeli military rule, while the more than 500,000 Jewish settlers in the territory have Israeli citizenship.\n\nMORE THAN A DOZEN COUNTRIES JOIN U.S. IN STATEMENT SUPPORTING BIDEN'S GAZA PLAN\n\nWASHINGTON -- More than a dozen countries joined the U.S. in a statement Thursday to show support for U.S. President Joe Biden's proposed deal to release the remaining hostages in Gaza and end the grinding Mideast war.\n\nThe statement was signed by the leaders of Argentina, Austria, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, Colombia, Denmark, France, Germany, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Serbia, Spain, Thailand and the United Kingdom as well as the United States.\n\n\"As leaders of countries deeply concerned for the hostages held by Hamas in Gaza, including many of our own citizens, we fully support the movement towards a ceasefire and hostage release deal now on the table and as outlined by President Biden on May 31, 2024,\" the statement said. \"There is no time to lose.\"\n\nThe United States has thrown its weight behind the phased cease-fire and hostage release outlined by Biden last week. But Israel says it won't end the war without destroying Hamas, while the militant group is demanding a lasting cease-fire and the full withdrawal of Israeli forces.\n\nFar-right members of Netanyahu's government have threatened to bring down the coalition if he signs onto a cease-fire deal.\n\nISRAEL'S MILITARY SAYS IT TRADED FIRE WITH PALESTINIAN MILITANTS JUST YARDS FROM GAZA BORDER\n\nJERUSALEM -- The Israeli military says it traded fire with Palestinian militants in southern Gaza some 300 meters (yards) from the Israeli border.\n\nThe fighters appeared to have infiltrated a heavily guarded buffer zone.\n\nLt. Col. Peter Lerner, an Israeli military spokesman, said the gunbattle erupted before dawn on Thursday. He said two militants were killed from the air and a third in a tank strike.\n\nIsraeli media later reported that an Israeli soldier was killed in the shootout. The military confirmed that a soldier was killed during a confrontation with militants in southern Gaza early Thursday but declined to say whether it was linked to the infiltration attempt.\n\nSatellite photos earlier this year showed extensive demolition inside Gaza along the border. Israel appears to have established a buffer zone despite international objections.\n\nThe United States, which has provided key military aid for Israel's nearly eight-month offensive, has said Gaza's territory should not shrink. Israel says it needs a buffer zone to prevent Hamas from carrying out another attack into southern Israel like the one on Oct. 7 that ignited the war.\n\nISRAEL'S REPRESENTATIVE RESIGNS FROM ICJ JUDGE PANEL OVERSEEING GENOCIDE CASE\n\nJERUSALEM -- Israel's representative on the panel of judges hearing the genocide case against Israel at the world's top court resigned from his post, citing personal reasons, according to a letter he sent to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu seen by The Associated Press on Thursday.\n\nJustice Aharon Barak, a former attorney general and peace negotiator who served as chief justice of Israel's highest court from 1995 to 2006, wrote Tuesday to Netanyahu, telling him that he had sent the president of the International Court of Justice a resignation letter.\n\n\"My resignation is for personal and family reasons,\" he wrote to Netanyahu. \"Thank you for the trust placed in me.\"\n\nBarak was one of four justices on the court who said the ICJ's ruling that Israel cease operations in Rafah, Gaza's southernmost city, did not mean Israel needed to stop operations there entirely. He said Israel could still operate in Gaza but needed to avoid causing undue harm to Palestinian civilians and contravening Israel's obligations under the Genocide Convention.\n\nIsraeli President Isaac Herzog, whose position is largely ceremonial, thanked Barak on Thursday for serving on the court in a statement posted to X, adding: \"We will continue to stand firm against the evil, the hypocrisy and the false accusations leveled against the State of Israel and the IDF,\" using an acronym for Israel's military.\n\nRECENT DRONE STRIKE IN NORTHERN ISRAEL KILLED A RESERVE SOLDIER, MILITARY SAYS\n\nJERUSALEM -- Israel's military said Thursday that a drone strike on a village in northern Israel the day before killed an Israeli reserve soldier.\n\nThe Lebanese militant group Hezbollah said it launched an attack toward a gathering of military officials in response to an earlier Israeli cross-border attack.\n\nIsrael's military said two explosive drones were fired toward Hurfeish, a northern village in Israel.\n\nAir raid sirens did not go off ahead of the strike, and Israeli authorities said that the strike wounded over 10 people in addition to the one soldier killed. The military identified the fallen soldier as Staff Sgt. (res.) Refael Kauders, 39.\n\nWith Kaunders' death, 16 soldiers have been killed in Israel's north since October, along with 10 civilians.\n\nMore 400 people have been killed in Lebanon, including more than 70 civilians and noncombatants.\n\nIsrael and Hezbollah have been exchanging fire daily since a day after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack, which set off the war in Gaza. The deadly fighting has displaced tens of thousands of people on both sides of the Israel-Lebanon border and sparked fears of a wider regional war.\n\nISRAELI MILITARY SAYS IT'S NOT AWARE OF ANY CIVILIAN CASUALTIES IN ITS STRIKE ON A SCHOOL\n\nJERUSALEM -- Israel's military said Thursday it was not aware of any civilian casualties in a strike that killed at least 33 Palestinians, including 23 women and children, according to local officials and an AP reporter at the hospital that received the bodies.\n\nThe strike occurred early Thursday on a United Nations school sheltering displaced Palestinians in central Gaza. Israeli military spokesperson Lt. Col. Peter Lerner said intelligence indicated that militants had used the school compound to orchestrate some of the attacks on Oct. 7 and that at least 20 militants there were using it currently as a \"staging realm\" to launch attacks on Israeli soldiers.\n\n\"I'm not aware of civilians being caught up in this. We will be looking at the data and intelligence that comes out in the next few hours or day,\" Lerner told journalists.\n\nHe declined to say whether the military would investigate the strike, as it did in May when an Israeli strike nearby a tent camp sheltering displaced people killed dozens in Rafah, Gaza's southernmost city.\n\nSPAIN APPLIES TO JOIN SOUTH AFRICA'S CASE ACCUSING ISRAEL OF GENOCIDE\n\nMADRID -- Spain will ask a United Nations court for permission to join South Africa's case accusing Israel of genocide in Gaza, its foreign minister announced Thursday.\n\nSpain is the first European country to take the step after South Africa filed its case with the International Court of Justice in late 2023. It alleged that Israel was breaching the genocide convention in its military assault that has laid waste to large swaths of Gaza.\n\nMexico, Colombia, Nicaragua, Libya and the Palestinians have already requested to join the case currently being heard at the court in The Hague, Netherlands.\n\nThe court has ordered Israel to immediately halt its military offensive in the southern Gaza city of Rafah but stopped short of ordering a cease-fire for the enclave. Israel has not complied.\n\nSpain's request to join the case is the latest move by the government of Socialist Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez to support peacemaking efforts in Gaza.\n\nIsrael denies it is committing genocide in its military operation to crush Hamas triggered by its deadly Oct. 7 attacks in southern Israel.\n\nHamas killed 1,200 people and took 250 more hostage in the surprise attacks. Israel's air and land attacks have killed 36,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which doesn't distinguish between combatants and civilians.\n\nISRAELI STRIKE KILLS DOZENS AT A SCHOOL-TURNED-SHELTER IN GAZA\n\nDEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip -- An Israeli strike early Thursday on a school-turned-shelter in central Gaza that the military claimed was being used as a Hamas compound killed at least 30 people, including five children, according to local health officials.\n\nThe strike came after the military said it was launching new air and ground operations in central Gaza in an apparent widening of its nearly eight-month offensive, launched after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack. An international medical charity had reported soaring casualties even before Thursday's strike.\n\nThe Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir al-Balah received at least 30 bodies from the strike on the school run by the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees -- known by the acronym UNRWA -- and another six from a separate strike on a home, according to hospital records and an Associated Press reporter at the hospital. Hamas-run TV had earlier reported a higher toll.\n\nThe Israeli military claimed, without immediately offering evidence, that Hamas and the Islamic Jihad used the school as cover for their operations and that risk reduction steps were taken before the strike.\n\nThe war began with Hamas' Oct. 7 attack inside Israel that killed at least 1,200 people with 250 others taken hostage. The Israeli military campaign in the Gaza Strip has killed at least 36,000 Palestinians, with hundreds of others killed in operations in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.\n\nYEMEN'S HOUTHI REBELS UNVEIL A NEW SOLID-FUEL MISSILE\n\nDUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Yemen's Houthi rebels have unveiled a new, solid-fuel missile in their arsenal that resembles aspects of one earlier displayed by Iran that Tehran described as flying at hypersonic speeds.\n\nThe rebels fired their new \"Palestine\" missile, complete with a warhead painted like a Palestinian keffiyeh checkered scarf, at the southern Gulf of Aqaba port of Eilat in Israel on Monday. The attack set off air raid sirens but caused no reported damage or injuries.\n\nFootage released by the Houthis late Wednesday showed the Palestine being raised on what appeared to be a mobile launcher and rising quickly into the air with plumes of white smoke coming from its engine. White smoke is common with solid-fuel missiles.\n\nSolid-fuel missiles can be set up and fired faster than those containing liquid fuel. That's a key concern for the Houthis as their missile launch sites have been repeatedly targeted by U.S. and allied forces in recent months over the rebels' attacks on shipping through the Red Sea corridor. One such strike hit the Houthis even before they were able to launch their missile.", "source": {"uri": "yakimaherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yakima Herald-Republic"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Gaza media office condemned the attack as a \"terrible massacre,\" calling it a \"clear evidence of the crime of genocide committed against civilians.\"\n\nThe Israeli military has acknowledged the air raid, but insisted it targeted a Hamas compound and successfully eliminated \"several terrorists\" who allegedly plotted attacks against Israeli troops.\n\n\"A short while ago, IAF fighter jets, directed by IDF intelligence and the ISA, conducted a precise strike on a Hamas compound embedded inside an UNRWA school in the area of Nuseirat,\" the Israeli military confirmed in a statement early Thursday morning.\n\n\"The terrorists directed terror from the area of the school while exploiting it and using it as a shelter,\" the IDF added, insisting that it conducted thorough aerial surveillance and gathered additional intelligence before the strike to \"reduce the risk of harming uninvolved civilians.\"\n\nLast month, at least 45 Palestinians were killed when Israeli jets bombed the southern Gazan city of Rafah, causing a large fire at a camp housing displaced people. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the strike \"a tragic mistake,\" and promised that it would be investigated.\n\nThe Gaza-based Palestinian militant group Hamas launched a series of raids into Israel on October 7 last year, dubbed 'Al-Aqsa Flood.' An estimated 1,200 Israelis were killed in the attacks, while another 250 were taken captive. Israel responded with a military offensive that has claimed the lives of over 36,000 Palestinians and devastated much of the enclave's infrastructure.\n\nThe United Nations' International Court of Justice (ICJ) recently ordered the Jewish state to \"immediately halt its military offensive\" as part of a 'genocide' complaint.

The Israeli military said that Hamas militants were operating from within the school.\n\nIt was the latest instance of mass casualties among Palestinians trying to find refuge as Israel expands its offensive. A day earlier, the military announced a new ground and air assault in central Gaza, pursuing Hamas militants it says have regrouped there. Troops repeatedly have swept back into parts of the Gaza Strip they have previously invaded, underscoring the resilience of the militant group despite Israel's nearly eight-month onslaught.\n\nWitnesses and hospital officials said the predawn strike hit the al-Sardi School, run by the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees known by the acronym UNRWA. The school was filled with Palestinians who had fled Israeli operations and bombardment in northern Gaza, they said.\n\nFallout continues for wealthy St. Louis couple accused of poisoning neighbor's trees Masyn Winn's hit streak halts with strategic decision Cardinals manager 'didn't want to make' Pet food maker Purina too 'woke' for Missouri Republican.

He said he helped carry out five dead, including an old man and two children, one with his head shattered open. \"It was dark, with no electricity, and we struggled to get out the victims,\" Rashed said.\n\nCasualties from school strike arrived at the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in nearby Deir al-Balah, which had already been overwhelmed by a stream of constant ambulances since the central Gaza incursion began 24 hours earlier, said Omar al-Derawi, a photographer working for the hospital.\n\nVideos circulating online appeared to show several wounded people being treated on the floor of the hospital, a common scene in Gaza's overwhelmed medical wards. Electricity in much of the hospital is out because staff are rationing fuel supplies for the generator.\n\n\"You can't walk in the hospital -- there's so many people. Women from the victims' families are massed in the hallways, crying,\" he said.\n\nHospital records and an Associated Press reporter at the hospital recorded at least 33 dead from the strike, including 14 children and nine women. Another strike on a house overnight killed six people, according to the records. Both strikes occurred in Nuseirat, one of several built-up refugee camps in Gaza dating to the 1948 war surrounding Israel's creation, when hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were driven from their homes in what became the new state.\n\nFootage showed bodies wrapped in blankets or plastic bags being laid out in lines in the courtyard of the hospital. Mohammed al-Kareem, a displaced Palestinian sheltering near the hospital, said he saw people searching for their loved ones among bodies, and that one woman kept asking medical workers to open the wraps on the bodies to see if her son was inside.\n\n\"The situation is tragic,\" he said.\n\nPhilippe Lazzarini, the commissioner-general of UNRWA, said in a post on X that 6,000 people were sheltering in the school when it was hit without prior warning. He said UNRWA was unable to verify claims that armed groups were inside.\n\nAn Israeli military spokesman, Lt. Col. Peter Lerner, said that the army wasn't aware of any civilian casualties in the strike. He said that intelligence indicated that militants had used the school compound to orchestrate some of the attacks on Oct. 7 and that at least 20 militants there were using it currently as a \"staging realm\" to launch attacks on Israeli soldiers. The military gave no evidence for its claims and released a photo of the school, pointing to classrooms on the second and third floor where it claimed militants were located.\n\nThe military said it took steps before the strike \"to reduce the risk of harming uninvolved civilians ... including conducting aerial surveillance, and additional intelligence information.\"\n\nUNRWA schools across Gaza have functioned as shelters since the start of the war, which has driven most of the territory's population of 2.3 million Palestinians from their homes.\n\nLast week, Israeli strikes hit near an UNRWA facility in the southern city of Rafah, saying they were targeting Hamas militants. An inferno ripped through tents nearby housing displaced families , killing at least 45 people. The deaths triggered international outrage, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the fire was the result of a \"tragic mishap.\" The military said the fire may have been caused by secondary explosions. The cause of the explosions has not been determined.\n\nIsrael sent troops into Rafah in early May in what it said was a limited incursion, but those forces are now operating in central parts of the city. More than 1 million people have fled Rafah since the start of the operation, scattering across southern and central Gaza into new tent camps or crowding into schools and homes.\n\nIsrael launched its campaign in Gaza after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack into Israel, in which militants killed some 1,200 people and took another 250 hostage. Israel's offensive has killed at least 36,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and civilians in its figures.\n\nIsrael blames civilian deaths on Hamas because it positions fighters, tunnels and rocket launchers in residential areas.\n\nThe United States has thrown its weight behind a phased cease-fire and hostage release outlined by President Joe Biden last week. But Israel says it won't end the war without destroying Hamas, while the militant group is demanding a lasting cease-fire and the full withdrawal of Israeli forces.\n\nFar-right members of Netanyahu's government have threatened to bring down the coalition if he signs onto a cease-fire deal.\n\nIsrael has routinely launched airstrikes in all parts of Gaza since the start of the war and has carried out massive ground operations in the territory's two largest cities, Gaza City and Khan Younis, that left much of them in ruins.\n\nThe military waged an offensive earlier this year for several weeks in Bureij and several other nearby refugee camps in central Gaza.\n\nTroops pulled out of the Jabaliya camp in northern Gaza last Friday after weeks of fighting caused widespread destruction. First responders have recovered the bodies of 360 people, mostly women and children, killed during the battles.\n\nSamy Magdy reported from Cairo.\n\nUpdated at 9 a.m.\n\n0 Comments", "source":

Hamas seeks a permanent end to the war. Israel says it must destroy the Islamist militant group first.\n\nThe U.S. issued a joint statement with other countries on Thursday calling on Israel and Hamas to make whatever compromises were necessary to finalize a deal as the two sides gave contradictory accounts of the school attack.\n\nIsmail Al-Thawabta, the director of the Hamas-run government media office, rejected Israel's assertion that the U.N. school in Nuseirat, in central Gaza, had hidden a Hamas command post.\n\nMore: 'You're beautiful': Video shows female Israeli soldiers seized by Hamas\n\n\"The occupation uses ... false fabricated stories to justify the brutal crime it conducted against dozens of displaced people,\" Thawabta told Reuters.\n\nIsrael's military said its fighter jets had carried out a \"precise strike\" and circulated satellite photos highlighting two parts of a building where it said the fighters were based.\n\n\"We're very confident in the intelligence,\" military spokesperson Lt. Col. Peter Lerner told reporters, accusing Hamas and Islamic Jihad fighters of deliberately using U.N. facilities as operational bases.\n\nHe said 20-30 fighters were located in the compound, and many of them had been killed, but he had no precise details as intelligence assessments were being carried out. \"I'm not aware of any civilian casualties and I'd be very, very cautious of accepting anything that Hamas puts out,\" he said.\n\nMore: The U.S. announced it. Israel kind of rejected it. What is Biden's Gaza cease-fire plan?\n\nThe school, run by the U.N. Palestinian refugee agency (UNRWA), was sheltering 6,000 displaced people at the time, UNRWA chief Philippe Lazzarini said.\n\n\"At least 35 people were killed and many more injured,\" he wrote on X. \"Claims that armed groups may have been inside the shelter are shocking. We are however unable to verify these claims. Attacking, targeting or using UN buildings for military purposes are a blatant disregard of International Humanitarian law.\"\n\nMedia in Hamas-run Gaza had earlier put the toll at 35-40. Thawabta said 40 had been killed, including 14 children and nine women.\n\nMore: Report: Israel targeted U.S. lawmakers through hundreds of fake social media accounts\n\nCease-fire efforts\n\nIsrael announced a new military campaign in central Gaza on Wednesday as it battles fighters relying on hit-and-run insurgency tactics. It says there will be no halt to fighting during ceasefire talks, which have intensified since U.S. President Joe Biden outlined a proposal on Friday.\n\n\"At this decisive moment, we call on the leaders of Israel as well as Hamas to make whatever final compromises are necessary to close this deal,\" said the statement issued by the White House jointly with Argentina, Austria, Brazil, Britain, Canada and others.\n\nIn another sensitive development, the Israeli military reported a rare attack near the Israel-Gaza border, saying a squad of Palestinian fighters killed a soldier, while three militants were killed in return fire.\n\nIt did not name a location but a statement by Hamas' armed wing, the Al-Qassam Brigades, said its fighters had conducted an operation behind enemy lines in the Rafah area of southern Gaza, a location corresponding to the Israeli military's account.\n\nMore: Furious Israel ambassador shreds UN charter before vote on Palestine membership\n\n\"Al-Qassam fighters managed to penetrate the barrier and attacked the enemy command headquarters,\" it said.\n\nThe incident was likely to challenge efforts to restore a sense of security in Israeli border communities that were overrun by Hamas-led gunmen on Oct. 7 last year.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Israeli military said it was setting up a quick-response commando unit made up of border residents as a precaution against further armed incursions.\n\nCIA director William Burns met senior officials from mediators Qatar and Egypt on Wednesday in Doha to discuss the ceasefire plan. Two Egyptian security sources said talks continued on Thursday with no sign of breakthrough.\n\nBiden has repeatedly declared that ceasefires were close over the past several months, but there has been only one, week-long truce, in November.\n\nLast week's announcement coincides with intense domestic political pressure on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to chart a path to end the eight-month-old war and negotiate the release of hostages held by Hamas.\n\nBut far-right members of his government have pledged to quit if he agrees to a peace deal that leaves Hamas in place.\n\nMore: 30,000-plus lives lost: Visualizing the death and destruction of Israel's war in Gaza\n\nHamas precipitated the war by attacking Israeli territory last Oct. 7, killing around 1,200 people and capturing more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies. About half the hostages were freed in the November truce.\n\nIsrael's military assault on Gaza has killed more than 36,000 people, according to health officials in the territory, who say thousands more dead are feared buried under the rubble.\n\nU.S. and Israeli officials have told Reuters about half of Hamas's forces have been killed in the conflict. Hamas does not disclose fatalities among its fighters and some officials say Israel exaggerated the figures.", "source": {"uri": "usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "USA Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_City", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internally_displaced_person", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Internally displaced person"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNRWA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UNRWA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Islamism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hostage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airstrike", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Airstrike"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of State"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_Islamic_Jihad", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian Islamic Jihad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_refugees", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian refugees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Military campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurgency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Insurgency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_J._Burns_(diplomat)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "William J.

There was no immediate confirmation by the health ministry, and the death toll could not immediately be verified.\n\nFootage on X posted by Palestinian journalists in the early hours of Thursday showed rows of bodies laid out at al-Aqsa hospital in Deir al-Balah, and wounded children being treated on the floor.\n\nThe Israeli military confirmed on X that it had targeted a UN school in al-Nuseirat, saying that it had been home to Hamas terrorists who had taken part in the 7 October attack on Israel. \"Terrorists\" who had been planning to carry out attacks in the immediate future had been \"eliminated\", it said, and that \"many steps were taken to reduce the chance of harm to those not involved\".\n\nThe attack on the school run by Unrwa, the UN refugee agency for Palestinians, follows the announcement on Wednesday by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) of a new operation against Hamas in central Gaza, with Palestinian medics saying airstrikes had killed dozens of people.\n\nThe charity Medicines Sans Frontiers (MSF) said that since Tuesday at least 70 dead and more than 300 wounded, mostly women and children, had been brought to al-Aqsa hospital after \"heavy Israeli strikes\" in central Gaza.\n\nKarin Huster, an MSF medical adviser in Gaza, described the situation as \"overwhelming\". \"There are people lying everywhere on the floor, outside ... bodies were being brought in plastic bags,\" she said on X.\n\nAn Israeli military statement said of the new operation: \"The forces of the 98th Division began a precise campaign in the areas of East Bureij and East Deir al-Balah, above and below ground at the same time.\"\n\nResidents said Israeli forces had sent tanks into Bureij and planes and tanks pounded the nearby settlements of al-Maghazi and al-Nuseirat as well as Deir al-Balah city.\n\nThe armed wings of Hamas and Islamic Jihad said they had fought gun battles with Israeli forces in areas throughout the territory and fired anti-tank rockets and shells.\n\nAbu Mohammed Abu Saif said two of his children were among the dead brought to al-Aqsa hospital after the earlier Israeli strikes. \"This is not war, it is destruction that words are unable to express,\" he said, adding that his children had been killed along with their mother, who had been unable to leave when others in the neighbourhood did.\n\nAl-Aqsa hospital is one of the last hospitals functioning in Gaza. Earlier in the night it reported an electrical generator failure, which risked complicating the treatment of patients.\n\nIsrael also reiterated on Wednesday its refusal to halt the Gaza offensive for a resumption of hostage-release talks with Hamas, with defence minister Yoav Gallant quoted by Israeli media as saying, \"Any negotiations with Hamas would be conducted only under fire.\"\n\nHamas leader Ismail Haniyeh meanwhile said the group would demand a permanent end to the war in Gaza and Israeli withdrawal as part of a ceasefire plan.\n\nThe comments dealt an apparent blow to a much-touted truce proposal put forward last week by US president Joe Biden.\n\nIsrael's military assault on Gaza has killed more than 36,000 people, according to health officials in the territory, who say thousands more dead are feared buried under the rubble. The war was sparked by an unprecedented attack by Hamas in southern Israel in October last year, killing about 1,200 people.\n\nOn Wednesday two new food security reports reported that many Palestinians in Gaza had been killed by months of extreme hunger while permanent damage had been caused to children through malnutrition, even before famine is officially declared.\n\nThe US-based famine early warning system network (Fews Net) said it was \"possible, if not likely\" that famine began in northern Gaza in April. Two UN organisations said more than 1 million people were \"expected to face death and starvation\" by mid-July.\n\nIsrael has blocked the entry of much aid and fuel to Gaza, and cut off most of the water supply.\n\nIsrael's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has meanwhile threatened an \"extremely powerful\" response to attacks by Hezbollah from Lebanon, which have escalated in recent days and set off huge fires in northern Israel.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "helen_livingstone@theguardian.com", "name": "Helen

An international medical charity had reported soaring casualties even before Thursday's strike.\n\nThe Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir al-Balah received at least 30 bodies from the strike on the school run by the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees -- known by the acronym UNRWA -- and another six from a separate strike on a home, according to hospital records and an Associated Press reporter at the hospital. Hamas-run TV had earlier reported a higher toll.\n\nThe Israeli military claimed, without immediately offering evidence, that Hamas and the Islamic Jihad used the school as cover for their operations and that risk reduction steps were taken before the strike.\n\nThe war began with Hamas' Oct. 7 attack inside Israel that killed at least 1,200 people with 250 others taken hostage. The Israeli military campaign in the Gaza Strip has killed at least 36,000 Palestinians, with hundreds of others killed in operations in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.\n\nYEMEN'S HOUTHI REBELS UNVEIL A NEW SOLID-FUEL MISSILE\n\nDUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Yemen's Houthi rebels have unveiled a new, solid-fuel missile in their arsenal that resembles aspects of one earlier displayed by Iran that Tehran described as flying at hypersonic speeds.\n\nThe rebels fired their new \"Palestine\" missile, complete with a warhead painted like a Palestinian keffiyeh checkered scarf, at the southern Gulf of Aqaba port of Eilat in Israel on Monday. The attack set off air raid sirens but caused no reported damage or injuries.\n\nFootage released by the Houthis late Wednesday showed the Palestine being raised on what appeared to be a mobile launcher and rising quickly into the air with plumes of white smoke coming from its engine. White smoke is common with solid-fuel missiles.\n\nSolid-fuel missiles can be set up and fired faster than those containing liquid fuel. That's a key concern for the Houthis as their missile launch sites have been repeatedly targeted by U.S. and allied forces in recent months over the rebels' attacks on shipping through the Red Sea corridor. One such strike hit the Houthis even before they were able to launch their missile.", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@aol.com",

He said Israel could still operate in Gaza but needed to avoid causing undue harm to Palestinian civilians and contravening Israel's obligations under the Genocide Convention.\n\nIsraeli President Isaac Herzog, whose position is largely ceremonial, thanked Barak on Thursday for serving on the court in a statement posted to X, adding: \"We will continue to stand firm against the evil, the hypocrisy and the false accusations leveled against the State of Israel and the IDF,\" using an acronym for Israel's military.\n\nRECENT DRONE STRIKE IN NORTHERN ISRAEL KILLED A RESERVE SOLDIER, MILITARY SAYS\n\nJERUSALEM -- Israel's military said Thursday that a drone strike on a village in northern Israel the day before killed an Israeli reserve soldier.\n\nThe Lebanese militant group Hezbollah said it launched an attack toward a gathering of military officials in response to an earlier Israeli cross-border attack.\n\nIsrael's military said two explosive drones were fired toward Hurfeish, a northern village in Israel.\n\nAir raid sirens did not go off ahead of the strike, and Israeli authorities said that the strike wounded over 10 people in addition to the one soldier killed. The military identified the fallen soldier as Staff Sgt. (res.) Refael Kauders, 39.\n\nWith Kaunders' death, 16 soldiers have been killed in Israel's north since October, along with 10 civilians.\n\nMore 400 people have been killed in Lebanon, including more than 70 civilians and noncombatants.\n\nIsrael and Hezbollah have been exchanging fire daily since a day after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack, which set off the war in Gaza. The deadly fighting has displaced tens of thousands of people on both sides of the Israel-Lebanon border and sparked fears of a wider regional war.\n\nISRAELI MILITARY SAYS IT'S NOT AWARE OF ANY CIVILIAN CASUALTIES IN ITS STRIKE ON A SCHOOL\n\nJERUSALEM -- Israel's military said Thursday it was not aware of any civilian casualties in a strike that killed at least 33 Palestinians, including 23 women and children, according to local officials and an AP reporter at the hospital that received the bodies.\n\nThe strike occurred early Thursday on a United Nations school sheltering displaced Palestinians in central Gaza. Israeli military spokesperson Lt. Col. Peter Lerner said intelligence indicated that militants had used the school compound to orchestrate some of the attacks on Oct. 7 and that at least 20 militants there were using it currently as a \"staging realm\" to launch attacks on Israeli soldiers.\n\n\"I'm not aware of civilians being caught up in this. We will be looking at the data and intelligence that comes out in the next few hours or day,\" Lerner told journalists.\n\nHe declined to say whether the military would investigate the strike, as it did in May when an Israeli strike nearby a tent camp sheltering displaced people killed dozens in Rafah, Gaza's southernmost city.\n\nSPAIN APPLIES TO JOIN SOUTH AFRICA'S CASE ACCUSING ISRAEL OF GENOCIDE\n\nMADRID -- Spain will ask a United Nations court for permission to join South Africa's case accusing Israel of genocide in Gaza, its foreign minister announced Thursday.\n\nSpain is the first European country to take the step after South Africa filed its case with the International Court of Justice in late 2023. It alleged that Israel was breaching the genocide convention in its military assault that has laid waste to large swaths of Gaza.\n\nMexico, Colombia, Nicaragua, Libya and the Palestinians have already requested to join the case currently being heard at the court in The Hague, Netherlands.\n\nThe court has ordered Israel to immediately halt its military offensive in the southern Gaza city of Rafah but stopped short of ordering a cease-fire for the enclave. Israel has not complied.\n\nSpain's request to join the case is the latest move by the government of Socialist Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez to support peacemaking efforts in Gaza.\n\nIsrael denies it is committing genocide in its military operation to crush Hamas triggered by its deadly Oct. 7 attacks in southern Israel.\n\nHamas killed 1,200 people and took 250 more hostage in the surprise attacks. Israel's air and land attacks have killed 36,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which doesn't distinguish between combatants and civilians.\n\nISRAELI STRIKE KILLS DOZENS AT A SCHOOL-TURNED-SHELTER IN GAZA\n\nDEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip -- An Israeli strike early Thursday on a school-turned-shelter in central Gaza that the military claimed was being used as a Hamas compound killed at least 30 people, including five children, according to local health officials.\n\nThe strike came after the military said it was launching new air and ground operations in central Gaza in an apparent widening of its nearly eight-month offensive, launched after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack.

Spain says it will ask a United Nations court for permission to join South Africa's case accusing Israel of genocide in Gaza. Spain is the first European country to take the step after South Africa filed its case with the International Court of Justice late last year. It alleged that Israel was breaching the genocide convention in its military assault that has laid waste to large swaths of Gaza.\n\nDozens are dead after an Israeli strike hit a school-turned-shelter in Gaza overnight. Israel claimed Thursday the school was being used as a Hamas compound, without providing evidence.\n\nThe Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir al-Balah received at least 30 bodies from the strike on the school run by the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees -- known by the acronym UNRWA -- and another six from a separate strike on a home. Israel's military later said it was not aware of any civilian casualties in the strike on the school.\n\nInternational pressure has been mounting to limit civilian bloodshed in the Israel-Hamas war. Spain's foreign minister announced Thursday that the country would ask a United Nations court for permission to join South Africa's case accusing Israel of genocide in Gaza. United States President Joe Biden's administration has launched an intense drive to persuade Hamas and Israel to accept a new cease-fire and hostage release proposal, which has raised hopes of ending the war.\n\nIsrael's war against Hamas in Gaza has killed more than 36,000 Palestinians, according to the Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians.\n\nThe eight-month war in Gaza has largely cut off the flow of food, medicine and other supplies to Palestinians who are facing widespread hunger. United Nations agencies say over 1 million in Gaza could experience the highest level of starvation by mid-July.\n\nIsrael launched the war after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack, in which militants stormed into southern Israel, killed some 1,200 people -- mostly civilians -- and abducted about 250. Around 80 hostages captured on Oct. 7 are believed to still be alive in Gaza, alongside the remains of 43 others.\n\nCurrently:\n\n-- Israeli strike on a Gaza school that military says was being used by Hamas kills 30 people.\n\n-- Spain applies to join South Africa's case at top the U.N. court accusing Israel of genocide.\n\n-- One image, millions of eyeballs: A social media effort to draw attention to Rafah surges.\n\n-- Israeli settlers in the West Bank were hit with international sanctions.

The military identified the fallen soldier as Staff Sgt. (res.) Refael Kauders, 39.\n\nWith Kaunders' death, 16 soldiers have been killed in Israel's north since October, along with 10 civilians.\n\nMore 400 people have been killed in Lebanon, including more than 70 civilians and noncombatants.\n\nIsrael and Hezbollah have been exchanging fire daily since a day after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack, which set off the war in Gaza. The deadly fighting has displaced tens of thousands of people on both sides of the Israel-Lebanon border and sparked fears of a wider regional war.\n\nISRAELI MILITARY SAYS IT'S NOT AWARE OF ANY CIVILIAN CASUALTIES IN ITS STRIKE ON A SCHOOL\n\nJERUSALEM -- Israel's military said Thursday it was not aware of any civilian casualties in a strike that killed at least 33 Palestinians, including 23 women and children, according to local officials and an AP reporter at the hospital that received the bodies.\n\nThe strike occurred early Thursday on a United Nations school sheltering displaced Palestinians in central Gaza. Israeli military spokesperson Lt. Col. Peter Lerner said intelligence indicated that militants had used the school compound to orchestrate some of the attacks on Oct. 7 and that at least 20 militants there were using it currently as a \"staging realm\" to launch attacks on Israeli soldiers.\n\n\"I'm not aware of civilians being caught up in this. We will be looking at the data and intelligence that comes out in the next few hours or day,\" Lerner told journalists.\n\nHe declined to say whether the military would investigate the strike, as it did in May when an Israeli strike nearby a tent camp sheltering displaced people killed dozens in Rafah, Gaza's southernmost city.\n\nSPAIN APPLIES TO JOIN SOUTH AFRICA'S CASE ACCUSING ISRAEL OF GENOCIDE\n\nMADRID -- Spain will ask a United Nations court for permission to join South Africa's case accusing Israel of genocide in Gaza, its foreign minister announced Thursday.\n\nSpain is the first European country to take the step after South Africa filed its case with the International Court of Justice in late 2023. It alleged that Israel was breaching the genocide convention in its military assault that has laid waste to large swaths of Gaza.\n\nMexico, Colombia, Nicaragua, Libya and the Palestinians have already requested to join the case currently being heard at the court in The Hague, Netherlands.\n\nThe court has ordered Israel to immediately halt its military offensive in the southern Gaza city of Rafah but stopped short of ordering a cease-fire for the enclave. Israel has not complied.\n\nSpain's request to join the case is the latest move by the government of Socialist Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez to support peacemaking efforts in Gaza.\n\nIsrael denies it is committing genocide in its military operation to crush Hamas triggered by its deadly Oct. 7 attacks in southern Israel.\n\nHamas killed 1,200 people and took 250 more hostage in the surprise attacks. Israel's air and land attacks have killed 36,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which doesn't distinguish between combatants and civilians.\n\nISRAELI STRIKE KILLS DOZENS AT A SCHOOL-TURNED-SHELTER IN GAZA\n\nDEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip -- An Israeli strike early Thursday on a school-turned-shelter in central Gaza that the military claimed was being used as a Hamas compound killed at least 30 people, including five children, according to local health officials.\n\nThe strike came after the military said it was launching new air and ground operations in central Gaza in an apparent widening of its nearly eight-month offensive, launched after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack. An international medical charity had reported soaring casualties even before Thursday's strike.\n\nThe Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir al-Balah received at least 30 bodies from the strike on the school run by the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees -- known by the acronym UNRWA -- and another six from a separate strike on a home, according to hospital records and an Associated Press reporter at the hospital. Hamas-run TV had earlier reported a higher toll.\n\nThe Israeli military claimed, without immediately offering evidence, that Hamas and the Islamic Jihad used the school as cover for their operations and that risk reduction steps were taken before the strike.\n\nThe war began with Hamas' Oct. 7 attack inside Israel that killed at least 1,200 people with 250 others taken hostage. The Israeli military campaign in the Gaza Strip has killed at least 36,000 Palestinians, with hundreds of others killed in operations in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.\n\nYEMEN'S HOUTHI REBELS UNVEIL A NEW SOLID-FUEL MISSILE\n\nDUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Yemen's Houthi rebels have unveiled a new, solid-fuel missile in their arsenal that resembles aspects of one earlier displayed by Iran that Tehran described as flying at hypersonic speeds.\n\nThe rebels fired their new \"Palestine\" missile, complete with a warhead painted like a Palestinian keffiyeh checkered scarf, at the southern Gulf of Aqaba port of Eilat in Israel on Monday. The attack set off air raid sirens but caused no reported damage or injuries.\n\nFootage released by the Houthis late Wednesday showed the Palestine being raised on what appeared to be a mobile launcher and rising quickly into the air with plumes of white smoke coming from its engine. White smoke is common with solid-fuel missiles.\n\nSolid-fuel missiles can be set up and fired faster than those containing liquid fuel. That's a key concern for the Houthis as their missile launch sites have been repeatedly targeted by U.S. and allied forces in recent months over the rebels' attacks on shipping through the Red Sea corridor. One such strike hit the Houthis even before they were able to launch their missile.", "source": {"uri": "idahostatejournal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Idaho State Journal"}, "authors":

Ismail Al-Thawabta, the director of the Hamas-run government media office, rejected Israel's assertion that the UN school in Nuseirat, in central Gaza, had hidden a Hamas command post.\n\n\"The occupation uses ... false fabricated stories to justify the brutal crime it conducted against dozens of displaced people,\" Thawabta told Reuters.\n\nIsrael's military said its fighter jets had carried out a \"precise strike\" and circulated satellite photos highlighting two parts of a building where it said the fighters were based.\n\n\"We're very confident in the intelligence,\" military spokesperson Lt Col Peter Lerner said, accusing Hamas and Islamic Jihad fighters of deliberately using UN facilities as operational bases.\n\nHe said 20-30 fighters were located in the compound, and many of them had been killed, but had no precise details as intelligence assessments were being carried out. \"I'm not aware of any civilian casualties and I'd be very, very cautious of accepting anything that Hamas puts out,\" he said.\n\nAs people at the school cleared rubble from bloodstained classrooms, survivor Huda Abu Dhaher described waking up to the sound of rockets.\n\n\"People's remains were scattered inside the yard and outside. The gas canister exploded,\" she told Reuters.\n\n\"My nephew was martyred (killed), he lost his leg and arm, he was a 10-year-old ... This woman's leg got a fragment in it, her son bled from his mouth and leg, her mother-in-law sustained three injuries.\"\n\nThe school, run by the UN Palestinian refugee agency (UNRWA), was sheltering 6,000 displaced people at the time, UNRWA chief Philippe Lazzarini said.\n\n\"At least 35 people were killed and many more injured,\" he wrote on X. \"Claims that armed groups may have been inside the shelter are shocking. We are however unable to verify these claims. Attacking, targeting or using UN buildings for military purposes are a blatant disregard of International Humanitarian law. \"\n\nThawabta and a medical source said 40 had been killed, including 14 children and nine women.\n\nIsrael announced a new military campaign in central Gaza on Wednesday as it battles fighters relying on hit-and-run insurgency tactics. It says there will be no halt to fighting during the ceasefire talks, which have intensified since US President Joe Biden outlined a proposal on Friday.\n\n\"At this decisive moment, we call on the leaders of Israel as well as Hamas to make whatever final compromises are necessary to close this deal,\" said the statement issued by the White House jointly with Argentina, Austria, Brazil, Britain, Canada and others.\n\nHamas seeks a permanent end to the war. Israel says it must destroy the Islamist militant group first.\n\nIn another sensitive development, the Israeli military reported a rare attack near the Israel-Gaza border, saying a squad of Palestinian fighters killed a soldier and three of them were killed in return fire.\n\nA statement by Hamas armed wing, the Al-Qassam Brigades, said its fighters had conducted an operation behind enemy lines in the Rafah area of southern Gaza, a location corresponding to the Israeli military's account.\n\nThe incident was likely to challenge efforts to restore a sense of security in Israeli border communities that were overrun by Hamas-led gunmen on Oct 7 last year.\n\nCIA director William Burns met senior officials from mediators Qatar and Egypt on Wednesday in Doha to discuss the ceasefire plan. Two Egyptian security sources said talks continued on Thursday but had shown no sign of breakthrough.\n\nBiden has repeatedly declared that ceasefires were close over the past several months, but there has been only one, week-long truce, in November.\n\nLast week's announcement coincides with intense domestic political pressure on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to chart a path to end the eight-month-old war and negotiate the release of hostages held by Hamas.\n\nA centrist party in his emergency coalition government has threatened to quit by Saturday if he does not commit to a post-war plan for Gaza. Far-right members have pledged to quit if he agrees to a peace deal that leaves Hamas in place.\n\nHamas precipitated the war by attacking Israeli territory last Oct 7, killing around 1,200 people and capturing more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies. About half the hostages were freed in the November truce.\n\nIsrael's military assault on Gaza has killed more than 36,000 people, according to health officials in the territory, who say thousands more dead are feared buried under the rubble.\n\nUS and Israeli officials have told Reuters about half of Hamas's forces have been killed in the conflict. Hamas does not disclose fatalities among its fighters, and some officials say Israel exaggerated the figures.\n\nIsrael's own military death toll is almost 300.

United Nations-run school that the Israeli military claimed housed a \"Hamas compound.\"\n\nThe deadly strike came as United States, Qatari and Egyptian mediators resumed talks aimed at securing a truce and hostage release deal in the nearly eight-month war triggered by Hamas' deadly attacks on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023.\n\nThe military said it had \"eliminated\" several militants in a

received the bodies of at least \"37 martyrs\" from the strike, updating an initial death toll of 27 provided by the Hamas government media office, which condemned it as a \"horrific massacre... that shames humanity.\"\n\nAn Agence France-Presse (AFP) photographer saw Palestinians removing blood-stained mattresses and inspecting the damage to the school where displaced Gazans were sheltering, parts of it now littered with broken concrete slabs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA medic at the hospital said another Israeli predawn strike killed six people in a house in Nuseirat, while witnesses reported intense artillery shelling in the Bureij and Al-Maghazi camps in the same area.\n\nIsraeli warplanes also carried out strikes in eastern and central neighborhoods of Rafah, Gaza's southernmost city, a local source told AFP.\n\nSticking points\n\nAs the fighting, set to enter its ninth month on Friday, rages on, Israel continues to face growing diplomatic isolation, with international court cases accusing it of war crimes and several European countries recognizing a Palestinian state.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUS President Joe Biden outlined last week what he called a three-phase Israeli plan to halt the fighting for six weeks while hostages held by militants in Gaza are exchanged for Palestinian prisoners and aid is stepped up.\n\nThe Group of Seven developed nations and Arab states have backed the proposal, although major sticking points remain: Hamas insists on a permanent truce and full Israeli withdrawal -- demands that Israel has flatly rejected.\n\nA source with knowledge of the negotiations confirmed to AFP that a meeting took place on Wednesday \"between the Qatari prime minister and head of Egyptian intelligence with Hamas in the Qatari capital Doha to discuss a deal for a truce in Gaza and the exchange of hostages and prisoners.\"\n\nBiden has urged Hamas to accept the deal and has deployed Central Intelligence Agency Director William Burns to Qatar, where the group's political bureau is based, for a renewed push after months of stalled negotiations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe source said Burns would \"continue working with mediators on reaching an agreement between Hamas and Israel on a ceasefire in Gaza and the release of hostages.\"\n\nA senior Hamas official in Lebanon's capital Beirut has accused Israel of seeking \"endless\" negotiations, while its leader Ismail Haniyeh said the Islamist movement would \"deal seriously and positively\" with any offer meeting its key demands.\n\nMuhammad al-Najjar, a 35-year-old man from northern Gaza twice displaced by the war, told AFP he was \"exhausted\" by the war, which has \"destroyed us and destroyed everything in our lives.\"\n\n\"We just want to... end the catastrophic situation that we are

School in Gaza Was 'Precise Strike'", "body": "Israel says its fighter jets targeted a \"Hamas compound\" embedded inside a school in Gaza early Thursday, but local health officials say over 30 people were killed in the attack including women and children.\n\nThe airstrike hit the al-Sardi School, a facility run by the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) in Nuseirat in central Gaza. Both Western and Palestinian news agencies reported that the school was sheltering people who had been displaced by the almost eight-month war at the time of the strike.\n\nIsrael Responds to Global Outcry by Sending Tanks Into Central Rafah for More Carnage\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces in a statement characterized the bombing as a \"precise strike\" which eliminated \"several Hamas and Islamic Jihad terrorists\" who \"participated in the Oct. 7 massacre\" in Israel. The military also claimed that \"a number of steps were taken to reduce the risk of harming uninvolved civilians during the strike\" which involved \"conducting aerial surveillance\" and \"additional intelligence information.\"\n\nAccording to the Associated Press, victims of the school attack were taken to Deir al-Balah's already overwhelmed Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital. The news agency cited one of its reporters at the scene and information from the hospital saying that at least 33 people were killed in the attack, including 14 children and nine women.\n\nThe Palestinian Authority's Wafa news agency reported that 32 died, \"most of them women and children,\" and dozens more were injured, including some seriously.\n\nAyman Rashed, a man displaced from Gaza City who was among those seeking refuge at the school at the time of the strike, told the AP that missiles struck classrooms on the second and third floors of the building where families had been sheltering. He said he'd helped to carry five deceased victims out of the school, including two children and an old man. \"It was dark, with no electricity, and we struggled to get out the victims,\" he said.\n\nThe mass casualty incident comes after at least 45 people died in another UNRWA facility for displaced Palestinians in Rafah in southern Gaza last week. The Israeli military said strikes in that incident were also targeting Hamas militants, with an IDF spokesman later claiming that the type of munitions used could not have started the blaze which broke out in the wake of the attack. They added that the inferno which swept through tents, burning people alive and injuring over 200 others, may have instead been ignited by \"secondary explosions\" due to weapons being stored in the area.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described the disaster as a \"tragic mistake.\" Multiple reports said U.S.-made munitions had been used in the Israeli strike.\n\nSince Israel launched its Gaza offensive in response to the Oct. 7 attacks, over 36,500 people have been killed in the enclave, according to the Gaza health ministry.\n\nOn Wednesday, before the reported influx of patients from the school airstrike, the ministry shared a press release from the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital saying one of the facility's two electricity generators had failed, risking a \"humanitarian catastrophe in which dozens of wounded, sick, and premature babies may fall victim.\"\n\nThe hospital said it was launching a \"distress call to the international community and international organizations\" to \"save the sick, wounded, and children of Gaza from certain death\" by helping to restore the power supply to the hospital \"before it is too late.\"\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.\n\nGet the Daily Beast's biggest scoops and scandals delivered right to your inbox.

Peter Lerner told a briefing with reporters, accusing Hamas and Islamic Jihad fighters of deliberately using UN facilities as operational bases.\n\nHe said 20-30 fighters were located in the compound, and many of them had been killed, but had no precise details as intelligence assessments were being carried out.\n\n\"I'm not aware of any civilian casualties and I'd be very, very cautious of accepting anything that Hamas puts out,\" he said.\n\nThe school, run by the UN Palestinian refugee agency (UNRWA), was sheltering 6,000 displaced people at the time, UNRWA chief Philippe Lazzarini said.\n\n\"At least 35 people were killed and many more injured,\" he wrote on X. \"Claims that armed groups may have been inside the shelter are shocking. We are however unable to verify these claims. Attacking, targeting or using UN buildings for military purposes are a blatant disregard of International Humanitarian law.\"\n\nMedia in Hamas-run Gaza had earlier put the toll at 35 to 40 people.\n\nIn an apparent blow to a truce proposal touted last week by U.S. President Joe Biden, the leader of Hamas on Wednesday said the group would demand a permanent end to the war in Gaza and Israeli withdrawal as part of a ceasefire plan.\n\nThe remarks by Ismail Haniyeh appeared to deliver the Palestinian militant group's reply to the proposal that Biden unveiled last week. Washington had said it was waiting to hear an answer from Hamas to what Biden described as an Israeli initiative.\n\n\"The movement and factions of the resistance will deal seriously and positively with any agreement that is based on a comprehensive ending of the aggression and the complete withdrawal and prisoners swap,\" Haniyeh said.\n\nAsked whether Haniyeh's remarks amounted to the group's reply to Biden, a senior Hamas official replied to a text message from Reuters with a \"thumbs up\" emoji.\n\nSince a brief week-long truce in November, all attempts to arrange a ceasefire have failed, with Hamas insisting on its demand for a permanent end to the conflict, while Israel says it is prepared to discuss only temporary pauses until the militant group is defeated.\n\nCanada was among several nations to join in a statement Thursday calling for \"the leaders of Israel as well as Hamas to make whatever final compromises are necessary to close this deal.\"\n\n\"There is no time to lose,\" the statement read. \"We call on Hamas to close this agreement, that Israel is ready to move forward with, and begin the process of releasing our citizens.\"\n\nThe signatories included Spain, which separately on Thursday became the first European country to ask a United Nations court for permission to join South Africa's case accusing Israel of genocide in Gaza.\n\nWashington is still pressing hard to reach an agreement. CIA director William Burns met senior officials from mediators Qatar and Egypt on Wednesday in Doha to discuss the ceasefire proposal.\n\nBiden has repeatedly declared that ceasefires were close over the past several months, only for no truce to materialize.\n\nLast week's announcement came with far greater fanfare from the White House, and at a time when Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is under mounting domestic political pressure to chart a path to end the eight-month-old war and negotiate the release of Israeli hostages held by Hamas.\n\nHamas-led militants abducted some 250 people when they stormed over the border into Israel on Oct. 7 last year, killing around 1,200 people, according to Israeli government tallies. About 120 people remain unaccounted for.\n\nOver 36,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's air and land war since then in Gaza, according to health officials there, and much of the densely populated enclave lies in ruins.\n\nHamas has seen about half its forces wiped out in eight months of fighting and is relying on insurgent tactics to frustrate Israel's attempts to take control of Gaza, U.S. and Israeli officials told Reuters.\n\nHamas has been reduced to between 9,000 and 12,000 fighters, according to three senior U.S. officials familiar with battlefield developments, down from American estimates of 20,000 to 25,000 before the conflict. Israel says it has lost almost 300 troops in the Gaza campaign.\n\nMeanwhile, a conflict between Israel and the Lebanon-based Hezbollah is threatening to escalate, with the U.S. State Department warning against a full-blown war.\n\nAlthough Biden described the ceasefire proposal as an Israeli offer, Israel's government has been lukewarm in public. A top Netanyahu aide confirmed on Sunday that Israel had made the proposal even though it was \"not a good deal.\"\n\nFar-right members of Netanyahu's government have pledged to quit if he agrees to a peace deal that leaves Hamas in place, a move that could force a new election and end the political career of Israel's longest-serving leader.\n\nCentrist opponents who joined Netanyahu's war cabinet in a show of unity at the outset of the conflict have also threatened to quit, saying his government has no plan.\n\nMeanwhile, Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said there would be no let-up in Israel's offensive while negotiations over the ceasefire proposal were under way.\n\n\"Any negotiations with Hamas would be conducted only under fire,\" Gallant said in remarks carried by Israeli media after he flew aboard a warplane to inspect the Gaza front.\n\nThe armed wings of Hamas and Islamic Jihad said they had fought gun battles with Israeli forces on Wednesday in areas throughout the enclave and fired anti-tank rockets and shells.", "source": {"uri": "cbc.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ismail_Haniyeh", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ismail Haniyeh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_City", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNRWA", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "UNRWA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internally_displaced_person", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Internally displaced person"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_refugees", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian refugees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_and_control", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Command and control"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fighter_aircraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fighter aircraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_Islamic_Jihad", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian Islamic Jihad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_fedayeen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian fedayeen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoav_Gallant", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yoav Gallant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_J._Burns_(diplomat)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "William J.

United Nations agencies say over 1 million in Gaza could experience the highest level of starvation by mid-July.\n\nIsrael launched the war after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack, in which militants stormed into southern Israel, killed some 1,200 people -- mostly civilians -- and abducted about 250.

An international medical charity had reported soaring casualties even before Thursday's strike.\n\nThe Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir al-Balah received at least 30 bodies from the strike on the school run by the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees -- known by the acronym UNRWA -- and another six from a separate strike on a home, according to hospital records and an Associated Press reporter at the hospital. Hamas-run TV had earlier reported a higher toll.\n\nThe Israeli military claimed, without immediately offering evidence, that Hamas and the Islamic Jihad used the school as cover for their operations and that risk reduction steps were taken before the strike.\n\nThe war began with Hamas' Oct. 7 attack inside Israel that killed at least 1,200 people with 250 others taken hostage. The Israeli military campaign in the Gaza Strip has killed at least 36,000 Palestinians, with hundreds of others killed in operations in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.\n\nYEMEN'S HOUTHI REBELS UNVEIL A NEW SOLID-FUEL MISSILE\n\nDUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Yemen's Houthi rebels have unveiled a new, solid-fuel missile in their arsenal that resembles aspects of one earlier displayed by Iran that Tehran described as flying at hypersonic speeds.\n\nThe rebels fired their new \"Palestine\" missile, complete with a warhead painted like a Palestinian keffiyeh checkered scarf, at the southern Gulf of Aqaba port of Eilat in Israel on Monday. The attack set off air raid sirens but caused no reported damage or injuries.\n\nFootage released by the Houthis late Wednesday showed the Palestine being raised on what appeared to be a mobile launcher and rising quickly into the air with plumes of white smoke coming from its engine. White smoke is common with solid-fuel missiles.\n\nSolid-fuel missiles can be set up and fired faster than those containing liquid fuel. That's a key concern for the Houthis as their missile launch sites have been repeatedly targeted by U.S. and allied forces in recent months over the rebels' attacks on shipping through the Red Sea corridor. One such strike hit the Houthis even before they were able to launch their missile.\n\nCOPYRIGHT 2024 BY CHANNEL 3000. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

Conflicting reports have emerged, with Hamas' media citing 39 deaths and other sources citing 32. The Israeli military alleges the site was used for militant operations, but evidence is yet to be provided.\n\nIsrael's military announced on Thursday its targeted strike on what it termed a 'Hamas compound' within a school in the Gaza Strip.\n\nThe attack, reported by Hamas-linked media sources, resulted in at least 32 fatalities and numerous injuries. However, details surrounding the strike, especially in the Nuseirat area, remain inconsistent as of Thursday morning. The Associated Press has yet to confirm these details independently.\n\nReports from Hamas' al-Aqsa television cite 39 deaths, although no source was provided for these numbers, while the Palestinian news agency WAFA also mentioned at least 32 people killed and dozens injured. The Israeli military claimed the strike was aimed at a school run by the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), alleging that Hamas and Islamic Jihad used the facility for their operations, though they did not immediately offer evidence.\n\nAccording to the Israeli military, steps were taken to minimize civilian casualties, including aerial surveillance and additional intelligence gathering before the strike. The Nuseirat refugee camp, a populated Palestinian area in central Gaza, dates back to the 1948 Arab-Israeli war. The Israeli military also published a graphic depicting the targeted areas on the school's upper floors.\n\nThis conflict has escalated following Hamas' attack inside Israel on October 7, which resulted in over 1,200 Israeli deaths and 250 hostages. The Israeli campaign in the Gaza Strip has resulted in approximately 36,000 Palestinian casualties, with more deaths reported from operations in the West Bank.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuseirat_Camp", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nuseirat Camp"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nuseirat Camp"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNRWA", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UNRWA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wafa", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wafa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_Islamic_Jihad", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian Islamic Jihad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_citizens_of_Israel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arab citizens of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hostage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Bank", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "West Bank"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "West Bank"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Military", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Military", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Military", "label": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Military", "wgt": 14}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/aiimagegallery/30_05_2024_23_33_34_4148777.png?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9626324", "eventUri": "eng-9626324", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 1682, "textEnd": 1691}], "sentiment": -0.1058823529411764, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

Authorities at the nearby Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital said casualties could rise as victims were still being brought to the hospital on Thursday morning.\n\nThe Israeli military confirmed it carried out the airstrike, which it said targeted a Hamas compound operating inside the school. CNN cannot independently verify the claims.\n\nIn a statement, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it had taken \"many measures\" to minimize the danger in advance of the strike, including aerial surveillance and the use of \"additional precise intelligence.\"\n\nThe attack came after the IDF ramped up ground and air assaults in the center of the strip on Tuesday amid a deepening humanitarian crisis there. Palestinians in central Gaza have reported that the intensity and frequency of Israeli strikes in the last week have felt like the beginning of the war.\n\nAccording to a journalist in the area working with CNN, the school was hit by at least three missiles that penetrated the three-story building. The facility was believed to be housing approximately 20,000 displaced people who had taken shelter in the school, its yard, and the surrounding area, according to the journalist.\n\n\"We were asleep here, (and) we suddenly saw rockets falling. I went down holding my child, we were both injured, my relative was martyred in that room,\" Jaber Abu Daher told CNN on Thursday.\n\nHe said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu \"is killing the civilians, he is not killing militants, it's innocent people asleep in a UNRWA facility... what did children and elderly do? What did they do to him? He is looking for Hamas people? Go look for them, why are you killing us in schools?\"\n\nGaza authorities said the dead and injured continue to be brought to Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, which is operating at three times its clinical capacity, \"signaling a real disaster that will lead to a greater increase in the number of martyrs,\" the Gaza media office said.\n\nUNRWA said its school was \"possibly hit several times\" overnight by the strikes. An UNRWA spokesperson told CNN it was not able to confirm Israeli reports that Hamas operatives had been using the school as a compound.\n\n\"We remind all parties to the conflict that schools and other UN premises must never be used for military or fighting purposes,\" the spokesperson said. \"UN facilities must be protected at all times.\"\n\nAn Israeli strike hit the same camp last month and killed dozens of people, Al-Aqsa Martyrs hospital said at the time. One woman, Um Mohammad Taha, told CNN then that five houses had collapsed, including her sister's, and that many were buried under the rubble, including children.\n\nAnd another Israeli attack on the Nuseirat camp in April injured several journalists, including one working with CNN.\n\nDoctors Without Borders/M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF), which has supported Al-Aqsa hospital, said Wednesday it had taken in more than 70 people who had been killed, and more than 300 injured, in just 48 hours, amid an escalation in bombing and ground fighting.\n\nKarin Huster, an MSF nurse, said in the group's statement: \"We have seen hospitals being bombed. We have seen refugee camps being bombed. We have seen humanitarian warehouses being bombed. The situation is apocalyptic.\"\n\n\"The odor of blood when I entered the emergency room was just overwhelming. People are lying on the floor. People are lying outside,\" Huster added. \"It's just an emotionally overwhelming situation.\"\n\nIsrael's renewed focus on bombarding central Gaza highlights again the elusive nature of its stated ambition to destroy Hamas. The brunt of the Israeli military campaign had, in recent months, moved south towards Rafah, but rocket fire and ground warfare have now again engulfed encampments further north such as Nuseirat and areas like Bureij, both just south of Gaza City.\n\n\"Every place we went to after they said it's safe was struck - I want the war to stop,\" Mohammad Farajallah, a child who said his two brothers were killed in Thursday's strike, told CNN as he rifled through the rubble of the school.\n\nThe latest attack also came as American, Egyptian and Qatari officials met in Doha to revive negotiations on a new ceasefire and hostage release deal.\n\nThe meetings follow a three-phase proposal -- characterized as an Israeli plan -- laid out by US President Joe Biden that would pair a release of hostages with a \"full and complete ceasefire\" in Gaza.\n\nOn Wednesday, Israel's Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant said the country's military offensive in Gaza would not be halted for any resumption of ceasefire and hostage release talks with Hamas.\n\n\"We are in a process of continuous engagement to wear down the enemy. Any negotiations with the terrorist organization Hamas will only be conducted under fire,\" Gallant said in a recorded video statement.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Peter Lerner said, accusing Hamas and Islamic Jihad fighters of deliberately using U.N. facilities as operational bases.\n\nHe said 20-30 fighters were located in the compound, and many of them had been killed, but had no precise details as intelligence assessments were being carried out. \"I'm not aware of any civilian casualties and I'd be very, very cautious of accepting anything that Hamas puts out,\" he said.\n\nAs people at the school cleared rubble from bloodstained classrooms, survivor Huda Abu Dhaher described waking up to the sound of rockets.\n\n\"People's remains were scattered inside the yard and outside. The gas canister exploded,\" she told Reuters.\n\n\"My nephew was martyred (killed), he lost his leg and arm, he was a 10-year-old ... This woman's leg got a fragment in it, her son bled from his mouth and leg, her mother-in-law sustained three injuries.\"\n\nThe school, run by the U.N. Palestinian refugee agency (UNRWA), was sheltering 6,000 displaced people at the time, UNRWA chief Philippe Lazzarini said.\n\n\"At least 35 people were killed and many more injured,\" he wrote on X. \"Claims that armed groups may have been inside the shelter are shocking. We are however unable to verify these claims. Attacking, targeting or using UN buildings for military purposes are a blatant disregard of International Humanitarian law.\"\n\nThawabta and a medical source said 40 had been killed, including 14 children and nine women.\n\nCEASEFIRE EFFORTS\n\nIsrael announced a new military campaign in central Gaza on Wednesday as it battles fighters relying on hit-and-run insurgency tactics. It says there will be no halt to fighting during the ceasefire talks, which have intensified since U.S. President Joe Biden outlined a proposal on Friday.\n\n\"At this decisive moment, we call on the leaders of Israel as well as Hamas to make whatever final compromises are necessary to close this deal,\" said the statement issued by the White House jointly with Argentina, Austria, Brazil, Britain, Canada and others.\n\nHamas seeks a permanent end to the war. Israel says it must destroy the Islamist militant group first.\n\nIn another sensitive development, the Israeli military reported a rare attack near the Israel-Gaza border, saying a squad of Palestinian fighters killed a soldier and three of them were killed in return fire.\n\nA statement by Hamas armed wing, the Al-Qassam Brigades, said its fighters had conducted an operation behind enemy lines in the Rafah area of southern Gaza, a location corresponding to the Israeli military's account.\n\nThe incident was likely to challenge efforts to restore a sense of security in Israeli border communities that were overrun by Hamas-led gunmen on Oct. 7 last year.\n\nCIA director William Burns met senior officials from mediators Qatar and Egypt on Wednesday in Doha to discuss the ceasefire plan. Two Egyptian security sources said talks continued on Thursday but had shown no sign of breakthrough.\n\nBiden has repeatedly declared that ceasefires were close over the past several months, but there has been only one, week-long truce, in November.\n\nLast week's announcement coincides with intense domestic political pressure on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to chart a path to end the eight-month-old war and negotiate the release of hostages held by Hamas.\n\nA centrist party in his emergency coalition government has threatened to quit by Saturday if he does not commit to a post-war plan for Gaza. Far-right members have pledged to quit if he agrees to a peace deal that leaves Hamas in place.\n\nHamas precipitated the war by attacking Israeli territory last Oct. 7, killing around 1,200 people and capturing more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies. About half the hostages were freed in the November truce.\n\nIsrael's military assault on Gaza has killed more than 36,000 people, according to health officials in the territory, who say thousands more dead are feared buried under the rubble.\n\nU.S. and Israeli officials have told Reuters about half of Hamas's forces have been killed in the conflict. Hamas does not disclose fatalities among its fighters and some officials say Israel exaggerated the figures.", "source": {"uri": "swissinfo.ch", "dataType": "news", "title": "SWI swissinfo.ch"}, "authors": [{"uri": "swi_swissinfo_ch@swissinfo.ch", "name": "Swi Swissinfo.Ch", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internally_displaced_person", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Internally displaced person"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_Islamic_Jihad", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian Islamic Jihad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNRWA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UNRWA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hostage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airstrike", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Airstrike"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cairo", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cairo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cairo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jerusalem"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jerusalem"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_refugees", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian refugees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Military campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurgency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Insurgency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martyr", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Martyr"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_J._Burns_(diplomat)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "William J.

What happened to us is unimaginable,\" said Naim al-Dadah from Gaza City, one of hundreds of displaced people sheltering there.\n\nIsrael's military says it carried out a \"precision, intelligence-based strike\" to target between 20 to 30 Hamas and Islamic Jihad fighters who were using the school as a staging ground to plan and launch attacks.\n\nHowever, 14 children and nine women were among those killed, the Hamas-run government media office says. Earlier, medics reported similar numbers to a local journalist working with the BBC.\n\nDuring the war, Israel has repeatedly accused Hamas of hiding its operatives in schools, hospitals, and other buildings, using civilians as human shields - charges the armed group denies.\n\n\"All of the red lines have been crossed,\" said Mr al-Dadah, suggesting that being in a UN institution had given his family no protection. He added: \"The world treats us with double standards. Israel has violated all international laws.\"\n\nIsrael has faced growing diplomatic isolation over its conduct of the war, with cases against it before two international courts, but insists it has acted within the laws of armed conflict as it tries to counter what it sees as an existential threat from Hamas.\n\nOn a call with journalists, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesman Lt Col Peter Lerner said that some of the Palestinian armed fighters based in the Nuseirat school had been involved in the 7 October attacks, which killed about 1,200 people in southern Israel and triggered the war in Gaza. No evidence was immediately given.\n\nCol Lerner suggested that Hamas and Islamic Jihad operatives would have \"felt relatively safe\" at the building, because it belonged to the UN.\n\nThe IDF published a photo of the school with classrooms on the first and second floors marked to show the locations it said were targeted by warplanes.\n\nTo an unusual extent in this case, the Israeli military has stressed that it took steps to reduce the risk of harming civilians. \"We actually called off the strike twice,\" Lt Col Lerner said.\n\nThe overnight attack was the latest case of mass casualties among Palestinians trying to find safety as Israel expands its offensives in the Gaza Strip.\n\nSome of those staying at the UN school said that they came from northern Gaza - but had heeded Israeli military evacuation orders and headed south in the early stages of the war - only to be displaced in the past month from Rafah, on the Egyptian border.\n\nThis week, the IDF announced a new ground and air assault in central Gaza, targeting what it said were Hamas fighters who had regrouped there. Its forces have repeatedly returned to parts of the Palestinian territory which they previously withdrew from.\n\nIn a courtyard of the UN school, more than 20 corpses were lined up in body bags and blankets. A journalist working with the BBC filmed several women cradling the heads and hands of their dead sons.\n\n\"It was a very harsh night,\" says Ibrahim Lulu, a teenager who said his cousin, Mohammed was killed.\n\n\"My brothers, friends and I were sitting together when suddenly there was an explosion. The mattress protected me because I was sitting against the wall. All the bodies were dismembered and torn.\"\n\nResidents said the part of the school targeted was being used as a shelter for men and boys, with women and girls sleeping in a separate section. Part of the school had previously been targeted by an Israeli strike in mid-May with the IDF then saying it was being used as a \"Hamas war room\".\n\nOvernight, casualties were rushed from Nuseirat to the al-Aqsa Martyrs' Hospital in nearby Deir al-Balah. In recent days it has been struggling to treat hundreds of wounded people following intense Israeli bombardment and shelling in the surrounded area.\n\nThe hospital had earlier reported an electrical generator failure saying that this would make it harder to treat patients.\n\nOn Wednesday, Medics from Doctors Without Borders (MSF) which is supporting the hospital described chaotic scenes there. It said that in the previous 24 hours, at least 70 dead people had been brought in, and more than 300 wounded, mostly women and children.", "source": {"uri": "bbc.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Videos showed the destruction and a number of bodies.\n\nIsrael's military said it had \"conducted a precise strike on a Hamas compound\" in the school and killed many of the 20 to 30 fighters it believed were inside.\n\nGaza's Hamas-run Government Media Office denied the claim and accused Israel of carrying out a \"horrific massacre\".\n\nThe head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa), which runs the school, described the incident as \"horrific\" and said the claim that armed groups might have been inside a shelter was \"shocking\".\n\nDead and wounded people were rushed to the al-Aqsa Martyrs' Hospital, in the nearby town of Deir al-Balah which has been overwhelmed since the Israeli military began a new ground operation against Hamas in central Gaza this week.\n\nThe circumstances of the strike in Nuseirat are still unclear and the BBC is working to verify the information coming in.\n\nLocal journalists and residents said it took place in the early hours of Thursday at al-Sardi school, which in a south-eastern Block 2 area of the densely-populated, decades-old camp, where Unrwa provides services.\n\nThe school was full of hundreds of displaced people who had fled the fighting elsewhere in Gaza, according to the residents. Many schools and other UN facilities have been used as shelters by the 1.7 million people who have fled their homes during the war, which has lasted almost eight months.\n\n\"I heard five missiles hitting the school. I went out, running, and found the fire burning in three classrooms,\" Maha Issa, a woman who said she was staying at the school with her family, told the Associated Press.\n\n\"My father was directly hit by the missile, and my uncle and my two cousins were martyred.\"\n\nVideos shared on social media showed the destruction of several classrooms at the school, as well as bodies wrapped in white shrouds and blankets.\n\n\"Enough war! We have been displaced dozens of times. They killed our children while they were sleeping,\" a woman injured in the attack screamed in one video.\n\nResidents initially said that more than 20 people were killed in the attack.\n\nLater, an official at al-Aqsa hospital told a freelance journalist working for the BBC that it had received 40 bodies from the school.\n\nGaza's Hamas-run health ministry said in a statement that 40 people were killed, including 14 children and nine women, and 74 others were injured. The same death toll was given by the director of the Hamas-run Government Media Office, Ismail al-Thawabta.\n\nUnrwa's Commissioner General, Philippe Lazzarini, said in a statement on X, formerly Twitter, that at least 35 people were killed and many more injured.\n\nIn a statement, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said fighter jets had conducted a \"precise strike on a Hamas compound embedded inside an Unrwa school in the area of Nuseirat\". An annotated aerial photograph highlighted classrooms on two upper floors of the building, which the IDF said were the \"locations of the terrorists\".\n\nThe IDF said members of Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad who took part in the 7 October attack on southern Israel, when around 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage, had been operating in the building.\n\n\"Before the strike, a number of steps were taken to reduce the risk of harming uninvolved civilians during the strike, including conducting aerial surveillance, and additional intelligence information,\" it added.\n\nLater, IDF spokesman Lt Col Peter Lerner told reporters that between 20 and 30 fighters had been using the school to plan and carry out attacks, and that many of them were killed in the strike. \"I'm not aware of any civilian casualties and I'd be very, very cautious of accepting anything that Hamas puts out,\" he added.\n\nHe also said the IDF had called off the attack twice in order to limit civilian casualties and accused Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad of deliberately using UN facilities as operational bases.\n\nMr Thawabta rejected the IDF's claims, saying: \"The occupation uses lying to the public opinion through false fabricated stories to justify the brutal crime it conducted against dozens of displaced people.\"\n\nThe head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa), Philippe Lazzarini, said said the school was hit \"without prior warning\" to his agency or the 6,000 displaced people who were sheltering there.\n\n\"Claims that armed groups may have been inside the shelter are shocking. We are however unable to verify these claims,\" he added.\n\n\"Attacking, targeting or using UN buildings for military purposes are a blatant disregard of International Humanitarian law. UN staff, premises and operations must be protected at all times.\"\n\nMr Lazzarini complained that more than 180 Unrwa buildings had been hit since the war began despite their co-ordinates being shared with parties to the conflict, and that more than 450 displaced people had been killed as a result.\n\n\"This must stop and all those responsible must be held accountable,\" he said.\n\nAt least 36,650 people have been killed in Gaza since Israel launched a military campaign in response to the 7 October attack, according to the territory's health ministry, whose figures do not differentiate between civilians and combatants.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Israeli military said it had taken \"operational control\" over eastern areas of Bureij refugee camp - which is just west of Nuseirat - and eastern Deir al-Balah.\n\nResidents reported intense bombardment and the charity M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF) said at least 70 bodies - the majority women and children - had been brought to al-Aqsa hospital over the previous 24 hours.\n\nLast month, there was global outrage after an Israeli air strike which the IDF said targeted two senior Hamas officials and a resulting fire reportedly killed dozens of Palestinians at a tented camp for displaced people near a Unrwa logistics base in the southern city of Rafah.\n\nThe IDF said the loss of life was \"tragic\" and that it was investigating the possibility that ammunition stored by Hamas could have exploded.\n\nThat incident prompted mediators to revive their efforts to broker a ceasefire and hostage release deal between Israel and Hamas.\n\nUS President Joe Biden outlined last Friday what he described as an Israeli proposal that had been presented to Hamas.\n\nThe first phase of the plan would last six weeks and include a temporary truce that would see the release of some of the hostages still being held in Gaza in return for Palestinians from Israeli jails. The second phase would include a permanent cessation of hostilities.\n\nOn Thursday, the US, UK and 16 other countries with citizens among the hostages issued a joint statement calling on the leaders of Israel and Hamas \"to make whatever final compromises are necessary to close this deal and bring relief to the families of our hostages\".\n\nHamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh said on Wednesday that the group would deal \"seriously and positively\" with a proposal based on an end to the war and a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza.\n\nIsrael's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has insisted he will not agree to a permanent ceasefire before Hamas is defeated and the hostages are released. On Wednesday, he declared that the country was \"striving for total victory\".", "source": {"uri": "nationnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Nation Newspaper, The"}, "authors": [{"uri":

An international medical charity had reported soaring casualties even before Thursday's strike.\n\nThe Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir al-Balah received at least 30 bodies from the strike on the school run by the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees -- known by the acronym UNRWA -- and another six from a separate strike on a home, according to hospital records and an Associated Press reporter at the hospital. Hamas-run TV had earlier reported a higher toll.\n\nThe Israeli military claimed, without immediately offering evidence, that Hamas and the Islamic Jihad used the school as cover for their operations and that risk reduction steps were taken before the strike.\n\nThe war began with Hamas' Oct. 7 attack inside Israel that killed at least 1,200 people with 250 others taken hostage. The Israeli military campaign in the Gaza Strip has killed at least 36,000 Palestinians, with hundreds of others killed in operations in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.\n\nYEMEN'S HOUTHI REBELS UNVEIL A NEW SOLID-FUEL MISSILE\n\nDUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Yemen's Houthi rebels have unveiled a new, solid-fuel missile in their arsenal that resembles aspects of one earlier displayed by Iran that Tehran described as flying at hypersonic speeds.\n\nThe rebels fired their new \"Palestine\" missile, complete with a warhead painted like a Palestinian keffiyeh checkered scarf, at the southern Gulf of Aqaba port of Eilat in Israel on Monday. The attack set off air raid sirens but caused no reported damage or injuries.\n\nFootage released by the Houthis late Wednesday showed the Palestine being raised on what appeared to be a mobile launcher and rising quickly into the air with plumes of white smoke coming from its engine. White smoke is common with solid-fuel missiles.\n\nSolid-fuel missiles can be set up and fired faster than those containing liquid fuel. That's a key concern for the Houthis as their missile launch sites have been repeatedly targeted by U.S. and allied forces in recent months over the rebels' attacks on shipping through the Red Sea corridor. One such strike hit the Houthis even before they were able to launch their missile.\n\nMore from this section\n\nImaget v2.0.0 Released: Bulk Download Images from URL List\n\nJon Tester wins

Videos showed the destruction and a number of bodies.\n\nIsrael's military said it had \"conducted a precise strike on a Hamas compound\" in the school and killed many of the 20 to 30 fighters it believed were inside.\n\nGaza's Hamas-run Government Media Office denied the claim and accused Israel of carrying out a \"horrific massacre\".\n\nDead and wounded people were rushed to the al-Aqsa Martyrs' Hospital, in the nearby town of Deir al-Balah which has been overwhelmed since the Israeli military began a new ground operation against Hamas in central Gaza this week.\n\nThe circumstances of the strike in Nuseirat are still unclear and the BBC is working to verify the information coming in.\n\nLocal journalists and residents said it took place in the early hours of Thursday at al-Sardi school, which is run by the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa) and is located in a south-eastern Block 2 area of the densely-populated, decades-old camp.\n\nThe school was full with hundreds of displaced people who had fled the fighting elsewhere in Gaza, according to the residents.\n\nVideos shared on social media showed the destruction of several classrooms at the school, as well as bodies wrapped in white shrouds and blankets.\n\n\"Enough war! We have been displaced dozens of times. They killed our children while they were sleeping,\" a woman injured in the attack screamed in one video.\n\nResidents initially said that more than 20 people were killed in the attack.\n\nLater, an official at al-Aqsa hospital told a freelance journalist working for the BBC that it had received 40 bodies from the school.\n\nUnrwa spokeswoman Juliette Touma also told Reuters that the number of those reported killed was between 35 and 45. But she added that she could not confirm the figure at this stage.\n\nReuters also cited the director of the Hamas-run Government Media Office, Ismail al-Thawabta, and an official at the Hamas-run health ministry as saying that 40 people were killed, including 14 children and nine women.\n\nIn a statement, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said fighter jets had conducted a \"precise strike on a Hamas compound embedded inside an Unrwa school in the area of Nuseirat\". An annotated aerial photograph highlighted rooms on two upper floors of the building, which the IDF said were the \"locations of the terrorists\".\n\nThe IDF said members of Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad who took part in the 7 October attack on southern Israel, when around 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage, had been operating in the building.\n\n\"Before the strike, a number of steps were taken to reduce the risk of harming uninvolved civilians during the strike, including conducting aerial surveillance, and additional intelligence information,\" it added.\n\nLater, IDF spokesman Lt Col Peter Lerner told reporters that between 20 and 30 fighters had been using the school to plan and carry out attacks, and that many of them were killed in the strike.\n\nHe also said he was not aware of any civilian casualties and questioned the figures put out by Hamas-run authorities.\n\nThawabta rejected the IDF's claims, saying: \"The occupation uses lying to the public opinion through false fabricated stories to justify the brutal crime it conducted against dozens of displaced people.\"\n\nAt least 36,580 people have been killed in Gaza since Israel launched a military campaign in response to the 7 October attack, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry, whose figures do not differentiate between civilians and combatants.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Israeli military said it had taken \"operational control\" over eastern areas of Bureij refugee camp - which is just west of Nuseirat - and eastern Deir al-Balah.\n\nResidents reported intense bombardment and the charity M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF) said at least 70 bodies - the majority women and children - had been brought to al-Aqsa hospital over the previous 24 hours. -- BBC", "source": {"uri": "saudigazette.com.sa", "dataType": "news", "title": "Saudi Gazette"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuseirat_Camp", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nuseirat Camp"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nuseirat Camp"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_refugees", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian refugees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massacre", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Massacre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missile", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Missile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airstrike", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Airstrike"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forced_displacement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Forced displacement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deir_al-Balah", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Deir al-Balah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Deir al-Balah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internally_displaced_person", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Internally displaced person"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journalist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Journalist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_Islamic_Jihad", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian Islamic Jihad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IDF_Spokesperson's_Unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "IDF Spokesperson's Unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Military campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M\u00e9decins_Sans_Fronti\u00e8res", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Surveillance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureij", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bureij"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bureij"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Refugees", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Refugees", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Nutrition/School_Meals", "label": "dmoz/Health/Nutrition/School Meals", "wgt": 11}], "image": "https://saudigazette.com.sa/uploads/images/2024/06/06/2393564.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9626324", "eventUri": "eng-9626324", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 2696, "textEnd": 2705, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.4588235294117647, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

In the attack, terrorists were eliminated who were planning to carry out attacks and promote terrorism against our forces in the immediate time frame,\" the Israeli military said in a post on X.\n\nThe military added that \"many steps were taken to reduce the chance of harm to those not involved.\"\n\nStaff at Al-Aqsa say one of the two generators at the central Gaza facility is now out of service and called on the international community for help to save people from \"certain death.\"\n\nMeanwhile, A Palestinian journalist has been attacked as thousands of ultranationalist Israelis paraded through occupied East Jerusalem as part of an annual \"Jerusalem Day\" flag march.\n\nIsrael's Display of 'Inhumanity' Will Have Long-Lasting Repercussions: Ashrawi\n\nHanan Ashrawi, a Palestinian political leader and former member of the Palestine Liberation Organization Executive Committee, stated that Israel's display of \"inhumanity, immorality, and vicious drive for death and destruction\" will have long-lasting ramifications, \"particularly within Israel.\"\n\nIn a brief social media post, the veteran Palestinian politician emphasized that words or even real images cannot encompass the level of violence exhibited by the \"Israeli occupation.\"\n\n\"The human mind, like the human conscience, is in despair,\" she wrote. \"The ramifications will be felt for a long time, particularly within Israel.\"\n\nAmongst all the chaos, Muhannad Hadi, the UN's humanitarian coordinator for the Middle East peace process, has warned that Palestinians in the occupied West Bank are facing increasing violence and pressure and \"must be supported\" to prevent the territory from becoming \"another Gaza.\"\n\n\"More than 500 Palestinians have been killed across the West Bank since October and thousands have been displaced,\" Hadi said in a social media post.\n\n\"Houses have been demolished.

Hamas seeks a permanent end to the war. Israel says it must destroy the Islamist group first.\n\nThe United States issued a joint statement with other countries on Thursday calling on Israel and Hamas to make whatever compromises were necessary to finalise a deal as the two sides gave contradictory accounts of the school attack.\n\nIsmail Al-Thawabta, the director of the Hamas-run government media office, rejected Israel's assertion that the U.N. school in Nuseirat, in central Gaza, had hidden a Hamas command post.\n\n\"The occupation uses ... false fabricated stories to justify the brutal crime it conducted against dozens of displaced people,\" Thawabta told Reuters.\n\nIsrael's military said its fighter jets had carried out a \"precise strike\" and circulated satellite photos highlighting two parts of a building where it said the fighters were based.\n\n\"We're very confident in the intelligence,\" military spokesperson Lt Col. Peter Lerner told reporters, accusing Hamas and Islamic Jihad fighters of deliberately using U.N. facilities as operational bases.\n\nHe said 20-30 fighters were located in the compound, and many of them had been killed, but had no precise details as intelligence assessments were being carried out. \"I'm not aware of any civilian casualties and I'd be very, very cautious of accepting anything that Hamas puts out,\" he said.\n\nThe school, run by the U.N. Palestinian refugee agency (UNRWA), was sheltering 6,000 displaced people at the time, UNRWA chief Philippe Lazzarini said.\n\n\"At least 35 people were killed and many more injured,\" he wrote on X. \"Claims that armed groups may have been inside the shelter are shocking. We are however unable to verify these claims. Attacking, targeting or using UN buildings for military purposes are a blatant disregard of International Humanitarian law.\"\n\nMedia in Hamas-run Gaza had earlier put the toll at 35-40. Thawabta and a medical source said 40 had been killed, including 14 children and nine women.\n\nCEASEFIRE EFFORTS\n\nIsrael announced a new military campaign in central Gaza on Wednesday as it battles fighters relying on hit-and-run insurgency tactics. It says there will be no halt to fighting during ceasefire talks, which have intensified since U.S. President Joe Biden outlined a proposal on Friday.\n\n\"At this decisive moment, we call on the leaders of Israel as well as Hamas to make whatever final compromises are necessary to close this deal,\" said the statement issued by the White House jointly with Argentina, Austria, Brazil, Britain, Canada and others.\n\nIn another sensitive development, the Israeli military reported a rare attack near the Israel-Gaza border, saying a squad of Palestinian fighters killed a soldier and three of them were killed in return fire.\n\nIt did not name a location but a statement by Hamas armed wing, Al-Qassam Brigades said its fighters had conducted an operation behind enemy lines in the Rafah area of southern Gaza, a location corresponding to the Israeli military's account.\n\n\"Al-Qassam fighters managed to penetrate the barrier and attacked the enemy command headquarters,\" it said.\n\nThe incident was likely to challenge efforts to restore a sense of security in Israeli border communities that were overrun by Hamas-led gunmen on Oct. 7 last year.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Israeli military said it was setting up a quick-response commando unit made up of border residents as a precaution against further armed incursions.\n\nCIA director William Burns met senior officials from mediators Qatar and Egypt on Wednesday in Doha to discuss the ceasefire plan. Two Egyptian security sources said talks continued on Thursday but had shown no sign of breakthrough.\n\nBiden has repeatedly declared that ceasefires were close over the past several months, but there has been only one, week-long truce, in November.\n\nLast week's announcement coincides with intense domestic political pressure on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to chart a path to end the eight-month-old war and negotiate the release of hostages held by Hamas.\n\nBut far-right members of his government have pledged to quit if he agrees to a peace deal that leaves Hamas in place.\n\nHamas precipitated the war by attacking Israeli territory last Oct. 7, killing around 1,200 people and capturing more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies. About half the hostages were freed in the November truce.\n\nIsrael's military assault on Gaza has killed more than 36,000 people, according to health officials in the territory, who say thousands more dead are feared buried under the rubble.\n\nU.S. and Israeli officials have told Reuters about half of Hamas's forces have been killed in the conflict. Hamas does not disclose fatalities among its fighters and some officials say Israel exaggerated the figures.\n\nIsrael's own military death toll is almost 300.\n\n(Additional reporting by Dan Williams, Clauda Tanios, Mrinmay Dey and Reuters bureaux; Writing by Michael Perry and Philippa Fletcher; Editing by Gerry Doyle and Timothy Heritage)", "source": {"uri": "zawya.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Zawya.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internally_displaced_person", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Internally displaced person"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNRWA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UNRWA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Islamism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hostage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airstrike", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Airstrike"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_Islamic_Jihad", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian Islamic Jihad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_refugees", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian refugees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Military campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurgency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Insurgency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Austria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Austria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_J._Burns_(diplomat)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "William J.

Hamas seeks a permanent end to the war. Israel says it must destroy the Islamist group first.\n\nThe United States issued a joint statement with other countries Thursday calling on Israel and Hamas to make whatever compromises were necessary to finalize a deal as the two sides gave contradictory accounts of the school attack.\n\nIsmail Al-Thawabta, the director of the Hamas terrorist-run government media office, rejected Israel's assertion that the U.N. school in Nuseirat, in central Gaza, had hidden a Hamas command post.\n\n\"The occupation uses ... false fabricated stories to justify the brutal crime it conducted against dozens of displaced people,\" Thawabta told Reuters.\n\nIsrael's military said its fighter jets had carried out a \"precise strike\" and circulated satellite photos highlighting two parts of a building where it said the fighters were based.\n\n\"We're very confident in the intelligence,\" military spokesperson Lt Col. Peter Lerner told a briefing with reporters, accusing Hamas and Islamic Jihad fighters of deliberately using U.N. facilities as operational bases.\n\nHe said 20-30 fighters were located in the compound, and many of them had been killed, but had no precise details as intelligence assessments were being carried out. \"I'm not aware of any civilian casualties and I'd be very, very cautious of accepting anything that Hamas puts out,\" he said.\n\nThe school, run by the U.N. Palestinian refugee agency (UNRWA), might have been hit several times, said the agency's communications director, Juliette Touma.\n\nShe said she could not confirm the death toll at this stage. Media in Hamas terrorist-run Gaza had earlier put the toll at 35-40. Thawabta and a medical source said 40 had been killed, including 14 children and nine women.\n\nCease-fire Efforts\n\nIsrael announced a new military campaign in central Gaza on Wednesday as it battles fighters relying on hit-and-run insurgency tactics. It says there will be no halt to fighting during ceasefire talks, which have intensified since U.S. President Joe Biden outlined a proposal on Friday.\n\nSince a week-long truce in November, all attempts to arrange a ceasefire have failed, with each side blaming the other.\n\n\"At this decisive moment, we call on the leaders of Israel as well as Hamas to make whatever final compromises are necessary to close this deal,\" said the statement issued by the White House jointly with Argentina, Austria, Brazil, Britain, Canada and others.\n\nCIA director William Burns met senior officials from mediators Qatar and Egypt on Wednesday in Doha to discuss the ceasefire proposal. Two Egyptian security sources said talks continued Thursday but had shown no sign of breakthrough.\n\nBiden has repeatedly declared that ceasefires were close over the past several months, only for no truce to materialize.\n\nLast week's high-profile announcement coincides with intense domestic political pressure on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to chart a path to end the eight-month-old war and negotiate the release of Israeli hostages held by Hamas.\n\nHamas, which rules Gaza, precipitated the war by attacking Israeli territory on Oct. 7, killing around 1,200 people and capturing more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies. Around half of the hostages were freed in the November truce.\n\nIsrael's military assault on Gaza has killed more than 36,000 people, according to Hamas terrorist-run health ministry, which claims thousands more dead are feared buried under the rubble.\n\nAbout half of Hamas's forces have been wiped out in eight months of fighting and the group is relying on insurgent tactics to frustrate Israel's attempts to take control of Gaza, U.S. and Israeli officials told Reuters.\n\nHamas has been reduced to 9,000 to 12,000 fighters, according to three senior U.S. officials familiar with battlefield developments, down from American estimates of 20,000-25,000 before the conflict. Israel says it has lost almost 300 troops in the Gaza campaign.\n\nHamas does not disclose fatalities among its fighters and some officials have described Israel's figures for the number of Hamas fighters killed as exaggerated.\n\nMeanwhile, a conflict between Israel and the Lebanon-based Hezbollah is threatening to escalate, with the U.S. State Department warning against a full-blown war.\n\nAlthough Biden described the ceasefire proposal as an Israeli offer, Israel's government has been lukewarm in public.

Peter Lerner told a briefing with reporters, accusing Hamas and Islamic Jihad fighters of deliberately using U.N. facilities as operational bases.\n\nHe said 20-30 fighters were located in the compound, and many of them had been killed, but had no precise details as intelligence assessments were being carried out. \"I'm not aware of any civilian casualties and I'd be very, very cautious of accepting anything that Hamas puts out,\" he said.\n\nThe school, run by the U.N. Palestinian refugee agency (UNRWA), may have been hit several times, said the agency's communications director, Juliette Touma.\n\nShe said she could not confirm the death toll at this stage. Media in Hamas-run Gaza had earlier put the toll at 35-40. Thawabta and a medical source said 40 had been killed, including 14 children and nine women.\n\nCEASEFIRE EFFORTS\n\nIsrael announced a new military campaign in central Gaza on Wednesday as it battles fighters relying on hit-and-run insurgency tactics. It says there will be no halt to fighting during ceasefire talks, which have intensified since U.S. President Joe Biden outlined a proposal on Friday.\n\nSince a week-long truce in November, all attempts to arrange a ceasefire have failed, with each side blaming the other.\n\n\"At this decisive moment, we call on the leaders of Israel as well as Hamas to make whatever final compromises are necessary to close this deal,\" said the statement issued by the White House jointly with Argentina, Austria, Brazil, Britain, Canada and others.\n\nCIA director William Burns met senior officials from mediators Qatar and Egypt on Wednesday in Doha to discuss the ceasefire proposal. Two Egyptian security sources said talks continued on Thursday but had shown no sign of breakthrough.\n\nBiden has repeatedly declared that ceasefires were close over the past several months, only for no truce to materialise.\n\nLast week's high-profile announcement coincides with intense domestic political pressure on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to chart a path to end the eight-month-old war and negotiate the release of Israeli hostages held by Hamas.\n\nHamas, which rules Gaza, precipitated the war by attacking Israeli territory on Oct. 7, killing around 1,200 people and capturing more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies. Around half of the hostages were freed in the November truce.\n\nIsrael's military assault on Gaza has killed more than 36,000 people, according to health officials in the territory, who say thousands more dead are feared buried under the rubble.\n\nAbout half of Hamas's forces have been wiped out in eight months of fighting and the group is relying on insurgent tactics to frustrate Israel's attempts to take control of Gaza, U.S. and Israeli officials told Reuters.\n\nHamas has been reduced to 9,000 to 12,000 fighters, according to three senior U.S. officials familiar with battlefield developments, down from American estimates of 20,000-25,000 before the conflict. Israel says it has lost almost 300 troops in the Gaza campaign.\n\nHamas does not disclose fatalities among its fighters and some officials have described Israel's figures for the number of Hamas fighters killed as exaggerated.\n\nMeanwhile, a conflict between Israel and the Lebanon-based Hezbollah is threatening to escalate, with the U.S. State Department warning against a full-blown war.\n\nAlthough Biden described the ceasefire proposal as an Israeli offer, Israel's government has been lukewarm in public. A top Netanyahu aide confirmed on Sunday that Israel had made the proposal even though it was \"not a good deal\".\n\nFar-right members of Netanyahu's government have pledged to quit if he agrees to a peace deal that leaves Hamas in place, a move that could force a new election and end the political career of Israel's longest-serving leader.\n\nCentrist opponents who joined Netanyahu's war cabinet in a show of unity at the outset of the conflict have also threatened to quit, saying his government has no plan.", "source": {"uri": "dtnext.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "dtNext.in"}, "authors": [{"uri": "reuters@dtnext.in", "name": "Reuters", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_City", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostage", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hostage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internally_displaced_person", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internally displaced person"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Islamism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airstrike", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Airstrike"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jerusalem"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jerusalem"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_Islamic_Jihad", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian Islamic Jihad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_J._Burns_(diplomat)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "William J.

We have been displaced dozens of times.

The same death toll was given by the director of the Hamas-run Government Media Office, Ismail al-Thawabta.\n\nThe head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa), Philippe Lazzarini, said in a statement on X, formerly Twitter, that at least 35 people were killed and many more injured. The agency's director of communications, Juliette Touma, told the BBC that \"the figures are coming from our own Unrwa colleagues on the ground\".\n\nIn a statement, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said fighter jets had conducted a \"precise strike on a Hamas compound embedded inside an Unrwa school in the area of Nuseirat\". An annotated aerial photograph highlighted classrooms on two upper floors of the building, which the IDF said were the \"locations of the terrorists\".\n\nThe IDF said members of Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad who took part in the 7 October attack on southern Israel, when around 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage, had been operating in the building.\n\n\"Before the strike, a number of steps were taken to reduce the risk of harming uninvolved civilians during the strike, including conducting aerial surveillance, and additional intelligence information,\" it added.\n\nLater, IDF spokesman Lt Col Peter Lerner told reporters that between 20 and 30 fighters had been using the school to plan and carry out attacks, and that many of them were killed in the strike. \"I'm not aware of any civilian casualties and I'd be very, very cautious of accepting anything that Hamas puts out,\" he added.\n\nHe also said the IDF had called off the attack twice in order to limit civilian casualties and accused Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad of deliberately using UN facilities as operational bases.\n\nMr Thawabta rejected the IDF's claims, saying: \"The occupation uses lying to the public opinion through false fabricated stories to justify the brutal crime it conducted against dozens of displaced people.\"\n\nPhilippe Lazzarini said the school was hit \"without prior warning\" to his agency or the 6,000 displaced people who were sheltering there.\n\n\"Claims that armed groups may have been inside the shelter are shocking. We are however unable to verify these claims,\" he added.\n\n\"Attacking, targeting or using UN buildings for military purposes are a blatant disregard of International Humanitarian law. UN staff, premises and operations must be protected at all times.\"\n\nMr Lazzarini complained that more than 180 Unrwa buildings had been hit since the war began despite their co-ordinates being shared with parties to the conflict, and that more than 450 displaced people had been killed as a result.\n\n\"This must stop and all those responsible must be held accountable,\" he said.\n\nAt least 36,650 people have been killed in Gaza since Israel launched a military campaign in response to the 7 October attack, according to the territory's health ministry, whose figures do not differentiate between civilians and combatants.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Israeli military said it had taken \"operational control\" over eastern areas of Bureij refugee camp - which is just west of Nuseirat - and eastern Deir al-Balah.\n\nResidents reported intense bombardment and the charity M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF) said at least 70 bodies - the majority women and children - had been brought to al-Aqsa hospital over the previous 24 hours.\n\nLast month, there was global outrage after an Israeli air strike, which the IDF said targeted two senior Hamas officials, and a resulting fire reportedly killed dozens of Palestinians at a tented camp for displaced people near a Unrwa logistics base in the southern city of Rafah.\n\nThe IDF said the loss of life was \"tragic\" and that it was investigating the possibility that ammunition stored by Hamas could have exploded.\n\nThat incident prompted mediators to revive their efforts to broker a ceasefire and hostage release deal between Israel and Hamas.\n\nUS President Joe Biden outlined last Friday what he described as an Israeli proposal that had been presented to Hamas.\n\nThe first phase of the plan would last six weeks and include a temporary truce that would see the release of some of the hostages still being held in Gaza in return for Palestinians from Israeli jails. The second phase would include a permanent cessation of hostilities.\n\nOn Thursday, the US, UK and 16 other countries with citizens among the hostages issued a joint statement calling on the leaders of Israel and Hamas \"to make whatever final compromises are necessary to close this deal and bring relief to the families of our hostages\".\n\nHamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh said on Wednesday that the group would deal \"seriously and positively\" with a proposal based on an end to the war and a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza.\n\nIsrael's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has insisted he will not agree to a permanent ceasefire before Hamas is defeated and the hostages are released. On Wednesday, he declared that the country was \"striving for total victory\".", "source": {"uri": "the-star.co.ke", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Star"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The Israeli military stated that the strike targeted a \"Hamas compound\" housed within the school.\n\nLocal journalists reported that an Israeli warplane fired two missiles at classrooms on the top floor of the school in the Nuseirat refugee camp. The Gaza media office claimed at least 27 people were killed and accused Israel of committing a \"horrific massacre.\"\n\nAmbulances and rescue teams quickly transported the wounded and deceased to a nearby hospital. Footage circulating on social media depicted destroyed classrooms and bodies wrapped in shrouds at a morgue.\n\nThe Israel Defence Forces (IDF) issued a statement asserting that the air strike was a \"precise strike on a Hamas compound embedded inside a UNRWA school in the Nuseirat area.\" The IDF claimed the strike \"eliminated\" Hamas and Islamic Jihad \"terrorists\" involved in the October 7 attack on southern Israel, which resulted in approximately 1,200 deaths and 251 hostages being taken.\n\nSince that attack, at least 36,580 people have been killed in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Locals denied that the UNRWA school was being used by militants.\n\nEarlier, the Israeli military announced it had taken \"operational control\" over eastern areas of the Bureij refugee camp and the town of Deir al-Balah in central Gaza, where dozens of Palestinians were reported killed. On Wednesday morning, the military said troops, supported by air strikes, had begun an operation against \"terrorists and terrorist infrastructure above and below ground.\"\n\nReports from the BBC, citing residents and M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF), described intense bombardment. MSF reported that at least 70 dead, mostly women and children, had been brought to a local hospital since Tuesday. The charity described the situation at Deir al-Balah's al-Aqsa hospital -- one of the few remaining functional health facilities in central Gaza -- as \"apocalyptic.\"\n\nThe Israel Defence Forces (IDF) announced that it will start presenting the findings of its investigation into the events of October 7 and the ensuing war to the Chief of Staff next month. The initial issues to be addressed will include the battles at Kibbutz Be'eri during the October 7 terror attack and the defence strategy along the Gaza border, which has been in place since 2018.\n\nPalestinian State: Fatah and Hamas to Hold Reconciliation Talks in China\n\nAccording to reports in Israeli media, talks between Hamas and the Fatah party of Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas are scheduled to take place in China in mid-June, officials from both sides told Reuters. These discussions follow two recent rounds of reconciliation talks, one in China and one in Russia.\n\nHezbollah Drone Attack Injures Eleven in Northern Israel; IDF Chief Signals Possible Offensive in Lebanon\n\nIn Lebanon, eleven people were wounded, one critically, when a Hezbollah drone struck the northern Israeli town of Hurfeish. During a tour of northern Israel, IDF Chief Herzl Halevi stated that the IDF is ready to transition to an offensive in Lebanon, indicating that the country is nearing \"the point where a decision will have to be made\" on the matter. The IDF reported that the Air Force targeted Hezbollah positions overnight into Wednesday across southern Lebanon.\n\nIn a separate incident, an armed man opened fire at the U.S. Embassy in Beirut. Soldiers from the Lebanese army returned fire, wounding and arresting the shooter, a Syrian national, who was then evacuated to a hospital. U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan told NBC that one Lebanese soldier was injured and that the U.S. is \"working closely with local authorities...to ensure there is no continuing threat.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited the northern Israeli town of Kiryat Shmona, which suffered extensive damage from fires triggered by rockets from Lebanon in recent days. During his visit, Netanyahu remarked, \"Yesterday the ground was set alight here, but it was also set alight in Lebanon. We are prepared for very powerful action in the north.\"", "source": {"uri": "greaterkashmir.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Greater Kashmir"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The Hamas government in Gaza places the number of dead at 40 and says 14 were children and nine were women. The Israeli army acknowledged the attack, but said it was a \"precision\" operation against 20 to 30 Hamas and Islamic Jihad militiamen who had been identified by intelligence services as using the building.\n\nIn the photographs and images broadcast by news agencies and television channels, both inside the school and at the Al Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in nearby Deir al-Balah, at least 15 corpses can be seen wrapped in blankets or in white bags, as well several people with wounds of varying severity, including children and women.\n\nPeter Lerner, an Israeli army spokesman, said in a video conference with journalists that the air strike targeted three rooms in which between 20 and 30 militiamen had installed themselves. \"We are confident that we have limited and reduced the damage to civilians in the attack [...] We are confident from our intelligence information that the terrorists were there,\" he said. The Hamas and Islamic Jihad operatives were not launching attacks from the school, he added, but they were using it as a hideout. The Hamas government in the Strip described the reports of the presence of fighters in the school as a \"lie\" and a \"fabrication.\"\n\nThe Israeli army has accepted that there were civilians in the school, but has not acknowledged any civilian casualties, nor has it opened an investigation or spoken of a \"mistake,\" as was the case after the bombing in May of a displaced persons camp in Rafah, southern Gaza, where one of the two Israeli missiles deployed caused a fire in which 45 Palestinians were killed by flames and smoke.\n\nThe school hit Thursday is located in Nuseirat, a refugee camp in central Gaza. It is one of the areas from which Israeli troops had withdrawn months ago, but they had initiated a new ground operation a day earlier against Hamas militiamen, who are employing guerrilla tactics and trying to reorganize.\n\nIsraeli bombardments are ongoing in various points in Gaza, in spite of last Friday's call by U.S. President Joe Biden to seek a negotiated end to the eight-month war. The optimism generated by Biden's speech, in which a phased \"Israeli proposal\" was presented that would lead to a permanent ceasefire and which Hamas received \"positively,\" has since faded.\n\nSeventeen countries, led by Washington, issued an unusual joint appeal Thursday in support of the ceasefire agreement \"right now on the table and as outlined by Biden.\" \"It is time for the war to end,\" the statement said. \"At this decisive moment, we call on the leaders of Israel as well as Hamas to make whatever final compromises are necessary to close this deal and bring relief to the families of our hostages, as well as those on both sides of this terrible conflict, including the civilian populations.\" Among the signatories are three Latin American countries (Argentina, Brazil and Colombia), 11 European nations (Austria, Bulgaria, Denmark, France, Germany, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Serbia, Spain, and the United Kingdom), in addition to the U.S., Canada and Thailand.\n\nHamas has asked the governments mediating the ceasefire talks -- Egypt, Qatar, and the United States -- for clarification because the proposal put forward by Biden differs from the one actually presented by Benjamin Netanyahu's government. \"After examining the content of the Israeli document, it is clear that it does not propose the correct basis for the required agreement, since it does not guarantee a definitive ceasefire, but a temporary one, and does not closely link the three stipulated stages,\" Hamas said in a statement Wednesday.\n\nThe Islamist movement accepts the proposal to return all the hostages still held in Gaza (124, about a third of who are deceased) in phases, as long as it has assurances that the final stage of deal is met: the end of the war. In fact, it has asked Washington, Israel's main ally, for guarantees that Netanyahu would not simply honor the first phase of the deal and then resume bombing in the Strip.\n\nThis first phase consists of a truce of at least six weeks during which Hamas would hand over about 30 of the living hostages, consisting of women, the elderly, and the sick and wounded, and some of those that have died while in captivity. In return, Israel would release hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, allow displaced persons in southern Gaza to return to the north, (which is currently prevented by checkpoints), withdraw its troops from populated areas, and allow 600 trucks of humanitarian aid to enter the Strip each day.\n\nNetanyahu, whose ultranationalist partners are threatening to leave the coalition government if he seals the deal, refuses a permanent ceasefire without first \"destroying\" Hamas' ability to fight and to govern in Gaza. Biden insisted in his speech that the Israeli army had destroyed Hamas in the course of eight months of bombardments - which have killed some 36,000 Palestinians and left over half of the buildings in the Strip damaged or destroyed - and that the Islamist militias are now incapable of launching another attack like that of October 7, which triggered the Israeli offensive in the Strip.\n\nWhile keeping up his warmongering rhetoric in Gaza, Netanyahu has in recent days placed the focus on Lebanon. On Wednesday, he visited the border area, where the Israeli army and the Hezbollah militia maintain a growing -- but still measured -- daily crossfire that has forced the evacuation of some 100,000 Lebanese and 60,000 Israelis from their homes. \"Whoever thinks he can hurt us and we will respond by sitting on our hands is making a big mistake. We are prepared for very intense action in the north. One way or another, we will restore security to the north,\" the Israeli prime mininster said.", "source": {"uri": "english.elpais.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "EL PA\u00cdS"}, "authors":

It said the attack took out 20 to 30 terrorists, some of whom were suspected of taking part in the Oct. 7 attack.\n\nThe Israeli military, however, has not commented on claims of civilian casualties. It said it had taken \"many steps\" to minimize harm to \"uninvolved people.\"\n\nHospital records verified by Associated Press reporters showed that at least 14 children and nine women were included in the bodies brought in from the school.\n\nPhilippe Lazzarini, the commissioner-general of UNRWA, said that about 6,000 people were sheltering in the school when it was hit without prior warning from the IDF.\n\n\"Attacking, targeting or using UN buildings for military purposes are a blatant disregard of International Humanitarian law,\" Lazzarini wrote on X. \"Targeting UN premises or using them for military purposes cannot become the new norm.\"\n\nThe UNRWA had previously come under fire after 12 staffers were fired over allegations that they assisted Hamas terrorists during the Oct. 7 massacre that left more than 1,200 people dead and some 250 others kidnapped in Israel.", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New York Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

(Doaa Rouqa / Reuters)\n\nIsrael's military struck a school in Gaza on June 6, which it said was a stronghold of the Hamas terrorist group with up to 30 Hamas fighters inside. The attack on the compound targeted terrorists involved in the Oct. 7 attack, according to the IDF.\n\nThe director of the Hamas-run media office in Gaza rejected Israel's claims that the U.N. school in Nuseirat, in central Gaza, had hidden a Hamas command post. He alleged the strike killed more than two dozen civilians seeking shelter.\n\nAccording to Israel's military, all necessary steps had been taken to reduce the risk of civilian casualties prior to the strike.\n\n\"We're very confident in the intelligence,\" military spokesperson Lt Col. Peter Lerner said, accusing Hamas and Islamic Jihad fighters of deliberately using U.N. facilities as operational bases.\n\n\"I'm not aware of any civilian casualties and I'd be very, very cautious of accepting anything that Hamas puts out,\" he added.\n\nThe strike followed an announcement by Israel that it would initiate a new military campaign in central Gaza aimed at targeting Hamas terrorists relying on hit-and-run insurgency tactics.\n\nIsrael has stood firm in saying that fighting will continue during ceasefire talks.\n\nLast week's truce proposal by President Joe Biden has hit a dead end after Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh responded by saying that any ceasefire plan would have to involve a complete and permanent end to the Gaza war, including withdrawal of all Israeli troops.\n\nCeasefire talks have been unsuccessful since a brief week-long truce in November. The terrorist group has repeatedly demanded an end to the fighting and withdrawal from Gaza, while Israel has offered only temporary pauses and vowed to continue fighting until the terrorist group is destroyed.\n\nMeanwhile, Washington has been pushing for a resolution on the ceasefire talks. On June 5, CIA director William Burns met with senior officials from mediators Qatar and Egypt in Doha for discussions on the proposal.\n\nHowever, despite repeated claims by President Biden that a ceasefire was near, no agreement has yet come to fruition.\n\nThe Gaza conflict began with Hamas's brutal Oct. 7 attack that killed more than 1,200 people and saw the terrorist group take nearly 240 hostages. The war has resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of Gazans, according to the Hamas-controlled Gaza health ministry. They don't differentiate between combatants and civilians.\n\nSince the week-long truce last November, around half of the hostages have been freed. It is currently still unclear how many of the remaining hostages are still alive.\n\nPrior to the conflict, Hamas had around 20,000-25,000 terrorist fighters, according to U.S. estimates.

But Israel says it won't end the war without destroying Hamas, while the militant group is demanding a lasting cease-fire and the full withdrawal of Israeli forces.\n\nFar-right members of Netanyahu's government have threatened to bring down the coalition if he signs onto a cease-fire deal.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nISRAEL'S MILITARY SAYS IT TRADED FIRE WITH PALESTINIAN MILITANTS JUST YARDS FROM GAZA BORDER\n\nJERUSALEM -- The Israeli military says it traded fire with Palestinian militants in southern Gaza some 300 meters (yards) from the Israeli border.\n\nThe fighters appeared to have infiltrated a heavily guarded buffer zone.\n\nLt. Col. Peter Lerner, an Israeli military spokesman, said the gunbattle erupted before dawn on Thursday. He said two militants were killed from the air and a third in a tank strike.\n\nIsraeli media later reported that an Israeli soldier was killed in the shootout. The military confirmed that a soldier was killed during a confrontation with militants in southern Gaza early Thursday but declined to say whether it was linked to the infiltration attempt.\n\nSatellite photos earlier this year showed extensive demolition inside Gaza along the border.

He said Israel could still operate in Gaza but needed to avoid causing undue harm to Palestinian civilians and contravening Israel's obligations under the Genocide Convention.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nIsraeli President Isaac Herzog, whose position is largely ceremonial, thanked Barak on Thursday for serving on the court in a statement posted to X, adding: \"We will continue to stand firm against the evil, the hypocrisy and the false accusations leveled against the State of Israel and the IDF,\" using an acronym for Israel's military.\n\nRECENT DRONE STRIKE IN NORTHERN ISRAEL KILLED A RESERVE SOLDIER, MILITARY SAYS\n\nJERUSALEM -- Israel's military said Thursday that a drone strike on a village in northern Israel the day before killed an Israeli reserve soldier.\n\nThe Lebanese militant group Hezbollah said it launched an attack toward a gathering of military officials in response to an earlier Israeli cross-border attack.\n\nIsrael's military said two explosive drones were fired toward Hurfeish, a northern village in Israel.\n\nAir raid sirens did not go off ahead of the strike, and Israeli authorities said that the strike wounded over 10 people in addition to the one soldier killed. The military identified the fallen soldier as Staff Sgt. (res.) Refael Kauders, 39.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nWith Kaunders' death, 16 soldiers have been killed in Israel's north since October, along with 10 civilians.\n\nMore 400 people have been killed in Lebanon, including more than 70 civilians and noncombatants.\n\nIsrael and Hezbollah have been exchanging fire daily since a day after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack, which set off the war in Gaza. The deadly fighting has displaced tens of thousands of people on both sides of the Israel-Lebanon border and sparked fears of a wider regional war.\n\nISRAELI MILITARY SAYS IT'S NOT AWARE OF ANY CIVILIAN CASUALTIES IN ITS STRIKE ON A SCHOOL\n\nJERUSALEM -- Israel's military said Thursday it was not aware of any civilian casualties in a strike that killed at least 33 Palestinians, including 23 women and children, according to local officials and an AP reporter at the hospital that received the bodies.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe strike occurred early Thursday on a United Nations school sheltering displaced Palestinians in central Gaza. Israeli military spokesperson Lt. Col. Peter Lerner said intelligence indicated that militants had used the school compound to orchestrate some of the attacks on Oct. 7 and that at least 20 militants there were using it currently as a \"staging realm\" to launch attacks on Israeli soldiers.\n\n\"I'm not aware of civilians being caught up in this. We will be looking at the data and intelligence that comes out in the next few hours or day,\" Lerner told journalists.\n\nHe declined to say whether the military would investigate the strike, as it did in May when an Israeli strike nearby a tent camp sheltering displaced people killed dozens in Rafah, Gaza's southernmost city.\n\nSPAIN APPLIES TO JOIN SOUTH AFRICA'S CASE ACCUSING ISRAEL OF GENOCIDE\n\nMADRID -- Spain will ask a United Nations court for permission to join South Africa's case accusing Israel of genocide in Gaza, its foreign minister announced Thursday.\n\nSpain is the first European country to take the step after South Africa filed its case with the International Court of Justice in late 2023. It alleged that Israel was breaching the genocide convention in its military assault that has laid waste to large swaths of Gaza.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nMexico, Colombia, Nicaragua, Libya and the Palestinians have already requested to join the case currently being heard at the court in The Hague, Netherlands.\n\nThe court has ordered Israel to immediately halt its military offensive in the southern Gaza city of Rafah but stopped short of ordering a cease-fire for the enclave. Israel has not complied.\n\nSpain's request to join the case is the latest move by the government of Socialist Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez to support peacemaking efforts in Gaza.\n\nIsrael denies it is committing genocide in its military operation to crush Hamas triggered by its deadly Oct. 7 attacks in southern Israel.\n\nHamas killed 1,200 people and took 250 more hostage in the surprise attacks. Israel's air and land attacks have killed 36,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which doesn't distinguish between combatants and civilians.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nISRAELI STRIKE KILLS DOZENS AT A SCHOOL-TURNED-SHELTER IN GAZA\n\nDEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip -- An Israeli strike early Thursday on a school-turned-shelter in central Gaza that the military claimed was being used as a Hamas compound killed at least 30 people, including five children, according to local health officials.\n\nThe strike came after the military said it was launching new air and ground operations in central Gaza in an apparent widening of its nearly eight-month offensive, launched after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack. An international medical charity had reported soaring casualties even before Thursday's strike.\n\nThe Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir al-Balah received at least 30 bodies from the strike on the school run by the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees -- known by the acronym UNRWA -- and another six from a separate strike on a home, according to hospital records and an Associated Press reporter at the hospital. Hamas-run TV had earlier reported a higher toll.\n\nThe Israeli military claimed, without immediately offering evidence, that Hamas and the Islamic Jihad used the school as cover for their operations and that risk reduction steps were taken before the strike.\n\nThe war began with Hamas' Oct. 7 attack inside Israel that killed at least 1,200 people with 250 others taken hostage. The Israeli military campaign in the Gaza Strip has killed at least 36,000 Palestinians, with hundreds of others killed in operations in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nYEMEN'S HOUTHI REBELS UNVEIL A NEW SOLID-FUEL MISSILE\n\nDUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Yemen's Houthi rebels have unveiled a new, solid-fuel missile in their arsenal that resembles aspects of one earlier displayed by Iran that Tehran described as flying at hypersonic speeds.\n\nThe rebels fired their new \"Palestine\" missile, complete with a warhead painted like a Palestinian keffiyeh checkered scarf, at the southern Gulf of Aqaba port of Eilat in Israel on Monday. The attack set off air raid sirens but caused no reported damage or injuries.\n\nFootage released by the Houthis late Wednesday showed the Palestine being raised on what appeared to be a mobile launcher and rising quickly into the air with plumes of white smoke coming from its engine. White smoke is common with solid-fuel missiles.\n\nSolid-fuel missiles can be set up and fired faster than those containing liquid fuel. That's a key concern for the Houthis as their missile launch sites have been repeatedly targeted by U.S. and allied forces in recent months over the rebels' attacks on shipping through the Red Sea corridor. One such strike hit the Houthis even before they were able to launch their missile.", "source": {"uri": "thestar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Star"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Videos showed the destruction and a number of bodies.\n\nIsrael's military said it had \"conducted a precise strike on a Hamas compound\" in the school and killed many of the 20 to 30 fighters it believed were inside.\n\nGaza's Hamas-run Government Media Office denied the claim and accused Israel of carrying out a \"horrific massacre\".\n\nThe head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa), which runs the school, described the incident as \"horrific\" and said the claim that armed groups might have been inside a shelter was \"shocking\" but could not be confirmed.\n\nDead and wounded people were rushed to the al-Aqsa Martyrs' Hospital, in the nearby town of Deir al-Balah, which has been overwhelmed since the Israeli military began a new ground operation against Hamas in central Gaza this week.\n\nThe circumstances of the strike in Nuseirat are still unclear and the BBC is working to verify the information coming in.\n\nLocal journalists and residents said it took place in the early hours of Thursday at al-Sardi school, which is in a south-eastern area of the densely-populated, decades-old camp, where Unrwa provides services.\n\nThe school was full of hundreds of displaced people who had fled the fighting elsewhere in Gaza, according to the residents. Many schools and other UN facilities have been used as shelters by the 1.7 million people who have fled their homes during the war, which has lasted almost eight months.\n\n\"I was asleep when the incident occurred. Suddenly, we heard a loud explosion and shattered glass and debris from the building fell on us,\" Udai Abu Elias, a man who was living at the school, told BBC Arabic's Gaza Today programme.\n\n\"Smoke filled the air, and I couldn't see anything. I didn't expect to make it out alive. I heard someone calling for survivors to come out from under the rubble. I struggled to see as I stumbled over the bodies of the martyrs.\"\n\nHe added: \"The situation has become extremely difficult, especially for children and the elderly. Everyone is a target. The blood of the martyrs has not yet dried; it stains the stairs, walls, and bedding.\"\n\nAnother man, Jabr, said he \"woke up to the sight of bodies and [human] remains everywhere\", while a third who asked not to be named said the casualties included \"elderly people, young individuals, and children\".\n\nVideos shared on social media showed the destruction of several classrooms at the school, as well as bodies wrapped in white shrouds and blankets.\n\n\"Enough war! We have been displaced dozens of times. They killed our children while they were sleeping,\" a woman injured in the attack screamed in one video.\n\nResidents initially said that more than 20 people were killed in the attack.\n\nLater, an official at al-Aqsa hospital told a freelance journalist working for the BBC that it had received 40 bodies from the school.\n\nGaza's Hamas-run health ministry said in a statement that 40 people were killed, including 14 children and nine women, and 74 others were injured. The same death toll was given by the director of the Hamas-run Government Media Office, Ismail al-Thawabta.\n\nThe head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa), Philippe Lazzarini, said in a statement on X, formerly Twitter, that at least 35 people were killed and many more injured. The agency's director of communications, Juliette Touma, told the BBC that \"the figures are coming from our own Unrwa colleagues on the ground\".\n\nIn a statement, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said fighter jets had conducted a \"precise strike on a Hamas compound embedded inside an Unrwa school in the area of Nuseirat\". An annotated aerial photograph highlighted classrooms on two upper floors of the building, which the IDF said were the \"locations of the terrorists\".\n\nThe IDF said members of Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad who took part in the 7 October attack on southern Israel, when around 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage, had been operating in the building.\n\n\"Before the strike, a number of steps were taken to reduce the risk of harming uninvolved civilians during the strike, including conducting aerial surveillance, and additional intelligence information,\" it added.\n\nLater, IDF spokesman Lt Col Peter Lerner told reporters that between 20 and 30 fighters had been using the school to plan and carry out attacks, and that many of them were killed in the strike. \"I'm not aware of any civilian casualties and I'd be very, very cautious of accepting anything that Hamas puts out,\" he added.\n\nHe also said the IDF had called off the attack twice in order to limit civilian casualties and accused Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad of deliberately using UN facilities as operational bases.\n\nMr Thawabta rejected the IDF's claims, saying: \"The occupation uses lying to the public opinion through false fabricated stories to justify the brutal crime it conducted against dozens of displaced people.\"\n\nPhilippe Lazzarini said the school was hit \"without prior warning\" to his agency or the 6,000 displaced people who were sheltering there.\n\n\"Claims that armed groups may have been inside the shelter are shocking. We are however unable to verify these claims,\" he added.\n\n\"Attacking, targeting or using UN buildings for military purposes are a blatant disregard of International Humanitarian law. UN staff, premises and operations must be protected at all times.\"\n\nMr Lazzarini complained that more than 180 Unrwa buildings had been hit since the war began despite their co-ordinates being shared with parties to the conflict, and that more than 450 displaced people had been killed as a result.\n\n\"This must stop and all those responsible must be held accountable,\" he said.\n\nAt least 36,650 people have been killed in Gaza since Israel launched a military campaign in response to the 7 October attack, according to the territory's health ministry, whose figures do not differentiate between civilians and combatants.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Israeli military said it had taken \"operational control\" over eastern areas of Bureij refugee camp - which is just west of Nuseirat - and eastern Deir al-Balah.\n\nResidents reported intense bombardment and the charity M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF) said at least 70 bodies - the majority women and children - had been brought to al-Aqsa hospital over the previous 24 hours.", "source": {"uri": "banglamirrornews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Weekly Bangla Mirror |"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mr_admin@banglamirrornews.com",

Hamas seeks a permanent end to the war. Israel says it must destroy the Islamist group first.\n\nThe United States issued a joint statement with other countries on Thursday calling on Israel and Hamas to make whatever compromises were necessary to finalise a deal as the two sides gave contradictory accounts of the school attack.\n\nIsmail Al-Thawabta, the director of the Hamas-run government media office, rejected Israel's assertion that the U.N. school in Nuseirat, in central Gaza, had hidden a Hamas command post.\n\n\"The occupation uses ... false fabricated stories to justify the brutal crime it conducted against dozens of displaced people,\" Thawabta told Reuters.\n\nIsrael's military said its fighter jets had carried out a \"precise strike\" and circulated satellite photos highlighting two parts of a building where it said the fighters were based.\n\n\"We're very confident in the intelligence,\" military spokesperson Lt Col. Peter Lerner told a briefing with reporters, accusing Hamas and Islamic Jihad fighters of deliberately using U.N. facilities as operational bases.\n\nHe said 20-30 fighters were located in the compound, and many of them had been killed, but had no precise details as intelligence assessments were being carried out. \"I'm not aware of any civilian casualties and I'd be very, very cautious of accepting anything that Hamas puts out,\" he said.\n\nThe school, run by the U.N. Palestinian refugee agency (UNRWA), may have been hit several times, said the agency's communications director, Juliette Touma.\n\nShe said she could not confirm the death toll at this stage. Media in Hamas-run Gaza had earlier put the toll at 35-40. Thawabta and a medical source said 40 had been killed, including 14 children and nine women.\n\nCEASEFIRE EFFORTS\n\nIsrael announced a new military campaign in central Gaza on Wednesday as it battles fighters relying on hit-and-run insurgency tactics. It says there will be no halt to fighting during ceasefire talks, which have intensified since U.S. President Joe Biden outlined a proposal on Friday.\n\nSince a week-long truce in November, all attempts to arrange a ceasefire have failed, with each side blaming the other.\n\n\"At this decisive moment, we call on the leaders of Israel as well as Hamas to make whatever final compromises are necessary to close this deal,\" said the statement issued by the White House jointly with Argentina, Austria, Brazil, Britain, Canada and others.\n\nCIA director William Burns met senior officials from mediators Qatar and Egypt on Wednesday in Doha to discuss the ceasefire proposal. Two Egyptian security sources said talks continued on Thursday but had shown no sign of breakthrough.\n\nBiden has repeatedly declared that ceasefires were close over the past several months, only for no truce to materialise.\n\nLast week's high-profile announcement coincides with intense domestic political pressure on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to chart a path to end the eight-month-old war and negotiate the release of Israeli hostages held by Hamas.\n\nHamas, which rules Gaza, precipitated the war by attacking Israeli territory on Oct. 7, killing around 1,200 people and capturing more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies. Around half of the hostages were freed in the November truce.\n\nIsrael's military assault on Gaza has killed more than 36,000 people, according to health officials in the territory, who say thousands more dead are feared buried under the rubble.\n\nAbout half of Hamas's forces have been wiped out in eight months of fighting and the group is relying on insurgent tactics to frustrate Israel's attempts to take control of Gaza, U.S. and Israeli officials told Reuters.\n\nHamas has been reduced to 9,000 to 12,000 fighters, according to three senior U.S. officials familiar with battlefield developments, down from American estimates of 20,000-25,000 before the conflict. Israel says it has lost almost 300 troops in the Gaza campaign.\n\nHamas does not disclose fatalities among its fighters and some officials have described Israel's figures for the number of Hamas fighters killed as exaggerated.\n\nMeanwhile, a conflict between Israel and the Lebanon-based Hezbollah is threatening to escalate, with the U.S. State Department warning against a full-blown war.\n\nAlthough Biden described the ceasefire proposal as an Israeli offer, Israel's government has been lukewarm in public. A top Netanyahu aide confirmed on Sunday that Israel had made the proposal even though it was \"not a good deal\".\n\nFar-right members of Netanyahu's government have pledged to quit if he agrees to a peace deal that leaves Hamas in place, a move that could force a new election and end the political career of Israel's longest-serving leader.\n\nCentrist opponents who joined Netanyahu's war cabinet in a show of unity at the outset of the conflict have also threatened to quit, saying his government has no plan.\n\n(Reporting by Nidal al-Mughrabi and James Mackenzie; Additional reporting by Clauda Tanios and Mrinmay Dey and Reuters bureaux; Writing by Michael Perry and Philippa Fletcher; Editing by Gerry Doyle and Timothy Heritage)", "source": {"uri": "swissinfo.ch", "dataType": "news", "title": "SWI swissinfo.ch"}, "authors": [{"uri": "swi_swissinfo_ch@swissinfo.ch", "name": "Swi Swissinfo.Ch", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_City", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostage", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hostage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internally_displaced_person", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internally displaced person"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Islamism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airstrike", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Airstrike"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cairo", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cairo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cairo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jerusalem"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jerusalem"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_Islamic_Jihad", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian Islamic Jihad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_J._Burns_(diplomat)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "William J.

Some rights groups estimate the death toll to be much higher when accounting for those presumed dead.\n\n** The death toll in the West Bank and Jerusalem is not updated regularly. According to the PA's Ministry of Health on June 5, this is the latest figure.\n\n*** These figures are released by the Israeli military, showing the soldiers whose names \"were allowed to be published.\" The number of Israeli soldiers wounded according to declarations by the head of the Israeli army's wounded association to Israel's channel 12 exceeds 20,000 including at least 8000 permanently handicapped as of June 1st.\n\nAt least 40 Palestinians were killed early on Thursday in an Israeli airstrike of an UNRWA school sheltering displaced families in the Nuseirat refugee camp in the central Gaza Strip.\n\nThe Gaza-based government media office said in a statement that 14 of the victims were children and nine were women. Around 74 more were wounded, including 23 children and 18 women, the office added.\n\nThe UNRWA Commissioner General Philippe Lazzarini said through his account on X that Israel bombed an UNRWA school that housed thousands of displaced Palestinians during the night, without any warning to the displaced or to the UNRWA.\n\nThe Israeli army admitted the bombing in a statement, claiming that it had conducted a \"precise strike\" on dozens of Palestinian militants who were gathered in a building separate from the location of the civilians. The Gaza government media office denied the Israeli army's claims.\n\nAccording to Gaza's authorities, Thursday's bombing is the 149th Israeli attack on a displacement shelter since the beginning of the current Israeli assault on Gaza last October. In late May, Israel killed 45 Palestinians, mostly civilians, including many children in a strike on a displaced tent encampment east of Rafah.\n\nA White House statement signed by 17 world leaders including U.S. Preident Joe Biden called upon Israel and Hamas to accept the latest U.S. proposal for a ceasefire and prisoners' exchange deal on Wednesday.\n\n\"At this decisive moment, we call on the leaders of Israel as well as Hamas to make whatever final compromises are necessary to close this deal and bring relief to the families of our hostages, as well as those on both sides of this terrible conflict, including the civilian populations,\" the statement read.\n\nThe statement was signed by leaders of France, Germany, the UK, Poland, Bulgaria, Canada, Thailand, Austria, Portugal, Denmark, Romania, and Serbia, among others.\n\nEarlier this week, U.S. President Biden announced a framework for a proposed deal that included three phases: a prisoners' exchange and a ceasefire for six months, followed by a negotiation period during which the ceasefire would continue alongside negotiations and an Israeli withdrawal from populated areas, and ending the beginning of reconstruction works and the total withdrawal of Israeli forces.\n\nAlthough the White House said that the proposal was designed by Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu said that the announced proposal wasn't the exact version that his government designed. Both Israel and Hamas expressed readiness to accept the proposal, but haven't yet formally responded.\n\nMeanwhile, fighting between Israeli forces and Palestinian resistance fighters has continued across the Strip. On Thursday, Palestinian fighters infiltrated the Karam Abu Salem crossing area east of Rafah and clashed with Israeli soldiers. The Israeli army admitted one soldier killed and another wounded while announcing that it killed three Palestinian fighters. Palestinian factions have announced targeting several Israeli tanks and armored vehicles in Rafah and Deir al-Balah since Wednesday.\n\nIn the north, the Israeli army completed its withdrawal from Jabalia after a three-week invasion of the camp, which was accompanied by intense fighting with Palestinian resistance factions, resulting in casualties in Israeli ranks. Palestinians began to return to Jabalia after Israel's withdrawal, installing makeshift tents and fixing spaces for living in their destroyed homes.", "source": {"uri": "mondoweiss.net", "dataType":

Israel's offensive has killed at least 36,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and civilians in its figures.\n\nIsrael says it takes measures to avoid harming civilians and blames the deaths of Hamas because it positions fighters, tunnels and rocket launchers in residential areas. The military rarely comments on individual strikes, which often kill women and children.\n\nThe United States has thrown its weight behind a phased cease-fire and hostage release outlined by President Joe Biden last week. But Israel says it won't end the war without destroying Hamas, while the militant group is demanding a lasting cease-fire and the full withdrawal of Israeli forces.\n\nThe military said Wednesday that forces were operating \"both above and below ground\" in eastern parts of Deir al-Balah and the Bureij refugee camp in central Gaza. It said the operation began with airstrikes on militant infrastructure, after which troops began a \"targeted daylight operation\" in both areas.\n\nDoctors Without Borders said at least 70 bodies and 300 wounded people, mostly women and children, were brought to a hospital in central Gaza on Tuesday and Wednesday after a wave of Israeli strikes.\n\nThe international charity said Wednesday in a post on X that Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital is struggling to treat \"a huge influx of patients, many of them arriving with severe burns, shrapnel wounds, fractures, and other traumatic injuries.\"\n\nGaza's health system has nearly collapsed through almost eight months of war. The hospital, which was treating some 700 wounded and sick people before the latest strikes, said Wednesday that one of its two electrical generators had stopped working, threatening its ability to keep operating ventilators and incubators for premature babies.\n\nIsrael has routinely launched airstrikes in all parts of Gaza since the start of the war and has carried out massive ground operations in the territory's two largest cities, Gaza City and Khan Younis, that left much of them in ruins.\n\nThe military waged an offensive earlier this year for several weeks in Bureij and several other nearby refugee camps in central Gaza.\n\nTroops pulled out of the Jabaliya camp in northern Gaza last Friday after weeks of fighting caused widespread destruction. First responders have recovered the bodies of 360 people, mostly women and children, killed during the battles.\n\nIsrael sent troops into Rafah in May in what it said was a limited incursion, but those forces are now operating in central parts of Gaza's southernmost city.

The Israeli armed forces stated that the airstrike, directed by IDF intelligence and the Israel Security Agency, targeted terrorists involved in the October 7 attack in southern Israel.\n\nThe IDF asserted that \"Hamas and Islamic Jihad terrorists who belonged to the Nukhba Forces were operating in the compound.\" They alleged that these terrorists were using the UNRWA school as a shelter and were planning imminent attacks against IDF troops.\n\nSeveral precautions were taken to minimize harm to uninvolved civilians, including aerial surveillance and additional intelligence gathering prior to the strike.\n\nHamas condemned the attack, describing it as a \"massacre\" and a premeditated crime against civilians. Gaza's government provided further details, stating that among the 40 killed were 14 children and 9 women. Additionally, 74 people were wounded, including 23 children and 18 women.\n\nSince October 7, more than 36,654 people have been killed and 83,309 wounded in Israeli military operations in Gaza, according to the enclave's Health Ministry. The ministry reported that in the past 24 hours alone, 68 Palestinians were killed and 235 wounded.\n\nThe Health Ministry also highlighted the dire medical situation, noting that 25,000 sick and wounded Palestinians need to leave Gaza for treatment. However, since May 12, when Israel closed the Rafah border crossing with Egypt, no one has been able to leave for medical treatment. Only 4,895 people managed to leave when the crossing was briefly open.\n\n\"This exposes the lives of thousands to avoidable complications and death,\" the ministry stated, emphasizing that many cases could be treated if allowed to access specialized centers outside Gaza.", "source": {"uri": "newsx.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NewsX"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNRWA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "UNRWA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_Air_Force", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israeli Air Force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Jazeera", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Al Jazeera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near_East", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Near East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airstrike", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Airstrike"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_Islamic_Jihad", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian Islamic Jihad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Military intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shin_Bet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shin Bet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massacre", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Massacre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Surveillance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafah_Border_Crossing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rafah Border Crossing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enclave_and_exclave", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Enclave and exclave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Intelligence", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Intelligence", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://www.newsx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/RAhul-2.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9626324", "eventUri": "eng-9626324", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 630, "textEnd": 639, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-12", "textStart": 1797, "textEnd": 1803}], "sentiment": -0.4588235294117647, "wgt": 145, "relevance": 1}

Peter Lerner told a briefing with reporters, accusing Hamas and Islamic Jihad fighters of deliberately using U.N. facilities as operational bases.\n\nHe said 20-30 fighters were located in the compound, and many of them had been killed, but had no precise details as intelligence assessments were being carried out. \"I'm not aware of any civilian casualties and I'd be very, very cautious of accepting anything that Hamas puts out,\" he said.\n\nThe school, run by the U.N. Palestinian refugee agency (UNRWA), may have been hit several times, said the agency's communications director, Juliette Touma.\n\nShe said she could not confirm the death toll at this stage. Media in Hamas-run Gaza had earlier put the toll at 35-40. Thawabta and a medical source said 40 had been killed, including 14 children and nine women.\n\nIsrael announced a new military campaign in central Gaza on Wednesday as it battles fighters relying on hit-and-run insurgency tactics. It says there will be no halt to fighting during ceasefire talks, which have intensified since U.S. President Joe Biden outlined a proposal on Friday.\n\nSince a week-long truce in November, all attempts to arrange a ceasefire have failed, with each side blaming the other.\n\n\"At this decisive moment, we call on the leaders of Israel as well as Hamas to make whatever final compromises are necessary to close this deal,\" said the statement issued by the White House jointly with Argentina, Austria, Brazil, Britain, Canada and others.\n\nCIA director William Burns met senior officials from mediators Qatar and Egypt on Wednesday in Doha to discuss the ceasefire proposal. Two Egyptian security sources said talks continued on Thursday but had shown no sign of breakthrough.\n\nBiden has repeatedly declared that ceasefires were close over the past several months, only for no truce to materialise.\n\nLast week's high-profile announcement coincides with intense domestic political pressure on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to chart a path to end the eight-month-old war and negotiate the release of Israeli hostages held by Hamas.\n\nHamas, which rules Gaza, precipitated the war by attacking Israeli territory on Oct. 7, killing around 1,200 people and capturing more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies. Around half of the hostages were freed in the November truce.\n\nIsrael's military assault on Gaza has killed more than 36,000 people, according to health officials in the territory, who say thousands more dead are feared buried under the rubble.\n\nAbout half of Hamas's forces have been wiped out in eight months of fighting and the group is relying on insurgent tactics to frustrate Israel's attempts to take control of Gaza, U.S. and Israeli officials told Reuters.\n\nHamas has been reduced to 9,000 to 12,000 fighters, according to three senior U.S. officials familiar with battlefield developments, down from American estimates of 20,000-25,000 before the conflict. Israel says it has lost almost 300 troops in the Gaza campaign.\n\nHamas does not disclose fatalities among its fighters and some officials have described Israel's figures for the number of Hamas fighters killed as exaggerated.\n\nMeanwhile, a conflict between Israel and the Lebanon-based Hezbollah is threatening to escalate, with the U.S. State Department warning against a full-blown war.\n\nAlthough Biden described the ceasefire proposal as an Israeli offer, Israel's government has been lukewarm in public. A top Netanyahu aide confirmed on Sunday that Israel had made the proposal even though it was \"not a good deal\".\n\nFar-right members of Netanyahu's government have pledged to quit if he agrees to a peace deal that leaves Hamas in place, a move that could force a new election and end the political career of Israel's longest-serving leader.\n\nCentrist opponents who joined Netanyahu's war cabinet in a show of unity at the outset of the conflict have also threatened to quit, saying his government has no plan.\n\n(Reporting by Nidal al-Mughrabi and James Mackenzie; Additional reporting by Clauda Tanios and Mrinmay Dey and Reuters bureaux; Writing by Michael Perry and Philippa Fletcher; Editing by Gerry Doyle and Timothy Heritage)", "source": {"uri": "theprint.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "ThePrint"}, "authors": [{"uri": "reuters@theprint.in", "name": "Reuters", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_City", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_Islamic_Jihad", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian Islamic Jihad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internally_displaced_person", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internally displaced person"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hostage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_J._Burns_(diplomat)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "William J.

And on Wednesday, Defence Minister Yoav Gallant declared that \"all negotiations with Hamas will be conducted under fire\".\n\nIsrael launched a military campaign in Gaza to destroy Hamas in response to the group's cross-border attack on southern Israel on 7 October, during which around 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.\n\nAt least 36,580 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.\n\nBureij is one of the smallest of Gaza's eight historic refugee camps. It covers an area of 0.5 sq km (0.2 sq miles) and had 46,000 residents registered with the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa) before the war.\n\nThe camp is just to the south of the Wadi Gaza riverbed and the IDF's \"Central Gaza Strip Corridor\" - a section of land controlled by Israeli forces which runs east to west from the border with Israel to the Mediterranean Sea, dividing Gaza in two.\n\nThe Nuseirat and Maghazi refugee camps are also located near Bureij, while the town of Deir al-Balah is about 5km (3 miles) to the south-west.\n\nThe four areas are currently crowded with people displaced by fighting elsewhere, including many of the more than a million who have fled the southern city of Rafah since the start of an Israeli ground operation there a month ago.\n\nEarlier this year, IDF troops carried out a ground operation against Hamas fighters in the camps of central Gaza that lasted several weeks.\n\nOn Wednesday, the IDF said the new \"targeted\" operation in Bureij and eastern Deir al-Balah was aimed at dismantling \"terrorist infrastructure located several kilometres away from the border with Israel above and below ground\".\n\n\"The activity started with a series of aerial strikes on terror targets, including military compounds, weapons storage facilities, and underground infrastructure,\" its statement added. \"During the strikes, several Hamas terrorists were eliminated.\"\n\nLater, the IDF put out a new statement announcing that troops had \"gained operational control\" of eastern Bureij and eastern Deir al-Balah. It added that they had \"eliminated terrorists\" in the areas, destroyed rocket and mortar launchers, and located several tunnel shafts.\n\nA man from Bureij told BBC Arabic's Gaza Today programme that his family fled the camp as the Israeli bombardment intensified on Tuesday.\n\n\"We were stunned that the army was conducting a ground operation again in Bureij,\" he said. \"We were struck by shells falling on us from all sides, landing on citizens' homes, on the streets... which led to the killing of a number of citizens.\"\n\n\"The situation in general is extremely difficult,\" he added. \"We left our homes in order to preserve our lives and the lives of our children.\"\n\nA young woman said: \"Fragments fell into our home and into some of the residential apartments in our building... We survived because we all were on the lower floors.\"\n\n\"We were in a residential building full of approximately 40 people, some of whom were residents of the building itself and others were people who were displaced from the north and the south, in Rafah... Now where should we head to from Bureij?\"\n\nOn Wednesday morning, Palestinian news agency Wafa cited medics and rescue workers as saying at least 11 people were killed in Israeli air strikes on several homes in Maghazi overnight.\n\nAnother two people were killed in a strike on a home near the entrance to Bureij, while two more were killed by artillery fire in the Abu al-Ajen area, south-east of Deir al-Balah, it said.\n\nLater, M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res said its medical team on the ground had described the situation at Deir al-Balah's al-Aqsa hospital - one of the only remaining functional health facilities in central Gaza - as \"apocalyptic\".\n\nThe charity said women and children made up the majority of the 70 dead people and 300 wounded, brought to hospital over the past 24 hours, and that many patients were suffering from severe burns, shrapnel wounds, fractures and other traumatic injuries.\n\n\"The odour of blood when I entered the emergency room [this morning] was just overwhelming. People are lying on the floor. People are lying outside... bodies being brought in white plastic bags. The families standing over them and praying,\" MSF medical referent Karin Huster said in an audio message.\n\n\"It's just an emotionally overwhelming situation. It's impossible for anyone to cope.\"\n\nAt the start of its operation in Rafah on 6 May, the IDF told civilians to evacuate to an \"expanded humanitarian area\" stretching from the coastal al-Mawasi area to Deir al-Balah, where it said they would find tents, field hospitals and supplies.\n\nBut Unrwa warned on Monday that space for displaced families in Deir al-Balah was \"running out, as people continue arriving hoping for safety where there is none\".\n\n\"Living conditions are not at all suitable for families and critical services, and supplies are limited,\" it said.\n\nThe IDF also said on Wednesday that troops were continuing \"targeted operations\" in Rafah. It added that they had \"located weapons and eliminated armed terrorists\", without providing further details.\n\nResidents told Reuters that Israeli tanks had mounted raids into the centre of Rafah and deeper into the west before retreating to eastern and southern areas.\n\nAs well as displacing civilians, the Rafah operation has resulted in the amount of humanitarian aid entering Gaza dropping by two-thirds, according to the UN.\n\nEgypt has closed the nearby Rafah border crossing since Israeli forces took control of the Gazan side almost a month ago and the UN has said it is too dangerous to reach the nearby Kerem Shalom crossing with Israel.\n\n\"In Gaza, delivering aid has become almost impossible,\" outgoing UN humanitarian chief Martin Griffiths told reporters on Tuesday. \"We need all border crossings open. We need safe and unimpeded access. We need to prioritize humanitarian aid.\"\n\nHe spoke after an independent group of experts warned in a report that it was \"possible, if not likely\" that famine was under way in northern Gaza. However, the US-funded Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET) said hostilities and access constraints had impeded the collection of data to prove that.\n\nA UN-backed assessment estimated in March that 1.1 million people across Gaza were facing catastrophic hunger and that famine was imminent in the north by May. Israel disputed the report, saying it contained factual and methodological flaws.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [{"uri": "david_gritten@yahoo.com",

The Zionist forces killed at least 40 people and wounded more than 70.\n\nOfficials from Gaza's government media office and the health ministry confirmed the death toll. It included 14 children, murdered in pre-dawn strikes which hit al-Sardi school and homes in Nuseirat camp.\n\nIsmail al-Thawabta, a spokesman for Gaza's government media office, said \"huge numbers of dead and wounded\" were arriving at the Al-Aqsa Hospital in central Gaza. It had reached three times its clinical capacity.\n\n\"This horrible massacre committed by the Israeli occupation is clear evidence of genocide, ethnic cleansing against civilians, including women and children and displaced people,\" he told reporters.\n\nThe dead and wounded were overwhelming the hospital, \"which is filled with wounded patients three times beyond its clinical capacity,\" he added. \"This portends a real disaster that will lead to an even greater increase in the number of martyrs.\"\n\nIsrael's military openly confirmed the bombing, saying its fighter planes struck a \"Hamas compound embedded inside a UN school in the area of Nuseirat\". It claimed the bombing \"eliminated terrorists who were planning to carry out attacks\" against its forces.\n\nHamas rejected the Israeli statement. \"The occupation uses fabricated stories to justify the brutal crime it conducted against dozens of displaced people,\" Ismail al-Thawabta told the Reuters news agency.\n\nThe attack on al-Sardi came as Israeli forces stepped up their bombardment of Gaza, even as the US continued to press ahead with an effort to secure a ceasefire deal.\n\nAl Jazeera journalist Hani Mahmoud, reporting from Deir el-Balah in central Gaza, said Israeli forces had killed at least 102 people in 24 hours prior to the latest attack on Nuseirat. These included attacks on the Bureij and Maghazi refugee camps, also located in central Gaza.\n\nDoctors Without Borders, known by its French acronym MSF, described the situation in Gaza as \"apocalyptic\". The group said the Al-Aqsa Hospital had received 70 dead people and more than 300 injured since Tuesday and that the majority of the casualties were women and children.\n\n\"The odour of blood in the hospital's emergency room this morning was unbearable. There are people lying everywhere, on the floor, outside bodies were being brought in plastic bags. The situation is overwhelming,\" said Karin Huster, an MSF official.\n\nAnd there are multiple reports of warnings from several Western envoys about an imminent Israeli attack on Lebanon. \"Prepare for war,\" one is thought to have told the Lebanese authorities.\n\nFar right Israeli national security minister Itamar Ben-Gvir has called for a war against the Lebanese armed group Hezbollah and an invasion of Lebanon. In a video message he added that the Israeli military's job \"is to destroy Hezbollah\".\n\nHe went on, \"They're burning us here. All Hezbollah strongholds should be burned, they should be destroyed. War!\"\n\nIsraeli prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu also said Israel was ready for \"very strong action\" inside Lebanon. Netanyahu told soldiers in Kiryat Shmona, \"We are prepared for a very strong action in the north. One way or another we will restore security to the north.\"\n\nImperialism won't end the slaughter, still less bring freedom for the Palestinians. It's more important than ever to take to the streets.", "source": {"uri": "socialistworker.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Socialist Worker (Britain)"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Israel's military said that before the strike by Israeli fighter jets, the military took steps to reduce the risk of harm to civilians.\n\nIsmail Al-Thawabta, the director of the Hamas-run government media office, has rejected Israel's claims.\n\nThe occupation uses lying to the public opinion through false fabricated stories to justify the brutal crime it conducted against dozens of displaced people.\n\nThe attack comes as Israel announces a new military campaign in central Gaza, as it battles a group of fighters relying on hit-and-run insurgency tactics.\n\nMore on that in a moment, first here's a summary of the day's other main events.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "martin_belam@theguardian.com", "name": "Martin Belam", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drone_strikes_in_Pakistan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drone strikes in Pakistan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Meron", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mount Meron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_District_(Israel)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Northern District (Israel)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Northern District (Israel)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurfeish", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hurfeish"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hurfeish"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Military campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurgency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Insurgency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internally_displaced_person", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internally displaced person"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Military", "label": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Military", "wgt": 13}], "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/033e78ff5826f2a586618d2a7599480bd4278caa/0_273_4673_2805/master/4673.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctbGl2ZS5wbmc&s=8900bffd9cbc649005bb33b15f337553", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9626324", "eventUri": "eng-9626324", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 642, "textEnd": 651}], "sentiment": -0.6, "wgt": 140, "relevance": 1}

It covers an area of 0.5 sq km (0.2 sq miles) and had 46,000 residents registered with the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa) before the war.\n\nThe camp is just to the south of the Wadi Gaza riverbed and the IDF's \"Central Gaza Strip Corridor\" - a section of land controlled by Israeli forces which runs east to west from the border with Israel to the Mediterranean Sea, dividing Gaza in two.\n\nThe Nuseirat and Maghazi refugee camps are also located near Bureij, while the town of Deir al-Balah is about 5km (3 miles) to the south-west.\n\nThe four areas are currently crowded with people displaced by fighting elsewhere, including many of the more than a million who have fled the southern city of Rafah since the start of an Israeli ground operation there a month ago.\n\nEarlier this year, IDF troops carried out a ground operation against Hamas fighters in the camps of central Gaza that lasted several weeks.\n\nOn Wednesday, the IDF said the new \"targeted\" operation in Bureij and eastern Deir al-Balah was aimed at dismantling \"terrorist infrastructure located several kilometres away from the border with Israel above and below ground\".\n\n\"The activity started with a series of aerial strikes on terror targets, including military compounds, weapons storage facilities, and underground infrastructure,\" its statement added. \"During the strikes, several Hamas terrorists were eliminated.\"\n\nA man from Bureij told BBC Arabic's Gaza Today programme that his family fled the camp as the Israeli bombardment intensified on Tuesday.\n\n\"We were stunned that the army was conducting a ground operation again in Bureij,\" he said. \"We were struck by shells falling on us from all sides, landing on citizens' homes, on the streets... which led to the killing of a number of citizens.\"\n\n\"The situation in general is extremely difficult,\" he added. \"We left our homes in order to preserve our lives and the lives of our children.\"\n\nA young woman said: \"Fragments fell into our home and into some of the residential apartments in our building... We survived because we all were on the lower floors.\"\n\n\"We were in a residential building full of approximately 40 people, some of whom were residents of the building itself and others were people who were displaced from the north and the south, in Rafah... Now where should we head to from Bureij?\"\n\nOn Wednesday morning, Palestinian news agency Wafa cited medics and rescue workers as saying at least 11 people were killed in Israeli air strikes on several homes in Maghazi overnight.\n\nAnother two people were killed in a strike on a home near the entrance to Bureij, while two more were killed by artillery fire in the Abu al-Ajen area, south-east of Deir al-Balah, it said.\n\nLater, M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res said its medical team on the ground had described the situation at Deir al-Balah's al-Aqsa hospital - one of the only remaining functional health facilities in central Gaza - as \"apocalyptic\".\n\nThe charity said women and children made up the majority of the 70 dead people and 300 wounded, brought to hospital over the past 24 hours, and that many patients were suffering from severe burns, shrapnel wounds, fractures and other traumatic injuries.\n\n\"The odour of blood when I entered the emergency room [this morning] was just overwhelming. People are lying on the floor. People are lying outside... bodies being brought in white plastic bags. The families standing over them and praying,\" MSF medical referent Karin Huster said in an audio message.\n\n\"It's just an emotionally overwhelming situation. It's impossible for anyone to cope.\"\n\nAt the start of its operation in Rafah on 6 May, the IDF told civilians to evacuate to an \"expanded humanitarian area\" stretching from the coastal al-Mawasi area to Deir al-Balah, where it said they would find tents, field hospitals and supplies.\n\nBut Unrwa warned on Monday that space for displaced families in Deir al-Balah was \"running out, as people continue arriving hoping for safety where there is none\".\n\n\"Living conditions are not at all suitable for families and critical services, and supplies are limited,\" it said.\n\nThe IDF also said on Wednesday that troops were continuing \"targeted operations\" in Rafah. It added that they had \"located weapons and eliminated armed terrorists\", without providing further details.\n\nResidents told Reuters that Israeli tanks had mounted raids into the centre of Rafah and deeper into the west before retreating to eastern and southern areas.", "source": {"uri": "the-star.co.ke", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Star"}, "authors": [{"uri": "https@the-star.co.ke",

The organization captured these disruptions in a video that CodePink posted to social media.\n\nThe video had notched more than 117,000 views on the organization's X account and more than 16,000 views on their YouTube as of Thursday morning. It has also made the rounds on X.\n\nWhile shouting things like \"stop the genocide\" and \"people are dying because of you,\" the activists blamed Harris for the deaths of thousands of Palestinian children and demanded that the U.S. government stop sending financial aid to Israel.\n\n\"Real babies have been beheaded. Not fake babies like Joe Biden said he saw,\" one spectator shouted in the video. \"Stop funding genocide.\"\n\n\"You are complicit in the genocide of Palestinian children,\" another spectator said while holding up a Palestinian flag, according to the video. \"You are a war criminal.\"\n\nKimmel tried to curb the outspoken audience members with subtle jokes like \"You're interrupting my flow\" and \"If anyone else has anything to say, this is the time.\"\n\nHowever, the hecklers continued to shout at Harris before they were removed by security guards. CodePink claimed their members were illegally detained and told to hand over their IDs without proper justification.\n\nCodePink said its members \"were physically restrained with excessive force, and the gates of the building were locked by security, illegally imprisoning the peaceful demonstrators.\"\n\nThe video captured a man, who claimed to be working security at the studio, telling them they were under arrest for interrupting a live television broadcast.\n\nThe same man was also caught getting physical with several spectators, putting one man in a headlock and chasing down a woman before letting both of them go free.\n\nThe video ended with demonstrators chanting \"cease fire now\" and \"free Palestine\" outside of the building. CodePink is now asking \"Jimmy Kimmel Live\" to address and apologize for its actions.\n\n\"We reject business as usual as the Israeli government carries out a genocide against Palestinians in Gaza, all with the unconditional support of the Biden/Harris administration,\" CodePink Inland Empire member Rachael O'Neill said in the press release. \"We took this action today to put pressure on the administration to back up their words with actions: stop arming Israel and support a permanent ceasefire resolution at the U.N.\"\n\nCodePink's demonstration came two days before an Israeli strike on the al-Sardi School, which was sheltering displaced Palestinians in central Gaza, killed more than 30 people -- including 23 women and children -- early Thursday, June 6, the Associated Press reported citing local health officials.\n\nThe Israeli military said that Hamas militants were operating from within the school, which was run by the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA), the AP reported.\n\nPhilippe Lazzarini, the commissioner-general of UNRWA, said in a post on X that 6,000 people were sheltering in the school when it was hit without prior warning. He said UNRWA was unable to verify claims that armed groups were inside.\n\nAn Israeli military spokesman, Lt. Col. Peter Lerner, told the AP that the army wasn't aware of any civilian casualties in the strike.\n\nHe said that intelligence indicated that militants had used the school compound to orchestrate some of the attacks on Oct. 7, and that at least 20 militants there were using it currently as a \"staging realm\" to launch attacks on Israeli soldiers.\n\nThe military gave no evidence for its claims and released a photo of the school, pointing to classrooms on the second and third floor where it claimed militants were located.\n\nThis was the latest instance of mass casualties among Palestinians trying to find refuge as Israel expands its offensive. A day earlier, the military announced a new ground and air assault in central Gaza, pursuing Hamas militants it says have regrouped there.\n\nLast week, Israeli strikes hit near an UNRWA facility in the southern city of Rafah, saying they were targeting Hamas militants. An inferno ripped through tents nearby housing displaced families, killing at least 45 people.\n\nThe deaths triggered international outrage, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the fire was the result of a \"tragic mishap,\" according to AP. The military said the fire may have been caused by secondary explosions. The cause of the explosions has not been determined.\n\nIsrael sent troops into Rafah in early May in what it said was a limited incursion, but those forces are now operating in central parts of the city. More than 1 million people have fled Rafah since the start of the operation, scattering across southern and central Gaza into new tent camps or crowding into schools and homes.\n\nIsrael launched its campaign in Gaza after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack into Israel, in which militants killed some 1,200 people and took another 250 hostage. Israel's offensive has killed at least 36,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and civilians in its figures.\n\nIsrael has routinely launched airstrikes in all parts of Gaza since the start of the war and has carried out massive ground operations in the territory's two largest cities, Gaza City and Khan Younis, that left much of them in ruins. Troops repeatedly have swept back into parts of the Gaza Strip they have previously invaded, underscoring the resilience of the militant group despite Israel's nearly eight-month onslaught.\n\nThe United States has thrown its weight behind a phased cease-fire and hostage release outlined by President Joe Biden last week. But Israel says it won't end the war without destroying Hamas, while the militant group is demanding a lasting cease-fire and the full withdrawal of Israeli forces. Far-right members of Netanyahu's government have threatened to bring down the coalition if he signs onto a cease-fire deal.", "source": {"uri": "masslive.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

The international broadcaster said it had carried out a detailed analysis of footage from the scene in conjunction with a review by an explosive weapons expert.\n\nThe IDF claimed a number of 'terrorists' killed in the airstrike had taken part in the 7 October 2023 attacks on the Gaza-Israel border. It said it would release a list of names of those killed confirming they were 'terrorists.' The statement said the list would be released Thursday afternoon.\n\nEarlier the IDF posted on X: \"Eliminated: several Hamas and Islamic Jihad terrorists who embedded themselves inside of an UNRWA schoo.\"\n\n\"IAF fighter jets conducted a precise strike on a Hamas compound embedded inside the school in the area of Nuseirat. These terrorists belonged to the Nukhba Forces and participated in the Oct. 7 massacre,\" the IDF post said. \"Before the strike, a number of steps were taken to reduce the risk of harming uninvolved civilians during the strike, including conducting aerial surveillance, and additional intelligence information.\"\n\nThe Hamas media office however described the attack as a \"brutal crime\" against displaced people.\n\nHeavy bombardment has taken place in recent days as negotiations continue over a hostage deal.\n\nHamas revealed Thursday that the proposal put forward publicly by U.S. President Joe Biden last week was put together by Israel. The group said Thursday the plan differs from what the U.S. president set out, and falls short of what he said was being offered.\n\nHamas maintains it was a permanent ceasefire whereas the U.S./Israeli blueprint is for a temporary truce. Hamas said the plan too calls for the Israeli army to continue to maintain troops in the Gaza Strip. \"The Israeli documents speak of open-ended negotiation with no deadline, and it speaks of a stage during which the occupation regains its hostages and resumes the war. We had told the mediators that such a paper wasn't acceptable to us,\" Abu Zuhri of the Hamas media office said Thursday.\n\n\"The documenthas no mention of ending the aggression or the withdrawal,\" he said.\n\nScores of Palestinians have been killed and hundreds wounded in the past 48 hours as Israel has escalated hostilities. This is a typical measure by the IDF when ceasefire negotiations are getting close to being finalised. Not so much to help the negotiations but to inflict as much damage as it can in the time left.\n\nIsrael, separately, is sending signals that it may be preparing to go to war against Hezbollah. This fear intensified after a drone attack, however this was downplayed by Israel. \"A short while ago, a number of launches that were identified from Lebanon fell in the area of Hurfeish in northern Israel,\" the IDF spokesperson said Thursday. \"No sirens were sounded, the incident is under review.\"\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu however, who was in northern Israel near the border with Lebanon on Wednesday, was more threatening.\n\n'Whoever thinks that they can harm us and we will sit idly by is making a big mistake. We are prepared for a very strong action in the north. In one way or another, we will restore security to the north,' Mr Netanyahu said.\n\nThe Lebanese militant group says it does not want a war, and willl cease hostilities if there is a ceasefire in Gazi. The Houthi rebels in Yemen have also indicated they will stop their attacks in the Red Sea when hostilities in Gaza end.\n\nThe IDF meantime said Thursday one of its soldiers had died in combat in Gaza. Sergeant-Major Zeed Mazarib, 34, was killed in the southern Gaza Strip. Mazarib was a tracker in the Southern Regional Division of the Border Guard Corps, th IDF said.", "source": {"uri": "cambodiantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Cambodian Times"}, "authors":

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) struck a school near the central Gaza city of Deir al-Balah, leaving at least 40 people dead and 74 injured.\n\nThe United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) says those sheltering at the Al-Nusseirat Boys Preparatory were given no prior warning that the strike was coming. But the IDF has countered that it was a \"precise strike on a Hamas compound\" inside the school and that dozens of Hamas militants were using the compound.\n\n\"The terrorists directed terror from the area of the school while exploiting it and using it as a shelter,\" the IDF wrote on Telegram. \"Several terrorists who planned to carry out terror attacks and promote terrorist activities against IDF troops in the immediate time frame were eliminated in the strike.\"\n\nThe UN agency is disputing this narrative, with Commissioner-general of UNRWA Philippe Lazzarini saying \"the school was sheltering 6,000 displaced people when it was hit.\" The Gaza Health Ministry has said that among the dead are 14 children and nine women.\n\n\"Attacking, targeting or using UN buildings for military purposes are a blatant disregard of International humanitarian law,\" he added. He also explained that throughout the conflict many other UNRWA shelters and conflicts had been struck, and estimated that over 450 internally displaced civilians had been killed in total.\n\nIsraeli leaders have long charged Hamas fighters with hiding among civilians or using residential areas to launch missile attacks or store arms. Often IDF military commanders fire back on said militants even knowing it could result in mass civilian casualties.\n\nIn this new mass casualty event, Israel does not appear to be denying that its airstrike killed many civilians. It has offered this as defense of its actions:\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) accused Hamas of embedding inside the UNRWA school and claimed fighters who invaded southern Israel on Oct. 7, killing around 1,200 people and taking another roughly 250 hostages, were sheltering at the site.\n\n\"Before the strike, a number of steps were taken to reduce the risk of harming uninvolved civilians during the strike, including conducting aerial surveillance, and additional intelligence information,\" they added.\n\nThis will without doubt result in more pressure from European powers for Israel to halt its operations at a moment there are reports a ceasefire deal is still inching forward in Qatar and Egypt-mediated truce talks.\n\nAn Egyptian source has been quoted in Al Jazeera as saying Thursday, \"Hamas leaders have informed us that they are studying the truce proposal seriously and positively.\" However, such reporting of 'positive' momentum has been a talking point on repeat for several months, but not resulting in a new truce or hostage deal coming to fruition.", "source": {"uri": "zerohedge.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Zero Hedge"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Israel has said there will be no halt to fighting during ceasefire talks.\n\nIn an apparent blow to a truce proposal touted last week by US President Joe Biden, the leader of Hamas on Wednesday said the group would demand a permanent end to the war in Gaza and Israeli withdrawal as part of a ceasefire plan.\n\nThe remarks by Ismail Haniyeh appeared to deliver the Palestinian militant group's reply to the proposal that Biden unveiled last week. Washington had said it was waiting to hear an answer from Hamas to what Biden described as an Israeli initiative.\n\nYoung Saudi chefs are training at the Zadk Academy, which is said to be Saudi Arabia's first culinary institution.\n\n\"The movement and factions of the resistance will deal seriously and positively with any agreement that is based on a comprehensive ending of the aggression and the complete withdrawal and prisoners swap,\" Haniyeh said.\n\nSince a brief week-long truce in November, all attempts to arrange a ceasefire have failed, with Hamas insisting on its demand for a permanent end to the conflict, while Israel says it is prepared to discuss only temporary pauses until the militant group is defeated.\n\nWashington is still pressing hard to reach an agreement. CIA director William Burns met senior officials from mediators Qatar and Egypt on Wednesday in Doha to discuss the ceasefire proposal.\n\nBiden has repeatedly declared that ceasefires were close over the past several months, only for no truce to materialise.\n\nLast week's announcement came with far greater fanfare from the White House, and at a time when Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is under mounting domestic political pressure to chart a path to end the eight-month-old war and negotiate the release of Israeli hostages held by Hamas.", "source": {"uri": "pakistantoday.com.pk", "dataType": "news", "title": "pakistantoday.com.pk"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ismail_Haniyeh", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ismail Haniyeh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internally_displaced_person", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internally displaced person"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cairo", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cairo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cairo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jerusalem"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jerusalem"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Military campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurgency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Insurgency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_fedayeen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian fedayeen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_J._Burns_(diplomat)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "William J.

Hamas described its attack as a response to the aggressive actions of Israeli authorities against the Al-Aqsa Mosque on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem's Old City. In response, Israel declared a total blockade of the Gaza Strip, home to 2.3 million Palestinians before the crisis, and has been delivering air strikes on Gaza as well as some parts of Lebanon and Syria. Clashes have also been reported on the West Bank.

That's not a realistic goal.\n\n\"Destroying Hamas as a governing authority is an achievable and attainable military objective.\"\n\nHamas' sprawling 311-mile maze of tunnels is now covered in rubble caused by ongoing airstrikes, which experts say could aid militants in their ambushes and attacks.\n\nThe fighters are able to travel underground and pop up from under the rubble to strike Israeli forces.\n\nExperts say the terrorists could also be using this advantage to withdraw deeper into Gaza City and lure Israelis into their \"kill zones\".\n\nBut Hamas has employed sinister tactic since the beginning of the war, according to Israel, even using recordings of children screaming \"save me!\" to con IDF troops into death traps.\n\nIsraeli spokesman Avi Hyman told The Sun in December of the \"psychological warfare\" being waged by Hamas against Israel's soldiers.\n\nHe said: \"We've heard reports of them setting up scenarios by which the soldiers would think that there's hostages in a specific area to then ambush them.\n\n\"So we've heard reports of them playing Israeli toddlers saying, 'Save me! Save me', you know, from within buildings that are booby trapped.\"\n\nHe claimed to have seen video evidence of \"booby-trapped\" children's toys which had been fixed with a device playing Israeli music and noises which could have come from young children.\n\nIsraeli forces said at the time that Hamas terrorists had planted a number of booby traps in kill zones, including a child's pink backpack containing a hidden bomb.\n\nChilling footage showed an IDF soldier opening the rucksack to reveal the explosives.\n\nThe military said: \"The bag was booby-trapped, containing a remote-activated explosive device -- weighing 7kg.\n\n\"Hamas purposefully chose to booby-trap a child's backpack with the hope a well-intentioned civilian would pick it up.\"\n\nIsrael's defence forces further claimed Hamas had attached speakers playing noises which sounded like the cries of distressed children to baby dolls, and even fixed bombs to the bodies of dead Israelis.\n\nDina Zaslacski, a friend of killed Canadian-Israeli mother Adi Vital-Kaploun, said: \"They put bombs all over her body, and her dad was in the house. Thank God he didn't open the door.\"", "source": {"uri": "thesun.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jessica_baker@thesun.co.uk", "name": "Jessica Baker", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambush", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ambush"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_City", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurgency", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Insurgency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Izz_ad-Din_al-Qassam_Brigades", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafah", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booby_trap", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Booby trap"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Advisor_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Security Advisor (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Israel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explosive", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Explosive"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_warfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Psychological warfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "God"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hostage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airstrike", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Airstrike"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Multinational_Forces", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Multinational Forces", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/newspress-collage-ga0aesm3k-1717668665858.jpg?1717672283&strip=all&quality=100&w=1920&h=1080&crop=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9626324", "eventUri": "eng-9626324", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 125, "textEnd": 134}], "sentiment": -0.5294117647058824, "wgt": 132, "relevance": 1}

The school, run by the UN Agency for Palestinian Refugees (Unrwa), was sheltering hundreds of displaced Palestinians who had fled ongoing fighting elsewhere in Gaza.\n\nLocal journalists reported that a warplane fired two missiles at classrooms on the top floor of the school. Maha Issa, a woman staying at the school with her family, recounted to the Associated Press, \"I heard five missiles hitting the school. I went out, running, and found the fire burning in three classrooms.\" Videos shared on social media showed extensive destruction, with bodies wrapped in white shrouds and blankets.\n\nGaza's health ministry reported that 40 people were killed, including 14 children and 9 women, with 74 others injured. An official at al-Aqsa hospital, where many of the dead and wounded were taken, confirmed the same death toll. Unrwa's Commissioner General, Philippe Lazzarini, stated, \"At least 35 people were killed and many more injured.\"\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) claimed responsibility for the strike, stating it was a \"precise strike on a Hamas compound embedded inside an Unrwa school in the area of Nuseirat.\" An annotated aerial photograph provided by the IDF highlighted classrooms on the upper floors as the \"locations of the terrorists.\" Lt Col Peter Lerner, an IDF spokesman, asserted, \"I'm not aware of any civilian casualties and I'd be very, very cautious of accepting anything that Hamas puts out.\"\n\nHowever, Unrwa officials and Gaza's Hamas-run government denied these claims. Philippe Lazzarini described the incident as \"horrific\" and expressed shock at the suggestion that armed groups might have been inside the shelter. He emphasized, \"UN staff, premises, and operations must be protected at all times.\"\n\nIn response to the ongoing conflict, which has resulted in over 36,650 deaths in Gaza according to health ministry figures, South Africa filed a case against Israel at the ICJ on December 29, 2023. The case accuses Israel of violating the 1948 Genocide Convention, arguing that Israel's military operations in Gaza amount to acts of genocide.\n\nSeveral countries have joined or declared their intention to join the case, including:\n\nNicaragua (February 8), Belgium (March 11), Colombia (April 5), Turkey (May 1), Libya (May 10), Egypt (May 12), Maldives (May 13), Mexico (May 24), Ireland (May 28), Chile (June 2), Palestine (June 3), Spain (June 6).\n\nThe incident at the UN school and the broader conflict have spurred global outrage and renewed calls for a ceasefire.\n\nUS President Joe Biden recently outlined a proposal for a temporary truce, followed by a permanent cessation of hostilities. However, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has insisted on defeating Hamas before agreeing to a permanent ceasefire.", "source": {"uri": "thenews-chronicle.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

That's not a realistic goal.\n\n\"Destroying Hamas as a governing authority is an achievable and attainable military objective.\"\n\nHamas' sprawling 311-mile maze of tunnels is now covered in rubble caused by ongoing airstrikes, which experts say could aid militants in their ambushes and attacks.\n\nThe fighters are able to travel underground and pop up from under the rubble to strike Israeli forces.\n\nExperts say the terrorists could also be using this advantage to withdraw deeper into Gaza City and lure Israelis into their \"kill zones\".\n\nBut Hamas has employed sinister tactics since the beginning of the war, according to Israel, even using recordings of children screaming \"save me!\" to con IDF troops into death traps.\n\nIsraeli spokesman Avi Hyman told The Sun in December of the \"psychological warfare\" being waged by Hamas against Israel's soldiers.\n\nHe said: \"We've heard reports of them setting up scenarios by which the soldiers would think that there's hostages in a specific area to then ambush them.\n\n\"So we've heard reports of them playing Israeli toddlers saying, 'Save me! Save me', you know, from within buildings that are booby trapped.\"\n\nHyman claimed to have seen video evidence of \"booby-trapped\" children's toys fixed with a device playing Israeli music and noises which could have come from young children.\n\nIsraeli forces said at the time that Hamas terrorists had planted a number of booby traps in kill zones, including a child's pink backpack stuffed with a bomb.\n\nChilling footage showed an IDF soldier opening the rucksack to reveal an explosive device.\n\nThe military said: \"The bag was booby-trapped, containing a remote-activated explosive device -- weighing 7kg.\n\n\"Hamas purposefully chose to booby-trap a child's backpack with the hope a well-intentioned civilian would pick it up.\"\n\nIsrael's defence forces further claimed Hamas had attached speakers playing noises which sounded like the cries of distressed children to baby dolls, and fixed bombs to the bodies of dead Israelis.\n\nDina Zaslacski, a friend of killed Canadian-Israeli mother Adi Vital-Kaploun, said last year: \"They put bombs all over her body, and her dad was in the house.", "source": {"uri": "the-sun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The US

Dozens of people have been killed, according to health workers in the Gaza Strip, who warned that the only remaining hospital in the area was inundated with wounded people.\n\nThe Gaza Health Ministry said it had recorded 36 dead and 115 injured in the past 24 hours, without saying how many were combatants. International aid group Doctors Without Borders said at least 70 bodies, mostly those of women and children, had been taken to Al Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, in Deir al-Balah, since Tuesday. The Israeli military declined to comment on the reports.\n\n\"The odor of blood in the hospital's emergency room this morning was unbearable,\" Karin Huster, a medical adviser for Doctors Without Borders in Gaza, said in a statement. \"There are people lying everywhere, on the floor, outside.\n\n\"The bodies were being brought in plastic bags,\" she said. \"The situation is overwhelming.\"\n\nIsrael's military said it was conducting military operations \"above and below ground\" against Hamas militants in Bureij and the eastern part of Deir al-Balah, both in central Gaza, and that it had \"eliminated\" several.\n\nOn its Telegram channel, Hamas also reported clashes with Israeli forces in the area and said Wednesday that it had fired missiles at Israeli troops in the east of Bureij. The number of people in central Gaza, particularly in Deir al-Balah, had swelled as hundreds of thousands of Gaza residents escaped fighting in the southern city of Rafah, once the main hub for people sheltering from the war.\n\nA spokesperson for Gaza's health ministry warned that Al Aqsa Martyrs Hospital was now the only functioning hospital in the region and was at three times its normal capacity. Health authorities in central Gaza estimate that the hospital, where the injured are being taken, is now handling services for 1 million people.\n\nSome people have died of their injuries while waiting outside operating rooms for their turn to be treated, said the spokesperson, Khalil al-Daghran, who is also a doctor at the hospital.\n\n\"We can no longer receive new wounded,\" he said. \"There is tremendous pressure on medical teams, who cannot control the current situation.\"\n\nOn Wednesday night, the hospital said in a statement distributed by the Gaza Health Ministry that one of its two remaining generators had failed, endangering dozens of patients in critical care, including premature babies. The hospital had been relying on the generators since the war started, and Israeli authorities had blocked access to equipment needed to maintain them, the statement said.\n\nResidents in Bureij reported heavy artillery strikes since Tuesday night and said that they were unsure where to go next, with fighting erupting around the Gaza Strip.\n\nHani Ahmed, a teacher and father of five who lives near the center of Bureij, said two buildings in his area had been struck. Despite this, he was hesitant to uproot his family again.\n\n\"There is no place to flee to now,\" Ahmed said. \"Khan Younis is rubble; Rafah is under attack; the north is destroyed.\"\n\n\"I might take my family in my small bus and live at the beach as I have no tent,\" he added. \"We are terrified.\"\n\nAdham al-Daya, a videographer based in central Gaza who reports for pan-Arab and Palestinian media outlets, said Israeli strikes had also hit several high-rise buildings in the nearby Maghazi area. While visiting one of the areas hit, he said he saw body parts scattered everywhere amid the rubble.\n\n\"The shelling, drone shooting and successive airstrikes are nonstop,\" he said in a phone interview, during which several explosions could be heard.\n\nResidents were loading the wounded on horse and donkey carts to get them to ambulances that could drive to the hospital, he said. But some ambulance drivers, unable to coordinate with Israeli forces in advance, were being forced to turn back as they came under gunfire from Israeli drones.\n\nThere are still dead bodies in their homes, he said, \"and no one can reach them.\"\n\nPentagon: US aid pier off Gaza may be repaired by week's end\n\nThe Pentagon hopes that the temporary pier set up by the US military off the coast of Gaza to deliver aid will be repaired by the end of the week, officials said Wednesday.\n\n\"We're hoping that we will be able to re-anchor the peer into Gaza at the end of the week,\" US Department of Defense spokeswoman Sabrina Singh said.\n\n\"As soon as the temporary pier is re-anchored to the beach in Gaza, we expect aid to flow pretty immediately,\" Singh added.\n\nThe pier anchored on the coast was severely damaged in rough seas at the end of May just a few days after it was completed.\n\nDue to strong waves, four US military ships involved in the mission broke free from their moorings.\n\nThere had also previously been problems with the distribution of aid supplies. The Pentagon said at the time that some lorries had been \"intercepted.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, Singh also corrected the estimated costs for the temporary pier downwards to around $230 million, including repair costs. The Pentagon had previously put the costs at around $300 million.\n\nIsraeli nationalists march through East Jerusalem, attack reporters\n\nThousands of Israeli nationalists marched through Palestinian neighborhoods in Jerusalem on Wednesday, provoking tense scenes and confrontations with police.\n\nThe annual Flag March celebrates Israel's capture of East Jerusalem in the Six-Day War of 1967. Critics accuse organizers of deliberately antagonizing the divided city's Palestinian community, with tensions especially high this year amid the conflict with Gaza.\n\nLarge contingents of police separated demonstrators and Palestinians in the Muslim Quarter of Jerusalem's Old City on Wednesday, Israeli media reported, with some participants being arrested for attacking a group of journalists.\n\nA reporter from Israel's liberal Haaretz newspaper wrote on the social media platform X that a colleague was attacked after defending fellow journalists. Five people were detained in the incident, police said.\n\nBefore the Six-Day War, Jordan administered East Jerusalem, which contains major religious monuments including the Wailing Wall - one of the holiest sites in Judaism - and the Al-Aqsa Mosque on the Temple Mount.\n\nPrevious marches have seen young ultra-nationalist Israelis violence rioting and carrying out violence against Palestinians.",

He alleged the strike killed more than two dozen civilians seeking shelter.\n\nAccording to Israel's military, all necessary steps had been taken to reduce the risk of civilian casualties prior to the strike.\n\n\"We're very confident in the intelligence,\" military spokesperson Lt Col. Peter Lerner said, accusing Hamas and Islamic Jihad fighters of deliberately using U.N. facilities as operational bases.\n\n\"I'm not aware of any civilian casualties and I'd be very, very cautious of accepting anything that Hamas puts out,\" he added.\n\nLast week's truce proposal by President Joe Biden has hit a dead end after Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh responded by saying that any ceasefire plan would have to involve a complete and permanent end to the Gaza war, including withdrawal of all Israeli troops.\n\nCeasefire talks have been unsuccessful since a brief week-long truce in November. The terrorist group has repeatedly demanded an end to the fighting and withdrawal from Gaza, while Israel has offered only temporary pauses and vowed to continue fighting until the terrorist group is destroyed.\n\nMeanwhile, Washington has been pushing for a resolution on the ceasefire talks. On June 5, CIA director William Burns met with senior officials from mediators Qatar and Egypt in Doha for discussions on the proposal.\n\nHowever, despite repeated claims by President Biden that a ceasefire was near, no agreement has yet come to fruition.\n\nThe Gaza conflict began with Hamas's brutal Oct. 7 attack that killed more than 1,200 people and saw the terrorist group take nearly 240 hostages. The war has resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of Gazans, according to the Hamas-controlled Gaza health ministry. They don't differentiate between combatants and civilians.\n\nSince the week-long truce last November, around half of the hostages have been freed. It is currently still unclear how many of the remaining hostages are still alive.\n\nPrior to the conflict, Hamas had around 20,000-25,000 terrorist fighters, according to U.S. estimates. Israel has reported a loss of around 300 troops since the conflict started.\n\nAt the same time, tensions between Israel and the Iranian-backed Hezbollah terrorist group, which operates out of Lebanon, remain high.\n\nDespite attributing the ceasefire proposal by President Biden as an Israeli initiative, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said, \"the claims that we have agreed to a ceasefire without our conditions being met are incorrect.\" The conditions refer to the destruction of Hamas and the freeing of all the hostages.\n\nMeanwhile, Israel's Defence Minister Yoav Gallant rejected any possibility of a halt to Israel's offensive amid ceasefire negotiations.\n\n\"Any negotiations with Hamas would be conducted only under fire,\" he said in remarks carried by Israeli media.", "source": {"uri": "theepochtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.theepochtimes.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_City", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_Islamic_Jihad", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian Islamic Jihad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_J._Burns_(diplomat)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "William J.

Hit Central Gaza As Hospitals Overwhelmed - World news - Tasnim News Agency", "body": "TEHRAN (Tasnim) - Israeli forces are continuing their offensive in central Gaza, targeting civilian areas including the Bureij camp and eastern Deir el-Balah with a series of air strikes.\n\nInjured Palestinians are being rescued from neighborhoods in central Gaza that have been under intense Israeli attack.\n\nIn a recent mission, the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) recovered the bodies of six Palestinians killed in Israeli bombardment and found eight others wounded in the Ja'frawi neighborhood, east of Deir el-Balah.\n\nMedical sources in Deir el-Balah report that morgues are full, and they are struggling to handle the influx of casualties.\n\nThe hospital is operating at three times its capacity.\n\nIsraeli attacks on the Bureij and Maghazi refugee camps in central Gaza killed at least 15 people on Tuesday.\n\nDozens more wounded in the attacks were taken to the overwhelmed Al-Aqsa Hospital in Deir el-Balah.\n\nA spokesman for the hospital, which faces a fuel shortage and lack of medical supplies, has called for international assistance as the facility is overrun with patients from the latest Israeli attacks.\n\nIsraeli troops have also continued their offensive in Rafah in the south.\n\nIsrael's latest round of attacks across Gaza has resulted in numerous civilian casualties, according to the Wafa news agency and medical sources who spoke to Al Jazeera, particularly in densely populated central areas suffering heavy bombardment.\n\nLocal media reported that an Israeli military attack on a home belonging to the Darwish family in the Maghazi camp killed at least eight people.\n\nOver the past day, a total of 75 people have been killed in central Gaza due to Israeli attacks, according to Palestinian journalists on the ground.\n\nThe attacks have heavily impacted the densely populated Bureij and Maghazi refugee camps, as well as neighborhoods east of Deir el-Balah.\n\nOfficials from Al Aqsa Hospital, the only functioning health facility in the area, have warned they cannot cope with the influx of victims.\n\nAn Al Jazeera correspondent reported artillery shelling in the Korba area in the Shujayea neighborhood, east of Gaza City in the north of the Strip.\n\nMarking World Environment Day, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees highlighted the environmental damage caused by Israel's assault on Gaza in a post on X.\n\nUNRWA stated that the war has caused \"catastrophic damage to the natural environment\" that Palestinians rely on for water, clean air, food, and livelihoods.\n\nThe agency added that restoring environmental services to Gaza will take \"decades\" and can only begin once a ceasefire and an end to the war are achieved.\n\nResearch from January indicated that the carbon footprint of Israel's war on Gaza exceeded the annual emissions of 20 small countries.\n\nGaza Health Ministry's Munir al-Bursh has called for more fuel to be delivered to northern Gaza as medical teams return to work at the Indonesian Field Hospital.\n\n\"The (Israeli forces) destroyed the health sector in northern Gaza,\" he told Al Jazeera.\n\n\"We are calling on the world to bring diesel fuel into northern Gaza ... we are working at the minimum.\"\n\nAt least 36,586 Palestinians have been killed and 83,074 wounded in Israeli attacks on Gaza since October 7, according to the Health Ministry.\n\nThe ministry added that 115 people were injured in the latest 24-hour reporting period.", "source": {"uri": "tasnimnews.com",

By contrast, Israel says it has lost almost 300 troops in the Gaza campaign.\n\nHamas fighters are now largely avoiding sustained skirmishes with Israeli forces closing in on the southernmost city of Rafah, instead relying on ambushes and improvised bombs to hit targets often behind enemy lines, one of the officials said.\n\nSeveral Gaza residents, including Wissam Ibrahim, said they, too, had observed a shift in tactics.\n\n\"In earlier months, Hamas fighters would intercept, engage, and fire at Israeli troops as soon as they pushed into their territory,\" Ibrahim told Reuters by phone. \"But now, there is a notable shift in their mode of operations, they wait for them to deploy and then they start their ambushes and attacks.\"\n\nThe officials, who requested anonymity to discuss sensitive matters, said such tactics could sustain a Hamas insurgency for months to come, aided by weapons smuggled into Gaza via tunnels and others repurposed from unexploded ordnance or captured from Israeli forces.\n\nThis kind of protracted timeframe is echoed by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's national security adviser who said last week the war could last until the end of 2024 at least.\n\nA Hamas spokesperson didn't respond to requests for comment on its battlefield strategy.\n\nIn a parallel propaganda drive, some of the group's fighters are videotaping their ambushes of Israeli troops, before editing and posting them on Telegram and other social media apps.\n\nPeter Lerner, a spokesperson for the IDF, told Reuters they were still some way from destroying Hamas, which he also said had lost roughly half of its fighting force.\n\nLerner said the military was adapting to the group's shift in tactics and acknowledged Israel couldn't eliminate every Hamas fighter or destroy every Hamas tunnel.\n\n\"There is never a goal to kill each and every last terrorist on the ground. That's not a realistic goal,\" he added. \"Destroying Hamas as a governing authority is an achievable and attainable military objective,\" he added.\n\nHAMAS LEADERS SINWAR AND DEIF\n\nNetanyahu and his government are under pressure from Washington to agree to a ceasefire plan to end the war, which began on Oct. 7 when Hamas fighters stormed into southern Israel, killing more than 1,200 people and seizing over 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.\n\nIsrael's subsequent ground-and-air campaign in Gaza has left the territory in ruins and killed more than 36,000 people, according to Palestinian health authorities. The United Nations says over a million people face \"catastrophic\" levels of hunger.\n\nThere are about between 7,000-8,000 Hamas fighters reportedly entrenched in Rafah, the last significant bastion of the group's resistance, according to Israeli officials. Top leaders Yahya Sinwar, his brother Mohammed, and Sinwar's second-in-command Mohammed Deif are still alive and believed to be hiding in tunnels with Israeli hostages, they said.\n\nThe Palestinian group has shown the ability to withdraw rapidly after attacks, take cover, regroup, and pop up again in areas that Israel had believed to be cleared of militants, an administration official said.\n\nLerner, the IDF spokesperson, agreed Israel faced a protracted battle to overcome Hamas, which has ruled the Gaza Strip since 2006.\n\n\"There is no quick fix after 17 years of them building their capabilities,\" he added.\n\nHamas has constructed a 500 km (310 miles) subterranean city of tunnels over the years. The labyrinth, dubbed the Gaza metro by the Israeli military, is roughly half the length of the New York subway system. Equipped with water, power and ventilation, it shelters Hamas leaders, command and control centers, and weapons and ammunition stores.\n\nThe Israeli military said last week that it had taken control of the entire Gaza-Egypt land border to prevent weapons smuggling. About 20 tunnels used by Hamas to carry arms into Gaza were found within the zone, it added.\n\nEgypt's State Information Service didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on Israel's claims of arms-smuggling from the country. Egyptian officials have previously denied any such clandestine trade is taking place, saying they destroyed the tunnel networks leading to Gaza years ago.\n\nECHOES OF FALLUJA INSURGENCY?\n\nThe Gaza incursion is Israel's longest and fiercest conflict since it invaded Lebanon to oust the Palestinian Liberation Organization in 1982.\n\nNetanyahu has defied domestic and international calls to outline a post-war plan for the territory. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has warned that the absence of such a roadmap could trigger lawlessness in the enclave.\n\nOne Arab official told Reuters that criminal gangs had already emerged in Gaza amid the power vacuum, seizing food deliveries and conducting armed robberies.\n\nThe official and two other Arab government sources, who all requested anonymity to speak freely, said the IDF could face similar threats to those encountered by America in the city of Falluja in 2004-2006 following the -led invasion of Iraq.\n\nA broad insurgency in Falluja swelled the ranks first of al Qaeda and then Islamic State, miring Iraq in conflict and chaos from which it has yet to fully emerge two decades later.\n\nWashington and its Arab allies have said they are working on a post-conflict plan for Gaza which involves a time-bound, irreversible path to Palestinian statehood.\n\nWhen the plan, part of a \"grand bargain\" envisioned by the United States that aims to secure a normalizing of relations between Saudi Arabia and Israel, is complete, Washington aims to put it to Israel, the officials said.\n\nA United Arab Emirates official with direct knowledge of the discussions said a Palestinian invitation was needed for countries to assist Gaza in an emergency operation, as well as an end to hostilities, full Israeli disengagement, and clarity on Gaza's legal status, including control of borders.\n\nThe emergency process could last a year and be potentially renewable for another year, according to the UAE official who said the aim to be to stabilize the enclave rather than rebuild it.\n\nFor reconstruction to begin, a more detailed roadmap towards a two-state solution was needed, he added, as well as serious and credible reform of the Palestinian Authority.\n\nHow the United States aims to overcome Netanyahu's repeated rejection of a two-state solution, which Riyadh says is a condition to normalizing ties, is unclear.\n\nDavid Schenker, a former Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs, dismissed any suggestion of a clean IDF pullout from the Palestinian territory.\n\n\"Israel says it's going to maintain security control which means that it's going to constantly fly drones over Gaza and they're not going to be limited if they see Hamas re-emerging, they're going to go back,\" said Schenker, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute -based think-tank.\n\nGadi Eisenkot, a former Israeli military chief serving in Netanyahu's war cabinet, has proposed an Egyptian-led international coalition as an alternative to Hamas rule in Gaza.\n\nIn a closed-door briefing last week to the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, he emphasized the complex nature of anti-militancy warfare.\n\n\"This is a religious, nationalistic, social, and military struggle with no knock-out blow but rather protracted warfare that will last many years,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "jpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Jerusalem Post"},

We are Muslims, O Arabs, why don't you save our children from death? Why all this silence about these crimes?\" she cried out.\n\nMeanwhile, tens of thousands of residents of the Al-Bureij and Al-Maghazi refugee camps in the central Gaza Strip fled to areas that might protect them from the avalanche of death by the Israeli army after it began a ground military operation in the area.\n\nThose newly displaced were seen walking dozens of kilometres on foot to escape the ongoing Israeli bombardment and perhaps save their children and women from what they described as \"hell.\"\n\nAfter two hours of walking, Hanadi Al-Banna, a displaced Palestinian, was able to reach the west of Al-Nuseirat camp and take refuge in a relative's tent to stay in until the end of the military operation in Al-Bureij camp.\n\n\"We are very tired of this war. We no longer have the energy to survive or continue living. No one has mercy on us and no one protects us,\" the 25-year-old mother of two remarked to TNA. \"The situation is tragic and catastrophic. There is no safe place in the Strip, and we do not even have hope that this catastrophic war will end soon.\"\n\nThe same despair was articulated by Fathia Al-Arabid, a displaced Palestinian from Al-Moghazi camp, despite her being lucky enough to survive an Israeli bombardment that targeted a house next to hers.\n\n\"I may have survived this time, but I do not know what will happen in the coming days,\" Al-Arabid said. \"We have been living in a real hell for more than eight months, with no hope of survival for long.\"\n\nSince 7 October, Israel has been launching a large-scale war on the Gaza Strip after Hamas led a military attack on Israeli military bases and civilian settlements within and around the Gaza envelop, killing about 1,190 people and capturing about 240 according to Israeli authorities.\n\nIsraeli indiscriminate attacks on the coastal enclave killed more than 36,500 Palestinians and wounded about 83,000, mostly women and children, according to the Ministry of Health in Gaza.", "source": {"uri": "newarab.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New Arab"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugee_camp", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Refugee camp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Health,_Palestine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Health, Palestine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forced_displacement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Forced displacement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslims", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Muslims"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arabs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deir_al-Balah", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Deir al-Balah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Deir al-Balah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_Mount", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Temple Mount"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_operation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Military operation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zionism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Zionism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internally_displaced_person", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Internally displaced person"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiscriminate_attack", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indiscriminate attack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Health_(Israel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Health (Israel)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/North_America", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/North America", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Special_Needs", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Special Needs", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Associations", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://www.newarab.com/sites/default/files/styles/600x338/public/2147810215.jpeg?h=199d8c1f&itok=1uzGo9Y1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9626324", "eventUri": "eng-9626324", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 3443, "textEnd": 3452}], "sentiment": -0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 129, "relevance": 1}

By contrast, Israel says it has lost almost 300 troops in the Gaza campaign.\n\nHamas fighters are now largely avoiding sustained skirmishes with Israeli forces closing in on the southernmost city of Rafah, instead relying on ambushes and improvised bombs to hit targets often behind enemy lines, one of the officials said.\n\nSTUDY SAYS FOOD AID MEETS QUALITY, QUANTITY FOR GAZANS AS UN, ICC SAY ISRAEL STARVING CIVILIANS\n\nSeveral Gaza residents, including Wissam Ibrahim, said they too had observed a shift in tactics.\n\n\"In earlier months, Hamas fighters would intercept, engage and fire at Israeli troops as soon as they pushed into their territory,\" Ibrahim told Reuters by phone. \"But now, there is a notable shift in their mode of operations, they wait for them to deploy and then they start their ambushes and attacks.\"\n\nThe U.S. officials, who requested anonymity to discuss sensitive matters, said such tactics could sustain a Hamas insurgency for months to come, aided by weapons smuggled into Gaza via tunnels and others repurposed from unexploded ordnance or captured from Israeli forces.\n\nThis kind of protracted timeframe is echoed by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's national security adviser who said last week the war could last until the end of 2024 at least.\n\nA Hamas spokesperson didn't respond to requests for comment on its battlefield strategy.\n\nIn a parallel propaganda drive, some of the group's fighters are videotaping their ambushes of Israeli troops, before editing and posting them on Telegram and other social media apps.\n\nPeter Lerner, a spokesperson for the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), told Reuters they were still some way from destroying Hamas, which he also said had lost roughly half of its fighting force.\n\nLerner said the military was adapting to the group's shift in tactics and acknowledged Israel couldn't eliminate every Hamas fighter or destroy every Hamas tunnel.\n\n\"There is never a goal to kill each and every last terrorist on the ground. That's not a realistic goal,\" he added. \"Destroying Hamas as a governing authority is an achievable and attainable military objective,\" he added.\n\nNetanyahu and his government are under pressure from Washington to agree to a ceasefire plan to end the war, which began on Oct. 7 when Hamas fighters stormed into southern Israel, killing more than 1,200 people and seizing over 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.\n\nIsrael's subsequent ground-and-air campaign in Gaza has left the territory in ruins and killed more than 36,000 people, according to Palestinian health authorities. The United Nations says over a million people face \"catastrophic\" levels of hunger.\n\nThere are about between 7,000-8,000 Hamas fighters reportedly entrenched in Rafah, the last significant bastion of the group's resistance, according to Israeli and U.S. officials. Top leaders Yahya Sinwar, his brother Mohammed, and Sinwar's second-in-command Mohammed Deif are still alive and believed to be hiding in tunnels with Israeli hostages, they said.\n\nThe Palestinian group has shown the ability to withdraw rapidly after attacks, take cover, regroup, and pop up again in areas that Israel had believed to be cleared of militants, a U.S. administration official said.\n\nLerner, the IDF spokesperson, agreed Israel faced a protracted battle to overcome Hamas, which has ruled the Gaza Strip since 2006.\n\n\"There is no quick fix after 17 years of them building their capabilities,\" he added.\n\nHamas has constructed a 310-mile subterranean city of tunnels over the years. The labyrinth, dubbed the Gaza metro by the Israeli military, is roughly half the length of the New York subway system. Equipped with water, power and ventilation, it shelters Hamas leaders, command and control centers, and weapons and ammunition stores.\n\nThe Israeli military said last week that it had taken control of the entire Gaza-Egypt land border to prevent weapons smuggling. About 20 tunnels used by Hamas to carry arms into Gaza were found within the zone, it added.\n\nEgypt's State Information Service didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on Israel's claims of arms-smuggling from the country. Egyptian officials have previously denied any such clandestine trade is taking place, saying they destroyed the tunnel networks leading to Gaza years ago.\n\nThe Gaza incursion is Israel's longest and fiercest conflict since it invaded Lebanon to oust the Palestinian Liberation Organization in 1982.\n\nNetanyahu has defied domestic and international calls to outline a post-war plan for the territory. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has warned that the absence of such a roadmap could trigger lawlessness in the enclave.\n\nOne Arab official told Reuters that criminal gangs had already emerged in Gaza amid the power vacuum, seizing food deliveries and conducting armed robberies.\n\nThe official and two other Arab government sources, who all requested anonymity to speak freely, said the IDF could face similar threats to those encountered by America in the city of Falluja in 2004-2006 following the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq.\n\nA broad insurgency in Falluja swelled the ranks first of al Qaeda and then Islamic State, miring Iraq in conflict and chaos from which it has yet to fully emerge two decades later.\n\nWashington and its Arab allies have said they are working on a post-conflict plan for Gaza which involves a time-bound, irreversible path to Palestinian statehood.\n\nWhen the plan, part of a \"grand bargain\" envisioned by the United States that aims to secure a normalizing of relations between Saudi Arabia and Israel, is complete, Washington aims to put it to Israel, the U.S. officials said.\n\nA United Arab Emirates official with direct knowledge of the discussions said a Palestinian invitation was needed for countries to assist Gaza in an emergency operation, as well as an end to hostilities, full Israeli disengagement, and clarity on Gaza's legal status, including control of borders.\n\nThe emergency process could last a year and be potentially renewable for another year, according to the UAE official who said the aim was to stabilize the enclave rather than rebuild it.\n\nFor reconstruction to begin, a more detailed roadmap towards a two-state solution was needed, he added, as well as serious and credible reform of the Palestinian Authority.\n\nHow the United States aims to overcome Netanyahu's repeated rejection of a two-state solution, which Riyadh says is a condition to normalizing ties, is unclear.\n\nDavid Schenker, a former U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs, dismissed any suggestion of a clean IDF pullout from the Palestinian territory.\n\n\"Israel says it's going to maintain security control which means that it's going to constantly fly drones over Gaza and they're not going to be limited if they see Hamas re-emerging, they're going to go back,\" said Schenker, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute U.S.-based think-tank.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nGadi Eisenkot, a former Israeli military chief serving in Netanyahu's war cabinet, has proposed an Egyptian-led international coalition as an alternative to Hamas rule in Gaza.\n\nIn a closed-door briefing last week to the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, he emphasized the complex nature of anti-militancy warfare.\n\n\"This is a religious, nationalistic, social, and military struggle with no knock-out blow but rather protracted warfare that will last many years,\" he said.", "source":

Dozens of Palestinians were reported killed. The military said on Wednesday that the troops had begun an operation against \"terrorists and terrorist infrastructure above and below ground\" backed by air strikes, the BBC reported.\n\nAccording to residents, intense bombardment took place after the military operation began. The charity M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res claimed that at least 70 dead people, majority women and children, had been brought to a local hospital since Tuesday, the BBC reported.\n\nThis came at a time when US, Egyptian, and Qatari mediators met in Doha and Cairo to hold discussions on how to finalise a new ceasefire and hostage release deal.\n\nOn Tuesday, the US said it was still waiting for a response from Hamas to what it described as an Israeli proposal outlined by US President Joe Biden last week.\n\nAccording to the BBC, Qatar stated that it had delivered the plan to Hamas representatives and noted that it was also still waiting for a clear position from the Israeli government.\n\nHamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh said on Wednesday that the group would deal \"seriously and positively\" with a proposal based on an end to the war and a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza.\n\nOne of the smallest refugee camps out of eight historic refugee camps in Gaza, Bureij covers an area of 0.5 sq km (0.2 sq miles) and had 46,000 residents registered with the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa) before the war, as reported by the BBC.\n\nThe Buregi refugee camp is just to the south of the Wadi Gaza riverbed and the IDF's \"Central Gaza Strip Corridor.\" It is a section of land that is under the control of Israeli forces and runs east to west from the border with Israel to the Mediterranean Sea, dividing Gaza in two.\n\nAccording to the BBC, the Nuseirat and Maghazi refugee camps are also located near Bureij, while the town of Deir al-Balah is about 5 km (3 miles) to the south-west.\n\nEarlier this year, a ground operation against Hamas fighters was carried out by IDF troops in the camps of central Gaza that lasted several weeks.\n\nOn Wednesday, the IDF stated that the new \"targeted\" operation in Bureij and eastern Deir al-Balah was aimed at dismantling \"terrorist infrastructure located several kilometres away from the border with Israel above and below ground,\" as quoted by the BBC.\n\n\"The activity started with a series of aerial strikes on terror targets, including military compounds, weapons storage facilities, and underground infrastructure,\" the IDF's statement further stated.\n\nLater, the IDF put out a new statement announcing that troops had \"gained operational control\" of eastern Bureij and eastern Deir al-Balah. It added that they had \"eliminated terrorists\" in the areas, destroyed rocket and mortar launchers, and located several tunnel shafts.", "source": {"uri": "news.abplive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "english"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugee_camp", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Refugee camp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureij", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bureij"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bureij"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qatar", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deir_al-Balah", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Deir al-Balah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Deir al-Balah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M\u00e9decins_Sans_Fronti\u00e8res", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airstrike", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Airstrike"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doha", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Doha"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Doha"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_refugees", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian refugees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ismail_Haniyeh", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ismail Haniyeh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_of_Israel", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cairo", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cairo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cairo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortar_(weapon)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mortar (weapon)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_Sea", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mediterranean Sea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wadi", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wadi"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/North_America", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/North America", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Refugees", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Refugees", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Associations", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://feeds.abplive.com/onecms/images/uploaded-images/2024/06/06/0cb30e34fc3156ee5335556e4f9ec6861717640417601566_original.png?impolicy=abp_cdn&imwidth=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9626324", "eventUri": "eng-9626324", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2313725490196078, "wgt": 127, "relevance": 1}

Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? Log in.\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces confirmed the attack on Thursday, saying it was targeting a Hamas compound of 20 to 30 militants that were operating inside the school, NBC News reported.\n\nPalestinian health officials said dozens of refugees were killed, including women and children, while a spokesperson for the IDF said he didn't know of any civilian deaths, NBC News reported.\n\n\"We were asleep here, (and) we suddenly saw rockets falling. I went down holding my child, we were both injured, my relative was martyred in that room,\" local journalist Jaber Abu Daher told CNN, adding that Israel's prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu \"is killing the civilians, he is not killing militants.\"\n\n\"It's innocent people asleep in a UNRWA facility... what did children and elderly do? What did they do to him? He is looking for Hamas people? Go look for them, why are you killing us in schools?\"\n\nThe IDF spokesperson said Israel had postponed the strike twice in an attempt to avoid killing civilians, NBC News reported.\n\nThe strike is the latest Israeli military action that's sparked international outcry as its war against Hamas drags on. Last month, airstrikes in southern Gaza killed at least 45 people, according to Palestinian health authorities.\n\nThose health authorities say tens of thousands have been killed in Israeli bombings since the war began last October, after Hamas launched terror attacks across the border, killing hundreds and taking hostages.\n\nThe overnight airstrike on the school in central Gaza also represents another challenge to US President Joe Biden, who has urged Israel and Hamas to come to a cease-fire deal and pressured the US ally into avoiding civilian casualties.\n\nBiden is facing pressure from his left flank in the US from progressive voters who accuse him of supporting \"genocide\" by backing Israel's campaign.", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider"}, "authors": [{"uri": "grace_eliza_goodwin@businessinsider.com", "name": "Grace Eliza Goodwin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_News", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Insider", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Business Insider"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Refugee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNRWA", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UNRWA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Progressivism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocide", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Genocide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hostage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airstrike", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Airstrike"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://i.insider.com/6661d1361cd3b1779043dff0?width=1200&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9626324", "eventUri": "eng-9626324", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 126, "relevance": 1}

There's no knowledge,\" he said.\n\nDouglas told Herzog that he felt a \"big shock\" about the growing campaign, where student activists have called for a ceasefire and the protection of civilian lives, as well as demanding universities divest from Israeli interests.\n\nHe also recounted his \"deep shock\" during his visit earlier on Sunday to Kibbutz Be'eri in southern Israel which was hit hard in the October 7 attack.\n\n\"It's a very difficult time. You sense the deep shock of this whole experience,\" Douglas said.\n\n\"We're just happy to be here in support of Israel and to share with you the fact that America is definitely your ally as our president has shared with you. I just hope that the latest negotiations will be reached, and the hostages will be back soon.\"\n\nDouglas has been a staunch supporter of Israel, having made several visits over the years and consistently advocated for Israel in his home country, the United States.\n\nHe and his wife Catherine Zeta-Jones hosted Israel's Genesis Prize award ceremony in 2020, after Douglas himself was awarded the prize in 2015 for his contributions to Israel.\n\nPrevious recipients also include former mayor of New York Michael Bloomberg, New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft, US singer and actress Barbara Streisand and filmmaker Steven Spielberg.\n\nShortly after the outbreak of the war on Gaza last October, Douglas reiterated his pro-Israel stance by signing an open letter in support of Israel's military conduct in Gaza.\n\nThe actor joined the likes of celebrities such as Jerry Seinfeld, Amy Schumer and Gal Gadot.\n\nIsrael's indiscriminate war on Gaza has killed at least 36,654 Palestinians, mostly women and children, and wounded more than 83,000. On Tuesday an Israeli airstrike on a school in the Nuseirat refugee camp in Gaza killed at least 40 people.\n\nOther well-known entertainers, from Jennifer Lopez to Drake, have supported the Artists4Ceasefire movement- which has campaigned for a permanent ceasefire in Gaza together with urgent humanitarian aid and the release of Israeli hostages held by Hamas and Palestinian detainees held in Israeli jails.\n\nIsrael has routinely launched airstrikes targeting all parts of Gaza since the start of the war and has carried out massive ground operations in the territory's two largest cities, Gaza City and Khan Younis, that have left them in ruins.\n\nThe Israeli army waged an offensive earlier this year for several weeks in Bureij and several other nearby refugee camps in central Gaza.\n\nTroops pulled out of the Jabalia camp in northern Gaza last Friday after weeks of fighting caused widespread destruction. First responders have recovered the bodies of 360 people, mostly women and children, killed during the attacks.\n\nIsrael sent troops into Rafah in May in what it said was a limited incursion, but those forces are now operating in central parts of Gaza's southernmost city.\n\nMore than one million people have fled Rafah since the start of the operation, with many heading toward central Gaza.",

the vast majority of the displaced forced into the densely crowded southern city of Rafah near the border with Egypt - in what has become Palestine's largest mass exodus since the 1948 Nakba.",

If Hamas has 9,000-12,000 fighters left, then it has some 12-15 battalions left, not just a few.\n\nHamas may have up to 12,000 fighters left, according to US officials who spoke to Reuters. This assessment would mean that Hamas has lost around half its strength in eight months of war.\n\nIsrael's assessments were that Hamas had some 24 battalions at the outset of the war and that most of them were defeated. Israel also believed that around 14,000 Hamas members were killed. This would mean thousands were wounded.\n\nThis is now a numbers game of interpretation. If Hamas has 9,000-12,000 fighters left, then it has some 12-15 battalions left, not just a few.\n\n\"Hamas fighters are now largely avoiding sustained skirmishes with Israeli forces closing in on the southernmost city of Rafah, instead relying on ambushes and improvised bombs to hit targets often behind enemy lines,\" one of the officials said to Reuters.\n\nWhen the numbers don't add up\n\nThe report claimed that Hamas also still has fighters in Rafah. But the numbers game here makes no sense. \"There are about between 7,000-8,000 Hamas fighters reportedly entrenched in Rafah, the last significant bastion of the group's resistance, according to Israeli and US officials,\" the report said.\n\nHow can this be? If Hamas has so many people in Rafah, then it has only 1,000 to control the rest of Gaza\n\nThis requires skepticism. The fact is that Hamas probably moved most of its fighters out of Rafah and moved back to Khan Younis. Yahya Sinwar, and Sinwar's second-in-command Mohammed Deif are probably in Khan Younis, where Sinwar is from.\n\nHamas clearly has thousands of fighters in the central camps area of Gaza as well. In addition, Hamas likely has thousands of affiliates in northern Gaza. Hamas also works with other terror groups in Gaza, and they have hundreds or thousands of members. All of the groups are also recruiting and preparing for a long war of attrition.\n\nThe fact that Hamas fighters approached the Israeli border fence on the morning of June 6 and clashed with the IDF, killing one IDF soldier, shows the group is still capable of planning and executing operations.\n\nThe article claimed Hamas has 500km of tunnels in Gaza. But how can this be known? Some tunnels have been found, but there are probably many that have not been found. The IDF hasn't even operated in parts of Gaza, including parts of Rafah, Mawasi, the central camps, and parts of northern Gaza.\n\nHamas works to gain more control\n\nGaza now boils down to a numbers game. Hamas is recruiting. Hamas is learning, and Hamas is preparing. Whether it has 8,000 or 12,000 fighters may not be that important. It controls most of Gaza. It always returns when the IDF leaves.\n\nThere is no huge breakdown in control, and no one seems to openly oppose Hamas in Gaza. It's believed that many people do oppose Hamas, but it still has a mafia-like grip on the whole of Gaza.\n\nIsrael has preferred to move displaced Gazans into areas that Hamas controls, cementing its grip. Israel doesn't do what the Iraqi army did in Mosul, which is moving the people behind its lines so they can be separated from the terrorists.\n\nTherefore, a continued pool of recruits is always handed to Hamas. So far, the war has been waged for eight months, and the result is to basically keep Hamas in power. Israeli leaders talk about a \"day after\" plan but it doesn't seem to be serious.\n\nTalk of humanitarian \"bubbles\" or handing over control to others has never panned out, and there doesn't seem to be any stomach in the region or in the US and elsewhere to work toward this handover of Gaza to anyone other than Hamas.\n\nThis leaves the tactics in Gaza without a strategy. Whether Hamas has 8,000 or 10,000 fighters, therefore, doesn't matter if, in the end, Gazans expect Hamas to return and Hamas is never replaced. It could be defeated and replaced, but the political will is not yet there in Israel.\n\nEvery day that goes by, Hamas likely becomes strong. It may have reached some kind of nadir at some point, but now it has nowhere to go but up.\n\nAll it has to do is hang on and entrench and carry out a few attacks a day in Gaza. That's how it thrived from the 1990s to 2007. It knows how to do this.", "source": {"uri": "jpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Jerusalem Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_City", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battalion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Battalion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafah", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambush", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ambush"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khan_Yunis", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Khan Yunis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Khan Yunis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammed_Deif", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mohammed Deif"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attrition_warfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Attrition warfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internally_displaced_person", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internally displaced person"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosul", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mosul"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mosul"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Science_Fiction", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Science Fiction", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Left-Handed_Products", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Left-Handed Products", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Experience_Flights", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Experience Flights", "wgt": 6}], "image": "https://images.jpost.com/image/upload/f_auto,fl_lossy/c_fill,g_faces:center,h_407,w_690/602422", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9626324", "eventUri": "eng-9626324", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-06", "textStart": 2065, "textEnd": 2071}], "sentiment": -0.2784313725490196, "wgt": 125, "relevance": 1}

This is nothing in the face of the needs,\" UNRWA said, insisting that at least 600 trucks per day \"of commercial, fuel and humanitarian supplies\" are required to help stave off famine and death in Gaza.\n\n\"Fuel is running short: our teams are standing by to pick it up when the Israeli Authorities give the green light,\" UNRWA said, before highlighting \"horrific\" scenes of devastation from Jabalia Refugee Camp in northern Gaza, home to thousands of displaced people.\n\n\"All eyes are on the proposal to reach an end to this war through a ceasefire, the release of all hostages and substantial and safe flow of urgently needed supplies into Gaza,\" the UNRWA update continued, as the US and 16 other countries reportedly expressed their full support for the ceasefire and hostage release proposal presented by President Biden on 31 May.\n\nAs summer temperatures rise, humanitarians also expressed deep concerns that preventable disease outbreaks could spread more widely.\n\n\"Children in Gaza are living alongside mountains of trash and raw sewage as basic services reach a breaking point amid continued fighting and displacement,\" said Catherine Russell, head of UN Children's Fund, UNICEF, on X.\n\nThe lack of clean drinking water has also fuelled warnings that cholera may strike too, just as healthcare provision remains \"crippled\", UN health agency chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.\n\n\"Intense hostilities have severely crippled health care provision in Rafah where tens of thousands of vulnerable people still remain,\" he said in post on X, noting that the partner medical NGO International Medical Corps had moved its 160-bed field hospital from Al-Mawasi to the west of Rafah to its existing facility in Deir Al Balah.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General noted that the only functioning field hospital in Al-Mawasi was the one run by the International Committee of the Red Cross. In Rafah city, meanwhile, only the United Arab Emirates field hospital currently provides health services \"but is increasingly difficult to reach due to hostilities\", Tedros said.\n\nIn a related development in the occupied West Bank, the UN's top aid official in the Occupied Palestinian Territory (OPT) warned of rising violence, bloodshed and killings, mainly of Palestinians.\n\nMore than 500 Palestinians and 12 Israelis have been killed in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, since 7 October, according to the UN aid coordination office, OCHA.\n\nAbout 280 olive and fig trees and 580 grape vine trees were also vandalized by Israeli settlers in seven communities across the West Bank during the week-long reporting period, the UN office said in a scheduled update.\n\n\"While all eyes are on Gaza, the people of the West Bank must also be supported and protected. The situation here is volatile,\" said UN Humanitarian Coordinator for the OPT Muhannad Hadi. \"We can't wait for the West Bank to become another Gaza.\"\n\nMr. Hadi's comments followed meetings on Wednesday with Palestinian herding and Bedouin communities in the central West Bank. Members and organizations supporting the Palestinian communities reported \"heightened violence, settler activities, access restrictions, demolitions and other coercive policies and practices\", OCHA said in its update.\n\nIn the same report, the UN aid office said that Israeli forces shot and killed two Palestinian men near a military gate located in the Barrier west of Tulkarm city on Tuesdat, \"after the two men reportedly opened fire at them. Their corpses have been withheld by Israeli forces\".", "source": {"uri": "globalissues.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Global Issues"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

In response, Israel has declared a state of war readiness; announced a total blockade of the Gaza Strip, home to 2.3 million Palestinians; and began delivering air strikes on the enclave and certain parts of Lebanon and Syria, followed by a ground operation in the enclave. Clashes are underway in the West Bank as well. In late November 2023, a temporary humanitarian ceasefire was brokered by Egypt and Qatar, which lasted for a week.

Fourteen children were killed, as well as nine women and at least 74 other people were wounded. The weapons used to carry out the attack - according to an Al Jazeera analysis of the fragments left behind - were US-made.\n\nAn inertial measurement unit from the missile, used to aid with precision targeting, was manufactured by Honeywell, an American conglomerate that specialises in the design and delivery of sensors and guidance devices that are used in a variety of military weapons.\n\nAl Jazeera's Sanad verification unit discovered that one of the fragments found in Nuseirat bore the manufacturer and category number HG1930BA06, tracing it back to Honeywell. HG1930 refers to the specific sensor manufactured by the company.\n\nThe same part was found after the Israeli bombing of a Palestinian home in Shujayea, Gaza in 2014. The two pieces, in the most recent and the 2014 bombing, have the same manufacturer part number inscribed on them.\n\n\"We see also other numbers like the MFR, HG 1930 and then BA 06. This is the manufacturer part number that provides more specific details about the component of the missiles,\" Elijah Magnier, an independent military and political analyst, told Al Jazeera. \"Now, if you look at the manufacturer identification ... it is a format used by the aerospace and defence sector in the United States connected to Honeywell.\"\n\n\"Honeywell is known for the supply of IMU in the various military applications, and particularly the guided missiles that it has been providing to the Israeli Air Force since the year 2000.\"\n\nAl Jazeera has reached out to Honeywell for comment, but has yet to receive a response.\n\nIsraeli attacks on UN spaces have become commonplace during Israel's war on Gaza, which has now killed more than 36,000 Palestinians.\n\nThe United States has been criticised for its role in supporting Israel, and particularly its continued supply of weapons.\n\nMajor rights groups have repeatedly accused Israel of violating international law, and Israel is currently facing a genocide case at the International Court of Justice. The International Criminal Court's chief prosecutor has also sought arrest warrants for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defence Minister Yoav Gallant for their actions in Gaza.\n\nIn May, a US government report found possible Israeli violations of international law in Gaza, but stopped short of identifying the violations that would end its continuing military aid. US President Joe Biden has threatened to stop the supply of some offensive weapons to Israel if it continues its Rafah operation, but has not carried out the threat, despite Israel pressing on in the area, which lies in southern Gaza.\n\nCentral Gaza has most recently come under severe Israeli bombardment, which Palestinians have described as similar to the early days of the war.\n\nThe attack on al-Sardi school in Nuseirat is part of that assault.\n\n\"The bombardment came from here,\" said Naim al-Dadah, a survivor of the attack.\n\n\"We were sleeping. The flying metal reached the roof on the other side and all these nets landed over there, on the other side. What happened to us is beyond anyone's imagination.\"\n\nOther witnesses say the attack tore people to pieces. Survivors collected body parts, including those of many children, until the early hours of the morning. Weapon debris was scattered throughout shattered rooms and the blood-stained mattresses. Multiple rooms were targeted, though the building's structure remained intact.\n\nIsrael's Arabic language spokesperson Avichay Adraee, claimed the UN school was targeted because it housed a Hamas command post and fighters involved in the Palestinian group's October 7 attack on Israel, which killed 1,139 people. He also claimed Israel took several steps to minimise the possibility of civilian casualties. The director of Hamas's government media office, Ismail al-Thawabta, rejected Israel's claims.\n\nIn April, the media outlet +972 Magazine reported that Israel uses an artificial intelligence-targeting system called Lavender in its Gaza-bombing campaign. The report quoted Israeli military officials who said that the system generates targets to kill. For low-level Hamas targets, the report said, the army was permitted to kill 15 to 20 civilians. An attack on a more senior Hamas official with the rank of battalion or brigade commander was used to justify the killing of more than 100 civilians.", "source": {"uri": "aljazeera.com", "dataType":

Egyptian officials have said they will not reopen the crossing as long as Israel controls the Gaza side.\n\nEgypt has, however, agreed to send aid trucks from its side of the border to be processed from the Israeli border checkpoint of Kerem Shalom.\n\nAlthough President Joe Biden on Friday outlined a multi-phase cease-fire proposal he said came from Israel, the Israeli Prime Minister's Office said in a statement Saturday that \"Israel's conditions for ending the war have not changed: the destruction of Hamas's military and governing capabilities, the freeing of all hostages and ensuring that Gaza no longer poses a threat to Israel.\"\n\n\"Under the proposal, Israel will continue to insist these conditions are met before a permanent cease-fire is put in place,\" the statement said. \"The notion that Israel will agree to a permanent cease-fire before these conditions are fulfilled is a non-starter.\"\n\nBiden said Friday that Israelis should feel comfortable with a cease-fire because Hamas's capabilities have deteriorated and can no longer repeat the Oct. 7 terrorist attacks.\n\nHamas in a statement reiterated its requirements for a deal. Hamas said it \"affirms its position of readiness to deal positively and constructively with any proposal based on a permanent cease-fire, complete withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, reconstruction, the return of the displaced to all their places of residence, and the completion of a serious prisoner exchange deal.\"\n\nMay 31, 5:15 PM\n\nCongressional leaders formally invite Netanyahu to deliver joint address\n\nThe four leaders of the House of Representatives and Senate formally invited Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to deliver a joint address to Congress.\n\nThe letter sent on Friday by House Speaker Mike Johnson, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell did not provide a date with the address.\n\nThe congressional leaders asked Netanyahu to \"share the Israeli government's vision for defending democracy, combatting terror, and establishing a just and lasting peace in the region.\"\n\n\"The existential challenges we face, including the growing partnership between Iran, Russia, and China, threaten the security, peace, and prosperity of our countries and of free people around the world,\" the letter read.\n\nNetanyahu last addressed Congress in 2015.\n\nMay 31, 4:03 PM\n\nIsrael 'united' in desire to return hostages, Netanyahu responds to Biden\n\nHours after President Joe Biden outlined a three-phase cease-fire deal to end the Israel-Hamas war and said it is time to bring the hostages home, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has responded, saying its government is \"united in the desire to return abductees.\"\n\n\"The Israeli government is united in the desire to return our abductees as soon as possible and is working to achieve this goal,\" Netanyahu's office said in a statement Friday.\n\n\"The Prime Minister authorized the negotiating team to present an outline for achieving this goal, while insisting that the war will not end until all of its goals are achieved, including the return of all our abductees and the elimination of Hamas' military and governmental capabilities,\" Netanyahu's office added.\n\nMay 31, 2:07 PM\n\nBiden pitches three-phase cease-fire deal to end Israel-Hamas war\n\nPresident Joe Biden gave remarks from the White House on Friday, pitching a new plan to draw the war in Gaza to a close.\n\nBiden said the deal had been transmitted to Israel and Hamas, through Qatar.\n\nThe president said the first phase would last for six weeks and include a \"full and complete cease-fire, a withdrawal of Israeli forces from all populated areas of Gaza [and] release of a number of hostages.\" Palestinians would also be able to return to their homes and 600 trucks of humanitarian aid would be delivered to Gaza every day.\n\nThe second phase would include a release of all remaining living hostages and the temporary cease-fire would become a permanent cease-fire with Israel withdrawing all forces from Gaza \"as long as Hamas lives up to its commitments,\" Biden said.\n\nIn phase three, there would be a major reconstruction of Gaza.\n\n\"At this point Hamas no longer is capable of carrying out another Oct. 7, which was one of the Israelis' main objectives in this war, and, quite frankly, a righteous one,\" Biden said.\n\nBiden continued, \"We can't lose this moment.

These types of SDB/GBU-39 weapons can carry a 37 pound warhead, consistent with statements from the IDF about what weapons were used in the strike, Trevor Ball, a former U.S. Army explosive ordinance disposal specialist, said.\n\n\"We used two small rockets, 17 kg warhead, that were fired from aircraft to hit, precisely. We've used this kind of ammunition before,\" Israel Defense Forces spokesman Lt. Col. Nadav Shoshani told ABC News when asked about what weapons were used in the strike.\n\nBall identified a series of numbers beginning with \"81873'' marked on one fragment seen in video reviewed by ABC News. This is the Commercial and Government Entity Code, or CAGE Code, assigned by the U.S. government to aerospace manufacturing company Woodward, based in Colorado, according to U.S. government records.\n\nA second former U.S. military explosive ordinance disposal specialist confirmed the fragments were consistent with the GBU-39, but asked to not be named by ABC News.\n\nAll sales of GBU-39/B Small Diameter Bombs to foreign entities require the State Department's approval, but a U.S. official says Israel may have also procured the munitions through direct commercial sales that don't meet the value threshold -- $25 million in Israel's case -- for congressional review and public notification.\n\nIn the days following the Oct. 7 attack, Israel rushed to back up its stockpiles, including its supply of the small diameter bombs by any available means, the official said. ABC News has not confirmed if the weapons Israel received after Oct. 7 were used in the May 26 Rafah strike.\n\nWhen asked if the bombs used in the strike were provided by the U.S., deputy Pentagon press secretary Sabrina Singh said reporters needed to ask the Israelis during a briefing on May 28.\n\n-ABC News' Chris Looft, Helena Skinner, Britt Clennett, Sohel Uddin, Luis Martinez, Matt Seyler, Shannon Crawford, Ellie Kaufman and Camilla Alcini\n\nMay 29, 3:50 PM\n\nWorld Central Kitchen suspends operations in Rafah over safety\n\nWorld Central Kitchen has suspended its humanitarian efforts in Rafah due to safety concerns.

The Israeli military said that Hamas militants were operating from within the school.\n\nIt was the latest instance of mass casualties among Palestinians trying to find refuge as Israel expands its offensives in the Gaza Strip. A day earlier, the military announced a new ground and air assault in central Gaza, pursuing Hamas militants it says have regrouped there. Troops repeatedly have swept back into sections of the Gaza Strip they have previously invaded, underscoring the resilience of the militant group despite Israel's nearly eight-month onslaught in the territory.\n\nWitnesses and hospital officials said the predawn strike hit the al-Sardi School, run by the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees known by the acronym UNRWA. The school was filled with Palestinians who had fled Israeli offensives and bombardment in northern Gaza, they said.\n\nAyman Rashed, a man displaced from Gaza City who was sheltering at the school, said the missiles hit classrooms on the second and third floor where families were sheltering. He said he helped carry out five dead, including an old man and two children, one with his head shattered open. \"It was dark, with no electricity, and we struggled to get out the victims,\" Rashed said.\n\nCasualties from school strike arrived at the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in nearby Deir al-Balah, which had already been overwhelmed by a stream of constant ambulances since the central Gaza incursion began 24 hours earlier, said Omar al-Derawi, a photographer working for the hospital. Videos circulating online appeared to show several wounded people being treated on the floor of the hospital, a common scene in Gaza's overwhelmed medical wards. Electricity in much of the hospital is out because staff are rationing fuel supplies for the generator.\n\nIsraeli settlers in the West Bank were hit with international sanctions. It only emboldened them\n\nSOUTH HEBRON HILLS, West Bank (AP) -- For weeks after being sanctioned by the United States, Yinon Levi struggled to pay the bills, living at his farming outpost atop a hill in the occupied West Bank. But the Israeli settler's problems didn't last.\n\nWhen the banks froze his accounts, his community raised thousands of dollars for him, and Israel's finance minister vowed to intervene on sanctioned settlers' behalf. Two months after sanctions were issued, Levi was granted access to his money.\n\n\"America thought it would weaken us, and in the end, they made us stronger,\" Levi, 31, told The Associated Press from his farm in the South Hebron Hills -- one of dozens of unauthorized settlement outposts dotting the West Bank.\n\nLevi is among 13 hard-line Israeli settlers -- as well as two affiliated outposts and four groups -- targeted by international sanctions over accusations of attacks and harassment against Palestinians in the West Bank. The measures are meant as a deterrent, and they expose people to asset freezes and travel and visa bans.\n\nBut the measures have had minimal impact, instead emboldening settlers as attacks and land-grabs escalate, according to Palestinians in the West Bank, local rights groups and sanctioned Israelis who spoke to AP.\n\nThe sun rises over Normandy's beaches on D-Day's 80th anniversary\n\nUTAH BEACH, France (AP) -- As the sun sets on the D-Day generation, it rose again over Normandy beaches where soldiers fought and died exactly 80 years ago Thursday, kicking off intense anniversary commemorations against the backdrop of renewed war in Europe, in Ukraine.\n\nEver-dwindling numbers of World War II veterans who have pilgrimaged back to France, and Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine that has dashed hopes that lives and cities wouldn't again be laid to waste in Europe, are making the poignant anniversary of the June 6, 1944, Allied landings even more so 80 years on.\n\nAs now-centenarian veterans revisit old memories and fallen comrades buried in Normandy graves, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's presence at D-Day commemorations with world leaders who are supporting Ukraine's fight against Russia's invasion -- including United States President Joe Biden -- will inevitably fuse together World War II's awful past with the fraught present on Thursday.\n\nThe break of dawn almost eight decades exactly after Allied troops waded ashore under hails of gunfire on five code-named beaches -- Utah, Omaha, Gold, Juno and Sword -- kicked off a day of remembrance by Allied nations now standing together again behind Ukraine -- and with World War II ally Russia not invited by host France. It cited Russia's \"war of aggression against Ukraine that has intensified in recent weeks\" for the snub.\n\nWith the dead and wounded on both sides in Ukraine estimated in the hundreds of thousands, commemorations for the more than 4,400 Allied dead on D-Day and many tens of thousands more, including French civilians, killed in the ensuing Battle of Normandy are tinged with concerns that World War II lessons are being lost.\n\nJurors in Hunter Biden's trial hear from the clerk who sold him the gun at the center of the case\n\nWILMINGTON, Del. (AP) -- Jurors in Hunter Biden's criminal trial got a look at the .38 caliber Colt revolver he bought back in October 2018. They saw Form 4473, the firearms transaction record at the center of the case. And they're hearing testimony from the former store clerk who watched as the president's son checked off \"no\" to the question of whether he was \"an unlawful user of or addicted to\" marijuana, stimulants, narcotics or any other controlled substance.\n\nFederal prosecutors have argued Hunter Biden was in the throes of a heavy crack addiction when he bought the gun, and they've accused him of lying on the form. He's been charged with three felonies: lying to a federally licensed gun dealer, making a false claim on the application by saying he was not a drug user and illegally having the gun for 11 days.\n\nHunter Biden has pleaded not guilty and said the Justice Department is bending to political pressure from Republicans and he is being wrongly targeted.\n\nGordon Cleveland, the former clerk at StarQuest Shooters & Survival Supply, told jurors he walked Hunter Biden through a few options before he settled on the $900 gun and he watched Biden sign the form, which includes a warning about the consequences of submitting false information.\n\n\"Everything he bought, he ultimately decided on,\" he told jurors.\n\nElection certification disputes in a handful of states spark concerns over presidential contest\n\nIn Michigan's Upper Peninsula, two Republican members of a county canvassing board last month refused to sign off on the results of an election that led to the recall of three GOP members of the county commission. They did so only after state officials warned them it was their legal duty to record the final vote tally.\n\nIn Georgia's Fulton County, which includes the Democratic-voting city of Atlanta, a group run by members of former President Donald Trump's administration last week sued so a Republican member of the local elections board could refuse to certify the results of the primary election.\n\nAnd in Arizona, GOP lawmakers sued to reverse the state's top Democratic officials' requirement that local boards automatically validate their election results.\n\nThe past four years have been filled with battles over all sorts of election arcana, including one that had long been regarded as an administrative afterthought -- little-known state and local boards certifying the results. With the presidential election looming in November, attorneys are gearing up for yet more fights over election certification, especially in the swing states where the victory margins are expected to be tight. Even if those efforts ultimately fail, election officials worry they'll become a vehicle for promoting bogus election claims.\n\nTrump and his allies have tried to use the tactic to stop election results from being made final if they lose. In 2020, two Republicans on Michigan's state board of canvassers, which must certify ballot totals before state officials can declare a winner, briefly balked at signing off before one relented and became the decisive vote. Trump had cheered the delay as part of his push to overturn his loss that ultimately culminated in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol.\n\nNetherlands kicks off 4 days of European Union elections across 27 nations\n\nTHE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) -- Polls opened in the Netherlands on Thursday to kick off four days of voting in European Union parliamentary elections across the 27 member states that are expected to deliver gains for the hard right.\n\nGeert Wilders, of the far-right Party for Freedom, or PVV, was among the first senior politicians to cast his ballot. Having sent shockwaves around Europe six months ago by becoming the biggest party in the Dutch national parliament, he now wants to build on that popularity and set the tone for much of the bloc, with calls to claw powers back to national capitals and away from the EU so member states have more autonomy on issues such as migration.\n\nParadoxically, like many hard right parties across the bloc, he wants to get more powers in the European parliament, so he can weaken the EU institutions from within.\n\n\"You also need to have a strong presence in the European Parliament and make sure that, if necessary, we will be able to change the European guidelines in order to be in charge of our own immigration policy and asylum policy,\" Wilders said after voting in The Hague.\n\nThat is why he was immediately calling for a broad alliance of hard right parties to break up the traditional coalition of Christian Democrats, Socialists, pro-business Liberals and Greens.\n\nSpain applies to join South Africa's case at top UN court accusing Israel of genocide\n\nBARCELONA, Spain (AP) -- Spain will ask a United Nations court for permission to join South Africa's case accusing Israel of genocide in Gaza, its foreign minister announced Thursday.\n\nSpain is the first European country to take the step after South Africa filed its case with the International Court of Justice late last year. It alleged that Israel was breaching the genocide convention in its military assault that has laid waste to large swaths of Gaza.\n\nMexico, Colombia, Nicaragua, Libya and the Palestinians have already requested to join the case currently being heard at the court in The Hague, Netherlands.\n\nThe court has ordered Israel to immediately halt its military offensive in the southern Gaza city of Rafah but stopped short of ordering a cease-fire for the enclave. Israel has not complied.\n\n\"We take the decision because of the ongoing military operation in Gaza,\" Spanish Foreign Minister Jos\u00e9 Manuel Albares said in Madrid. \"We want peace to return to Gaza and the Middle East, and for that to happen we must all support the court.\"\n\nTornado hits Michigan without warning, killing toddler, while twister in Maryland injures 5\n\nLIVONIA, Mich. (AP) -- A toddler was killed and his mother was injured when a tornado struck suburban Detroit without warning, while five people were injured when a tornado in Maryland collapsed structures and trapped people inside.\n\nOfficials in Livonia, Michigan, said the tornado tore through several neighborhoods on Wednesday afternoon and developed so quickly that there was no advance notice from the National Weather Service or others that would have normally led to the activation of warning sirens.\n\nThe storm uprooted a massive tree that fell on one family's house and came through the roof, landing on a bed where a woman and her 2-year-old were sleeping, officials said in a post on the city's website. Crews worked for nearly an hour to remove the roof and parts of the tree and then lift the tree to get the victims out.\n\nThe toddler was pronounced dead at the scene, officials said. The mother was transported to a local hospital in critical condition.\n\nA 2-week-old sibling who was in a crib in a separate room was not injured but taken to a hospital for an evaluation, Livonia Fire Department Chief Robert Jennison told WDIV-TV.\n\nMigrants are rattled and unsure as deportations begin under new rule halting asylum\n\nDULZURA, Calif. (AP) -- Abigail Castillo was about to cross the U.S. border illegally when she heard President Joe Biden was halting asylum. She continued anyway, walking hours through the mountains east of San Diego with her toddler son, hoping it wasn't too late.\n\n\"I heard that they were going to do it or were about to do it,\" Castillo, 35, said Wednesday as she and her son were escorted to a Border Patrol van with about two dozen others from Brazil, Ecuador and her village in the southern Mexican state of Oaxaca, which she said she left because it was gripped by violence.\n\nThey had missed the deadline, and were now subject to the new deportation rule.\n\nHer sense of uncertainty prevailed among many migrants after Biden invoked presidential powers to stop asylum processing when arrests for illegal crossings top 2,500 in a day. The measure took effect at 12:01 a.m. EDT on Wednesday because that threshold was met.\n\nTwo senior Homeland Security Department officials confirmed the first deportations under the new rule took place Wednesday, though they did not say how many were deported. The officials briefed reporters on condition their names not be used in keeping with regulations.\n\nA realistic way to protect kids from social media? Find a middle ground\n\nAhmed Othman isn't on TikTok and doesn't want to be.\n\nHe and his younger sister got iPhones when they were in eighth and seventh grade respectively, but with no social media, just iMessage. Their parents, who are both computer scientists, spent the next year teaching them about social media, bombarding them with studies about its effects on teen mental health.\n\n\"They really tried to emphasize social media is a tool, but can also be like your worst enemy if you so make it,\" Othman said.\n\nNow 17, Othman credits his parents' deep involvement for what he calls a \"healthy relationship\" with his phone. That includes staying away from TikTok.\n\n\"The algorithm is so potent that I feel like, you know, TikTok might not benefit me,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "santamariatimes.com", "dataType":

(Photo by Rizek Abdeljawad/Xinhua)\n\nGAZA, June 5 (Xinhua) -- At least 75 Palestinians were killed in Israeli overnight attacks on several areas in the central Gaza Strip, Palestinian sources said on Wednesday.\n\nSecurity sources told Xinhua that Israeli aircraft and artillery bombed several locations overnight in the Al-Bureij and Al-Maghazi refugee camps and east of Deir al-Balah in central Gaza.\n\nThe sources said violent air and artillery strikes continued through the night and into the morning, targeting residential homes and agricultural lands.\n\nMedical sources confirmed that the Israeli bombing resulted in the deaths of 75 Palestinians, including children and women, and injured dozens more.\n\nThe escalation followed an Israeli air and ground assault in central Gaza's Al-Bureij camp. Israeli military spokesperson Avichay Adraee stated on Tuesday that Israeli fighter jets targeted Hamas positions in the refugee camp, with ground forces simultaneously operating in the area based on intelligence.\n\nIsrael has been conducting a large-scale offensive against Hamas in Gaza in retaliation for the group's assault on southern Israel last October, which resulted in around 1,200 deaths and over 200 hostages taken into Gaza. The Israeli attacks have killed more than 36,000 Palestinians and injured about 83,000 others in the enclave, according to local health authorities.\n\nSmoke rises following Israeli airstrikes in the Al-Bureij and Al-Maghazi refugee camps in central Gaza Strip, on June 5, 2024.

AP\n\nThe displaced Palestinians were seen walking tens of kilometres on foot to escape the ongoing Israeli bombing and perhaps save their children and women from what they described as \"hell.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, the Israeli army announced its ground forces had begun a delicate operation in the Bureij refugee camp.\n\nThe raids coincided with ground forces carrying out a precise operation under intelligence guidance in Bureij in the central Gaza Strip, the occupation army's spokesman said in a statement on his account on the \"X\" platform.\n\nThe Israeli army continued to launch air and ground attacks throughout the night on the two camps, which were already densely populated after having become shelters for hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians.\n\nAt least 75 Palestinians were killed, while dozens were injured and taken to Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in the city of Deir Al-Balah in the central Gaza Strip, according to a statement by the Palestinian health ministry.\n\nThe ministry explained that the only hospital in Deir Al-Balah cannot accommodate \"such a large number of victims, especially in light of the lack of fuel necessary to operate electrical generators and transport beds inside the hospital as well as the medical staff needed to treat the victims.\"\n\nThe bodies of the dead were piled up in the hospital's courtyard as hundreds of their relatives arrived to pay their respects.\n\nAn elderly man, Abu Ahmed, carried the body of his grandson who was killed as a result of an Israeli raid that targeted their house in the Bureij camp, to be buried in one of the cemeteries near the hospital.\n\n\"What was the fault of these children that they were killed in cold blood? My grandson was sleeping when the house was targeted. I do not know if he was dreaming when he was killed or if he was afraid of death and he died,\" Abu Ahmed told the DPA sadly.\n\nAnother person, Jalal Al-Hato, stood in shock in front of the several corpses piled up in the hospital's yard, as he must uncover their faces to perhaps recognize his sons who were killed in an Israeli raid that targeted their neighbours' house in the Bureij camp in the middle of the Gaza Strip.\n\n\"Where is the world regarding this indiscriminate killing and massive destruction that was imposed on us without any fault? We are Muslims and Arabs. Why do you not save our children from death? Why all this silence regarding these crimes?\" Al-Hato told DPA.\n\nSince the early hours of the morning, the two camps have witnessed a massive displacement of residents, especially in areas witnessing intense bombardment and ground entry by Israeli forces.\n\nAfter two hours of walking, Hanadi Al-Banna, a displaced Palestinian, was able to reach the west of the Nuseirat camp and take refuge in the tent of one of her relatives to stay there until the end of the military operation in the Bureij camp.\n\n\"We are very tired of this war ... We no longer have any energy to survive or even continue life.

According to their statement, out of the 40 people confirmed martyred in the attack on the UN-run school there, 14 were children and nine were women.\n\nOut of 74 wounded in the attack, 23 are children and 18 are women, it added.\n\nHealth Ministry in the besieged enclave said at least 36,654 people have been martyred and 83,309 wounded in the Israeli brutal aggression on Gaza since October 7.\n\nOf them, 68 Palestinians were martyred and 235 wounded in the past 24 hours, the ministry added.\n\nResistance Operations\n\nMeanwhile, the Palestinian resistance groups kept up their operations against the Israeli occupation, with Reuters news agency citing an American official as saying that Hamas resistance movement \"has shown the ability to re-emerge in areas that Israel believed were free of militants.\"\n\nHamas' Al-Qassam Brigades announced on Thursday that its fighters targeted two \"D9\" Zionist bulldozers with two \"Al-Yassin 105\" shells, east of the city of Deir Al-Balah in central Gaza.\n\nAl-Qassam declared that its fighters managed to infiltrate the fence near the southern city of Rafah and attacked an IOF site located in the area.\n\nAlso in Rafah, Al-Qassam said that resistance fighters detonated a tunnel shaft west of the city, killing or injuring at least 5 Israeli soldiers.\n\nThe Nasser Salah Al-Din Brigades and the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades bombed the Kissufim military site east of the Central Governorate with 107 missiles. The video below shows the strike.\n\nFor its part, Abu Ali Mustafa Brigades published scenes from the joint operation with the Islamic Jihad's Al-Quds Brigades in which the resistance fighters shelled of Israeli occupation forces in \"Netzarim\" axis.\n\nLatest on Ceasefire Deal\n\nOn the other hand, the White House has put out a joint statement regarding the ceasefire deal outlined by US President Biden.\n\nThe statement, attributed to the leaders of the United States, Argentina, Austria, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, Colombia, Denmark, France, Germany, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Serbia, Spain, Thailand and the United Kingdom, said the countries' leaders \"fully support the movement towards a ceasefire and hostage release deal now on the table and as outlined by President Biden on May 31, 2024\".\n\nThe statement claimed that \"Israel is ready to move forward with the agreement\" and called on Hamas to accept it and begin the process of releasing captives.\n\nThe proposal, which calls for a six-week ceasefire in phase one before a transition to a permanent ceasefire, has drawn mixed messages from Israeli officials, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu claiming he is still committed to \"eliminating\" Hamas before ending the war.\n\nFor his part, senior Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri has told Reuters that while the resistance group \"appreciates Biden's ideas\", the current ceasefire proposal does not provide a firm enough commitment that the war will end.\n\n\"The Israeli documents speak of open-ended negotiation with no deadline, and it speaks of a stage during which the occupation regains its hostages and resumes the war. We had told the mediators that such a paper wasn't acceptable to us,\" said Abu Zuhri.\n\n\"The (US) document...has no mention of ending the aggression or the withdrawal,\" he added.\n\nSource:

Will Israel be cut off financially and diplomatically?\n\n\"So far in the general election we have had platitudes from the main parties, but what we require are policy commitments to show the UK will meet its obligations under international law.\"\n\nMr Jamal said campaigners will continue to hold politicians to account -- both through the national demonstration in London tomorrow and through the course of the general election.\n\nPeace and Justice Project founder Jeremy Corbyn, who is defending his Islington North seat as an independent MP, said he is \"appalled by the ongoing loss of life,\" telling the Star: \"Another day, another war crime.\n\n\"What kind of world are we living in when this kind of horror becomes part of our weekly or even daily routine?\n\n\"How have we allowed these atrocities to become so normalised?\n\n\"A school is a place of learning, growth and joy. In Gaza, they have been turned into a place of death, trauma and grief.\"\n\nMr Corbyn vowed to continue to speak up for a ceasefire, the end to arms sales to Israel and \"the only path to a just and lasting peace: the end to the occupation of Palestine.\"\n\nBrendan O'Hara, SNP MP and candidate for Argyll, Bute and South Lochaber, called the strike \"the latest horrific attack resulting in the pointless death of yet more innocent civilians.\"\n\nHe said: \"The SNP has been Westminster's moral compass throughout the conflict in Gaza -- while the Tories and Labour have failed to add their voice to international efforts to end bloodshed and save innocent lives.\"\n\nThe party has called for the release of hostages, an end to arms sales, an immediate ceasefire and the recognition of a Palestinian state \"to ensure a lasting peace.\"\n\nCharity Islamic Relief said that international governments and world leaders \"must use all their influence and leverage to demand an end to these attacks and an immediate ceasefire,\" it said in a statement.\n\nOutside of Britain, Ireland's Sinn Fein leader Mary Lou McDonald said the attack is \"further horrifying proof that nowhere is safe in Gaza.\"\n\nMs McDonald reiterated her call for an immediate ceasefire, an end to the slaughter, and called on the government to lead an urgent push for sanctions against Israel.\n\n\"Israel must be held to account for its war crimes and brutalisation of the Palestinian people,\" she said.\n\n\"Recognising the state of Palestine was an important step. The Irish government must now lead in the push for sanctions that increase pressure for a ceasefire and an end to the slaughter.\"\n\nThe US-based Institute for Middle East Understanding said the strike was \"deliberate\" and one that US President Joe Biden \"could have stopped.\"\n\nIt said: \"Nowhere is safe [in Gaza] because Israel bombs and destroys the places it forces Palestinians to flee to for shelter.\n\n\"Enough, Potus. To end this genocide, end US weapons to Israel.\"\n\nThe International Centre for Justice for Palestinians said that \"time and time again, Israel shows its willingness to target schools, refugee camps and UN agencies.\"\n\nAnd Belgian foreign minister Hadja Lahbib said that the \"devastating\" air-strike \"is an appalling and unacceptable act of violence.\"\n\nAyman Rashed, a man displaced from Gaza City who was sheltering at the al-Sardi School, said the missiles hit classrooms on the second and third floors where families were sheltering.\n\nHe said he helped carry out five dead, including an old man and two children, one with his head shattered open.\n\n\"It was dark, with no electricity, and we struggled to get out the victims,\" Mr Rashed said.\n\nUNRWA commissioner-general Phillippe Lazzarini said that 6,000 people were sheltering in the school when it was hit without prior warning.\n\nHe said the body was unable to verify claims that armed groups were inside.\n\nDead and wounded people were taken to the al-Aqsa Martyrs' Hospital, which has been overwhelmed by the eight-month-long attack.\n\nThe hospital recorded at least 33 people dead, including 14 children and nine women.\n\nFootage showed bodies wrapped in blankets or plastic bags being laid out in lines in the courtyard of the hospital.\n\nMohammed al-Kareem, a displaced Palestinian sheltering near the hospital, said he saw people searching for their loved ones among bodies, and that one woman kept asking medical workers to open the wraps on the bodies to see if her son was inside.", "source":

Hamas described its attack as a response to the aggressive actions of Israeli authorities against the Al-Aqsa Mosque on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem's Old City. In response, Israel has declared a state of war readiness; announced a total blockade of the Gaza Strip, home to 2.3 million Palestinians; and began delivering air strikes on the enclave and certain parts of Lebanon and Syria, followed by a ground operation in the enclave. Clashes are underway in the West Bank as well. In late November 2023, a temporary humanitarian ceasefire was brokered by Egypt and Qatar, which lasted for a week.

"GAZA: Israel's military pounded central Gaza with heavy air strikes on Wednesday as US, Qatari and Egyptian mediators planned to resume talks on a truce and captives release deal.\n\nTensions were high in annexed east Al Quds where thousands of police were deployed to guard Israel's annual \"flag march\" that has sparked clashes between Jews and Arabs in previous years.\n\nThe bloodiest ever Gaza war, sparked by October 7 attack on southern Israel, raged on unabated with jets bombing targets overnight and Palestinian officials reporting yet more deaths.\n\nUrban combat and shelling rocked Gaza's southern city of Rafah near the Egyptian border, the last area hit by the Israeli ground invasion launched in northern Gaza in late October.\n\nBut fighting has also flared again in central areas, where the army said \"troops have started targeted operational activity in the areas of Bureij and eastern Deir al-Balah, both above and below ground\".\n\n\"The activity started with a series of air strikes on targets, including compounds, weapons storage facilities and underground infrastructure,\" it said.\n\nBombardment of central Gaza killed 11 people near the Al-Maghazi camp and two near Deir al-Balah, said witnesses and Palestinian civil defence and hospital officials.\n\nFamilies rushed the wounded, including children, to hospitals in the area, where reporters said civilians were once more packing their belongings on pickup trucks and onto wheelchairs to flee.\n\nAlmost eight months into the war, global outrage has spiralled over the soaring death toll and the destruction in Gaza, where UN data suggests more than half of all buildings are destroyed or damaged.\n\nUS President Joe Biden last Friday outlined what he called a three-phase Israeli plan that would halt the fighting for six weeks while captives are exchanged for Palestinian prisoners and aid is stepped up.\n\nG7 powers and Arab states have backed the proposal, although sticking points remain -- Hamas insists on a permanent truce and full Israeli withdrawal, demands that Israel has flatly rejected.\n\nBrett McGurk, Biden's top Middle East adviser, was also headed to Qatar, according to news site Axios which quoted an administration source as talking of a \"full-court press... to get a breakthrough\".\n\nEgypt's state-linked Al-Qahera News said an \"Egyptian security delegation will meet with its Qatari and US counterparts in Doha on Wednesday to discuss the mechanism of restoring the truce talks\".\n\nQatar said on Tuesday it had yet to see statements from either side \"that give us a lot of confidence\", but that Doha was \"working with both sides on proposals on the table\". -- AFP", "source": {"uri": "omanobserver.om", "dataType": "news", "title": "Oman Observer"}, "authors": [],

The target was two senior Hamas commanders, Yassin Rabia and Khaled Nagar. Shortly after the car was hit, a fire broke out in a tent a kilometer-and-a-half away, killing 45 civilians. The world promptly blamed Israel for that fire, charging it with having deliberately hit the tent. More on what Israel was accused of, and what actually happened, can be found here: \"Israeli Military Suspects Hamas Munitions Caused Deadly Rafah Fire,\" by Joshua Klein, Breitbart, May 28, 2024:\n\nThe deadly fire that broke out in Rafah following an Israeli airstrike outside the designated \"humanitarian zone\" Sunday night may have been caused by the secondary detonation of Hamas munitions located near a civilian safe zone, according to the Israeli military.\n\nThe airstrike, which eliminated several senior Hamas commanders, has been the subject of international condemnation due to the apparent civilian casualties. However, Israel said it prepared carefully and followed international law in launching a precision strike that was not anticipated to cause wider damage.\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) is currently investigating the possibility that the deadly fire, which broke out after the airstrike at a complex housing displaced Gazans in Rafah, was caused by the secondary detonation of Hamas munitions or other flammable material stored near the target of a precise airstrike against senior Hamas terrorists, according to IDF Spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, who provided further details about the incident in an English-language press conference on Tuesday.\n\nHagari explained that the IDF conducted a targeted strike on senior Hamas terrorists in Rafah based on precise intelligence, which unintentionally ignited a fire that killed 45 civilians. He emphasized that the strike was away from the humanitarian zone, using minimal explosives, and the fire's cause is under investigation, with suspicions that nearby stored Hamas weapons may have detonated.\n\n\"Signals intelligence intercepted some phone calls that reinforce this concern, raising the possibility that weapons stored in a nearby compound caught fire,\" he said before playing a recorded call in which Gazans discuss the explosion.\n\nHagari assured a thorough and transparent investigation into the incident, vowing it would be \"swift, comprehensive, and transparent.\"\n\nThe IDF reportedly fired two 17-kilogram munitions at senior Hamas terrorists in Rafah on Sunday night, which were too small to ignite a fire on their own....\n\nThese 17-kilogram munitions are the smallest in Israel's armory, and the IDF has pointed out that they could not ignite a fire on their own. There must have been a secondary explosion of Hamas weapons, stored close to the IDF target.\n\n\"Contrary to reports, we conducted the strike outside the area that we designated as a humanitarian area and called civilians to evacuate to. Our strike was over a kilometer and a half away from the al-Mawasi humanitarian area, what we call the safer zone,\" Hagari said.\n\nHighlighting the measures taken to avoid civilian harm, he detailed the steps taken before the strike, including \"aerial surveillance, using specific munitions to minimize collateral damage, delaying the attack to further assess the expected civilian presence, and other means.\"\n\nBefore the airstrike on the car, the IDF carefully surveyed the area to make sure there were no civilians in the immediate area, used its smallest munitions so as to minimize collateral damage, and delayed the attack to make doubly sure there would be no civilians in the area at the time of the airstrike.\n\nHe also noted that the military is \"looking into all possibilities, including the option that weapons stored in a compound next to our target, which we did not know of, may have ignited as a result of the strike.\"...\n\nThis is the most likely scenario. The IDF had not known that Hamas had stored weapons in a compound next to its target. When that target was hit, flaming shrapnel from that first explosion might have hit the weapons stored in the compound, setting some aflame, which in turn could have set on fire a tent containing civilians, who then perished.\n\nThe IDF expressed regret for \"any harm to noncombatants during the war\" and stated the airstrike targeted legitimate sites based on precise intelligence indicating Hamas's use of the area....\n\nHigh civilian deaths were attributed to Hamas commanders operating near a camp for displaced Palestinians close to a United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) facility, according to reports.\n\nSome Israeli media claimed Hamas exploited Western sensitivities to Rafah casualties, especially after the Biden administration's opposition to Israeli actions and the International Court of Justice's (ICJ) ruling against Israeli attacks in the area....\n\nBiden originally withheld the shipment of some 500- and 2000-bombs and artillery shells to Israel in order to prevent the IDF from entering the center of Rafah \"without a credible plan\" for ensuring the safety of civilians in the city. The IDF has continued to push into Rafah without, apparently, presenting that \"credible plan.\" But the Bidenites have not announced any new holdups of American weapons to Israel, weapons that the IDF needs to successfully prosecute the war. Perhaps the Bidenites have come round to understanding just how essential to Israel's war aims has the dismantling of the intact Hamas battalions become, and decided to finesse the matter.\n\nMosab Hassan Yousef has been warning the West that Hamas does not take just Israel as its target. Its real aim is, like that of ISIS, to spread Islam across the globe, until Islam everywhere dominates, and Muslims rule, everywhere. He keeps warning the West that Muslim aggression will only increase If Israel is prevented from attacking the four intact Hamas battalions known to remain in Rafah; the failure of the IDF to dismantle those remaining Hamas forces would give the terror group a boost; it could plausibly claim that it had remained standing despite the IDF's best efforts to destroy it and so, in a sense, it had \"won\" the war; it could now regroup in order to attack Israel, as it has promised to do, \"again and again.\"\n\nAnd that is why, no matter what the ICJ, or the ICC, or the UNGA, or the EU, or the Bidenites demand, Israel will never agree to halt its offensive in Rafah.\n\nWhen the IDF has completed its investigation of the entire incident, it will no doubt show exactly the sequence of events, from the initial airstrike to the secondary explosion of Hamas weapons stored nearby that, in turn, caused the fire at the tent where 45 civilians died. That won't stop the Jewish state from continuing to be blamed for the tent fire by the legions of Israel-haters. But at least the record -- for those whose minds are not already made up -- will have been set straight.", "source": {"uri": "frontpagemag.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FrontPage Magazine"},

These homes have been repurposed into storage centers for an array of weaponry, including AK-47s, anti-tank missile launchers, RPGs, bombs, mortars, IEDs and sniper rifles.\n\nWhether in southern Gazan districts like Rafah, where the 162 Division is currently operating, in northern Gaza, where the 98 Division is operating (after spending four months fighting in Khan Yunis, in southern Gaza), or central Gaza, where the 99 Division is operating, soldiers and officers are finding incredibly large numbers of homes prepped with weapons.\n\nThis is so terrorists can walk the streets in civilian clothes, unarmed, reducing chances of being detected by the IDF, arrive at a weapons pick-up center, and begin rapidly attacking from there.\n\nThis tactic not only endangers Israeli soldiers but also places civilians at significant risk.\n\nAccording to a recent report by Ynet, large explosives have been hidden within walls, and terrorists also broke down walls between crowded homes to create passages in ways that are reminiscent of how terrorists operated in Nablus during the IDF's \"Operation Defensive Shield\" in 2002.\n\nThe IDF's divisions are learning from their own experience and from one another to deal with this trend as the ground maneuver continues.\n\nHouse by house\n\nThe concealed weapons and underground networks mean the IDF must dismantle this hidden infrastructure to avoid allowing Hamas to regroup and rearm quickly, as it had already begun to do in Jabalia before the IDF returned to northern Gaza in recent weeks.\n\nThe IDF's methodical approach involves clearing each area house by house, ensuring that all weapons are found and neutralized before moving on. The homes of terrorist commanders are often destroyed.\n\nThe presence of weapons in civilian homes highlights the involvement of Gazan civilians in various capacities within Hamas's war machine. While some civilians may be coerced or have little choice due to the Islamists' ability to threaten them, others are willingly involved in Hamas attacks. This complicates the humanitarian situation, as distinguishing between combatants and noncombatants becomes difficult in such cases.\n\nHundreds of kilometers of tunnels running under these civilian areas are part of the same operational logic of turning Gaza into one massive shield for Hamas.\n\nDespite the IDF's efforts to minimize civilian casualties, including through the successful mass evacuation of battle zones, the presence of weapons in homes increases the risk of collateral damage. Hamas's tactic of embedding its military infrastructure within civilian areas serves to invite international condemnation of Israel's actions, even as the IDF strives -- more than any Western military -- to conduct its operations within the bounds of international law.\n\nThroughout the years that Hamas turned homes, hospitals, mosques, schools, United Nations installations and more into its bases, its planners did not likely believe that the IDF would one day arrive and take on this unprecedented challenge.\n\nAs such, at least at the operational level, this entrenchment approach has failed in its goal of preventing the IDF from accessing Hamas's core zones of operations.", "source": {"uri": "tjpnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Texas Jewish Post"}, "authors": [{"uri":

He said he lost his father in the strike.\n\n\"What did we do? There are no armed people in the school. The ones there are children, playing. We play together... Why did they bomb us?\" he said in the video obtained by Reuters.\n\nIn images of the dead laid out at the hospital surrounded by wailing mourners, bodies were mostly wrapped in shrouds or carpets, making it impossible to determine from the video if they included non-combatants.\n\nThe United States issued a joint statement with other countries calling on Israel and Hamas to make whatever compromises were necessary to finalise a deal after eight months of war in the Gaza Strip.\n\nIsmail Al-Thawabta, the director of the Hamas-run government media office, rejected Israel's assertion that the U.N. school in Nuseirat, in central Gaza, had hidden a Hamas command post.\n\n\"The occupation uses ... false fabricated stories to justify the brutal crime it conducted against dozens of displaced people,\" Thawabta told Reuters.\n\nIsrael's military said its fighter jets had carried out a \"precise strike\", and circulated satellite photos highlighting two parts of a building where it said the fighters were based.\n\n\"We're very confident in the intelligence,\" military spokesperson Lt Col. Peter Lerner said, accusing Hamas and Islamic Jihad fighters of deliberately using U.N. facilities as operational bases.\n\nHe said 20-30 fighters were located in the compound, and many of them had been killed, but had no precise details as intelligence assessments were being carried out. \"I'm not aware of any civilian casualties and I'd be very, very cautious of accepting anything that Hamas puts out,\" he said.\n\nAs people at the school cleared rubble from bloodstained classrooms, survivor Huda Abu Dhaher described waking up to the sound of rockets.\n\n\"People's remains were scattered inside the yard and outside. The gas canister exploded,\" she told Reuters.\n\n\"My nephew was martyred (killed), he lost his leg and arm, he was a 10-year-old ... This woman's leg got a fragment in it, her son bled from his mouth and leg.\"\n\nThe school, run by the U.N. Palestinian refugee agency (UNRWA), was sheltering 6,000 displaced people at the time, UNRWA chief Philippe Lazzarini said.\n\n\"At least 35 people were killed and many more injured,\" he wrote on X. \"Claims that armed groups may have been inside the shelter are shocking. We are however unable to verify these claims. Attacking, targeting or using UN buildings for military purposes are a blatant disregard of International Humanitarian law.\"\n\nThawabta and a medical source said 40 had been killed, including 14 children and nine women.\n\nCEASEFIRE EFFORTS\n\nThe bombing took place in a central part of Gaza where Israel announced a new military campaign on Wednesday as it battles fighters relying on hit-and-run insurgency tactics. It says there will be no halt to fighting during ceasefire talks, which have intensified since U.S. President Joe Biden outlined a proposal for a truce on Friday.\n\nHamas seeks a permanent end to the war. Israel says it must destroy the Islamist militant group first.\n\nIn another sensitive development, the Israeli military reported a rare attack near the Israel-Gaza border, saying a squad of Palestinian fighters killed a soldier and three of them were killed in return fire.\n\nA statement by the Hamas armed wing, the Al-Qassam Brigades, said its fighters had conducted an operation behind enemy lines in the Rafah area of southern Gaza, a location corresponding to the Israeli military's account.\n\nCIA director William Burns met senior officials from mediators Qatar and Egypt on Wednesday in Doha to discuss the ceasefire plan. Two Egyptian security sources said talks continued on Thursday but had shown no sign of breakthrough.\n\nBiden has repeatedly declared that ceasefires were close over the past several months, but all such efforts have failed since a single week-long truce in November.\n\nThe U.S. president's announcement of a ceasefire proposal coincides with intense domestic political pressure on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to chart a path to end the eight-month-old war and negotiate the release of hostages.\n\nA centrist party in his emergency coalition government has threatened to quit by Saturday if he does not commit to a post-war plan for Gaza. Far-right members have pledged to quit if he agrees to a peace deal that leaves Hamas in place.\n\nHamas precipitated the war by attacking Israeli territory last Oct. 7, killing around 1,200 people and capturing more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies. About half the hostages were freed in the November truce.\n\nIsrael's military assault on Gaza has killed more than 36,000 people, according to health officials in the territory, who say thousands more dead are feared buried under the rubble.\n\nU.S. and Israeli officials have told Reuters about half of Hamas's forces have been killed in the conflict. Hamas does not disclose fatalities among its fighters and some officials say Israel exaggerated the figures. Israel's own military death toll is almost 300.\n\n(Additional reporting by Dan Williams, Clauda Tanios, Henriette Chacar, Mrinmay Dey and Reuters bureaux; Writing by Michael Perry, Philippa Fletcher, Alexandra Hudson; Editing by Gerry Doyle, Timothy Heritage, Peter Graff)", "source": {"uri": "swissinfo.ch", "dataType": "news", "title": "SWI swissinfo.ch"}, "authors": [{"uri": "swi_swissinfo_ch@swissinfo.ch", "name": "Swi Swissinfo.Ch", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNRWA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UNRWA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-combatant", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Non-combatant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deir_al-Balah", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Deir al-Balah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Deir al-Balah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_Mount", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Temple Mount"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internally_displaced_person", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internally displaced person"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_and_control", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Command and control"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hostage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airstrike", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Airstrike"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cairo", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cairo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cairo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jerusalem"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jerusalem"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_Islamic_Jihad", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian Islamic Jihad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_refugees", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian refugees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martyr", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Martyr"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_J._Burns_(diplomat)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "William J.

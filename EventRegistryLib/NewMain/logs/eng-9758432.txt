(AP) -- Donald Trump is holding his first public campaign rally since President Joe Biden dropped out of a 2024 matchup that both major parties had spent months preparing for, leaving the former president to direct his ire toward his likely new opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nTrump is expected to turn his full focus on Harris as he stops Wednesday in North Carolina, a swing state that Trump has carried in the past, but Democrats have seen as pivotal. The former president's trip to the state shows he's still concerned about keeping it in his column this November, even as his team reaches for wins in traditionally Democratic-leaning states like Minnesota, where Trump is set to visit Saturday.\n\nWith Biden's abrupt departure from the presidential race and Harris edging closer and closer to officially being the Democrats' general election pick, Trump has ramped up his criticism of the vice president, whom he's characterized as \"the same as Biden but much more radical.\"\n\nHe has blamed her for what he portrays as the Biden administration's failures, particularly on security along the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nTrump has also hedged on plans for an expected debate with Harris, first saying that he wanted Fox News, not ABC, to host the matchup he had originally scheduled for September with Biden. On Tuesday, Trump appeared to tweak that message again, saying on a call with reporters that he'd like to debate Harris \"more than once\" but not committing to appearing at the debate currently on the books and saying he'd only agreed to debate Biden twice, not Harris.\n\nQuietly, Republicans have spoken about how subbing Harris in for Biden nullifies a portion of their party's argument in favor of Trump's vitality and vigor.\n\nAt 81, Biden had been the oldest nominee heading into a general election. Now, the 78-year-old Trump occupies that slot. Harris, 59, has launched a campaign that at least in some corners appears to be stoking interest among the younger voters who could be key in deciding an anticipated close general election.\n\nNorth Carolina is a state Trump carried in both his previous campaigns but by less than 1.5 percentage points over Biden in 2020, the closest margin of any state Trump won. Trump stumped heavily in North Carolina even as the COVID-19 pandemic wore on, while Biden largely kept off the physical campaign trail and did not personally visit the state in the last 16 days of the election.\n\nMecklenburg County, home to Charlotte -- the state's biggest city -- was also the scene of Trump's narrowest margin of victory in North Carolina's GOP primary, edging out Nikki Haley by fewer than 8 percentage points.\n\nThis year, Trump had planned to hold his first rally since the start of his hush money trial in Fayetteville, but that event was called off due to inclement weather. Trump called in from his private plane instead.\n\nDemocrats also have been working to win North Carolina, where the party's most recent presidential win was Barack Obama's 2008 victory, despite recent GOP dominance.\n\nBiden held a campaign event in Raleigh the day after his disastrous June debate with Trump. While he was much more forceful in that appearance than he was on the debate stage, it did not help much to quell the growing concern from members of his party about his ability to win the White House again.\n\nWith Harris now poised to take his spot, she may again be turning to North Carolina for some political help: the state's Gov. Roy Cooper is among the Democrats that Harris' campaign is vetting for a possible pick as her vice presidential running mate.\n\nCooper is term limited and cannot seek reelection. The highly competitive race to replace him pits Democratic Attorney General Josh Stein against Republican Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson, a staunch Trump supporter who is North Carolina's first Black major party nominee for governor.\n\nTrump's Charlotte event is his second campaign rally since a July 13 assassination attempt at a Pennsylvania rally. Days later, Trump accepted the GOP presidential nomination and gave a speech at the Republican National Convention, where his ear -- injured in the shooting -- was bandaged.\n\nWednesday's rally also is the first since the resignation of Secret Service director Kimberly Cheatle, who said she took \"full responsibility for the security lapse\" that led to a gunman being able to get so close to Trump at the outdoor event in Pennsylvania.\n\nThe Charlotte rally, like the one over the weekend in Grand Rapids, Michigan, will be held in an indoor arena.\n\nMeg Kinnard can be reached at http://twitter.com/MegKinnardAP", "source": {"uri": "mlive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "mlive"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Swing state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico\u2013United_States_border", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mexico\u2013United States border"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Election_Day_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Election Day (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Stein", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Josh Stein"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lieutenant_Governor_of_New_York", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lieutenant Governor of New York"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikki_Haley", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nikki Haley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assassination of John F.

(AP) -- Donald Trump is holding his first public campaign rally since President Joe Biden dropped out of a 2024 matchup that both major parties had spent months preparing for, leaving the former president to direct his ire toward his likely new opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nTrump is expected to turn his full focus on Harris as he stops Wednesday in North Carolina, a swing state that Trump has carried in the past, but Democrats have seen as pivotal. The former president's trip to the state shows he's still concerned about keeping it in his column this November, even as his team reaches for wins in traditionally Democratic-leaning states like Minnesota, which Trump is set to visit on Saturday.\n\nWith Biden's abrupt departure from the presidential race and Harris edging closer and closer to officially being the Democrats' general election pick, Trump has ramped up his criticism of the vice president, whom he's characterized as \"the same as Biden but much more radical.\"\n\nHe has blamed her for what he portrays as the Biden administration's failures, particularly on security along the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nTrump has also hedged on plans for an expected debate with Harris, first saying that he wanted Fox News, not ABC, to host the matchup he had originally scheduled for September with Biden. On Tuesday, Trump appeared to tweak that message again, saying on a call with reporters that he'd like to debate Harris \"more than once\" but not committing to appearing at the debate currently on the books and saying he'd only agreed to debate Biden twice, not Harris.\n\nHarris, meanwhile, spent Wednesday in Indiana, telling members of the historically Black sorority Zeta Phi Beta that \"we are not playing around\" and asked for their help in electing her president in November, an election she characterized as \"a choice between two different visions for our nation, one focused on the future, the other focused on the past.\"\n\nVoters in Indiana haven't backed a Democratic presidential candidate in nearly 16 years. But Harris, a woman of Black and South Asian descent, was speaking to a group already excited by her historic status as the likely Democratic nominee and one that her campaign hopes can expand its coalition.\n\nQuietly, Republicans have spoken about how subbing Harris in for Biden nullifies a portion of their party's argument in favor of Trump's vitality and vigor.\n\nAt 81, Biden would have been the oldest presidential nominee heading into a general election. Now, the 78-year-old Trump occupies that slot. Harris, 59, has launched a campaign that at least in some corners appears to be stoking interest among the younger voters who could be key in deciding an anticipated close general election.\n\nNorth Carolina is a state Trump carried in both his previous campaigns but by less than 1.5 percentage points over Biden in 2020, the closest margin of any state Trump won. Trump stumped heavily in North Carolina even as the COVID-19 pandemic wore on, while Biden largely kept off the physical campaign trail and did not personally visit the state in the last 16 days of the election.\n\nMecklenburg County, home to Charlotte -- the state's biggest city -- was also the scene of Trump's narrowest margin of victory in North Carolina's GOP primary, edging out Nikki Haley by fewer than 8 percentage points.\n\nThis year, Trump had planned to hold his first rally since the start of his hush money trial in Fayetteville, but that event was called off due to inclement weather. Trump called in from his private plane instead.\n\nDemocrats also have been working to win North Carolina, where the party's most recent presidential win was Barack Obama's 2008 victory, despite recent GOP dominance.\n\nBiden held a campaign event in Raleigh the day after his disastrous June debate with Trump. While he was much more forceful in that appearance than he was on the debate stage, it did not help much to quell the growing concern from members of his party about his ability to win the White House again.\n\nWith Harris now poised to take his spot, she may again be turning to North Carolina for some political help: the state's Gov. Roy Cooper is among the Democrats that Harris' campaign is vetting for a possible pick as her vice presidential running mate.\n\nCooper is term limited and cannot seek reelection. The highly competitive race to replace him pits Democratic Attorney General Josh Stein against Republican Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson, a staunch Trump supporter who is North Carolina's first Black major party nominee for governor.\n\nTrump's Charlotte event is his second campaign rally since a July 13 assassination attempt at a Pennsylvania rally. Days later, Trump accepted the GOP presidential nomination and gave a speech at the Republican National Convention, where his ear -- injured in the shooting -- was bandaged.\n\nWednesday's rally also is the first since the resignation of Secret Service director Kimberly Cheatle, who said she took \"full responsibility for the security lapse\" that led to a gunman being able to get so close to Trump at the outdoor event in Pennsylvania.\n\nThe Charlotte rally, like the one over the weekend in Grand Rapids, Michigan, will be held in an indoor arena.\n\nMeg Kinnard can be reached at http://twitter.com/MegKinnardAP", "source": {"uri": "wxow.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WXOW"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@wxow.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Swing state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraternities_and_sororities", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fraternities and sororities"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Asian Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historically_black_colleges_and_universities", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Historically black colleges and universities"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeta_Phi_Beta", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Zeta Phi Beta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Percentage point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico\u2013United_States_border", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mexico\u2013United States border"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Election_Day_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Election Day (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Stein", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Josh Stein"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lieutenant_Governor_of_New_York", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lieutenant Governor of New York"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikki_Haley", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nikki Haley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assassination of John F.

(AP) -- Donald Trump is holding his first public campaign rally since President Joe Biden dropped out of a 2024 matchup that both major parties had spent months preparing for, leaving the former president to direct his ire toward his likely new opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nTrump is expected to turn his full focus on Harris as he stops Wednesday in North Carolina, a swing state that Trump has carried in the past, but Democrats have seen as pivotal. The former president's trip to the state shows he's still concerned about keeping it in his column this November, even as his team reaches for wins in traditionally Democratic-leaning states like Minnesota, which Trump is set to visit on Saturday.\n\nWith Biden's abrupt departure from the presidential race and Harris edging closer and closer to officially being the Democrats' general election pick, Trump has ramped up his criticism of the vice president, whom he's characterized as \"the same as Biden but much more radical.\"\n\nHe has blamed her for what he portrays as the Biden administration's failures, particularly on security along the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nTrump has also hedged on plans for an expected debate with Harris, first saying that he wanted Fox News, not ABC, to host the matchup he had originally scheduled for September with Biden. On Tuesday, Trump appeared to tweak that message again, saying on a call with reporters that he'd like to debate Harris \"more than once\" but not committing to appearing at the debate currently on the books and saying he'd only agreed to debate Biden twice, not Harris.\n\nQuietly, Republicans have spoken about how subbing Harris in for Biden nullifies a portion of their party's argument in favor of Trump's vitality and vigor.\n\nAt 81, Biden would have been the oldest presidential nominee heading into a general election. Now, the 78-year-old Trump occupies that slot. Harris, 59, has launched a campaign that at least in some corners appears to be stoking interest among the younger voters who could be key in deciding an anticipated close general election.\n\nNorth Carolina is a state Trump carried in both his previous campaigns but by less than 1.5 percentage points over Biden in 2020, the closest margin of any state Trump won. Trump stumped heavily in North Carolina even as the COVID-19 pandemic wore on, while Biden largely kept off the physical campaign trail and did not personally visit the state in the last 16 days of the election.\n\nMecklenburg County, home to Charlotte -- the state's biggest city -- was also the scene of Trump's narrowest margin of victory in North Carolina's GOP primary, edging out Nikki Haley by fewer than 8 percentage points.\n\nThis year, Trump had planned to hold his first rally since the start of his hush money trial in Fayetteville, but that event was called off due to inclement weather. Trump called in from his private plane instead.\n\nDemocrats also have been working to win North Carolina, where the party's most recent presidential win was Barack Obama's 2008 victory, despite recent GOP dominance.\n\nBiden held a campaign event in Raleigh the day after his disastrous June debate with Trump. While he was much more forceful in that appearance than he was on the debate stage, it did not help much to quell the growing concern from members of his party about his ability to win the White House again.\n\nWith Harris now poised to take his spot, she may again be turning to North Carolina for some political help: the state's Gov. Roy Cooper is among the Democrats that Harris' campaign is vetting for a possible pick as her vice presidential running mate.\n\nCooper is term limited and cannot seek reelection.

Trump is expected to turn his full focus on Harris as he stops Wednesday in North Carolina, a swing state that Trump has carried in the past, but Democrats have seen as pivotal. The former president's trip to the state shows he's still concerned about keeping it in his column this November, even as his team reaches for wins in traditionally Democratic-leaning states like Minnesota, which Trump is set to visit on Saturday.With Biden's abrupt departure from the presidential race and Harris edging closer and closer to officially being the Democrats' general election pick, Trump has ramped up his criticism of the vice president, whom he's characterized as \"the same as Biden but much more radical.\"He has blamed her for what he portrays as the Biden administration's failures, particularly security along the U.S.-Mexico border. On Wednesday, the speakers who appeared on stage before the Republican nominee attacked Harris' record on the border, highlighting she was tasked with leading a White House effort to tackle migration issues. Harris' name was met with boos several times during the speeches.\"She was assigned that, she was given that task, and she failed,\" said Brandon Judd, former president of the National Border Patrol Council, the union that represents agents.Trump has also hedged on plans for an expected debate with Harris, first saying that he wanted Fox News, not ABC, to host the matchup he had originally scheduled for September with Biden. On Tuesday, Trump appeared to tweak that message again, saying on a call with reporters that he'd like to debate Harris \"more than once\" but not committing to appearing at the debate currently on the books and saying he'd only agreed to debate Biden twice, not Harris.Harris, meanwhile, spent Wednesday in Indiana, telling members of the historically Black sorority Zeta Phi Beta that \"we are not playing around\" and asked for their help in electing her president in November, an election she characterized as \"a choice between two different visions for our nation, one focused on the future, the other focused on the past.\"Voters in Indiana haven't backed a Democratic presidential candidate in nearly 16 years. But Harris, a woman of Black and South Asian descent, was speaking to a group already excited by her historic status as the likely Democratic nominee and one that her campaign hopes can expand its coalition.Quietly, Republicans have spoken about how subbing Harris in for Biden nullifies a portion of their party's argument in favor of Trump's vitality and vigor.At 81, Biden would have been the oldest presidential nominee heading into a general election. Now, the 78-year-old Trump occupies that slot. Harris, 59, has launched a campaign that at least in some corners appears to be stoking interest among the younger voters who could be key in deciding an anticipated close general election.North Carolina is a state Trump carried in both his previous campaigns but by less than 1.5 percentage points over Biden in 2020, the closest margin of any state Trump won. Trump stumped heavily in North Carolina even as the COVID-19 pandemic wore on, while Biden largely kept off the physical campaign trail and did not personally visit the state in the last 16 days of the election.Mecklenburg County, home to Charlotte -- the state's biggest city -- was also the scene of Trump's narrowest margin of victory in North Carolina's GOP primary, edging out Nikki Haley by fewer than 8 percentage points.This year, Trump had planned to hold his first rally since the start of his hush money trial in Fayetteville, but that event was called off due to inclement weather. Trump called in from his private plane instead.Democrats also have been working to win North Carolina, where the party's most recent presidential win was Barack Obama's 2008 victory, despite recent GOP dominance.Biden held a campaign event in Raleigh the day after his disastrous June debate with Trump. While he was much more forceful in that appearance than he was on the debate stage, it did not help much to quell the growing concern from members of his party about his ability to win the White House again.With Harris now poised to take his spot, she may again be turning to North Carolina for some political help: the state's Gov. Roy Cooper is among the Democrats that Harris' campaign is vetting for a possible pick as her vice presidential running mate.Cooper is term limited and cannot seek reelection.

(AP) -- Donald Trump unleashed a barrage of attack lines Wednesday against his likely new opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, who he called his \"new victim to defeat\" and accused of deceiving the public about President Joe Biden 's ability to run for a second term.\n\nThe rally in Charlotte, North Carolina marked his first public campaign event since Biden dropped out of the 2024 matchup and Harris became the Democrats' likely nominee.\n\n\"So now we have a new victim to defeat: Lyin' Kamala Harris,\" Trump said, labeling her \"the most incompetent and far left vice president in American history.\"\n\nTrump called her a \"radical left lunatic\" and called her \"crazy\" for her positions on abortion and on immigration. He also mispronounced her first name repeatedly.\n\nThe former president's stop in North Carolina shows he's concerned about keeping the state in his column this November, even as his team reaches for wins in traditionally Democratic-leaning states like Minnesota, which Trump is set to visit on Saturday.\n\nTrump has ramped up his criticism of the vice president since Biden's abrupt departure, calling Harris \"the same as Biden but much more radical.\"\n\nHe has blamed her for what he portrays as the Biden administration's failures, particularly security along the U.S.-Mexico border. On Wednesday, the speakers who appeared on stage before the Republican nominee attacked Harris' record on the border, highlighting she was tasked with leading a White House effort to tackle migration issues. Harris' name was met with boos several times during the speeches.\n\n\"She was assigned that, she was given that task, and she failed,\" said Brandon Judd, former president of the National Border Patrol Council, the union that represents agents.\n\nTrump has also hedged on plans for an expected debate with Harris, first saying that he wanted Fox News, not ABC, to host the matchup he had originally scheduled for September with Biden. On Tuesday, Trump appeared to tweak that message again, saying on a call with reporters that he'd like to debate Harris \"more than once\" but not committing to appearing at the debate currently on the books and saying he'd only agreed to debate Biden twice, not Harris.\n\nHarris, meanwhile, spent Wednesday in Indiana, telling members of the historically Black sorority Zeta Phi Beta that \"we are not playing around\" and asked for their help in electing her president in November, an election she characterized as \"a choice between two different visions for our nation, one focused on the future, the other focused on the past.\"\n\nVoters in Indiana haven't backed a Democratic presidential candidate in nearly 16 years. But Harris, a woman of Black and South Asian descent, was speaking to a group already excited by her historic status as the likely Democratic nominee and one that her campaign hopes can expand its coalition.\n\nQuietly, Republicans have spoken about how subbing Harris in for Biden nullifies a portion of their party's argument in favor of Trump's vitality and vigor.\n\nAt 81, Biden would have been the oldest presidential nominee heading into a general election. Now, the 78-year-old Trump occupies that slot. Harris, 59, has launched a campaign that at least in some corners appears to be stoking interest among the younger voters who could be key in deciding an anticipated close general election.\n\nNorth Carolina is a state Trump carried in both his previous campaigns but by less than 1.5 percentage points over Biden in 2020, the closest margin of any state Trump won. Trump stumped heavily in North Carolina even as the COVID-19 pandemic wore on, while Biden largely kept off the physical campaign trail and did not personally visit the state in the last 16 days of the election.\n\nMecklenburg County, home to Charlotte -- the state's biggest city -- was also the scene of Trump's narrowest margin of victory in North Carolina's GOP primary, edging out Nikki Haley by fewer than 8 percentage points.\n\nThis year, Trump had planned to hold his first rally since the start of his hush money trial in Fayetteville, but that event was called off due to inclement weather. Trump called in from his private plane instead.\n\nDemocrats also have been working to win North Carolina, where the party's most recent presidential win was Barack Obama's 2008 victory, despite recent GOP dominance.\n\nBiden held a campaign event in Raleigh the day after his disastrous June debate with Trump. While he was much more forceful in that appearance than he was on the debate stage, it did not help much to quell the growing concern from members of his party about his ability to win the White House again.\n\nWith Harris now poised to take his spot, she may again be turning to North Carolina for some political help: the state's Gov. Roy Cooper is among the Democrats that Harris' campaign is vetting for a possible pick as her vice presidential running mate.\n\nCooper is term limited and cannot seek reelection. The highly competitive race to replace him pits Democratic Attorney General Josh Stein against Republican Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson, a staunch Trump supporter who is North Carolina's first Black major party nominee for governor.\n\nTrump's Charlotte event is his second campaign rally since a July 13 assassination attempt at a Pennsylvania rally. Days later, Trump accepted the GOP presidential nomination and gave a speech at the Republican National Convention, where his ear -- injured in the shooting -- was bandaged.\n\nWednesday's rally also is the first since the resignation of Secret Service director Kimberly Cheatle, who said she took \"full responsibility for the security lapse\" that led to a gunman being able to get so close to Trump at the outdoor event in Pennsylvania.\n\nThe Charlotte rally, like the one over the weekend in Grand Rapids, Michigan, will be held in an indoor arena.\n\nMeg Kinnard can be reached at

(AP) -- Donald Trump is holding his first public campaign rally since President Joe Biden dropped out of a 2024 matchup that both major parties had spent months preparing for, leaving the former president to direct his ire toward his likely new opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nTrump is expected to turn his full focus on Harris as he stops Wednesday in North Carolina, a swing state that Trump has carried in the past, but Democrats have seen as pivotal. The former president's trip to the state shows he's still concerned about keeping it in his column this November, even as his team reaches for wins in traditionally Democratic-leaning states like Minnesota, which Trump is set to visit on Saturday.\n\nWith Biden's abrupt departure from the presidential race and Harris edging closer and closer to officially being the Democrats' general election pick, Trump has ramped up his criticism of the vice president, whom he's characterized as \"the same as Biden but much more radical.\"\n\nHe has blamed her for what he portrays as the Biden administration's failures, particularly security along the U.S.-Mexico border. On Wednesday, the speakers who appeared on stage before the Republican nominee attacked Harris' record on the border, highlighting she was tasked with leading a White House effort to tackle migration issues. Harris' name was met with boos several times during the speeches.\n\n\"She was assigned that, she was given that task, and she failed,\" said Brandon Judd, former president of the National Border Patrol Council, the union that represents agents.\n\nTrump has also hedged on plans for an expected debate with Harris, first saying that he wanted Fox News, not ABC, to host the matchup he had originally scheduled for September with Biden. On Tuesday, Trump appeared to tweak that message again, saying on a call with reporters that he'd like to debate Harris \"more than once\" but not committing to appearing at the debate currently on the books and saying he'd only agreed to debate Biden twice, not Harris.\n\nHarris, meanwhile, spent Wednesday in Indiana, telling members of the historically Black sorority Zeta Phi Beta that \"we are not playing around\" and asked for their help in electing her president in November, an election she characterized as \"a choice between two different visions for our nation, one focused on the future, the other focused on the past.\"\n\nVoters in Indiana haven't backed a Democratic presidential candidate in nearly 16 years. But Harris, a woman of Black and South Asian descent, was speaking to a group already excited by her historic status as the likely Democratic nominee and one that her campaign hopes can expand its coalition.\n\nQuietly, Republicans have spoken about how subbing Harris in for Biden nullifies a portion of their party's argument in favor of Trump's vitality and vigor.\n\nAt 81, Biden would have been the oldest presidential nominee heading into a general election. Now, the 78-year-old Trump occupies that slot. Harris, 59, has launched a campaign that at least in some corners appears to be stoking interest among the younger voters who could be key in deciding an anticipated close general election.\n\nNorth Carolina is a state Trump carried in both his previous campaigns but by less than 1.5 percentage points over Biden in 2020, the closest margin of any state Trump won. Trump stumped heavily in North Carolina even as the COVID-19 pandemic wore on, while Biden largely kept off the physical campaign trail and did not personally visit the state in the last 16 days of the election.\n\nMecklenburg County, home to Charlotte -- the state's biggest city -- was also the scene of Trump's narrowest margin of victory in North Carolina's GOP primary, edging out Nikki Haley by fewer than 8 percentage points.\n\nThis year, Trump had planned to hold his first rally since the start of his hush money trial in Fayetteville, but that event was called off due to inclement weather. Trump called in from his private plane instead.\n\nDemocrats also have been working to win North Carolina, where the party's most recent presidential win was Barack Obama's 2008 victory, despite recent GOP dominance.\n\nBiden held a campaign event in Raleigh the day after his disastrous June debate with Trump. While he was much more forceful in that appearance than he was on the debate stage, it did not help much to quell the growing concern from members of his party about his ability to win the White House again.\n\nWith Harris now poised to take his spot, she may again be turning to North Carolina for some political help: the state's Gov. Roy Cooper is among the Democrats that Harris' campaign is vetting for a possible pick as her vice presidential running mate.\n\nCooper is term limited and cannot seek reelection. The highly competitive race to replace him pits Democratic Attorney General Josh Stein against Republican Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson, a staunch Trump supporter who is North Carolina's first Black major party nominee for governor.\n\nTrump's Charlotte event is his second campaign rally since a July 13 assassination attempt at a Pennsylvania rally. Days later, Trump accepted the GOP presidential nomination and gave a speech at the Republican National Convention, where his ear -- injured in the shooting -- was bandaged.\n\nWednesday's rally also is the first since the resignation of Secret Service director Kimberly Cheatle, who said she took \"full responsibility for the security lapse\" that led to a gunman being able to get so close to Trump at the outdoor event in Pennsylvania.\n\nThe Charlotte rally, like the one over the weekend in Grand Rapids, Michigan, will be held in an indoor arena.\n\nMeg Kinnard can be reached at

Evan Vucci/Associated Press\n\nCHARLOTTE, N.C. -- Donald Trump is holding his first public campaign rally since President Biden dropped out of a 2024 matchup that both major parties had spent months preparing for, leaving the former president to direct his ire toward his likely new opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nTrump is expected to turn his full focus on Harris as he stops Wednesday in North Carolina, a swing state that Trump has carried in the past, but Democrats have seen as pivotal. The former president's trip to the state shows he's still concerned about keeping it in his column this November, even as his team reaches for wins in traditionally Democratic-leaning states like Minnesota, which Trump is set to visit on Saturday.\n\nWith Biden's abrupt departure from the presidential race and Harris edging closer and closer to officially being the Democrats' general election pick, Trump has ramped up his criticism of the vice president, whom he's characterized as \"the same as Biden but much more radical.\"\n\nRelated Republican leaders urge colleagues to steer clear of racist, sexist attacks on Harris\n\nHe has blamed her for what he portrays as the Biden administration's failures, particularly security along the U.S.-Mexico border. On Wednesday, the speakers who appeared on stage before the Republican nominee attacked Harris' record on the border, highlighting she was tasked with leading a White House effort to tackle migration issues. Harris' name was met with boos several times during the speeches.\n\n\"She was assigned that, she was given that task, and she failed,\" said Brandon Judd, former president of the National Border Patrol Council, the union that represents agents.\n\nTrump has also hedged on plans for an expected debate with Harris, first saying that he wanted Fox News, not ABC, to host the matchup he had originally scheduled for September with Biden. On Tuesday, Trump appeared to tweak that message again, saying on a call with reporters that he'd like to debate Harris \"more than once\" but not committing to appearing at the debate currently on the books and saying he'd only agreed to debate Biden twice, not Harris.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHarris, meanwhile, spent Wednesday in Indiana, telling members of the historically Black sorority Zeta Phi Beta that \"we are not playing around\" and asked for their help in electing her president in November, an election she characterized as \"a choice between two different visions for our nation, one focused on the future, the other focused on the past.\"\n\nVoters in Indiana haven't backed a Democratic presidential candidate in nearly 16 years. But Harris, a woman of Black and South Asian descent, was speaking to a group already excited by her historic status as the likely Democratic nominee and one that her campaign hopes can expand its coalition.\n\nRelated Biden will make a case for his legacy - and for Harris to continue it - in his Oval Office address\n\nQuietly, Republicans have spoken about how subbing Harris in for Biden nullifies a portion of their party's argument in favor of Trump's vitality and vigor.\n\nAt 81, Biden would have been the oldest presidential nominee heading into a general election. Now, the 78-year-old Trump occupies that slot. Harris, 59, has launched a campaign that at least in some corners appears to be stoking interest among the younger voters who could be key in deciding an anticipated close general election.\n\nNorth Carolina is a state Trump carried in both his previous campaigns but by less than 1.5 percentage points over Biden in 2020, the closest margin of any state Trump won. Trump stumped heavily in North Carolina even as the COVID-19 pandemic wore on, while Biden largely kept off the physical campaign trail and did not personally visit the state in the last 16 days of the election.\n\nMecklenburg County, home to Charlotte - the state's biggest city - was also the scene of Trump's narrowest margin of victory in North Carolina's GOP primary, edging out Nikki Haley by fewer than 8 percentage points.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis year, Trump had planned to hold his first rally since the start of his hush money trial in Fayetteville, but that event was called off due to inclement weather. Trump called in from his private plane instead.\n\nDemocrats also have been working to win North Carolina, where the party's most recent presidential win was Barack Obama's 2008 victory, despite recent GOP dominance.\n\nBiden held a campaign event in Raleigh the day after his disastrous June debate with Trump. While he was much more forceful in that appearance than he was on the debate stage, it did not help much to quell the growing concern from members of his party about his ability to win the White House again.\n\nWith Harris now poised to take his spot, she may again be turning to North Carolina for some political help: the state's Gov. Roy Cooper is among the Democrats that Harris' campaign is vetting for a possible pick as her vice presidential running mate.\n\nCooper is term-limited and cannot seek reelection. The highly competitive race to replace him pits Democratic Attorney General Josh Stein against Republican Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson, a staunch Trump supporter who is North Carolina's first Black major party nominee for governor.\n\nRelated Secret Service director steps down after Trump assassination attempt\n\nTrump's Charlotte event is his second campaign rally since a July 13 assassination attempt at a Pennsylvania rally. Days later, Trump accepted the GOP presidential nomination and gave a speech at the Republican National Convention, where his ear - injured in the shooting - was bandaged.\n\nWednesday's rally also is the first since the resignation of Secret Service director Kimberly Cheatle, who said she took \"full responsibility for the security lapse\" that led to a gunman being able to get so close to Trump at the outdoor event in Pennsylvania.\n\nThe Charlotte rally, like the one over the weekend in Grand Rapids, Michigan, will be held in an indoor arena\n\nCopy the Story Link Related Headlines Kamala

He also mispronounced her first name repeatedly.\n\nThe former president's stop in North Carolina shows he's concerned about keeping the state in his column this November, even as his team reaches for wins in traditionally Democratic-leaning states like Minnesota, which Trump is set to visit on Saturday.\n\nTrump has ramped up his criticism of the vice president since Biden's abrupt departure, calling Harris \"the same as Biden but much more radical.\"\n\nHe has blamed her for what he portrays as the Biden administration's failures, particularly security along the U.S.-Mexico border. On Wednesday, the speakers who appeared on stage before the Republican nominee attacked Harris' record on the border, highlighting she was tasked with leading a White House effort to tackle migration issues. Harris' name was met with boos several times during the speeches.\n\n\"She was assigned that, she was given that task, and she failed,\" said Brandon Judd, former president of the National Border Patrol Council, the union that represents agents.\n\nTrump has also hedged on plans for an expected debate with Harris, first saying that he wanted Fox News, not ABC, to host the matchup he had originally scheduled for September with Biden. On Tuesday, Trump appeared to tweak that message again, saying on a call with reporters that he'd like to debate Harris \"more than once\" but not committing to appearing at the debate currently on the books and saying he'd only agreed to debate Biden twice, not Harris.\n\nHarris, meanwhile, spent Wednesday in Indiana, telling members of the historically Black sorority Zeta Phi Beta that \"we are not playing around\" and asked for their help in electing her president in November, an election she characterized as \"a choice between two different visions for our nation, one focused on the future, the other focused on the past.\"\n\nVoters in Indiana haven't backed a Democratic presidential candidate in nearly 16 years. But Harris, a woman of Black and South Asian descent, was speaking to a group already excited by her historic status as the likely Democratic nominee and one that her campaign hopes can expand its coalition.\n\nQuietly, Republicans have spoken about how subbing Harris in for Biden nullifies a portion of their party's argument in favor of Trump's vitality and vigor.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nAt 81, Biden would have been the oldest presidential nominee heading into a general election. Now, the 78-year-old Trump occupies that slot. Harris, 59, has launched a campaign that at least in some corners appears to be stoking interest among the younger voters who could be key in deciding an anticipated close general election.\n\nNorth Carolina is a state Trump carried in both his previous campaigns but by less than 1.5 percentage points over Biden in 2020, the closest margin of any state Trump won. Trump stumped heavily in North Carolina even as the COVID-19 pandemic wore on, while Biden largely kept off the physical campaign trail and did not personally visit the state in the last 16 days of the election.\n\nMecklenburg County, home to Charlotte -- the state's biggest city -- was also the scene of Trump's narrowest margin of victory in North Carolina's GOP primary, edging out Nikki Haley by fewer than 8 percentage points.\n\nThis year, Trump had planned to hold his first rally since the start of his hush money trial in Fayetteville, but that event was called off due to inclement weather. Trump called in from his private plane instead.\n\nDemocrats also have been working to win North Carolina, where the party's most recent presidential win was Barack Obama's 2008 victory, despite recent GOP dominance.\n\nBiden held a campaign event in Raleigh the day after his disastrous June debate with Trump. While he was much more forceful in that appearance than he was on the debate stage, it did not help much to quell the growing concern from members of his party about his ability to win the White House again.\n\nWith Harris now poised to take his spot, she may again be turning to North Carolina for some political help: the state's Gov. Roy Cooper is among the Democrats that Harris' campaign is vetting for a possible pick as her vice presidential running mate.\n\nCooper is term limited and cannot seek reelection. The highly competitive race to replace him pits Democratic Attorney General Josh Stein against Republican Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson, a staunch Trump supporter who is North Carolina's first Black major party nominee for governor.\n\nTrump's Charlotte event is his second campaign rally since a July 13 assassination attempt at a Pennsylvania rally. Days later, Trump accepted the GOP presidential nomination and gave a speech at the Republican National Convention, where his ear -- injured in the shooting -- was bandaged.\n\nWednesday's rally also is the first since the resignation of Secret Service director Kimberly Cheatle, who said she took \"full responsibility for the security lapse\" that led to a gunman being able to get so close to Trump at the outdoor event in Pennsylvania.\n\nThe Charlotte rally, like the one over the weekend in Grand Rapids, Michigan, will be held in an indoor arena.\n\nMeg Kinnard can be reached at http://twitter.com/MegKinnardAP ___\n\nJill Colvin in New York contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

On Tuesday, Trump appeared to tweak that message again, saying on a call with reporters that he'd like to debate Harris \"more than once\" but not committing to appearing at the debate currently on the books and saying he'd only agreed to debate Biden twice, not Harris.Quietly, Republicans have spoken about how subbing Harris in for Biden nullifies a portion of their party's argument in favor of Trump's vitality and vigor.At 81, Biden had been the oldest nominee heading into a general election. Now, the 78-year-old Trump occupies that slot. Harris, 59, has launched a campaign that, at least in some corners, appears to be stoking interest among the younger voters who could be key in deciding an anticipated close general election. North Carolina is a state Trump carried in both his previous campaigns but by less than 1.5 percentage points over Biden in 2020, the closest margin of any state Trump won.

Trump called in from his private plane instead.Democrats also have been working to win North Carolina, where the party's most recent presidential win was Barack Obama's 2008 victory, despite recent GOP dominance. Biden held a campaign event in Raleigh the day after his disastrous June debate with Trump. While he was much more forceful in that appearance than he was on the debate stage, it did not help much to quell the growing concern from members of his party about his ability to win the White House again.With Harris now poised to take his spot, she may again be turning to North Carolina for some political help: the state's Gov. Roy Cooper is among the Democrats that Harris' campaign is vetting for a possible pick as her vice presidential running mate.Cooper is term-limited and cannot seek reelection.

(AP) -- Donald Trump unleashed a barrage of attack lines Wednesday against his likely new opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, whom he called his \"new victim to defeat\" and accused of deceiving the public about President Joe Biden 's ability to run for a second term.\n\nThe rally in Charlotte, North Carolina marked his first public campaign event since Biden dropped out of the 2024 matchup and Harris became the Democrats' likely nominee.\n\n\"So now we have a new victim to defeat: Lyin' Kamala Harris,\" Trump said, labeling her \"the most incompetent and far left vice president in American history.\"\n\nTrump called her a \"radical left lunatic\" and called her \"crazy\" for her positions on abortion and on immigration. He also mispronounced her first name repeatedly.\n\nHarris is expected to make abortion a key part of her campaign, looking to present herself to voters as someone who will fight against abortion restrictions. Earlier this week, she said she \"trusts women to make decisions about their own bodies.\"\n\nThe former president's stop in North Carolina shows he's concerned about keeping the state in his column this November, even as his team reaches for wins in traditionally Democratic-leaning states like Minnesota, which Trump is set to visit on Saturday.\n\nTrump has ramped up his criticism of the vice president since Biden's abrupt departure, calling Harris \"the same as Biden but much more radical.\"\n\nHe blamed her for what he portrays as the Biden administration's failures, particularly security along the U.S.-Mexico border. On Wednesday, the speakers who appeared on stage before the Republican nominee attacked Harris' record on the border, highlighting she was tasked with leading a White House effort to tackle migration issues. Harris' name was met with boos several times during the speeches.\n\n\"She was assigned that, she was given that task, and she failed,\" said Brandon Judd, former president of the National Border Patrol Council, the union that represents agents.\n\nTrump also accused her of being just as responsible for Biden's policies at the U.S.-Mexico border, which saw illegal crossing arrests reach record highs at the end of 2023 and repeated his pledge to conduct mass deportations with the help of local police.\n\n\"Kamala's deadly destruction of America's borders is completely and totally disqualifying. She shouldn't be allowed to run for president with what she's done,\" Trump told supporters.\n\nTrump has hedged on plans for an expected debate with Harris, first saying that he wanted Fox News, not ABC, to host the matchup he had originally scheduled for September with Biden. On Tuesday, Trump appeared to tweak that message again, saying on a call with reporters that he'd like to debate Harris \"more than once\" but not committing to appearing at the debate currently on the books and saying he'd only agreed to debate Biden twice, not Harris.\n\nHarris, meanwhile, spent Wednesday in Indiana, telling members of the historically Black sorority Zeta Phi Beta that \"we are not playing around\" and asked for their help in electing her president in November, an election she characterized as \"a choice between two different visions for our nation, one focused on the future, the other focused on the past.\"\n\nVoters in Indiana haven't backed a Democratic presidential candidate in nearly 16 years. But Harris, a woman of Black and South Asian descent, was speaking to a group already excited by her historic status as the likely Democratic nominee and one that her campaign hopes can expand its coalition.\n\nQuietly, Republicans have spoken about how subbing Harris in for Biden nullifies a portion of their party's argument in favor of Trump's vitality and vigor.\n\nAt 81, Biden would have been the oldest presidential nominee heading into a general election. Now, the 78-year-old Trump occupies that slot. Harris, 59, has launched a campaign that at least in some corners appears to be stoking interest among the younger voters who could be key in deciding an anticipated close general election.\n\nNorth Carolina is a state Trump carried in both his previous campaigns but by less than 1.5 percentage points over Biden in 2020, the closest margin of any state Trump won. Trump stumped heavily in North Carolina even as the COVID-19 pandemic wore on, while Biden largely kept off the physical campaign trail and did not personally visit the state in the last 16 days of the election.\n\nMecklenburg County, home to Charlotte -- the state's biggest city -- was also the scene of Trump's narrowest margin of victory in North Carolina's GOP primary, edging out Nikki Haley by fewer than 8 percentage points.\n\nThis year, Trump had planned to hold his first rally since the start of his hush money trial in Fayetteville, but that event was called off due to inclement weather. Trump called in from his private plane instead.\n\nDemocrats also have been working to win North Carolina, where the party's most recent presidential win was Barack Obama's 2008 victory, despite recent GOP dominance.\n\nBiden held a campaign event in Raleigh the day after his disastrous June debate with Trump. While he was much more forceful in that appearance than he was on the debate stage, it did not help much to quell the growing concern from members of his party about his ability to win the White House again.\n\nWith Harris now poised to take his spot, she may again be turning to North Carolina for some political help: the state's Gov. Roy Cooper is among the Democrats that Harris' campaign is vetting for a possible pick as her vice presidential running mate.\n\nCooper is term limited and cannot seek reelection. The highly competitive race to replace him pits Democratic Attorney General Josh Stein against Republican Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson, a staunch Trump supporter who is North Carolina's first Black major party nominee for governor.\n\nTrump's Charlotte event is his second campaign rally since a July 13 assassination attempt at a Pennsylvania rally. Days later, Trump accepted the GOP presidential nomination and gave a speech at the Republican National Convention, where his ear -- injured in the shooting -- was bandaged.\n\nWednesday's rally also is the first since the resignation of Secret Service director Kimberly Cheatle, who said she took \"full responsibility for the security lapse\" that led to a gunman being able to get so close to

On Tuesday, Trump appeared to tweak that message again, saying on a call with reporters that he'd like to debate Harris \"more than once\" but not committing to appearing at the debate currently on the books and saying he'd only agreed to debate Biden twice, not Harris.\n\nQuietly, Republicans have spoken about how subbing Harris in for Biden nullifies a portion of their party's argument in favor of Trump's vitality and vigor.\n\nAt 81, Biden had been the oldest nominee heading into a general election. Now, the 78-year-old Trump occupies that slot. Harris, 59, has launched a campaign that at least in some corners appears to be stoking interest among the younger voters who could be key in deciding an anticipated close general election.\n\nNorth Carolina is a state Trump carried in both his previous campaigns but by less than 1.5 percentage points over Biden in 2020, the closest margin of any state Trump won. Trump stumped heavily in North Carolina even as the COVID-19 pandemic wore on, while Biden largely kept off the physical campaign trail and did not personally visit the state in the last 16 days of the election.\n\nMecklenburg County, home to Charlotte -- the state's biggest city -- was also the scene of Trump's narrowest margin of victory in North Carolina's GOP primary, edging out Nikki Haley by fewer than 8 percentage points.\n\nThis year, Trump had planned to hold his first rally since the start of his hush money trial in Fayetteville, but that event was called off due to inclement weather. Trump called in from his private plane instead.\n\nDemocrats also have been working to win North Carolina, where the party's most recent presidential win was Barack Obama's 2008 victory, despite recent GOP dominance.\n\nBiden held a campaign event in Raleigh the day after his disastrous June debate with Trump. While he was much more forceful in that appearance than he was on the debate stage, it did not help much to quell the growing concern from members of his party about his ability to win the White House again.\n\nWith Harris now poised to take his spot, she may again be turning to North Carolina for some political help: the state's Gov. Roy Cooper is among the Democrats that Harris' campaign is vetting for a possible pick as her vice presidential running mate.\n\nCooper is term limited and cannot seek reelection. The highly competitive race to replace him pits Democratic Attorney General Josh Stein against Republican Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson, a staunch Trump supporter who is North Carolina's first Black major party nominee for governor.\n\nTrump's Charlotte event is his second campaign rally since a July 13 assassination attempt at a Pennsylvania rally. Days later, Trump accepted the GOP presidential nomination and gave a speech at the Republican National Convention, where his ear -- injured in the shooting -- was bandaged.\n\nWednesday's rally also is the first since the resignation of Secret Service director Kimberly Cheatle, who said she took \"full responsibility for the security lapse\" that led to a gunman being able to get so close to Trump at the outdoor event in Pennsylvania.\n\nThe Charlotte rally, like the one over the weekend in Grand Rapids, Michigan, will be held in an indoor arena.", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston Globe"}, "authors": [{"uri": "meg_kinnard@bostonglobe.com", "name": "Meg Kinnard", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "General election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico\u2013United_States_border", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mexico\u2013United States border"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikki_Haley", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nikki Haley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Election_Day_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Election Day (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mecklenburg_County,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mecklenburg County, North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mecklenburg County, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fayetteville,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fayetteville, North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Fayetteville, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimberly_Cheatle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kimberly Cheatle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Robinson_(American_politician)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mark Robinson (American politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Stein", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Josh Stein"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lieutenant_Governor_of_New_York", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lieutenant Governor of New York"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assassination of John F.

(AP) -- Donald Trump is holding his first public campaign rally since President Joe Biden dropped out of a 2024 matchup that both major parties had spent months preparing for, leaving the former president to direct his ire toward his likely new opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nTrump is expected to turn his full focus on Harris as he stops Wednesday in North Carolina, a swing state that Trump has carried in the past, but Democrats have seen as pivotal. The former president's trip to the state shows he's still concerned about keeping it in his column this November, even as his team reaches for wins in traditionally Democratic-leaning states like Minnesota, which Trump is set to visit on Saturday.\n\nWith Biden's abrupt departure from the presidential race and Harris edging closer and closer to officially being the Democrats' general election pick, Trump has ramped up his criticism of the vice president, whom he's characterized as \"the same as Biden but much more radical.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...

On Tuesday, Trump appeared to tweak that message again, saying on a call with reporters that he'd like to debate Harris \"more than once\" but not committing to appearing at the debate currently on the books and saying he'd only agreed to debate Biden twice, not Harris.\n\nQuietly, Republicans have spoken about how subbing Harris in for Biden nullifies a portion of their party's argument in favor of Trump's vitality and vigor.\n\nAt 81, Biden would have been the oldest presidential nominee heading into a general election. Now, the 78-year-old Trump occupies that slot. Harris, 59, has launched a campaign that at least in some corners appears to be stoking interest among the younger voters who could be key in deciding an anticipated close general election.\n\nNorth Carolina is a state Trump carried in both his previous campaigns but by less than 1.5 percentage points over Biden in 2020, the closest margin of any state Trump won. Trump stumped heavily in North Carolina even as the COVID-19 pandemic wore on, while Biden largely kept off the physical campaign trail and did not personally visit the state in the last 16 days of the election.\n\nMecklenburg County, home to Charlotte -- the state's biggest city -- was also the scene of Trump's narrowest margin of victory in North Carolina's GOP primary, edging out Nikki Haley by fewer than 8 percentage points.\n\nThis year, Trump had planned to hold his first rally since the start of his hush money trial in Fayetteville, but that event was called off due to inclement weather. Trump called in from his private plane instead.\n\nDemocrats also have been working to win North Carolina, where the party's most recent presidential win was Barack Obama's 2008 victory, despite recent GOP dominance.\n\nBiden held a campaign event in Raleigh the day after his disastrous June debate with Trump. While he was much more forceful in that appearance than he was on the debate stage, it did not help much to quell the growing concern from members of his party about his ability to win the White House again.\n\nWith Harris now poised to take his spot, she may again be turning to North Carolina for some political help: the state's Gov. Roy Cooper is among the Democrats that Harris' campaign is vetting for a possible pick as her vice presidential running mate.\n\nCooper is term limited and cannot seek reelection. The highly competitive race to replace him pits Democratic Attorney General Josh Stein against Republican Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson, a staunch Trump supporter who is North Carolina's first Black major party nominee for governor.\n\nTrump's Charlotte event is his second campaign rally since a July 13 assassination attempt at a Pennsylvania rally. Days later, Trump accepted the GOP presidential nomination and gave a speech at the Republican National Convention, where his ear -- injured in the shooting -- was bandaged.\n\nWednesday's rally also is the first since the resignation of Secret Service director Kimberly Cheatle, who said she took \"full responsibility for the security lapse\" that led to a gunman being able to get so close to Trump at the outdoor event in Pennsylvania.\n\nThe Charlotte rally, like the one over the weekend in Grand Rapids, Michigan, will be held in an indoor arena.\n\nMeg Kinnard can be reached at http://twitter.com/MegKinnardAP\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

(AP) -- Donald Trump unleashed a barrage of attack lines Wednesday against his likely new opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, whom he called his \"new victim to defeat\" and accused of deceiving the public about President Joe Biden 's ability to run for a second term.\n\nThe rally in Charlotte, North Carolina marked his first public campaign event since Biden dropped out of the 2024 matchup and Harris became the Democrats' likely nominee. The rally concluded minutes before Biden addressed the nation to explain he dropped his reelection bid to \"pass the torch\" to Harris, who is 22 years younger than him.\n\n\"So now we have a new victim to defeat: Lyin' Kamala Harris,\" Trump said, labeling her \"the most incompetent and far-left vice president in American history.\"\n\nTrump called her a \"radical left lunatic\" and said she was \"crazy\" for her positions on abortion and on immigration. He also mispronounced her first name repeatedly, a denigrating approach to the first Black woman and person of South Asian descent likely to lead a major party's presidential ticket.\n\nTrump's speech signaled the next stage for the campaign may be especially brutal and personal, even as some GOP leaders warned Republican allies not to use overtly racist and sexist attacks against Harris.\n\nTrump has ramped up his criticism of the vice president since Biden's abrupt departure, calling Harris \"the same as Biden but much more radical.\"\n\nHe blamed her for what he portrays as the Biden administration's failures, particularly security along the U.S.-Mexico border. On Wednesday, the speakers who appeared on stage before the Republican nominee attacked Harris' record on the border, highlighting she was tasked with leading a White House effort to tackle migration issues. Harris' name was met with boos several times during the speeches.\n\n\"She was assigned that, she was given that task, and she failed,\" said Brandon Judd, former president of the National Border Patrol Council, the union that represents agents.\n\nTrump also accused Harris of being just as responsible for Biden's policies at the U.S.-Mexico border, which saw illegal crossing arrests reach record highs at the end of 2023 and repeated his pledge to conduct mass deportations with the help of local police.\n\n\"Kamala's deadly destruction of America's borders is completely and totally disqualifying. She shouldn't be allowed to run for president with what she's done,\" Trump told supporters.\n\nHarris, meanwhile, spent Wednesday in Indiana, telling members of the historically Black sorority Zeta Phi Beta that \"we are not playing around\" and asked for their help in electing her president in November, an election she characterized as \"a choice between two different visions for our nation, one focused on the future, the other focused on the past.\"\n\nHarris' campaign released a statement after Trump's speech describing it as \"unhinged, weird and rambling.\"\n\n\"Unity is over for Donald Trump,\" said campaign spokesperson Ammar Moussa, referring to unity pledges made during the Republican National Convention.\n\nHarris is expected to make abortion a key part of her campaign, looking to present herself to voters as someone who will fight against abortion restrictions. Earlier this week, she said she \"trusts women to make decisions about their own bodies.\"\n\nTrump has hedged on plans for an expected debate with Harris, first saying that he wanted Fox News, not ABC, to host the matchup he had originally scheduled for September with Biden. On Tuesday, Trump appeared to tweak that message again, saying on a call with reporters that he'd like to debate Harris \"more than once\" but not committing to appearing at the debate currently on the books and saying he'd only agreed to debate Biden twice, not Harris.\n\nQuietly, Republicans have spoken about how subbing Harris in for Biden nullifies a portion of their party's argument in favor of Trump's vitality and vigor.\n\nAt 81, Biden would have been the oldest presidential nominee heading into a general election.

(AP) -- Donald Trump unleashed a barrage of attack lines Wednesday against his likely new opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, who he called his \"new victim to defeat\" and accused of deceiving the public about President Joe Biden 's ability to run for a second term.\n\nThe rally in Charlotte, North Carolina marked his first public campaign event since Biden dropped out of the 2024 matchup and Harris became the Democrats' likely nominee.\n\n\u00d7\n\nAlready a Subscriber? Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\n\"So now we have a new victim to defeat: Lyin' Kamala Harris,\" Trump said, labeling her \"the most incompetent and far left vice president in American history.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nTrump called her a \"radical left lunatic\" and called her \"crazy\" for her positions on abortion and on immigration. He also mispronounced her first name repeatedly.\n\nThe former president's stop in North Carolina shows he's concerned about keeping the state in his column this November, even as his team reaches for wins in traditionally Democratic-leaning states like Minnesota, which Trump is set to visit on Saturday.\n\nTrump has ramped up his criticism of the vice president since Biden's abrupt departure, calling Harris \"the same as Biden but much more radical.\"\n\nHe has blamed her for what he portrays as the Biden administration's failures, particularly security along the U.S.-Mexico border. On Wednesday, the speakers who appeared on stage before the Republican nominee attacked Harris' record on the border, highlighting she was tasked with leading a White House effort to tackle migration issues. Harris' name was met with boos several times during the speeches.\n\n\"She was assigned that, she was given that task, and she failed,\" said Brandon Judd, former president of the National Border Patrol Council, the union that represents agents.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nTrump has also hedged on plans for an expected debate with Harris, first saying that he wanted Fox News, not ABC, to host the matchup he had originally scheduled for September with Biden. On Tuesday, Trump appeared to tweak that message again, saying on a call with reporters that he'd like to debate Harris \"more than once\" but not committing to appearing at the debate currently on the books and saying he'd only agreed to debate Biden twice, not Harris.\n\nHarris, meanwhile, spent Wednesday in Indiana, telling members of the historically Black sorority Zeta Phi Beta that \"we are not playing around\" and asked for their help in electing her president in November, an election she characterized as \"a choice between two different visions for our nation, one focused on the future, the other focused on the past.\"\n\nVoters in Indiana haven't backed a Democratic presidential candidate in nearly 16 years. But Harris, a woman of Black and South Asian descent, was speaking to a group already excited by her historic status as the likely Democratic nominee and one that her campaign hopes can expand its coalition.\n\nQuietly, Republicans have spoken about how subbing Harris in for Biden nullifies a portion of their party's argument in favor of Trump's vitality and vigor.\n\nAt 81, Biden would have been the oldest presidential nominee heading into a general election. Now, the 78-year-old Trump occupies that slot. Harris, 59, has launched a campaign that at least in some corners appears to be stoking interest among the younger voters who could be key in deciding an anticipated close general election.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nNorth Carolina is a state Trump carried in both his previous campaigns but by less than 1.5 percentage points over Biden in 2020, the closest margin of any state Trump won. Trump stumped heavily in North Carolina even as the COVID-19 pandemic wore on, while Biden largely kept off the physical campaign trail and did not personally visit the state in the last 16 days of the election.\n\nMecklenburg County, home to Charlotte -- the state's biggest city -- was also the scene of Trump's narrowest margin of victory in North Carolina's GOP primary, edging out Nikki Haley by fewer than 8 percentage points.\n\nThis year, Trump had planned to hold his first rally since the start of his hush money trial in Fayetteville, but that event was called off due to inclement weather. Trump called in from his private plane instead.\n\nDemocrats also have been working to win North Carolina, where the party's most recent presidential win was Barack Obama's 2008 victory, despite recent GOP dominance.\n\nBiden held a campaign event in Raleigh the day after his disastrous June debate with Trump. While he was much more forceful in that appearance than he was on the debate stage, it did not help much to quell the growing concern from members of his party about his ability to win the White House again.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nWith Harris now poised to take his spot, she may again be turning to North Carolina for some political help: the state's Gov. Roy Cooper is among the Democrats that Harris' campaign is vetting for a possible pick as her vice presidential running mate.\n\nCooper is term limited and cannot seek reelection. The highly competitive race to replace him pits Democratic Attorney General Josh Stein against Republican Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson, a staunch Trump supporter who is North Carolina's first Black major party nominee for governor.\n\nTrump's Charlotte event is his second campaign rally since a July 13 assassination attempt at a Pennsylvania rally. Days later, Trump accepted the GOP presidential nomination and gave a speech at the Republican National Convention, where his ear -- injured in the shooting -- was bandaged.\n\nWednesday's rally also is the first since the resignation of Secret Service director Kimberly Cheatle, who said she took \"full responsibility for the security lapse\" that led to a gunman being able to get so close to Trump at the outdoor event in Pennsylvania.\n\nThe Charlotte rally, like the one over the weekend in Grand Rapids, Michigan, will be held in an indoor arena.\n\n___\n\nMeg Kinnard can be reached at

On Wednesday, the speakers who appeared on stage before the Republican nominee attacked Harris' record on the border, highlighting she was tasked with leading a White House effort to tackle migration issues. Harris' name was met with boos several times during the speeches.\n\n\"She was assigned that, she was given that task, and she failed,\" said Brandon Judd, former president of the National Border Patrol Council, the union that represents agents.\n\nTrump has also hedged on plans for an expected debate with Harris, first saying that he wanted Fox News, not ABC, to host the matchup he had originally scheduled for September with Biden. On Tuesday, Trump appeared to tweak that message again, saying on a call with reporters that he'd like to debate Harris \"more than once\" but not committing to appearing at the debate currently on the books and saying he'd only agreed to debate Biden twice, not Harris.\n\nHarris, meanwhile, spent Wednesday in Indiana, telling members of the historically Black sorority Zeta Phi Beta that \"we are not playing around\" and asked for their help in electing her president in November, an election she characterized as \"a choice between two different visions for our nation, one focused on the future, the other focused on the past.\"\n\nVoters in Indiana haven't backed a Democratic presidential candidate in nearly 16 years. But Harris, a woman of Black and South Asian descent, was speaking to a group already excited by her historic status as the likely Democratic nominee and one that her campaign hopes can expand its coalition.\n\nQuietly, Republicans have spoken about how subbing Harris in for Biden nullifies a portion of their party's argument in favor of Trump's vitality and vigor.\n\nAt 81, Biden would have been the oldest presidential nominee heading into a general election. Now, the 78-year-old Trump occupies that slot. Harris, 59, has launched a campaign that at least in some corners appears to be stoking interest among the younger voters who could be key in deciding an anticipated close general election.\n\nNorth Carolina is a state Trump carried in both his previous campaigns but by less than 1.5 percentage points over Biden in 2020, the closest margin of any state Trump won. Trump stumped heavily in North Carolina even as the COVID-19 pandemic wore on, while Biden largely kept off the physical campaign trail and did not personally visit the state in the last 16 days of the election.\n\nMecklenburg County, home to Charlotte -- the state's biggest city -- was also the scene of Trump's narrowest margin of victory in North Carolina's GOP primary, edging out Nikki Haley by fewer than 8 percentage points.\n\nThis year, Trump had planned to hold his first rally since the start of his hush money trial in Fayetteville, but that event was called off due to inclement weather. Trump called in from his private plane instead.\n\nDemocrats also have been working to win North Carolina, where the party's most recent presidential win was Barack Obama's 2008 victory, despite recent GOP dominance.\n\nBiden held a campaign event in Raleigh the day after his disastrous June debate with Trump. While he was much more forceful in that appearance than he was on the debate stage, it did not help much to quell the growing concern from members of his party about his ability to win the White House again.\n\nWith Harris now poised to take his spot, she may again be turning to North Carolina for some political help: the state's Gov. Roy Cooper is among the Democrats that Harris' campaign is vetting for a possible pick as her vice presidential running mate.\n\nCooper is term limited and cannot seek reelection. The highly competitive race to replace him pits Democratic Attorney General Josh Stein against Republican Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson, a staunch Trump supporter who is North Carolina's first Black major party nominee for governor.\n\nTrump's Charlotte event is his second campaign rally since a July 13 assassination attempt at a Pennsylvania rally. Days later, Trump accepted the GOP presidential nomination and gave a speech at the Republican National Convention, where his ear -- injured in the shooting -- was bandaged.\n\nWednesday's rally also is the first since the resignation of Secret Service director Kimberly Cheatle, who said she took \"full responsibility for the security lapse\" that led to a gunman being able to get so close to Trump at the outdoor event in Pennsylvania.\n\nThe Charlotte rally, like the one over the weekend in Grand Rapids, Michigan, will be held in an indoor arena.\n\nMeg Kinnard can be reached at http://twitter.com/MegKinnardAP ___\n\nJill Colvin in New York contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

The former president's trip there shows he remains keen to keep the state on his list in November, even as his team eyes victories in traditionally Democratic-leaning states like Minnesota, which Trump is scheduled to visit Saturday.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump arrives at his campaign rally at Bojangles Coliseum on July 24, 2024, in Charlotte, North Carolina. BRANDON BELL/Getty Images\n\nTrump has called Harris a \"radical left lunatic\" and called her \"crazy\" because of her positions on abortion and immigration. He has also mispronounced her first name several times.\n\n\"We now have a new victim to defeat, the lying Kamala Harris... the most incompetent and left-wing vice president in American history,\" Trump told the crowd, adding that she was \"the ultra-liberal driving force behind every Biden disaster.\"\n\nHarris is expected to make abortion a key part of her campaign, seeking to present herself to voters as someone who will fight abortion restrictions. Earlier this week, she said she \"trusts women to make decisions about their own bodies.\"\n\nHe criticized her for what he described as the Biden administration's failures, including on border security between the United States and Mexico. On Wednesday, speakers who took the stage before the Republican candidate attacked Harris' record on the border, emphasizing that she was tasked with leading a White House effort to address immigration issues. Harris' name was repeatedly booed during their speeches.\n\n\"She was given this job, and she failed,\" said Brandon Judd, former president of the National Border Patrol Council, the union that represents the agents.\n\nTrump also accused her of being equally responsible for Biden's policy on the U.S.-Mexico border, which has seen arrests for illegal crossings peak in late 2023, and reiterated his promise to carry out mass deportations with the help of local police.\n\n\"She's now trying to get rid of her record,\" Trump said, calling Harris the \"border czar,\" a term that has become popular among Republicans but is not based on facts.\n\n\"Kamala's murderous destruction of America's borders is completely and utterly disqualifying. She should not be allowed to run for president with what she has done,\" Trump told his supporters.\n\nIn the days since the assassination attempt on him, Trump has indicated that he might tone down some of his rhetoric. He appeared to do so with a relatively moderate speech at the Republican National Convention, but he has since returned to some of his old rhetoric.\n\n\"You know, I was supposed to be nice,\" Trump said. \"They say something happened to me when I got shot. I became nice. And when you're dealing with these people, they're very dangerous people. When you're dealing with them, you can't be too nice, you really can't be, so if you don't mind, I'm not going to be nice. Is that okay with you?\"\n\nTrump also dodged his plan to debate Harris, initially saying he wanted Fox News, not ABC, to host the matchup he had originally scheduled for September with Mr. Biden. On Tuesday, Trump appeared to change that message again, saying on a call with reporters that he would like to debate Harris \"more than once,\" but not committing to the currently scheduled debate and saying he had only agreed to debate Mr. Biden twice, not Harris.\n\nSupporters of former President Donald Trump line up before a campaign rally at Bojangles Coliseum on July 24, 2024, in Charlotte, North Carolina. Brandon Bell/Getty Images\n\nAt 81, Mr. Biden should have been the oldest candidate in the presidential race. Trump, 78, now holds that spot. Harris, 59, has launched a campaign that, at least in some areas, appears to be attracting the interest of younger voters who could play a key role in a tight general election.\n\nRepublicans view North Carolina as a crucial state\n\nNorth Carolina is a state that Trump won in his previous two campaigns, but by less than 1.5 percentage points over Mr. Biden in 2020, the narrowest margin of any state Trump won. Trump campaigned heavily in North Carolina, even as the COVID-19 pandemic continued, while Mr. Biden largely stayed off the campaign trail and did not personally visit the state in the final 16 days of the election.\n\nMecklenburg County, home to Charlotte -- the state's largest city -- was also home to Trump's narrowest margin of victory in North Carolina's Republican primary, beating former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley by less than 8 percentage points.\n\nThis year, Trump had planned to hold his first rally since his bribe trial began in Fayetteville, but that event was canceled due to bad weather, so Trump called in from his private plane.\n\nDemocrats seek to turn things around in North Carolina\n\nDemocrats also worked to win North Carolina, where the party's last presidential victory was in 2008, when former President Barack Obama was elected, despite the Republican Party's recent dominance.\n\nMr. Biden held a campaign event in Raleigh the day after his disastrous debate with Trump in June. While he was much more energetic in that appearance than in the debate, it did little to quell growing concern among members of his party about his ability to recapture the White House.\n\nWith Harris now set to take her place, she may again look to North Carolina for political help: The state's governor, Roy Cooper, is among the Democrats Harris' campaign is considering for a possible vice presidential running mate.\n\nCooper is term-limited and cannot run again. The hotly contested race to replace him pits Democratic Attorney General Josh Stein against Republican Lt. Gov.

Get out of here! You're fired! \" bellowed Trump, eliciting roars from the throng of supporters crammed into the indoor arena for his campaign event.\n\nHe began by targeting Harris with, \"Now we have a new victim to defeat, Lyin' Kamala Harris,\" which was met with jeers. He then lambasted her: \"For three and a half years, Lyin' Kamala Harris has been the ultra-liberal driving force behind every single Biden catastrophe. She is a radical left lunatic who will destroy our country if she gets the chance to get into office. We're not going to let that happen,\" sparking another wave of applause.\n\nThis rally marked Trump's first public campaign appearance since Joe Biden announced he wouldn't be running in the 2024 presidential race. The ex-president's choice to campaign in North Carolina swing state he previously clinched but where Democrats are making strides underscores his commitment to reclaiming the state this November, reports the Mirror US.\n\nMoreover, Trump is casting his sights on traditionally Democratic territories, such as Minnesota, which he's scheduled to visit next Saturday.\n\nREAD MORE: Kamala Harris makes savage joke about Donald Trump that will have him fuming\n\nHis rally also marks the second event since he narrowly escaped an assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania. Trump has devoted considerable time readying to take on Biden in the upcoming November election and his focus now shifts towards Vice President Kamala Harris, who is gradually gaining traction as the Democratic frontrunner.\n\nDuring his Wednesday pit stop, Trump was gearing up to unload a volley of criticism directed at Harris. Following Biden's surprising step away from the presidential race, his attacks on Harris turned more fervent, labelling her as \"the same as Biden but much more radical.\"\n\nHe partly blames her for what he perceives as the shortcomings of the Biden administration, most notably border security issues.\n\nTrump's plans for a potential debate with Harris remain somewhat unclear. Initially, he voiced a preference for Fox News over ABC to host the September scheduled debate with Biden. However, his position seemed to have shifted again during a reporter's call on Tuesday. He showed interest in engaging in a debate with Harris \"more than once\", yet didn't confirm his attendance for the currently scheduled debate.\n\nHe also confirmed he had only agreed upon two debates with Biden, not Harris. Meanwhile, Harris spent her Wednesday in Indiana.\n\nSpeaking to members of the historically Black sorority Zeta Phi Beta, she made it clear that \"we are not playing around.\"\n\nShe sought their backing for her presidential bid in the upcoming November elections, which she characterised as \"a choice between two different visions for our nation, one focused on the future, the other focused on the past.\"\n\nIt's been a whopping 16 years since Indiana voters threw their support behind a Democratic presidential candidate. However, Harris, who proudly identifies as Black and South Asian, was speaking to an audience already excited by her historic potential as the likely Democratic nominee.\n\nHer campaign is banking on this group to help expand its coalition. In hushed tones, Republicans have admitted that swapping Biden for Harris weakens part of their party's argument about Trump's vitality and energy.\n\nAt 81, Biden would have been the oldest presidential nominee entering a general election. Now, that mantle falls to the 78 year old Trump.\n\nHarris, at 59, has kicked off a campaign that seems to be sparking interest among younger voters, who could play a crucial role in determining the outcome of what's expected to be a tight general election.\n\nNorth Carolina, a state that Trump managed to secure in both his previous campaigns, was won by less than 1.5 percentage points over Biden in 2020, marking the tightest margin of any state Trump claimed. Despite the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, Trump campaigned heavily in North Carolina, while Biden largely refrained from physical campaigning and did not personally visit the state in the final 16 days of the election.\n\nMecklenburg County, which houses Charlotte - the largest city in the state - also witnessed Trump's narrowest margin of victory in North Carolina's GOP primary, where he edged out Nikki Haley by less than eight percentage points. This year, Trump had intended to host his first rally since the commencement of his hush money trial in Fayetteville, but the event was cancelled due to poor weather conditions.\n\nInstead, Trump called in from his private plane.\n\nThe Democrats have also been striving to secure North Carolina, a state where the party's most recent presidential win was Barack Obama's 2008 triumph, despite the recent dominance of the GOP. Following his heated June debate with Trump, Biden made an appearance at a campaign event in Raleigh.\n\nDespite showcasing a more assertive demeanour than at the debate, it did little to alleviate growing concerns within his party about his chances of reclaiming the White House. Harris is now poised to replace him, and she may look to North Carolina for political backing.\n\nTrump's Charlotte appearance marks his second campaign rally following the shocking assassination attempt on him at a Pennsylvania rally on July 13. After recovering, he graciously accepted the GOP's presidential nomination and gave a stirring speech at the Republican National Convention, all while visibly sporting bandages from the shooting incident.\n\nIn a dramatic development related to the security breach, Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle has stepped down.

Trump's visit to North Carolina, a swing state he has carried in the past, reflects his efforts to secure it for the upcoming election. He has intensified his criticism of Harris, blaming her for perceived failures of the Biden administration, particularly on border security. Trump has also hinted at potential debates with Harris, showing hesitancy and changing his stance on the matter. Republicans are concerned about the shift from Biden to Harris, as it impacts their argument in favor of Trump's vitality and vigor. North Carolina has been a battleground state, with Trump winning it in previous elections by narrow margins. The upcoming election poses a challenge for both parties, with Democrats working to win back the state despite recent Republican dominance.

He endorsed Harris, and Democrats have lined up behind her. Harris took in record fundraising hauls and some polls have shown a tighter race between Harris and Trump.\n\n\"He quit because he was losing so badly in the polls,\" Trump said.\n\nIt was Trump's first event in North Carolina since he survived an assassination attempt this month in Pennsylvania. Nearly every speaker made reference to the incident, citing God's hand in preventing Trump from more serious injury. Trump sustained an ear injury during the incident, which occurred at a rural, open-air rally.\n\nAfter the incident, Trump and other Republicans signaled the experience would lead to a change in his temperament and calls for unity in the divided nation.\n\n\"I became nice,\" Trump said. He then asked the crowd: \"If you don't mind, I'm not going to be nice.\"\n\nTrump, who typically gives his political opponents derogatory nicknames, called Harris \"Lyin' Kamala\" over and over again.\n\nThe crowd loved it. Video criticizing Harris on immigration policies was playing before the speech as the crowd booed loudly.\n\nAbout 10,000 Trump supporters filled Bojangles Coliseum, including Daune Galbraith, who arrived at 8 a.m. -- 10 hours before Trump was scheduled to begin speaking -- for her first Trump rally.\n\n\"He's for the people,\" said Galbraith, who lives in Greensboro and said she is excited to vote for Trump a third time. \"He is going to take care of America. He is going to bring back the America I grew up loving.\"\n\nTrump defeated Hilary Clinton in 2016 before losing to Biden and Harris in 2020. With Harris' ascension to the top of the ticket, Democrats hope to turn the election into a referendum on Trump -- who has twice lost the popular vote -- rather than a debate about the ability of Biden to do the job for another four years.\n\n\"She is fighting to protect our democracy,\" Mark Jerrell, the vice chair of the Mecklenburg County Board of Commissioners, said during a press event Wednesday morning. \"She's fighting to strengthen America's position in the world. The stakes of this election couldn't be higher.\"\n\nDespite the burst of enthusiasm for Harris, some Trump supporters believe he will have no problem winning in November.\n\n\"Because what has she done?\" said Trump supporter Sheri McReynolds, who is from Wake Forest.\n\nSeveral Republican officials, officeholders and candidates delivered short speeches, previewing the attacks on Harris over immigration, border security and liberal positions during her time as U.S. Senator.\n\n\"She's a San Francisco liberal who wants to turn the whole country into San Francisco,\" said U.S. Rep. Richard Hudson, who is leading the Republican effort to keep the U.S. House of Representatives. \"... She is wrong for America.\"\n\nCongressional candidate Mark Harris delivered a prayer to begin the event around 4 p.m. North Carolina House Speaker Tim Moore, who is running for U.S. House, spoke and earned his biggest cheer when he endorsed a proposed constitutional amendment to ban non-citizens from voting in the state. The proposal would reaffirm an existing state constitutional provision.\n\nU.S. Rep. Dan Bishop, the Republican nominee for attorney general, and Republican National Committee chairman Michael Whatley, the former North Carolina Republican Party chairman, also spoke. Each took shots at Harris, who has quickly united the Democratic Party with an immense fundraising haul, hitting her over immigration. Whatley said the November election is about \"strength versus weakness.\"\n\nLt. Gov. Mark Robinson, who is typically a featured speaker at Trump rallies, wasn't part of the program. And when Trump encouraged the crowd to vote for North Carolina Republicans -- listing them by name -- Robinson, the GOP's gubernatorial candidate, wasn't mentioned.\n\nPolice and Secret Service personnel were visible nearly everywhere outside and inside of the site, not surprising given the assassination attempt in Pennsylvania earlier in the month. The head of the Secret Service resigned this week under pressure from lawmakers.\n\n\"As you move to an indoor site, it opens up a number of different vulnerabilities that you don't have,\" former U.S. Secret Service agent Paul Eckloff told WRAL. \"A farm field is a far more controlled environment with separate ingress and egress to protect the staff, press and VIP ease.\"\n\nBut, he added, an indoor venue like the Bojangles Coliseum is \"already designed for crowd control.\"\n\nTrump carried North Carolina twice -- including by less than 1.5% in 2020 -- and has been favored to do so again, even as Democrats have made frequent campaign stops across the state. Harris has visited the state seven times in 2024.\n\nDemocratic Gov. Roy Cooper, who won the state twice with Trump on the ballot, is among the top contenders to be Harris' vice-presidential choice. Trump picked U.S. Sen. JD Vance of Ohio to be his vice president. Trump didn't mention Cooper or any other potential Democratic vice presidential candidates.\n\nInstead, he focused his broadsides on Harris and, to a lesser degree, Biden. It was a typical Trump speech, veering off and on his teleprompter, infused with humor and hitting many familiar topics -- protecting women's sports from transgender competitors, crimes committed by undocumented immigrants, a riff on Hannibal Lecter, the fictional killer who eats his victims.\n\nTrump said Harris \"can't ever be trusted\" and that she \"brazenly\" lied about Biden's mental capacity.\n\nPerhaps trying to neutralize a political weakness, Trump defended his position on abortion -- seen by Democrats as a potential liability for Trump, who appointed three Supreme Court justices that voted to overturn the landmark Roe v. Wade ruling.\n\nHe told the crowd that he supports abortion rights in cases of rape, incest and when the life of the mother is in danger but added that people need to \"follow their heart\" on the issue. Trump, as he has in the past, said the issue should stand with the states.", "source": {"uri": "wral.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WRAL"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

(Photo by Galen Bacharier/NC Newsline)\n\nCHARLOTTE -- Former President Donald Trump launched a volley of attacks on Vice President Kamala Harris in a speech on Wednesday, calling her \"stupid,\" a \"lunatic\" and \"ultra-liberal\" in his first campaign rally since her ascension as the all but certain Democratic nominee.\n\nAddressing several thousand supporters at a packed Bojangles Coliseum in Charlotte, Trump painted Harris as \"incompetent\" and \"radical,\" ticking through her voting record as a senator and declaring her the \"driving force\" of the Biden White House.\n\n\"For three and a half years, lyin' Kamala Harris has been the ultra-liberal driving force behind every single Biden catastrophe,\" Trump said.\n\nThroughout he and other speakers' remarks, almost every mention of the vice president prompted loud boos. And throughout his hour-plus speech, Trump repeatedly returned to her role in immigration policy -- at one point referring to a \"Kamala Harris border invasion.\"\n\nHe took aim at her background as a prosecutor and attorney general, declaring that she \"ruined San Francisco.\" And he scrutinized her policy stances on criminal justice and policing, while mocking contrasts her campaign has drawn between them.\n\n\"They get me to that position and then the campaign says 'I'm a prosecutor,' and I'm a convicted felon,\" Trump said, referencing his conviction in a New York criminal trial. \"I don't think people are going to buy it.\"\n\nEchoing an ad released by his campaign earlier this week, Trump branded the vice president \"the most liberal elected politician in American history,\" and the \"original Marxist.\" Both of these claims are demonstrably false.\n\n\"She makes Bernie look like a moderate,\" he said. \"(U.S. Sen.) Bernie Sanders, he's actually quite moderate by comparison.\"\n\nPrior to the Wednesday rally, Trump last visited North Carolina in late May. Harris, who swiftly coalesced support from Democrats in North Carolina and nationally in recent days after President Joe Biden announced his decision that he would not seek reelection, has visited twice in recent weeks with events in Greensboro and Fayetteville prior to becoming the all-but-certain nominee of her party.\n\nThe former president swiftly addressed Biden bowing out of the race, telling supporters that \"he quit.\"\n\n\"He was losing so badly in the polls and down by a lot, so he quit,\" Trump said. \"But really, what happened was the leaders of the Democrat Party did a very undemocratic move.\"\n\nAnd though Biden no longer tops the ticket for November, he was still the target of numerous criticisms from his 2020 opponent. Trump called him a \"fake liberal\" while contrasting him with Harris, and recalled a conversation in which Biden was called \"cognitively a degenerate.\"\n\n\"I wish him well, but I don't like him,\" Trump said. \"He's not a nice person. He's trying to put me in jail, why would I like him?\"\n\nThose who attended the rally and spoke to NC Newsline expressed confidence that Trump would emerge victorious in November, despite now facing a new opponent.\n\nJohn Yopp, a law enforcement officer and former candidate for sheriff from Jacksonville, North Carolina, called Biden's stepping aside for Harris \"totally undemocratic.\" And he equated the vice president's candidacy to the infamous \"New Coke\" marketing campaign.\n\n\"It got a lot of people's attention, but it was superficial, it disappeared quickly,\" Yopp said. \"That's what's going to happen here.\"\n\nAnother said he didn't believe Trump's chances of victory had changed despite Harris now leading the Democratic ticket.\n\n\"At the end of the day, her policies are Biden's policies,\" said Doyle Ball, who traveled from Tennessee to attend the Wednesday rally.\n\nAn array of Republicans that will appear on the ballot below Trump threw their support behind the nominee ahead of his speech Wednesday.\n\nMark Harris, who is running for Congress in North Carolina's 8th House District, led the coliseum in prayer. It was \"an act of God\" that prevented Trump from further injury during the assassination attempt in Pennsylvania, he said.\n\n\"It is by your grace and by your mercy and your hand that was upon President Trump that caused him to turn his head,\" Harris said.\n\nSpeaker of the House Tim Moore, also seeking a seat in Congress, touted the Republican-led legislature's priorities in recent years. And U.S. Rep. Dan Bishop, running for attorney general, sought to tie his Democratic opponent to Harris, calling them \"radical.\"\n\n\"The last thing North Carolina needs, and America needs, is more prosecutors like Jeff Jackson and Kamala Harris,\" Bishop said.\n\nHarris' campaign gathered local officials for a press conference ahead of the rally -- continuing to home in on abortion rights and Project 2025 as top lines of attack against Trump.\n\nThe wide-ranging conservative policy agenda from the Heritage Foundation has increasingly come into focus from Democrats, who say it is effectively a blueprint for Trump's second term in office. The former president has dismissed the plan and tried to distance himself from its authors and endorsers, a number of whom served in his administration.\n\n\"Donald Trump's Project 2025 threatens to roll back the rights and freedoms of the American people and give the presidency more power and less accountability than ever before,\" Mecklenburg County Commissioner Mark Jerrell said.\n\nThe campaign also featured Hadley Duvall, a sexual assault survivor and abortion rights advocate who featured in a prominent ad for Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear's campaign.\n\n\"Donald Trump has come to North Carolina today to brag about how he overturned Roe v. Wade and ripped away reproductive freedom from women and girls across the country,\" Duvall said. \"He is proudly responsible for each and every one of the cruel abortion bans across the country, including the one in effect here in North Carolina.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bojangles_Coliseum", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bojangles Coliseum"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernie_Sanders", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bernie Sanders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney_General", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney General"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Criminal justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liberalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_to_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Immigration to the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marxism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheriff", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sheriff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "History of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politician", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacksonville,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville, North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greensboro,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Greensboro, North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Greensboro, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fayetteville,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fayetteville, North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Fayetteville, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobbs_v._Jackson_Women's_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dobbs v.

Because that's not abortion that's the execution of a baby.'\n\nDonald Trump shifted his attention from 'Crooked Joe Biden' to 'Lyin', lunatic Kamala Harris' during first rally after vice president became his likely 2024 opponent. Pictured: Trump speaks to his fans at a rally in Charlotte, North Carolina on Wednesday\n\nThe six conservative Supreme Court justices - including three appointed by Trump - ruled in June 2022 to overturn Roe v. Wade and send back to the state the ability to legislate on abortion.\n\nPresident Joe Biden announced in a one-page letter posted to social media on Sunday that he was ending his reelection bid after weeks of pressure following a disastrous debate against Trump.\n\nHe then sent a follow-up post on X endorsing Harris to take his place at the top of the Democratic ballot in November.\n\nEarlier this week, Harris earned enough delegates to earn the Democratic Party's nomination at the Convention in Chicago next month.\n\nIn the 2024 campaign, Democrats are really leaning into the abortion argument, and hoping to earn the vote of women in some battleground states like North Carolina and Pennsylvania who are casting their ballot on the single issue of women's healthcare.\n\nBut Trump also hit 'lyin' Kamala Harris' on other topics during his Wednesday speech, including for her failure to quell the migration crisis after Biden put her in charge of addressing the uptick in crossings at the southern border.\n\n'If 'border czar' Harris gets in charge, every week will bring a never-ending stream of illegal alien rapists, bloodthirsty killers and child predators to go after our sons and our daughters - that's what's going to happen. Everyone knows that,' Trump claimed.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris is now the presumed Democratic presidential nominee\n\nPresident Joe Biden addressed the nation Wednesday night in an address discussing his decision to drop out of his reelection race and endorse his No. 1 for the spot. His remarks began just 10 minutes after Trump concluded his rally in Charlotte, North Carolina\n\nHe also vowed to end all of Biden's border policies on Day One of a second term. This is similar to what the President did in 2021 when he reversed all of Trump's immigration policies that kept crossings at bay.\n\n'Joe Biden made [Harris] the border czar and that's when it really got bad,' Trump said. 'She launched a colossal illegal alien invasion of our country. She said, 'Come on in.' Remember?'\n\n'On my very first day back in the White House I will terminate every single open border policy of the Biden-Harris administration,' he vowed. 'And we will seal the border and we will stop Kamala Harris invasion without delay. It will happen immediately.'\n\nThe former president also provided what he thinks could be a solution to addressing national defense failures - firing U.S. Generals and putting NASCAR drivers and football coaches in charge of the Military.\n\n'I've always said, get these guys, I have a lot of friends in this word [NASCAR],' Trump said.\n\n'I said let me use these guys to guide our military a little bit.'\n\n'When you can win so many races, that's O.K. You guide,' he continued. 'Same thing with coaches, you take some of the greatest football coaches, you put them at a table. 'What do you like coach?' Because in its own ways it's not so much really different.'\n\nHe was calling out NASCAR stars Roger Penske and Richard Childress, who were both in the crowd.\n\nChildress was brought on stage to introduce Trump at the Charlotte rally on Wednesday.\n\nHe got choked up when talking about Trump's tribute and meeting with the 13 gold star families who lost loved ones in the Afghanistan withdrawal.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Swing state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bojangles_Coliseum", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bojangles Coliseum"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_migration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Human migration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Roe v.

But his supporters see her gaining ground", "body": "CHARLOTTE, North Carolina -- Even Donald Trump's supporters sense he suddenly has a tougher race on his hands.\n\nAs the former president unloaded on Kamala Harris in the swing state of North Carolina on Wednesday -- calling her a \"radical, left lunatic\" at one point -- faithful fans conceded that what had been a sleepy contest had abruptly become something quite different.\n\nTo some, it seemed like the vice president had momentum.\n\n\"Policy aside and everything, she definitely has the energy,\" said Jessica Castillo, a self-described centrist from Charlotte who voted for Trump in both 2016 and 2020 and was at the Charlotte event. \"She is going to be a contender for Trump. Honestly, I think she'll be more of a challenge.\"\n\nTaking the stage at the Bojangles Coliseum, his first rally since President Joe Biden dropped out of the campaign, Trump ripped into the vice president, casting her as \"Lying Kamala Harris,\" mispronouncing her name as he dubbed her \"the most incompetent and far-left vice president in American history,\" and repeatedly declaring that she would \"destroy\" the United States, if elected.\n\nTrump has some reason for concern. Harris, after being endorsed by Biden to run at the top of the Democratic ticket, in recent days has seen a bump in polling compared to Biden's lagging performance, including among independents, people of color and women, among other critical voting blocs.\n\n\"Now,\" said Bryson Davis, an 18-year-old from Statesville, \"he's running against somebody that's competent. \"Kamala is probably going to come off a little more fiery than Joe would.\"\n\nOr as Castillo put it, \"The fact she isn't suffering from old age ... it's definitely going to give her a huge bump right away. She can talk. She can laugh, obviously.\"\n\nFor the former president, Harris' ascension was but a new invitation to fight -- and the crowd ate it up. They cheered when he conceded he was \"not going to be nice\" about Harris, despite saying he \"became nice\" after the attempted assassination on July 13.\n\nTrump on Wednesday fumed over the news coverage Harris has received as Democrats have coalesced around her since Sunday, insisting that his crowd sizes were still larger.\n\n\"Three weeks, four weeks ago, she was the worst politician in America,\" Trump said. \"Now they say, 'Isn't it amazing? Look at her. She's beautiful. She's so magnificent.'\"\n\nTrump this week agreed to debate Harris, and said he would be \"willing to do more than one debate\" against her. It's a forum his supporters appeared eager for.\n\nWhile predicting an eventual Trump-Harris debate would sway voters toward Trump, Jo Wally of Mooresville acknowledged the race seems closer now, \"because she's got the momentum.\"\n\nSitting next to her, Kelly Henderson said she feared some women who are soft Trump backers will shift away from him.\n\nTrump focused his attacks at the rally against Harris on her history as a prosecutor and senator, describing her as \"more liberal than Bernie Sanders,\" who \"destroyed San Francisco with her policies\" and will \"destroy our country if she's elected.\" His new Harris talking points were apparently distributed to speakers who took the stage before him, with Rep. Richard Hudson (R-N.C.), chair of the National Republican Congressional Committee, offering nearly identical criticism.\n\nWhat kind of attacks Republicans will consider in bounds is still a matter of uncertainty. After Speaker Mike Johnson this week chided GOP members about attacking Harris based on her race or gender -- a warning that came as at least one Republican congressman called her \"a DEI vice president\" -- Trump supporters at the rally Wednesday largely shrugged off concerns about whether her status as a woman of color would be used against her by Trump or Republican operatives.\n\nBefore the rally Wednesday, Steven Cheung, a spokesperson for Trump, said the campaign hasn't gone after Harris' race or gender, and so they didn't take issue with Johnson's guidance. But asked if taking that approach was off limits for Trump, Cheung said that it wasn't necessarily.\n\n\"I don't know it's off limits,\" he said. \"But it's not something that we've done. So it's not even on our radar.\"\n\nSimilarly, Michael Whatley, the chair of the Republican National Committee and former chair of the North Carolina Republican Party, in an interview declined to say whether he agreed with Johnson's remarks about staying away from Harris' race or gender -- instead, he said what he thought the party should focus on.\n\n\"Look, I think we need to talk about her being an extreme California liberal,\" Whatley said, criticizing policies she supported in her home state, in the Senate and as Biden's vice president.\n\nPressed again, Whatley said the Republican Party is \"going to focus all day, every day on the American voters,\" and telling them about Trump's policies.\n\nEven before Trump took the stage, the GOP's focus -- evident in speakers' remarks before him -- had dramatically moved away from Biden and onto Harris. While the vice president came up at times throughout Trump's Saturday night rally in Grand Rapids, Michigan, now all but certain to become the nominee, she was the center of attack Wednesday.\n\nTwice in his on-stage remarks, Whatley referred to her as \"Border Czar Kamala Harris,\" and slammed her record in the Senate. Hudson one-upped Trump on describing Harris as a progressive senator, not only saying that she was \"more liberal\" than Sanders, but also Sen. Elizabeth Warren.\n\nCriticizing Harris for failing to attend Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's joint address to Congress earlier Wednesday, Trump falsely claimed that Harris, whose husband is Jewish, is \"totally against the Jewish people.\"\n\n\"It amazes me how Jewish people will vote for the Democrats when they're being treated so disrespectfully,\" Trump said.\n\nThroughout the rest of his speech, Trump railed against transgender athletes, briefly discussed his attempted assassination, reiterated his position in favor of exceptions for abortion restrictions, bashed Democrats' southern border policies, falsely claimed Harris wants to \"outlaw red meat\" and gave what has now become his standard shoutout to Hannibal Lecter, a fictional character from the movie \"Silence of the Lambs.\"\n\nAsked whether Republicans would need to reevaluate their plans to spend time and money flipping blue states like Minnesota, where Trump is scheduled to hold a rally Saturday, Whatley said they were still focused on their 10-battleground state plan.\n\n\"Right now, we're playing offense,\" Whatley said. \"Right now, the Democrats aren't even playing defense yet. They're circling the wagons and trying to figure out how they can put a new candidate who's never won a single primary state in as their nominee, and how they can pick somebody to be the vice presidential nominee.\n\n\"It's important to note they not only had a bad messenger, but they had a bad message.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-left_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Far-left politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bojangles_Coliseum", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bojangles Coliseum"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Centrism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Person_of_color", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Person of color"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Swing state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "History of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liberalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Hudson_(American_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Richard Hudson (American politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Republican_Congressional_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Republican Congressional Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assassination of John F.

He is going to bring back the America I grew up loving.\"\n\nTrump, the former president who earned the Republican presidential nomination for the third consecutive time, is expected to turn his attention to Harris after months of campaigning against President Joe Biden.\n\nBiden, 81, announced Sunday that he would not run for re-election, bowing to pressure that mounted after a dismal debate performance against Trump. Democrats have lined up behind Harris, who is seeking to be the first woman president. Trump defeated Hilary Clinton in 2016, but lost to Biden in 2020.\n\n\"She is fighting to protect our democracy,\" Mark Jerrell, the vice chair of the Mecklenburg County Board of Commissioners, said during a press event Wednesday morning. \"She's fighting to strengthen America's position in the world. The stakes of this election couldn't be higher.\"\n\nSeveral Republican officials, officeholders and candidates delivered short speeches, previewing the attacks on Harris over immigration, border security and liberal positions during her time as U.S. Senator.\n\n\"She's a San Francisco liberal who wants to turn the whole country into San Francisco,\" said U.S. Rep. Richard Hudson, who is leading the Republican effort to keep the U.S. House of Representatives.. \"... She is wrong for America.\"\n\nTrump had opened up a polling edge on Biden. In early polling since Harris became the presumptive nominee, the results are mixed with Harris seemingly closing the gap. But some Trump supporters believe he will have no problem with Harris.\n\n\"Because what has she done?\" said Trump supporter Sheri McReynolds, who is from Wake Forest.\n\nCongressional candidate Mark Harris delivered a prayer to begin the event around 4 p.m. North Carolina House Speaker Tim Moore, who is running for U.S. House, spoke and earned his biggest cheer when he endorsed a proposed constitutional amendment to ban non-citizens from voting in the state. The proposal would reaffirm an existing state constitutional provision.\n\nU.S. Rep. Dan Bishop, the Republican nominee for attorney general, and Republican National Committee chairman Michael Whatley, the former North Carolina Republican Party chairman, also spoke. Each took shots at Harris, who has quickly united the Democratic Party with an immense fundraising haul, hitting her over immigration. Whatley said the November election is about \"strength versus weakness.\"\n\nIt is Trump's first event in North Carolina since an assassination attempt this month in Pennsylvania. Nearly every speaker made reference to the incident, citing God's hand in preventing Trump from more serious injury. Trump sustained an ear injury during the incident, which occurred at a rural, open-air rally.\n\nThe Bojangles Coliseum in Charlotte is an indoor venue. Police and Secret Service personnel were visible nearly everywhere outside and inside of the site. The head of the Secret Service resigned under pressure from lawmakers after the assassination attempt.\n\n\"As you move to an indoor site, it opens up a number of different vulnerabilities that you don't have,\" former U.S. Secret Service agent Paul Eckloff told WRAL. \"A farm field is a far more controlled environment with separate ingress and egress to protect the staff, press and VIP ease.\"\n\nBut, he added, an indoor venue like the Bojangles Coliseum is \"already designed for crowd control.\"\n\nTrump carried North Carolina twice -- including by less than 1.5% in 2020 -- and is favored to do so again, even as Democrats have made frequent campaign stops across the state. Harris has visited the state seven times in 2024.\n\nDemocratic Gov. Roy Cooper, who won the state twice with Trump on the ballot, is among the top contenders to be Harris' vice-presidential choice.

In Charlotte rally, Trump proved he hasn't changed a bit | Opinion", "body": "He even admitted as much in Charlotte Wednesday, during a rally in which he railed against \"his new victim to defeat,\" whom he anointed with the nickname \"Lyin' Kamala Harris.\"\n\n\"When you're dealing with these people, they're very dangerous people, when you're dealing with them, you can't be too nice,\" Trump told the crowd at his first campaign appearance since President Joe Biden's sudden exit from the race. \"So if you don't mind, I'm not going to be nice.\"\n\nWhat followed was a roughly 90-minute rant in which Trump fulfilled that promise. At various points throughout his speech, Trump called Harris \"crazy,\" \"unfit to lead,\" \"the original Marxist,\" \"a radical left lunatic who will destroy our country\" and \"the most incompetent and far left vice president in American history.\"\n\nTrump attempted to pin responsibility for the current administration's actions squarely upon Harris herself, the \"ultra-liberal driving force behind every Biden administration catastrophe,\" he said.\n\n\"She shouldn't even be allowed to run for president for what she's done. She's committing crimes,\" Trump, who has been indicted four times and convicted of 34 felonies, said.\n\nTrump also made wildly exaggerated and outright false claims about Harris' record, including that Harris is a \"radical crazy person on abortion\" because she \"wants abortion right up to birth and even after birth.\"\n\nThe list of complaints about Harris was so exhaustive that Trump even warned that she wants to \"ban red meat.\"\n\n\"That means no more cows, you know, this is serious,\" Trump said.\n\nBecause it couldn't be a Trump rally without him mentioning crowd sizes, Trump bemoaned the media for mentioning the crowd sizes at Harris' events but not his.\n\nTrump's fellow Republicans at the rally also didn't bother much with the whole unity thing. That included U.S. Rep. Dan Bishop, who told supporters in an email ahead of the event that Trump would be joining him at a rally instead of the other way around. Bishop spent his time attacking Jeff Jackson, his fellow congressman and opponent in the upcoming election for North Carolina attorney general. Bishop sought to associate Jackson with Harris, calling them both \"Soros prosecutors posing as moderate and reasonable and mainstream.\"\n\n\"The progressive Democrats are out to destroy you, your families, your country, everything you've worked for and valued,\" Bishop warned the crowd.\n\nWhy bother with unity when you can go with some good old-fashioned fearmongering instead?\n\nOf course, no one really expected the GOP's rhetorical makeover to pan out. It was, after all, only a matter of time before the attacks on Harris began.\n\nWhile Trump largely avoided overt racist or sexist attacks on Harris at Wednesday's rally, he refused to pronounce her first name correctly, something that has become so common among Republicans that The Washington Post assembled a tracker at the Republican National Convention.\n\nOn Wednesday, he labeled her \"Lyin' Kamala Harris,\" though in recent days he has also referred to her as \"Dumb as a Rock Kamala\" and mocked her laugh by calling her \"Laughing Kamala.\" Some Republican politicians have called her a \"DEI hire\" or a \"DEI president\" and suggested she wasn't even qualified to be vice president, let alone president, despite her lengthy resume.\n\nTrump claimed at the GOP convention that, after surviving an assassination attempt, he was a changed man who would be a president for \"all of America.\"\n\nBut Wednesday's rally made it clear: no matter what happens, and no matter who he's running against, he's still the same old Trump.

(AP) -- Donald Trump unleashed a barrage of attack lines Wednesday against his likely new opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, whom he called his \"new victim to defeat\" and accused of deceiving the public about President Joe Biden 's ability to run for a second term.\n\nThe rally in Charlotte, North Carolina marked his first public campaign event since Biden dropped out of the 2024 matchup and Harris became the Democrats' likely nominee. The rally concluded minutes before Biden addressed the nation to explain he dropped his reelection bid to \"pass the torch\" to Harris, who is 22 years younger than him.\n\n\"So now we have a new victim to defeat: Lyin' Kamala Harris,\" Trump said, labeling her \"the most incompetent and far-left vice president in American history.\"\n\nTrump called her a \"radical left lunatic\" and said she was \"crazy\" for her positions on abortion and on immigration. He also mispronounced her first name repeatedly, a denigrating approach to the first Black woman and person of South Asian descent likely to lead a major party's presidential ticket.\n\nTrump's speech signaled the next stage for the campaign may be especially brutal and personal, even as some GOP leaders warned Republican allies not to use overtly racist and sexist attacks against Harris.\n\nTrump has ramped up his criticism of the vice president since Biden's abrupt departure, calling Harris \"the same as Biden but much more radical.\"\n\nHe blamed her for what he portrays as the Biden administration's failures, particularly security along the U.S.-Mexico border. On Wednesday, the speakers who appeared on stage before the Republican nominee attacked Harris' record on the border, highlighting she was tasked with leading a White House effort to tackle migration issues. Harris' name was met with boos several times during the speeches.\n\n\"She was assigned that, she was given that task, and she failed,\" said Brandon Judd, former president of the National Border Patrol Council, the union that represents agents.\n\nTrump also accused Harris of being just as responsible for Biden's policies at the U.S.-Mexico border, which saw illegal crossing arrests reach record highs at the end of 2023 and repeated his pledge to conduct mass deportations with the help of local police.\n\n\"Kamala's deadly destruction of America's borders is completely and totally disqualifying. She shouldn't be allowed to run for president with what she's done,\" Trump told supporters.\n\nHarris, meanwhile, spent Wednesday in Indiana, telling members of the historically Black sorority Zeta Phi Beta that \"we are not playing around\" and asked for their help in electing her president in November, an election she characterized as \"a choice between two different visions for our nation, one focused on the future, the other focused on the past.\"\n\nHarris' campaign released a statement after Trump's speech describing it as \"unhinged, weird and rambling.\"\n\n\"Unity is over for Donald Trump,\" said campaign spokesperson Ammar Moussa, referring to unity pledges made during the Republican National Convention.\n\nHarris is expected to make abortion a key part of her campaign, looking to present herself to voters as someone who will fight against abortion restrictions. Earlier this week, she said she \"trusts women to make decisions about their own bodies.\"\n\nTrump has hedged on plans for an expected debate with Harris, first saying that he wanted Fox News, not ABC, to host the matchup he had originally scheduled for September with Biden. On Tuesday, Trump appeared to tweak that message again, saying on a call with reporters that he'd like to debate Harris \"more than once\" but not committing to appearing at the debate currently on the books and saying he'd only agreed to debate Biden twice, not Harris.\n\nQuietly, Republicans have spoken about how subbing Harris in for Biden nullifies a portion of their party's argument in favor of Trump's vitality and vigor.\n\nAt 81, Biden would have been the oldest presidential nominee heading into a general election. Now, the 78-year-old Trump occupies that slot. Harris, 59, has launched a campaign that at least in some corners appears to be stoking interest among the younger voters who could be key in deciding an anticipated close general election.\n\nTrump's stop in North Carolina shows he's concerned about keeping the state in his column this November, even as his team reaches for wins in traditionally Democratic-leaning states like Minnesota, which Trump is set to visit on Saturday.\n\nNorth Carolina is a state Trump carried in both his previous campaigns but by less than 1.5 percentage points over Biden in 2020, the closest margin of any state Trump won. Trump stumped heavily in North Carolina even as the COVID-19 pandemic wore on, while Biden largely kept off the physical campaign trail and did not personally visit the state in the last 16 days of the election.\n\nThis year, Trump had planned to hold his first rally since the start of his hush money trial in Fayetteville, but that event was called off due to inclement weather. Trump called in from his private plane instead.\n\nDemocrats also have been working to win North Carolina, where the party's most recent presidential win was Barack Obama's 2008 victory, despite recent GOP dominance.\n\nBiden held a campaign event in Raleigh the day after his disastrous June debate with Trump. While he was much more forceful in that appearance than he was on the debate stage, it did not help much to quell the growing concern from members of his party about his ability to win the White House again.\n\nTrump's Charlotte event was his second campaign rally since a July 13 assassination attempt at a Pennsylvania rally. Days later, Trump accepted the GOP presidential nomination and gave a speech at the Republican National Convention, where his ear -- injured in the shooting -- was bandaged.\n\nThe Charlotte rally, like one held Saturday in Grand Rapids, Michigan, was held in an indoor arena. Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung said it's \"to be determined\" if the campaign will no longer hold outdoor rallies due to security concerns.\n\nMeg Kinnard can be reached at

If you'd like some nightmare fuel beyond that time you forgot to wear sunscreen and wore a top with cutouts, it does, in fact, get worse: as the BBC reports, two food stalls had to be shut down by Live Nation at last weekend's Download Festival in Leicestershire, UK, following numerous reports of fans getting sick.\n\nThe aptly-titled Food Poisoning News is speculating that, according to reports from the Download medical tent, as many as 500 of the tens of thousands of people who attended the music festival between last Wednesday (June 12) and Sunday (June 16) were affected by the outbreak, with symptoms including nausea, diarrhea, stomach cramps, fever and general malaise.\n\nThose close to the matter even went so far as to describe it as a \"real food poisoning epidemic,\" and some festivalgoers apparently had to resort to using buckets as makeshift toilets amid their gastrointestinal distress. (It should be noted that Download is a camping festival, which just makes this all the worse.)\n\nTravelling from Norfolk, Will Ellis and his partner had \"pre-planned\" one of the food stalls they were eager to visit after enjoying it last year. Ellis apparently woke up the next morning with \"the most painful stomach ache,\" he and his partner both suffering diarrhea -- which \"ruined\" almost an entire day of the festival.\n\nDevon resident Megan Souster, a first-time Download attendee, said that she had \"never been so ill in my life,\" when she started to feel sick on Saturday night and proceeded to spend all of Sunday under her partner's care, too unwell to even make it to a medical tent. Souster said it took her four days to recover and she still wasn't feeling like herself when she spoke to BBC.\n\nSean Smith, frontman of Wales metal band Raiders, took to Twitter on Monday (June 17) to let fans know that he had food poisoning and had been \"sick all night,\" adding that he had to go to the hospital to be put on an IV.\n\nNorth West Leicestershire District Council (NWLDC) said that, when the pattern of fans falling ill became apparent, Live Nation launched an investigation that resulted in two of the vendors being forced to cease their operations at the festival after they \"failed to meet the standards of Environmental Health and the local authority.\" The promoter called customer well-being its \"primary concern,\" assuring that all vendors had been subject to inspection before and during the event.\n\n\"We are aware of reports of people feeling unwell and will continue to investigate,\" NWLDC's head of community services, Paul Sanders, told BBC. \"Anyone

According to reports from a medical tent on site (via FoodPoisoningNews), as many as 500 people were affected by what they described as a \"real food poisoning epidemic\".\n\nSpeaking to BBC News, a spokesperson for the North West Leicestershire District Council (NWLDC) said medics began to see \"a pattern\" of fans falling ill, prompting event organiser Live Nation to launch an investigation.\n\nLive Nation said that customer safety was its \"primary concern\" and confirmed that all food traders had been inspected before and during the event. The promotor added that two vendors \"were closed and removed from the site as they failed to meet the standards of Environment Health and the local authority\" (via LeicestershireLive).\n\nAmong those who reported illness were artists performing at the event, including Sean Smith - frontman of The Raiders - who revealed that he was hospitalised after the event and was put on an IV drip due to food poisoning.\n\nThe NHS lists common food poisoning symptoms as nausea, diarrhoea, vomiting, stomach cramps, high fever, and general feelings of unwellness, including fatigue, aches, and chills. These symptoms typically arise after consuming contaminated food that has been improperly cooked, stored, or handled.\n\nSpeaking to LeicestershireLive, Paul Sanders, head of community services at NWLDC, said: \"We carried out ongoing food hygiene safety checks on-site throughout the five days of the festival to ensure that all vendors were up to the required standards.\n\n\"Where we find improvements are required, we provide advice and carry out a further visit to ensure the improvements have been made. We worked with the event organiser to investigate two food vendors, both of which were closed by the event organiser over the course of the weekend.\"\n\nThe issue with food poisoning was just one of the many issues that plagued the 2024 edition of the festival, with the organisers also issuing warnings across the three-day span due to extreme weather conditions.\n\nThroughout the course of the event, heavy storms hit the Donington Park site, causing the space to turn into a mud bath - to the point where even Pantera referenced the sludgy fields in a tweet showing a snippet of their set: \"We had a great time today at Download! Here's a glimpse of our performance. Hope you guys had fun in the mud.\"\n\nAs well as that, a number of bands have dropped out of this year's edition due to the festival's former ties with Barclays, and the bank's role in the Israel-Palestine conflict.\n\nPest Control were the first band to pull out of the festival, saying that they would not \"take part in an event whose sponsor profits from facilitating a genocide\". Scowl, Speed and Zulu all boycotted the festival later, as well as Enter Shikari.\n\nThe number of boycotts eventually led to Barclays pulling out of a number of festivals including Download, Latitude and Isle Of Wight.\n\nDespite the issues, NME praised the event in a recent review, and highlighted how the line-up this year marked a huge step in the right direction.\n\n\"At first glance, Download 2024 seemed to be marred by a range of factors that could have signalled its downfall - even festival boss Andy Copping admitted that it was the \"hardest year\" to secure a line-up and the team approached over \"21 bands\" to find headliners,\" it read.\n\n\"Yet, against the odds, the festival delivers one of its most promising editions in recent memory, and proves that it is one of the main events leading the way when it comes to creating opportunities for the next generation of headliners.\"", "source": {"uri": "nme.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NME Music News, Reviews, Videos,

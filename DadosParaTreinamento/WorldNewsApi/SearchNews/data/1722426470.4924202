{"id": 243359802, "title": "Ger Canning: Farewell to everyone\u2019s friend, M\u00edche\u00e1l \u00d3 Muircheartaigh", "text": "As we neared the end of our journey a very emotional Leitrim man reached out with his right hand to greet M\u00edche\u00e1l. And I will always remember his words: 'M\u00edche\u00e1l \u00d3 Muircheartaigh, you're everyone's friend'. And he was, and always had been deeply imbedded in the affection and admiration of countless sports fans throughout the length and breath of this country and far beyond. Long before RT\u00c9 TV and GAAGO brought pictures of Gaelic games action into the homes of the Irish diaspora, M\u00edche\u00e1l was the critical link with home, bringing lively, vivid, colourful descriptions of great (and not so great) hurling and football matches from every corner of Ireland. He was a most worthy successor to the late Michael O'Hehir, another giant of sports broadcasting. And when the latter fell ill in 1985, M\u00edche\u00e1l carried on the great tradition of sports commentary, primarily on radio. Although, at an earlier stage in his career he was associated with the minor matches (then played before the senior) which he carried off with great style in his beautiful natural Corca Dhuibhne Irish. I first met him the day I started on TV in 1980 in P\u00e1irc U\u00ed Chaoimh. His friendliness (that word again) was the first thing that struck you. Later that year we worked side by side on some Leinster hurling matches and my wife Yvonne was with me. Immediately he said, \u201cOh we must get you a chair\u201d. Ever the gentleman! Among his great talents as a broadcaster was his ability to tell a story. His voice sounded as though he was telling you the story, and one which you must hear because it's such an exciting story. So every match became a story with a beginning, middle and an end. And, like all stories, there had to be heroes and villains. However, it was never in his nature to castigate anyone who fell short in the pursuit of excellence. He was a storyteller of great warmth, one we have all been so fortunate to hear in his prime. From 1980 until he retired in 2011 I was privileged to share the workspace with M\u00edche\u00e1l most Sundays throughout the GAA season, he on radio, me doing television. He was a very punctual individual and that always meant there was time beforehand to consider how the match might go and what to look out for. I greatly valued his expertise, his wisdom, and the generous manner in which he was only too willing to help those of us trying to get a foot on the first rung of the commentary ladder. He lived a long and hugely productive life and part of the secret of his success was his great humour and light-hearted spirit. We worked for many years on greyhound racing. He loved the dogs and occasionally this became apparent during his hurling commentaries. One day in Nowlan Park he was broadcasting a National League match between Kilkenny and Wexford. At one point this happened: \u201cLine ball to Kilkenny, Joe Hennessy to take it. We'll check on the watch. 29.35. 'Twould be a good time at Shelbourne Park. Joe Hennessy takes the line ball...\u201d Global adventures I was fortunate to work with him several times in Australia on International Rules matches, and there were matches as well in the States. He was a very keen golfer and a very good one. On one trip to Melbourne he was joined by his brother Paddy. M\u00edche\u00e1l needed a new driver to boost his game. There was sufficient time between matches and attending training sessions to go searching sports shots. With Paddy's help he bought this wonderful new club which he hoped would fundamentally improve his game and brought it back to his bedroom in the hotel, where we were told he spent time perfecting his 'swing'. Unfortunately, he placed the new driver in an upright position in the corner of his room when he went to dinner. Sadly.......the place he chose to put it was in the waste paper basket. When he returned some hours later the beautiful new golf club was nowhere to be seen. He checked at reception. Reception queried housekeeping. Alas, it had been assumed to be waste and the duty manager broke the sad news. \u201cIt's been shredded, sir.\" He used to tell the story of one day being outside Macy's on Herald Square in New York where he decided to buy a newspaper from a street vendor whose people were more likely to be from Kansas rather than Killarney. \u201cDo you by any chance have a copy of The Kerryman?\u201d he reportedly asked. According to M\u00edche\u00e1l, the vendor rustled through a bunch of newspapers and came back with the reply, \u201cDo you want the North Kerry edition or the South Kerry one?\u201d He was always full of fun and the most wonderful company. After retirement we were fortunate enough to still see him in Croke Park and there was always a huge welcome from my media colleagues when we shared a cup of tea before going out to view another big game. I met him with his son Aonghus before last year's All-Ireland football final, where his beloved Kerry were attempting to retain their crown against Dublin. He asked me for my thoughts on the game. I told him I thought that the Dubs would win this time. M\u00edche\u00e1l just nodded. 'I suppose you're right'. The country has lost one of the greatest communicators we have been so fortunate to know and love. Farewell M\u00edche\u00e1l, you've been everyone's friend.", "summary": "The country has lost one of the greatest communicators we have been so fortunate to know and love", "url": "https://www.irishexaminer.com/opinion/commentanalysis/arid-41424109.html", "image": "https://www.irishexaminer.com/cms_media/module_img/8364/4182151_3_seoimage1x1_2858470_1_.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 06:35:24", "author": "Ger Canning,Irishexaminer.com", "authors": ["Ger Canning", "Irishexaminer.com"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "ie", "sentiment": 0.339}

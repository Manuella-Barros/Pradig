accusations Israel was deliberately targeting and starving Gazan civilians.\n\nNetanyahu, who has often spoke to foreign media during the war but largely avoided interviews with Israeli outlets, said the ratio of militants to civilians killed so far in the Israeli offensive was \"the lowest rate we have seen in an urban war\".\n\nHundreds of demonstrators rallied late Thursday outside the offices of private broadcaster TF1, LCI's parent company, in Paris's western suburbs, to protest the broadcast.\n\nWearing black and white keffiyeh scarves and waving Palestinian flags, the protesters chanted: \"Gaza, Paris is with you.\"\n\n- Car, house hit -\n\nThe Gaza war was sparked by Hamas's October 7 attack on southern Israel, which resulted in the deaths of 1,189 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures.\n\nMilitants also took 252 hostages, 121 of whom remain in Gaza, including 37 the army says are dead.\n\nIsrael's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 36,224 people in Gaza, mostly civilians, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry.\n\nA medical official at Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in central Gaza's Deir al-Balah said eight people, including two children, were killed in an air strike that hit a house in Al-Bureij refugee camp.\n\nAnother source at Nuseirat's Al-Awda Hospital reported three deaths in a strike on a car.\n\nAn AFP correspondent saw Israeli military vehicles southwest of Gaza City, in the territory's north.\n\nThe military announced the deaths of two soldiers in Gaza, taking to 294 the number of Israeli troops killed since the start of ground operations in late October.\n\nAn Israeli strike Sunday that sparked a fire and killed dozens in a displacement camp in Rafah drew a wave of fresh condemnation and prompted two days of discussions at the UN Security Council.\n\nIsrael has said it targeted a Hamas compound and killed two senior members.\n\nAfter the strike, Algeria presented a draft resolution to the UN Security Council demanding an immediate ceasefire and the release of all hostages, but it was unclear when it would be voted on.\n\nAmid the fighting, Israeli war cabinet minister Benny Gantz's centrist party submitted a bill to dissolve parliament for an early election, drawing criticism from Netanyahu's right-wing Likud party.", "source": {"uri":

Since then, one million have fled the area, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, has said.\n\nThe United Nations has warned of looming famine in Gaza.\n\nThe Israeli seizure of the Rafah crossing has further slowed sporadic deliveries of aid for Gaza's 2.4 million people and effectively shuttered the territory's main exit point.\n\nHowever, Israel said at the weekend that aid deliveries had been stepped up, including through its Kerem Shalom crossing with Gaza.\n\nCyprus, the European Union's easternmost member, said humanitarian aid shipped to Gaza was being kept at sea off the territory's coast, after a US-built pier was damaged in bad weather.\n\nIn an interview on French channel LCI, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu dismissed as \"anti-Semitic slander\" accusations Israel was deliberately targeting and starving Gazan civilians.\n\nNetanyahu, who has often spoke to foreign media during the war but largely avoided interviews with Israeli outlets, said the ratio of militants to civilians killed so far in the Israeli offensive was \"the lowest rate we have seen in an urban war\".\n\nHundreds of demonstrators rallied late Thursday outside the offices of private broadcaster TF1, LCI's parent company, in Paris's western suburbs, to protest the broadcast.\n\nWearing black and white keffiyeh scarves and waving Palestinian flags, the protesters chanted: \"Gaza, Paris is with you.\"\n\n- Car, house hit -\n\nThe Gaza war was sparked by Hamas's October 7 attack on southern Israel, which resulted in the deaths of 1,189 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures.\n\nMilitants also took 252 hostages, 121 of whom remain in Gaza, including 37 the army says are dead.\n\nIsrael's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 36,224 people in Gaza, mostly civilians, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry.\n\nA medical official at Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in central Gaza's Deir al-Balah said eight people, including two children, were killed in an air strike that hit a house in Al-Bureij refugee camp.\n\nAnother source at Nuseirat's Al-Awda Hospital reported three deaths in a strike on a car.\n\nAn AFP correspondent saw Israeli military vehicles southwest of Gaza City, in the territory's north.\n\nThe military announced the deaths of two soldiers in Gaza, taking to 294 the number of Israeli troops killed since the start of ground operations in late October.\n\nAn Israeli strike Sunday that sparked a fire and killed dozens in a displacement camp in Rafah drew a wave of fresh condemnation and prompted two days of discussions at the UN Security Council.\n\nIsrael has said it targeted a Hamas compound and killed two senior members.\n\nAfter the strike, Algeria presented a draft resolution to the UN Security Council demanding an immediate ceasefire and the release of all hostages, but it was unclear when it would be voted on.\n\nAmid the fighting, Israeli war cabinet minister Benny Gantz's centrist party submitted a bill to dissolve parliament for an early election, drawing criticism from Netanyahu's right-wing Likud party.", "source": {"uri":

Since then, one million have fled the area, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, has said.\n\nThe United Nations has warned of looming famine in Gaza as Israel has closed all land crossings into the Palestinian territory only allowing sporadic aid deliveries through the Karm Abu Salem crossing.\n\nThe Israeli seizure of the Rafah crossing has further complicated efforts to deliver aid for Gaza's 2.4 million people and effectively shuttered the territory's main exit point.\n\nCyprus, the European Union's easternmost member, said humanitarian aid shipped to Gaza was being kept at sea off the territory's coast, after a US-built pier was damaged in bad weather.\n\nIsrael's bloodiest war on Gaza has killed at least 36,224 Palestinians and wounded more than 80,000 others, mostly women and children, according to the health ministry.\n\nAn AFP correspondent saw Israeli army vehicles southwest of Gaza City, in the territory's north.\n\nThe latest casualties of Israel's brutal war come as Sunday's Israeli strike, which killed dozens of civilians at the Rafah displacement camp, has prompted two days of discussions at the UN Security Council.\n\nAfter the strike, Algeria presented a draft resolution to the UN Security Council demanding an immediate ceasefire and the release of all captives, but it was unclear when it would be voted on.\n\nThe United States, the strong supporter of Israel, said Wednesday that such resolution \"is not going to be helpful.\"\n\nU.S. deputy ambassador Robert Wood told reporters ahead of Wednesday's monthly Mideast meeting that \"another

The military said in a statement Friday, May 31, that its troops in central Rafah had uncovered Hamas rocket launchers and tunnels and dismantled a weapons storage city of the group.\n\nIsrael launched its ground assault into the city on May 6 and has mainly been operating in its eastern districts and close to the border with Egypt.

More than 1 million Palestinians have fled the city since the assault began, scattering around southern and central Gaza.\n\nWitnesses said Friday Israeli strikes hit the Rafah area as well as central Gaza's Nuseirat, and an Agence France-Presse correspondent reported intense bombardment in the north. Strikes on two separate locations killed a total of 11 people overnight, medical sources at a hospital in Deir al-Balah and the Nuseirat refugee camp reported.\n\nAn air strike \"targeted and eliminated\" a militant in the Rafah area, the military said. In central Gaza, further air strikes \"eliminated several terrorists who operated near\" troops, the military said without elaborating. On Wednesday it claimed to have killed 300 Hamas militants since the start of the operation.\n\nAmid stalled diplomatic efforts towards a ceasefire, Hamas said it had informed mediators it would only agree a \"comprehensive\" truce agreement including a hostage-prisoner swap if Israel halts its \"aggression.\" Ismail Haniyeh, the head of Hamas's Qatar-based political office, reiterated in a Friday that the group's core demands - including a permanent ceasefire and full Israeli withdrawal - \"are non-negotiable.\" He accused Israel of \"using negotiations as a cover to continue its aggression,\" saying Hamas \"refuses to be a part of these maneuvres.\"\n\nA stream of civilians have fled Rafah, taking their belongings on their shoulders, in cars or on donkey-drawn carts. Before the Rafah offensive began, the United Nations said up to 1.4 million people were sheltering in the city. Since then, 1 million have fled the area, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, has said.\n\nThe United Nations has warned of looming famine in Gaza. The Israeli seizure of the Rafah crossing has further slowed sporadic deliveries of aid for Gaza's 2.4 million people and effectively shuttered the territory's main exit point. However, Israel said at the weekend that aid deliveries had been stepped up, including through its Kerem Shalom crossing with Gaza.\n\nIn an interview on French channel LCI, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu dismissed as \"anti-Semitic slander\" accusations Israel was deliberately targeting and starving Gazan civilians. Netanyahu said the ratio of militants to civilians killed so far in the Israeli offensive was \"the lowest rate we have seen in an urban war.\"\n\nIsrael's retaliatory offensive since October 7 has killed at least 36,224 people in Gaza, mostly civilians, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry.", "source": {"uri": "lemonde.fr", "dataType": "news", "title": "Le Monde.fr"},

Still, US President Joe Biden has said Israel has not crossed the \u201cred lines\u201d of a full-fledged invasion that he has urged them against.\n\nFriday\u2019s statement by the Israeli military suggested its forces have been operating in most parts of the city. For its first weeks, the Israeli assault focused on in Rafah\u2019s eastern districts and in areas close to the border with Egypt. Israeli troops seized the Rafah crossing into Egypt on the first day of the offensive and have since claimed control over the Philadelphia Corridor, a road running the length of the Gaza-Egypt border on the Gazan side.\n\nEarlier this week, Israeli troops also moved into Rafah\u2019s western district of Tel al-Sultan, where heavy clashes with Hamas fighters have been reported by witnesses.\n\nIn its statement Friday, the military said its troops in central Rafah had uncovered Hamas rocket launchers and tunnels and dismantled a weapons storage city of the group. It did not specify where in central Rafah the operations were taking place, but previous statements and witness reports have pointed to raids in the Shaboura refugee camp and other sites near the city centre.\n\nIsrael has said an offensive in Rafah is vital to uprooting Hamas fighters in its military\u2019s campaign to destroy the group after its October 7 attack on southern Israel.\n\nPalestinians who fled the city have scattered around southern and central Gaza, most of them living in squalid tent camps. Up to around 300,000 people are believed to remain in the area, some of them still in the central urban parts of the city, a UN official said, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to talk to the press. Shaina Low, a spokesperson for the Norwegian Refugee Council, a humanitarian group that operates in the area, said most have flocked to the rural area west of the city near the coast \u2013 an area that has seen deadly Israeli strikes and shelling the past week.", "source": {"uri": "scmp.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "South China Morning Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_City", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafah", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_launcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rocket launcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tel_al-Sultan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tel al-Sultan"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafah_Border_Crossing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rafah Border Crossing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarian aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_Refugee_Council", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Norwegian Refugee Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugee_camp", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Refugee camp"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Military", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Military", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Urban_Living", "label": "dmoz/Home/Urban Living", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Multinational_Forces", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Multinational Forces", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Weapons_and_Equipment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Weapons and Equipment", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 50}], "image": "https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/d8/images/canvas/2024/05/31/db57a1e0-47d1-4953-996d-c9e44285d94e_3d42ec65.jpg?itok=3GOoZxtF", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9613852", "eventUri": "eng-9613852", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-06", "textStart": 495, "textEnd": 500}, {"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 1933, "textEnd": 1942}], "sentiment": -0.2941176470588235, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1}

Since then, one million have fled the area, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, has said.\n\nThe United Nations has warned of looming famine in Gaza.\n\nThe Israeli seizure of the Rafah crossing has further slowed sporadic deliveries of aid for Gaza's 2.4 million people and effectively shuttered the territory's main exit point.\n\nHowever, Israel said at the weekend that aid deliveries had been stepped up, including through its Kerem Shalom crossing with Gaza.\n\nCyprus, the European Union's easternmost member, said humanitarian aid shipped to Gaza was being kept at sea off the territory's coast, after a US-built pier was damaged in bad weather.\n\nCypriot government spokesman Konstantinos Letymbiotis said Friday the maritime corridor was \"uninterrupted\" and the pier would be \"back on track\" within days.\n\n\"Our goal... is to be able to help half a million people per month, and we think that this goal is achievable,\" he said.\n\nIn an interview on French channel LCI, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu dismissed as \"anti-Semitic slander\" accusations Israel was deliberately targeting and starving Gazan civilians.\n\nMr. Netanyahu said the ratio of militants to civilians killed so far in the Israeli offensive was \"the lowest rate we have seen in an urban war\".\n\nCar, house hit\n\nThe Gaza war was sparked by Hamas's October 7 attack on southern Israel, which resulted in the deaths of 1,189 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures.\n\nMilitants also took 252 hostages, 121 of whom remain in Gaza, including 37 the army says are dead.\n\nIsrael's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 36,224 people in Gaza, mostly civilians, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry.\n\nA medical official at Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in central Gaza's Deir al-Balah said eight people, including two children, were killed in an air strike that hit a house in Al-Bureij refugee camp.\n\nAnother source at Nuseirat's Al-Awda Hospital reported three deaths in a strike on a car.\n\nAn AFP correspondent saw Israeli military vehicles southwest of Gaza City, in the territory's north.\n\nThe military announced the deaths of two soldiers in Gaza, taking to 294 the number of Israeli troops killed since the start of ground operations in late October.\n\nAn Israeli strike Sunday that sparked a fire and killed dozens in a displacement camp in Rafah drew a wave of fresh condemnation and prompted two days of discussions at the UN Security Council.\n\nIsrael has said it targeted a Hamas compound and killed two senior members.\n\nAfter the strike, Algeria presented a draft resolution to the UN Security Council demanding an immediate ceasefire and the release of all hostages, but it was unclear when it would be voted on.\n\nRead Comments", "source": {"uri": "thehindu.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hindu"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

It did not elaborate.\n\nIsrael has repeatedly vowed to destroy Hamas since the Palestinian militant group attacked southern Israel on October 7.\n\nOn Wednesday, it declared its forces had taken control of the 14-kilometre Philadelphi corridor along the Gaza-Egypt border, where it alleges weapons were being smuggled.\n\nEgypt, a longtime mediator in the conflict, has yet to officially comment on the Israeli takeover, which officials have previously said could violate the two countries' 1979 peace deal.\n\nAmid stalled diplomatic efforts towards a ceasefire, Hamas said it had informed mediators it would only agree a \"comprehensive\" truce agreement including a hostage-prisoner swap if Israel halts its \"aggression\".\n\nIsmail Haniyeh, the head of Hamas's Qatar-based political office, reiterated Friday that the group's core demands -- including a permanent ceasefire and full Israeli withdrawal - \"are non-negotiable\".\n\nHe accused Israel of \"using negotiations as a cover to continue its aggression\", saying Hamas \"refuses to be a part of these manoeuvres\".\n\nOn Thursday, Israel said its forces had killed about 300 Palestinian militants in Rafah since launching its military operation in the city.\n\nA stream of civilians fled Rafah, taking their belongings on their shoulders, in cars or on donkey-drawn carts.\n\nBefore the Rafah offensive began, the United Nations said up to 1.4 million people were sheltering in the city. Since then, one million have fled the area, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, has said.\n\nThe United Nations has warned of looming famine in Gaza.\n\nThe Israeli seizure of the Rafah crossing has further slowed sporadic deliveries of aid for Gaza's 2.4 million people and effectively shuttered the territory's main exit point.\n\nHowever, Israel said at the weekend that aid deliveries had been stepped up, including through its Kerem Shalom crossing with Gaza.\n\nUN Palestinian refugee agency chief Philippe Lazzarini appealed Friday for Israel to \"stop its campaign against UNRWA\", in an opinion article published in the New York Times.\n\nCyprus, the European Union's easternmost member, said humanitarian aid shipped to Gaza was being kept at sea off the territory's coast, after a US-built pier was damaged in bad weather.\n\nCypriot government spokesman Konstantinos Letymbiotis said Friday the pier would be \"back on track\" within days.\n\n\"Our goal... is to be able to help half a million people per month, and we think that this goal is achievable,\" he said.\n\nIn an interview on French channel LCI, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu dismissed as \"anti-Semitic slander\" accusations Israel was deliberately targeting and starving Gazan civilians.\n\nNetanyahu said the ratio of militants to civilians killed so far in the Israeli offensive was \"the lowest rate we have seen in an urban war\".\n\nThe Gaza war was sparked by Hamas's October 7 attack on southern Israel, which resulted in the deaths of 1,189 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures.\n\nMilitants also took 252 hostages, 121 of whom remain in Gaza, including 37 the army says are dead.\n\nIsrael's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 36,284 people in Gaza, mostly civilians, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry.\n\nA medical official at Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in central Gaza's Deir al-Balah said eight people, including two children, were killed in an air strike that hit a house in Al-Bureij refugee camp.\n\nAnother source at Nuseirat's Al-Awda Hospital reported three deaths in a strike on a car.\n\nAn AFP correspondent saw Israeli military vehicles southwest of Gaza City, in the territory's north.\n\nThe military announced the deaths of two soldiers in Gaza, taking to 294 the number of Israeli troops killed since the start of ground operations in late October.\n\nAn Israeli strike Sunday that sparked a fire and killed dozens in a displacement camp in Rafah drew a fresh wave of condemnation and prompted two days of discussions at the UN Security Council.\n\nIsrael has said it targeted a Hamas compound and killed two senior members.\n\nAfter the strike, Algeria presented a draft resolution to the UN Security Council demanding an immediate ceasefire and the release of all hostages, but it was unclear when it would be voted on.\n\nThe organisers of next month's Eurosatory 2024 trade fair in Paris said the French authorities had banned Israeli defence firms from exhibiting there.\n\nSeventy-four Israeli firms had been set to be represented at the event.", "source": {"uri": "timesofmalta.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "timesofmalta.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5,

It did not elaborate.\n\nIsrael has repeatedly vowed to destroy Hamas since the Palestinian militant group attacked southern Israel on October 7.\n\nOn Wednesday, it declared its forces had taken control of the 14-kilometre (8.5-mile) Philadelphi corridor along the Gaza-Egypt border, where it alleges weapons were being smuggled.\n\nEgypt, a longtime mediator in the conflict, has yet to officially comment on the Israeli takeover, which officials have previously said could violate the two countries' 1979 peace deal.\n\nAmid stalled diplomatic efforts towards a ceasefire, Hamas said it had informed mediators it would only agree a \"comprehensive\" truce agreement including a hostage-prisoner swap if Israel halts its \"aggression\".\n\nIsmail Haniyeh, the head of Hamas's Qatar-based political office, reiterated Friday that the group's core demands -- including a permanent ceasefire and full Israeli withdrawal -- \"are non-negotiable\".\n\nHe accused Israel of \"using negotiations as a cover to continue its aggression\", saying Hamas \"refuses to be a part of these manoeuvres\".\n\nOn Thursday, Israel said its forces had killed about 300 Palestinian militants in Rafah since launching its military operation in the city.\n\nA stream of civilians fled Rafah, taking their belongings on their shoulders, in cars or on donkey-drawn carts.\n\n- Aid at sea -\n\nBefore the Rafah offensive began, the United Nations said up to 1.4 million people were sheltering in the city. Since then, one million have fled the area, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, has said.\n\nThe United Nations has warned of looming famine in Gaza.\n\nThe Israeli seizure of the Rafah crossing has further slowed sporadic deliveries of aid for Gaza's 2.4 million people and effectively shuttered the territory's main exit point.\n\nHowever, Israel said at the weekend that aid deliveries had been stepped up, including through its Kerem Shalom crossing with Gaza.\n\nUN Palestinian refugee agency chief Philippe Lazzarini appealed Friday for Israel to \"stop its campaign against UNRWA\", in an opinion article published in the New York Times.\n\nCyprus, the European Union's easternmost member, said humanitarian aid shipped to Gaza was being kept at sea off the territory's coast, after a US-built pier was damaged in bad weather.\n\nCypriot government spokesman Konstantinos Letymbiotis said Friday the pier would be \"back on track\" within days.\n\n\"Our goal... is to be able to help half a million people per month, and we think that this goal is achievable,\" he said.\n\nIn an interview on French channel LCI, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu dismissed as \"anti-Semitic slander\" accusations Israel was deliberately targeting and starving Gazan civilians.\n\nNetanyahu said the ratio of militants to civilians killed so far in the Israeli offensive was \"the lowest rate we have seen in an urban war\".\n\n- Car, house hit -\n\nThe Gaza war was sparked by Hamas's October 7 attack on southern Israel, which resulted in the deaths of 1,189 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures.\n\nMilitants also took 252 hostages, 121 of whom remain in Gaza, including 37 the army says are dead.\n\nIsrael's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 36,284 people in Gaza, mostly civilians, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry.\n\nA medical official at Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in central Gaza's Deir al-Balah said eight people, including two children, were killed in an air strike that hit a house in Al-Bureij refugee camp.\n\nAnother source at Nuseirat's Al-Awda Hospital reported three deaths in a strike on a car.\n\nAn AFP correspondent saw Israeli military vehicles southwest of Gaza City, in the territory's north.\n\nThe military announced the deaths of two soldiers in Gaza, taking to 294 the number of Israeli troops killed since the start of ground operations in late October.\n\nAn Israeli strike Sunday that sparked a fire and killed dozens in a displacement camp in Rafah drew a fresh wave of condemnation and prompted two days of discussions at the UN Security Council.\n\nIsrael has said it targeted a Hamas compound and killed two senior members.\n\nAfter the strike, Algeria presented a draft resolution to the UN Security Council demanding an immediate ceasefire and the release of all hostages, but it was unclear when it would be voted on.\n\nThe organisers of next month's Eurosatory 2024 trade fair in Paris said the French authorities had banned Israeli defence firms from exhibiting there.\n\nSeventy-four Israeli firms had been set to be represented at the event.\n\nburs-dv/kir\n\nMore from this section\n\nVoices for Humanity Is Rockin' the Truth About Drugs with Dave Scattergood\n\nOnline notarization is streamlined with Secured

(AP Photo/Abdel Kareem Hana)\n\nThe Israeli military confirmed Friday that its forces are operating in central parts of Rafah in its expanding offensive in the southern Gaza city.\n\nIsrael launched its ground assault into the city on May 6, triggering an exodus of around 1 million Palestinians out of the city and throwing U.N. humanitarian operations based in the area into turmoil. Still, U.S. President Joe Biden has said Israel has not crossed the \"red lines\" of a full-fledged invasion that he has urged them against.\n\nFriday's statement by the Israeli military suggested its forces have been operating in most parts of the city. For its first weeks, the Israeli assault focused on in Rafah's eastern districts and in areas close to the border with Egypt. Israeli troops seized the Rafah crossing into Egypt on the first day of the offensive and have since claimed control over the Philadelphia Corridor, a road running the length of the Gaza-Egypt border on the Gazan side.\n\nEarlier this week, Israeli troops also moved into Rafah's western district of Tel al-Sultan, where heavy clashes with Hamas fighters have been reported by witnesses.\n\nIn its statement Friday, the military said its troops in central Rafah had uncovered Hamas rocket launchers and tunnels and dismantled a weapons storage city of the group. It did not specify where in central Rafah the operations were taking place, but previous statements and witness reports have pointed to raids in the Shaboura refugee camp and other sites near the city center.\n\nIsrael has said an offensive in Rafah is vital to uprooting Hamas fighters in its military's campaign to destroy the group after its Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel.\n\nPalestinains who fled the city have scattered around southern and central Gaza, most of them living in squalid tent camps. Up to around 300,000 people are believed to remain in the area, some of them still in the central urban parts of the city, a U.N. official said, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to the press.

It did not elaborate.\n\nIsrael has repeatedly vowed to destroy Hamas since the Palestinian militant group attacked southern Israel on October 7.\n\nOn Wednesday, it declared its forces had taken control of the 14-kilometre (8.5-mile) Philadelphi corridor along the Gaza-Egypt border, where it alleges weapons were being smuggled.\n\nEgypt, a longtime mediator in the conflict, has yet to officially comment on the Israeli takeover, which officials have previously said could violate the two countries' 1979 peace deal.\n\nAmid stalled diplomatic efforts towards a ceasefire, Hamas said it had informed mediators it would only agree a \"comprehensive\" truce agreement including a hostage-prisoner swap if Israel halts its \"aggression\".\n\nIsmail Haniyeh, the head of Hamas's Qatar-based political office, reiterated Friday that the group's core demands -- including a permanent ceasefire and full Israeli withdrawal -- \"are non-negotiable\".\n\nHe accused Israel of \"using negotiations as a cover to continue its aggression\", saying Hamas \"refuses to be a part of these manoeuvres\".\n\nOn Thursday, Israel said its forces had killed about 300 Palestinian militants in Rafah since launching its military operation in the city.\n\nA stream of civilians fled Rafah, taking their belongings on their shoulders, in cars or on donkey-drawn carts.\n\n- Aid at sea -\n\nBefore the Rafah offensive began, the United Nations said up to 1.4 million people were sheltering in the city. Since then, one million have fled the area, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, has said.\n\nThe United Nations has warned of looming famine in Gaza.\n\nThe Israeli seizure of the Rafah crossing has further slowed sporadic deliveries of aid for Gaza's 2.4 million people and effectively shuttered the territory's main exit point.\n\nHowever, Israel said at the weekend that aid deliveries had been stepped up, including through its Kerem Shalom crossing with Gaza.\n\nUN Palestinian refugee agency chief Philippe Lazzarini appealed Friday for Israel to \"stop its campaign against UNRWA\", in an opinion article published in the New York Times.\n\nMore from this section Nigel Farage rages at BBC form asking to disclose his 'sexuality' and 'ethnicity' British Library forced to call the police as book lovers romp in toilets Menendez bribery trial: Jurors see texts sent between senator and wife regarding Egyptian military aid\n\nCyprus, the European Union's easternmost member, said humanitarian aid shipped to Gaza was being kept at sea off the territory's coast, after a US-built pier was damaged in bad weather.\n\nCypriot government spokesman Konstantinos Letymbiotis said Friday the pier would be \"back on track\" within days.\n\n\"Our goal... is to be able to help half a million people per month, and we think that this goal is achievable,\" he said.\n\nIn an interview on French channel LCI, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu dismissed as \"anti-Semitic slander\" accusations Israel was deliberately targeting and starving Gazan civilians.\n\nNetanyahu said the ratio of militants to civilians killed so far in the Israeli offensive was \"the lowest rate we have seen in an urban war\".\n\n- Car, house hit -\n\nThe Gaza war was sparked by Hamas's October 7 attack on southern Israel, which resulted in the deaths of 1,189 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures.\n\nMilitants also took 252 hostages, 121 of whom remain in Gaza, including 37 the army says are dead.\n\nIsrael's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 36,284 people in Gaza, mostly civilians, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry.\n\nA medical official at Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in central Gaza's Deir al-Balah said eight people, including two children, were killed in an air strike that hit a house in Al-Bureij refugee camp.\n\nAnother source at Nuseirat's Al-Awda Hospital reported three deaths in a strike on a car.\n\nAn AFP correspondent saw Israeli military vehicles southwest of Gaza City, in the territory's north.\n\nThe military announced the deaths of two soldiers in Gaza, taking to 294 the number of Israeli troops killed since the start of ground operations in late October.\n\nAn Israeli strike Sunday that sparked a fire and killed dozens in a displacement camp in Rafah drew a fresh wave of condemnation and prompted two days of discussions at the UN Security Council.\n\nIsrael has said it targeted a Hamas compound and killed two senior members.\n\nAfter the strike, Algeria presented a draft resolution to the UN Security Council demanding an immediate ceasefire and the release of all hostages, but it was unclear when it would be voted on.\n\nThe organisers of next month's Eurosatory 2024 trade fair in Paris said the French authorities had banned Israeli defence firms from exhibiting there.\n\nSeventy-four Israeli firms had been set to be represented at the event.\n\nburs-dv/kir", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com",

We will destroy the Hamas battalions there, we will complete all the objectives of the war, including the return of all our hostages,\" he said.\n\nIsrael says Rafah is Hamas' last major stronghold in the Gaza Strip, after operations elsewhere dismantled 18 out of the militant group's 24 battalions, according to the military.\n\nIsraeli troops in central Rafah uncovered Hamas rocket launchers and tunnels and dismantled a weapons storage facility, the army said Friday.\n\nCivilians from across Gaza have fled to the south to escape fighting. The U.S. has urged Israel not to carry out a wide operation without a \"credible\" plan to evacuate those civilians.\n\nEgypt, a strategic partner of Israel, has said that an Israeli military seizure of the Gaza-Egypt border -- which is supposed to be demilitarized -- or any move to push Palestinians into Egypt would threaten its four-decade-old peace agreement with Israel.\n\nPREVIOUS: ICC requests arrest warrants for Netanyahu, Hamas leaders over 'war crimes'\n\nMoreover, U.N. officials say an attack on Rafah will collapse the aid operation that is keeping the population across the Gaza Strip alive, and potentially push Palestinians into greater starvation and mass death.\n\nThe U.S. has said that Israel should use pinpoint operations against Hamas inside Rafah without a major

The ground assault into Rafah commenced on May 6, prompting a significant displacement of approximately 1 million Palestinians from the area and disrupting U.N. humanitarian operations in the region.\n\nDespite this escalation, U.S. President Joe Biden said that Israel has not breached the \"red lines\" of a full-fledged invasion, which he had cautioned against, reported news agency AP.\n\nThe Israeli military's Friday statement indicates that its forces have extended their operations across various parts of Rafah.

While the specific location within central Rafah was not specified in the statement, previous reports and witness accounts have indicated raids in areas such as the Shaboura refugee camp and other sites near the city center.\n\nIsrael has emphasised the significance of its offensive in Rafah as part of its broader campaign to dismantle Hamas following the group's attack on southern Israel on October 7th.\n\nThe Palestinians who fled Rafah have dispersed throughout southern and central Gaza, with many residing in makeshift tent camps under dire conditions.\n\nIt is estimated that up to 300,000 individuals have remained in the area, with some still situated in the central urban sectors of the city, as indicated by a U.N. official who spoke on condition of anonymity due to unauthorised press engagement, AP reported.\n\nShaina Low, a spokesperson for the Norwegian Refugee Council, noted that the majority of displaced individuals have sought refuge in rural areas west of the city, near the coast.

Fighting and Israeli evacuation orders forced more than 1 million Palestinians to flee Rafah, most of whom had already been displaced earlier in the war.\n\nStill, the United States says Israel's operations has not crossed the \"red lines\" of a full-fledged invasion of Rafah that the Biden administration has urged them against, citing the risk to civilians.\n\nIsrael has vowed to expunge Hamas and other Palestinian militants from the entire Gaza Strip, and says Rafah is Hamas' last stronghold. Israeli troops in central Rafah uncovered Hamas rocket launchers and tunnels and dismantled a weapons storage facility, the army said Friday.\n\nIsrael faces growing international criticism for its strategy of systematic destruction -- at a huge cost in civilian lives -- in the nearly 8-month-old war against Hamas in Gaza.\n\nIsraeli bombardments and ground offensives in the besieged territory have killed more than 36,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians.\n\nIsrael launched its war in Gaza after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack in which militants stormed into southern Israel, killed some 1,200 people -- mostly civilians -- and abducted about 250. Israel says around 100 hostages are still captive in Gaza, along with the bodies of around 30 more.\n\n-- A global aid group asks warring forces to respect its neutrality, saying 24 of its aid workers have been killed\n\nFollow AP's coverage of the war in Gaza at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war\n\nHere's the latest:\n\nBEIRUT -- An Israeli airstrike in south Lebanon killed Friday a member of the Hezbollah militant group's paramedic arm and wounded another, the group's Al-Manar TV reported.\n\nThe strike Friday afternoon on the coastal border town of Naqoura came amid a violent day along the border during which Hezbollah attacked Israeli military posts with explosive drones and rockets with heavy warheads while Israel's air force struck areas on the Lebanese side of the border.\n\nAl-Manar identified the dead member of Hezbollah's Islamic Health Society as Haidar Juhair adding that his death brings to 10 the number of paramedics with the group who have been killed over the past seven months.\n\nThere was no immediate comment from the Israeli military.\n\nThe Lebanon-Israel border has between witnessing almost daily exchange since a day after the Israel-Hamas war started on Oct. 7.\n\nTens of thousands of people have been displaced on both sides of the border and since Oct. 8, more than 400 people have been killed in Lebanon, most of them fighters, but they also include more than 70 civilians and non-combatants. On the Israeli side, 15 soldiers and 10 civilians have been killed during the same period.\n\nJERUSALEM, Israel -- The Israeli military has confirmed that its forces are operating in central parts of Rafah in its expanding offensive in the southern Gaza city.\n\nThe military said in a statement Friday that its troops in central Rafah had uncovered Hamas rocket launchers and tunnels and dismantled a weapons storage city of the group.\n\nThe statement did not specify where in central Rafah the operations were taking place, but previous statements and witness reports have pointed to raids in the Shaboura refugee camp and other sites near the city center.\n\nMore than 1 million Palestinians have fled the city since the assault began, scattering around southern and central Gaza..\n\nTEL AVIV, Israel -- In an aggressive meeting Thursday, Israel's national security adviser told hostage families that the government wasn't ready to sign a deal to bring all of the hostages home and that there was no plan B.\n\nGil Dickmann, who's cousin Carmel is being held hostage, told The Associated Press that during a face-to-face meeting with Tzachi Hanegbi and several hostage families, they were told the government wasn't prepared to end the war to bring their loved ones back.\n\n\"I said: 'Does that mean that we're doomed, we're lost?' He said, yes,\" said Dickmann.\n\nThe remarks came a day after the official said he expects the war to drag on for another seven months, in order to destroy the military and governing capabilities of Hamas and the smaller Islamic Jihad militant group.\n\nHamas-led militants killed around 1,200 people, mainly civilians, and abducted around 250 others in the Oct. 7 attack. Around half of those hostages have since been freed, most in swaps for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel during a weeklong cease-fire in November.\n\nAfter months of on-and-off negotiations, cease-fire talks are at a standstill.\n\nDickmann said it was the harshest and most difficult meeting with officials since the war began, because it left them hopeless.\n\nAt one point in the meeting, Hanegbi lashed out at one of the women who criticized Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, telling her she was \"full of hate\", said Dickmann.\n\nHanegbi told the hostage families the only way to possibly get the government to sign a deal was through public pressure, said Dickmann. Opinion polls need to show that most Israelis are willing to bring the hostages back at the cost of ending the war, he said.\n\nIsraelis are divided into two main camps: those who want the government to put the war on hold and free the hostages, and others who think the hostages are an unfortunate price to pay for eradicating Hamas\n\nHanegbi's office didn't respond to request for comment.\n\nOn Friday, a group supporting the hostages accused the government of making a \"conscious and deliberate decision to sacrifice\" them, forgoing the Israeli principle that it will never leave anyone behind.\n\nTEL AVIV, Israel -- Israel's army said Friday that it completed its mission in part of the Gaza Strip's northern city of Jabaliya and will continue operations in other parts of the enclave.\n\nThe army said during its operations in eastern Jabaliya that it killed hundreds of fighters, destroyed dozens of targets and combat compounds and located hundreds of weapons.\n\nIt also said it destroyed more than 10 kilometers (6 miles) of underground tunnels and retrieved the bodies of seven hostages and returned them to their families in Israel.\n\nIsraeli troops returned to Jabaliya and the surrounding areas in northern Gaza in early May, months after an earlier operation. The United Nations said that about 100,000 Palestinians were displaced in northern Gaza following Israel's evacuation orders.\n\nNorthern Gaza was the first target of Israel's ground offensive launched after Hamas and other militants attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7, killing around 1,200 people.\n\nIsraeli troops have relaunched attacks in the north as Hamas repeatedly returns to areas that Israel withdraws from.\n\nDEIR AL-BALAH -- At least a dozen people were killed, including children, in two airstrikes Friday in Central Gaza, according to hospital officials and Associated Press journalists who counted the bodies.\n\nThe strikes hit Nuseirat and Bureij, two children and four women were among those killed and the bodies were brought to the Al Aqsa Hospital in Deir al-Balah.\n\nA funeral for all 12 people was held Friday.\n\nIsrael's campaign of bombardment and offensives in Gaza has killed more than 36,000 Palestinians and wounded more than 80,000, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. Its count does not differentiate between civilians and combatants.\n\nDUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Joint British-United States airstrikes targeting Yemen's Houthi rebels killed at least 16 people and wounded 42 others, the rebels said Friday -- the highest publicly acknowledged death toll from the multiple rounds of strikes carried out over the rebels' attacks on shipping.\n\nThe Houthis have stepped up attacks on shipping in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, demanding that Israel end the war in Gaza, which has killed more than 36,000 Palestinians there. The war began after Hamas-led militants attacked Israel on Oct. 7, killing about 1,200 people and taking around 250 hostage.\n\nHouthis said Friday morning that one of the strikes struck a building housing Hodeida Radio and civilian homes in the port city on the Red Sea. Their Al Masirah satellite news channel aired images of one bloodied man being carried downstairs and others receiving aid in the hospital. It said all the dead and nearly all the wounded from the strikes came from there.\n\nThe Houthis described all those killed and hurt in Hodeida as civilians, something The Associated Press couldn't immediately confirm. The rebel force that's held Yemen's capital, Sanaa, since 2014 includes fighters who often are not in uniform.\n\nOther strikes hit outside of Sanaa near its airport and communication equipment in Taiz, the broadcaster said. Little other information was released on those sites -- likely signaling that Houthi military sites had been struck. One person was wounded in Sanaa.\n\nThe U.S. and the U.K. have launched strikes against the Houthis since January. Abdul Malik al-Houthi, the Houthis' secretive supreme leader, offered an overall death toll for the strikes up to that point as 40 people killed and 35 others wounded. He did not offer a breakdown between civilian and combatant casualties at the time.\n\nThe Houthis have launched more than 50 attacks on shipping, killed three sailors, seized one vessel and sunk another since November, according to the U.S. Maritime Administration. This week, they attacked a ship carrying grain to Iran, the rebels' main benefactor.", "source": {"uri": "hosted.ap.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Associated Press"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Fighting and Israeli evacuation orders forced more than 1 million Palestinians to flee Rafah, most of whom had already been displaced earlier in the war.\n\nStill, the United States says Israel's operations has not crossed the \"red lines\" of a full-fledged invasion of Rafah that the Biden administration has urged them against, citing the risk to civilians.\n\nIsrael has vowed to expunge Hamas and other Palestinian militants from the entire Gaza Strip, and says Rafah is Hamas' last stronghold. Israeli troops in central Rafah uncovered Hamas rocket launchers and tunnels and dismantled a weapons storage facility, the army said Friday.\n\nIsrael faces growing international criticism for its strategy of systematic destruction -- at a huge cost in civilian lives -- in the nearly 8-month-old war against Hamas in Gaza.\n\nIsraeli bombardments and ground offensives in the besieged territory have killed more than 36,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians.\n\nIsrael launched its war in Gaza after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack in which militants stormed into southern Israel, killed some 1,200 people -- mostly civilians -- and abducted about 250. Israel says around 100 hostages are still captive in Gaza, along with the bodies of around 30 more.\n\nCurrently:\n\n-- Houthi rebels say joint U.S.-British airstrikes in Yemen killed at least 16 and wounded 42\n\n-- Slovenia's government endorses recognition of a Palestinian state\n\n-- A pro-Palestinian camp at Wayne State is dismantled while MIT students walk out of commencement\n\n-- A global aid group asks warring forces to respect its neutrality, saying 24 of its aid workers have been killed\n\nFollow AP's coverage of the war in Gaza at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war\n\nHere's the latest:\n\nISRAELI AIRSTRIKE IN SOUTH LEBANON KILLED A HEZBOLLAH PARAMEDIC, THE GROUP SAYS\n\nBEIRUT -- An Israeli airstrike in south Lebanon killed Friday a member of the Hezbollah militant group's paramedic arm and wounded another, the group's Al-Manar TV reported.\n\nThe strike Friday afternoon on the coastal border town of Naqoura came amid a violent day along the border during which Hezbollah attacked Israeli military posts with explosive drones and rockets with heavy warheads while Israel's air force struck areas on the Lebanese side of the border.\n\nAl-Manar identified the dead member of Hezbollah's Islamic Health Society as Haidar Juhair adding that his death brings to 10 the number of paramedics with the group who have been killed over the past seven months.\n\nThere was no immediate comment from the Israeli military.\n\nThe Lebanon-Israel border has between witnessing almost daily exchange since a day after the Israel-Hamas war started on Oct. 7.\n\nTens of thousands of people have been displaced on both sides of the border and since Oct. 8, more than 400 people have been killed in Lebanon, most of them fighters, but they also include more than 70 civilians and non-combatants. On the Israeli side, 15 soldiers and 10 civilians have been killed during the same period.\n\nISRAEL CONFIRMS ITS FORCES ARE IN CENTRAL RAFAH IN EXPANDING OFFENSIVE IN THE SOUTHERN GAZA CITY\n\nJERUSALEM, Israel -- The Israeli military has confirmed that its forces are operating in central parts of Rafah in its expanding offensive in the southern Gaza city.\n\nThe military said in a statement Friday that its troops in central Rafah had uncovered Hamas rocket launchers and tunnels and dismantled a weapons storage city of the group.\n\nThe statement did not specify where in central Rafah the operations were taking place, but previous statements and witness reports have pointed to raids in the Shaboura refugee camp and other sites near the city center.\n\nMore than 1 million Palestinians have fled the city since the assault began, scattering around southern and central Gaza..\n\nISRAELI GOVERNMENT TELLS HOSTAGE FAMILIES THAT IT'S NOT READY TO SIGN A DEAL TO BRING BACK ALL HOSTAGES\n\nTEL AVIV, Israel -- In an aggressive meeting Thursday, Israel's national security adviser told hostage families that the government wasn't ready to sign a deal to bring all of the hostages home and that there was no plan B.\n\nGil Dickmann, who's cousin Carmel is being held hostage, told The Associated Press that during a face-to-face meeting with Tzachi Hanegbi and several hostage families, they were told the government wasn't prepared to end the war to bring their loved ones back.\n\n\"I said: 'Does that mean that we're doomed, we're lost?' He said, yes,\" said Dickmann.\n\nThe remarks came a day after the official said he expects the war to drag on for another seven months, in order to destroy the military and governing capabilities of Hamas and the smaller Islamic Jihad militant group.\n\nHamas-led militants killed around 1,200 people, mainly civilians, and abducted around 250 others in the Oct. 7 attack. Around half of those hostages have since been freed, most in swaps for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel during a weeklong cease-fire in November.\n\nAfter months of on-and-off negotiations, cease-fire talks are at a standstill.\n\nDickmann said it was the harshest and most difficult meeting with officials since the war began, because it left them hopeless.\n\nAt one point in the meeting, Hanegbi lashed out at one of the women who criticized Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, telling her she was \"full of hate\", said Dickmann.\n\nHanegbi told the hostage families the only way to possibly get the government to sign a deal was through public pressure, said Dickmann. Opinion polls need to show that most Israelis are willing to bring the hostages back at the cost of ending the war, he said.\n\nIsraelis are divided into two main camps: those who want the government to put the war on hold and free the hostages, and others who think the hostages are an unfortunate price to pay for eradicating Hamas\n\nHanegbi's office didn't respond to request for comment.\n\nOn Friday, a group supporting the hostages accused the government of making a \"conscious and deliberate decision to sacrifice\" them, forgoing the Israeli principle that it will never leave anyone behind.\n\nISRAELI ARMY SAYS IT COMPLETED MISSION IN PART OF JABALIYA IN NORTHERN GAZA\n\nTEL AVIV, Israel -- Israel's army said Friday that it completed its mission in part of the Gaza Strip's northern city of Jabaliya and will continue operations in other parts of the enclave.\n\nThe army said during its operations in eastern Jabaliya that it killed hundreds of fighters, destroyed dozens of targets and combat compounds and located hundreds of weapons.\n\nIt also said it destroyed more than 10 kilometers (6 miles) of underground tunnels and retrieved the bodies of seven hostages and returned them to their families in Israel.\n\nIsraeli troops returned to Jabaliya and the surrounding areas in northern Gaza in early May, months after an earlier operation. The United Nations said that about 100,000 Palestinians were displaced in northern Gaza following Israel's evacuation orders.\n\nNorthern Gaza was the first target of Israel's ground offensive launched after Hamas and other militants attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7, killing around 1,200 people.\n\nIsraeli troops have relaunched attacks in the north as Hamas repeatedly returns to areas that Israel withdraws from.\n\nAIRSTRIKES IN CENTRAL GAZA KILL AT LEAST A DOZEN PEOPLE\n\nDEIR AL-BALAH -- At least a dozen people were killed, including children, in two airstrikes Friday in Central Gaza, according to hospital officials and Associated Press journalists who counted the bodies.\n\nThe strikes hit Nuseirat and Bureij, two children and four women were among those killed and the bodies were brought to the Al Aqsa Hospital in Deir al-Balah.\n\nA funeral for all 12 people was held Friday.\n\nIsrael's campaign of bombardment and offensives in Gaza has killed more than 36,000 Palestinians and wounded more than 80,000, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. Its count does not differentiate between civilians and combatants.\n\nAIRSTRIKES TARGETING YEMEN'S HOUTHI REBELS KILL AT LEAST 16\n\nDUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Joint British-United States airstrikes targeting Yemen's Houthi rebels killed at least 16 people and wounded 42 others, the rebels said Friday -- the highest publicly acknowledged death toll from the multiple rounds of strikes carried out over the rebels' attacks on shipping.\n\nThe Houthis have stepped up attacks on shipping in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, demanding that Israel end the war in Gaza, which has killed more than 36,000 Palestinians there. The war began after Hamas-led militants attacked Israel on Oct. 7, killing about 1,200 people and taking around 250 hostage.\n\nHouthis said Friday morning that one of the strikes struck a building housing Hodeida Radio and civilian homes in the port city on the Red Sea. Their Al Masirah satellite news channel aired images of one bloodied man being carried downstairs and others receiving aid in the hospital. It said all the dead and nearly all the wounded from the strikes came from there.\n\nThe Houthis described all those killed and hurt in Hodeida as civilians, something The Associated Press couldn't immediately confirm. The rebel force that's held Yemen's capital, Sanaa, since 2014 includes fighters who often are not in uniform.\n\nOther strikes hit outside of Sanaa near its airport and communication equipment in Taiz, the broadcaster said. Little other information was released on those sites -- likely signaling that Houthi military sites had been struck. One person was wounded in Sanaa.\n\nThe U.S. and the U.K. have launched strikes against the Houthis since January. Abdul Malik al-Houthi, the Houthis' secretive supreme leader, offered an overall death toll for the strikes up to that point as 40 people killed and 35 others wounded. He did not offer a breakdown between civilian and combatant casualties at the time.\n\nThe Houthis have launched more than 50 attacks on shipping, killed three sailors, seized one vessel and sunk another since November, according to the U.S. Maritime Administration. This week, they attacked a ship carrying grain to Iran, the rebels' main benefactor.\n\nCOPYRIGHT 2024 BY CHANNEL 3000. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

He said, yes,\" said Dickmann.\n\nThe remarks came a day after the official said he expects the war to drag on for another seven months, in order to destroy the military and governing capabilities of Hamas and the smaller Islamic Jihad militant group.\n\nHamas-led militants killed around 1,200 people, mainly civilians, and abducted around 250 others in the Oct. 7 attack. Around half of those hostages have since been freed, most in swaps for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel during a weeklong cease-fire in November.\n\nAfter months of on-and-off negotiations, cease-fire talks are at a standstill.\n\nDickmann said it was the harshest and most difficult meeting with officials since the war began, because it left them hopeless.\n\nAt one point in the meeting, Hanegbi lashed out at one of the women who criticized Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, telling her she was \"full of hate\", said Dickmann.\n\nHanegbi told the hostage families the only way to possibly get the government to sign a deal was through public pressure, said Dickmann. Opinion polls need to show that most Israelis are willing to bring the hostages back at the cost of ending the war, he said.\n\nIsraelis are divided into two main camps: those who want the government to put the war on hold and free the hostages, and others who think the hostages are an unfortunate price to pay for eradicating Hamas\n\nHanegbi's office didn't respond to request for comment.\n\nOn Friday, a group supporting the hostages accused the government of making a \"conscious and deliberate decision to sacrifice\" them, forgoing the Israeli principle that it will never leave anyone behind.\n\nISRAELI ARMY SAYS IT COMPLETED MISSION IN PART OF JABALIYA IN NORTHERN GAZA\n\nTEL AVIV, Israel -- Israel's army said Friday that it completed its mission in part of the Gaza Strip's northern city of Jabaliya and will continue operations in other parts of the enclave.\n\nThe army said during its operations in eastern Jabaliya that it killed hundreds of fighters, destroyed dozens of targets and combat compounds and located hundreds of weapons.\n\nIt also said it destroyed more than 10 kilometers (6 miles) of underground tunnels and retrieved the bodies of seven hostages and returned them to their families in Israel.\n\nIsraeli troops returned to Jabaliya and the surrounding areas in northern Gaza in early May, months after an earlier operation. The United Nations said that about 100,000 Palestinians were displaced in northern Gaza following Israel's evacuation orders.\n\nNorthern Gaza was the first target of Israel's ground offensive launched after Hamas and other militants attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7, killing around 1,200 people.\n\nIsraeli troops have relaunched attacks in the north as Hamas repeatedly returns to areas that Israel withdraws from.\n\nAIRSTRIKES IN CENTRAL GAZA KILL AT LEAST A DOZEN PEOPLE\n\nDEIR AL-BALAH -- At least a dozen people were killed, including children, in two airstrikes Friday in Central Gaza, according to hospital officials and Associated Press journalists who counted the bodies.\n\nThe strikes hit Nuseirat and Bureij, two children and four women were among those killed and the bodies were brought to the Al Aqsa Hospital in Deir al-Balah.\n\nA funeral for all 12 people was held Friday.\n\nIsrael's campaign of bombardment and offensives in Gaza has killed more than 36,000 Palestinians and wounded more than 80,000, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. Its count does not differentiate between civilians and combatants.\n\nAIRSTRIKES TARGETING YEMEN'S HOUTHI REBELS KILL AT LEAST 16\n\nDUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Joint British-United States airstrikes targeting Yemen's Houthi rebels killed at least 16 people and wounded 42 others, the rebels said Friday -- the highest publicly acknowledged death toll from the multiple rounds of strikes carried out over the rebels' attacks on shipping.\n\nThe Houthis have stepped up attacks on shipping in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, demanding that Israel end the war in Gaza, which has killed more than 36,000 Palestinians there. The war began after Hamas-led militants attacked Israel on Oct. 7, killing about 1,200 people and taking around 250 hostage.\n\nHouthis said Friday morning that one of the strikes struck a building housing Hodeida Radio and civilian homes in the port city on the Red Sea. Their Al Masirah satellite news channel aired images of one bloodied man being carried downstairs and others receiving aid in the hospital. It said all the dead and nearly all the wounded from the strikes came from there.\n\nThe Houthis described all those killed and hurt in Hodeida as civilians, something The Associated Press couldn't immediately confirm. The rebel force that's held Yemen's capital, Sanaa, since 2014 includes fighters who often are not in uniform.\n\nOther strikes hit outside of Sanaa near its airport and communication equipment in Taiz, the broadcaster said. Little other information was released on those sites -- likely signaling that Houthi military sites had been struck. One person was wounded in Sanaa.\n\nThe U.S. and the U.K. have launched strikes against the Houthis since January. Abdul Malik al-Houthi, the Houthis' secretive supreme leader, offered an overall death toll for the strikes up to that point as 40 people killed and 35 others wounded. He did not offer a breakdown between civilian and combatant casualties at the time.\n\nThe Houthis have launched more than 50 attacks on shipping, killed three sailors, seized one vessel and sunk another since November, according to the U.S. Maritime Administration. This week, they attacked a ship carrying grain to Iran, the rebels' main benefactor.", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brattleboro Reformer"}, "authors": [{"uri":

This comes after a devastating strike on Sunday near a Rafah refugee camp caused a fire with reportedly 45 people dying including women and children.\n\nAt least a dozen people were killed in two airstrikes Friday in central Gaza. Two children and four women were among the dead.

This week, it also moved into the city's western district of Tel al-Sultan, where witnesses have reported heavy clashes with Hamas fighters.\n\nFriday's statement did not specify where in central Rafah the operations were taking place, but previous statements and witness reports have pointed to raids in the Shaboura refugee camp and other sites near the city centre. More than one million Palestinians have fled the city since the assault began, scattering around southern and central Gaza. The Hamas-run Gaza health ministry has said that more than 36,000 people have died since Israel invaded following the October 7 raid into Israel.\n\nOn Sunday night, an attack on a displacement camp killed at least 45 people, according to the Gaza Health Ministry and the Palestinian Red Crescent rescue service. The ministry said the dead included at least 12 women, eight children, and three older adults, with another three bodies burned beyond recognition.\n\nMohammed Abuassa, who rushed to the scene in the northwestern neighbourhood of Tel al-Sultan, said rescuers \"pulled out people who were in an unbearable state.\" He said: \"We pulled out children who were in pieces. We pulled out young and elderly people. The fire in the camp was unreal.\"\n\nPhilippe Lazzarini, commissioner-general of the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, condemned the airstrike, saying the images coming out of Gaza are a \"testament to how Rafah has turned into hell on earth\".

He said, yes,\" said Dickmann.\n\nThe remarks came a day after the official said he expects the war to drag on for another seven months, in order to destroy the military and governing capabilities of Hamas and the smaller Islamic Jihad militant group. Hamas-led militants killed around 1,200 people, mainly civilians, and abducted around 250 others in the Oct. 7 attack. Around half of those hostages have since been freed, most in swaps for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel during a weeklong cease-fire in November.", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "charlie_jones@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Charlie Jones", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_City", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafah", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafah_Camp", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rafah Camp"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tel_al-Sultan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tel al-Sultan"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_refugees", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian refugees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airstrike", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Airstrike"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Health,_Palestine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Health, Palestine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestine_Red_Crescent_Society", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palestine Red Crescent Society"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugee_camp", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Refugee camp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_Islamic_Jihad", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian Islamic Jihad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNRWA", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UNRWA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tzachi_Hanegbi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tzachi Hanegbi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Carmel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mount Carmel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near_East", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Near East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hostage"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Special_Needs", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Special Needs", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Refugees", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Refugees", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 65}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article32934325.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_PALESTINIAN-ISRAEL-CONFLICT.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9613852", "eventUri": "eng-9613852", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-06", "textStart": 1033, "textEnd": 1038}, {"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 1739, "textEnd": 1748, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.4588235294117647, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

Fighting and Israeli evacuation orders forced more than 1 million Palestinians to flee Rafah, most of whom had already been displaced earlier in the war.\n\nStill, the United States says Israel's operations has not crossed the \"red lines\" of a full-fledged invasion of Rafah that the Biden administration has urged them against, citing the risk to civilians.\n\nIsrael has vowed to expunge Hamas and other Palestinian militants from the entire Gaza Strip, and says Rafah is Hamas' last stronghold. Israeli troops in central Rafah uncovered Hamas rocket launchers and tunnels and dismantled a weapons storage facility, the army said Friday.\n\nIsrael faces growing international criticism for its strategy of systematic destruction in Gaza -- at a huge cost in civilian lives -- in the nearly 8-month-old war against Hamas.\n\nIsraeli bombardments and ground offensives in the besieged territory have killed more than 36,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians.\n\nIsrael launched its war in Gaza after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack in which militants stormed into southern Israel, killed some 1,200 people -- mostly civilians -- and abducted about 250. Israel says around 100 hostages are still captive in Gaza, along with the bodies of around 30 more.\n\nCurrently:\n\n-- Houthi rebels say joint U.S.-British airstrikes in Yemen killed at least 16 and wounded 42\n\n-- Slovenia's government endorses recognition of a Palestinian state\n\n-- A pro-Palestinian camp at Wayne State is dismantled while MIT students walk out of commencement\n\n-- A global aid group asks warring forces to respect its neutrality, saying 24 of its aid workers have been killed\n\nFollow AP's coverage of the war in Gaza at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war\n\nHere's the latest:\n\nISRAEL SAYS IT HAS KILLED 18 HAMAS MILITANTS DURING GAZA WAR WHO WERE DIRECTING ATTACKS IN THE WEST BANK\n\nJERUSALEM -- Israel says it has killed 18 Hamas militants during the war in Gaza from a unit orchestrating attacks against Israelis in the West Bank, including two men who Israel says it targeted in a recent airstrike that ignited a deadly fire in a camp for displaced Palestinians.\n\nThe statement, released Friday by Israel's Shin Bet internal intelligence agency, said it had also detained nine militants from the cell for questioning. The Shin Bet said the two militants killed in Sunday's tent camp strike were Yassin Rabia and Khaled al-Najjar.\n\nThe statement said many of the militants in the unit were released from Israeli prisons in the occupied West Bank and deported to the Gaza Strip as part of the 2011 Gilad Shalit deal, in which more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners were released in exchange for Shalit, an Israeli soldier who was taken from his tank into Gaza in 2006 and held captive for five years.\n\nThe agency said the unit was responsible for over 20 shooting attacks that killed and wounded Israelis in the West Bank, including four attacks that killed eight Israelis last year.\n\nViolence in the West Bank has surged throughout the war in Gaza. Israel has been conducting raids into Palestinian cities and towns in the territory to crack down on militancy and the incursions have led to the deaths of more than 500 Palestinians. Most of those killed have been in clashes with the military. But people throwing stones as well as others not involved in the confrontations have also been killed.\n\nPalestinian attacks against Israelis have also been on the rise in the territory.\n\nISRAELI AIRSTRIKE IN SOUTH LEBANON KILLED A HEZBOLLAH PARAMEDIC, THE GROUP SAYS\n\nBEIRUT -- An Israeli airstrike in south Lebanon killed Friday a member of the Hezbollah militant group's paramedic arm and wounded another, the group's Al-Manar TV reported.\n\nThe strike Friday afternoon on the coastal border town of Naqoura came amid a violent day along the border during which Hezbollah attacked Israeli military posts with explosive drones and rockets with heavy warheads while Israel's air force struck areas on the Lebanese side of the border.\n\nAl-Manar identified the dead member of Hezbollah's Islamic Health Society as Haidar Juhair adding that his death brings to 10 the number of paramedics with the group who have been killed over the past seven months.\n\nThere was no immediate comment from the Israeli military.\n\nThe Lebanon-Israel border has between witnessing almost daily exchange since a day after the Israel-Hamas war started on Oct. 7.\n\nTens of thousands of people have been displaced on both sides of the border and since Oct. 8, more than 400 people have been killed in Lebanon, most of them fighters, but they also include more than 70 civilians and non-combatants. On the Israeli side, 15 soldiers and 10 civilians have been killed during the same period.\n\nISRAEL CONFIRMS ITS FORCES ARE IN CENTRAL RAFAH IN EXPANDING OFFENSIVE IN THE SOUTHERN GAZA CITY\n\nJERUSALEM, Israel -- The Israeli military has confirmed that its forces are operating in central parts of Rafah in its expanding offensive in the southern Gaza city.\n\nThe military said in a statement Friday that its troops in central Rafah had uncovered Hamas rocket launchers and tunnels and dismantled a weapons storage city of the group.\n\nThe statement did not specify where in central Rafah the operations were taking place, but previous statements and witness reports have pointed to raids in the Shaboura refugee camp and other sites near the city center.\n\nMore than 1 million Palestinians have fled the city since the assault began, scattering around southern and central Gaza..\n\nISRAELI GOVERNMENT TELLS HOSTAGE FAMILIES THAT IT'S NOT READY TO SIGN A DEAL TO BRING BACK ALL HOSTAGES\n\nTEL AVIV, Israel -- In an aggressive meeting Thursday, Israel's national security adviser told hostage families that the government wasn't ready to sign a deal to bring all of the hostages home and that there was no plan B.\n\nGil Dickmann, who's cousin Carmel is being held hostage, told The Associated Press that during a face-to-face meeting with Tzachi Hanegbi and several hostage families, they were told the government wasn't prepared to end the war to bring their loved ones back.\n\n\"I said: 'Does that mean that we're doomed, we're lost?' He said, yes,\" said Dickmann.\n\nThe remarks came a day after the official said he expects the war to drag on for another seven months, in order to destroy the military and governing capabilities of Hamas and the smaller Islamic Jihad militant group.\n\nHamas-led militants killed around 1,200 people, mainly civilians, and abducted around 250 others in the Oct. 7 attack. Around half of those hostages have since been freed, most in swaps for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel during a weeklong cease-fire in November.\n\nAfter months of on-and-off negotiations, cease-fire talks are at a standstill.\n\nDickmann said it was the harshest and most difficult meeting with officials since the war began, because it left them hopeless.\n\nAt one point in the meeting, Hanegbi lashed out at one of the women who criticized Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, telling her she was \"full of hate\", said Dickmann.\n\nHanegbi told the hostage families the only way to possibly get the government to sign a deal was through public pressure, said Dickmann. Opinion polls need to show that most Israelis are willing to bring the hostages back at the cost of ending the war, he said.\n\nIsraelis are divided into two main camps: those who want the government to put the war on hold and free the hostages, and others who think the hostages are an unfortunate price to pay for eradicating Hamas\n\nHanegbi's office didn't respond to request for comment.\n\nOn Friday, a group supporting the hostages accused the government of making a \"conscious and deliberate decision to sacrifice\" them, forgoing the Israeli principle that it will never leave anyone behind.\n\nISRAELI ARMY SAYS IT COMPLETED MISSION IN PART OF JABALIYA IN NORTHERN GAZA\n\nTEL AVIV, Israel -- Israel's army said Friday that it completed its mission in part of the Gaza Strip's northern city of Jabaliya and will continue operations in other parts of the enclave.\n\nThe army said during its operations in eastern Jabaliya that it killed hundreds of fighters, destroyed dozens of targets and combat compounds and located hundreds of weapons.\n\nIt also said it destroyed more than 10 kilometers (6 miles) of underground tunnels and retrieved the bodies of seven hostages and returned them to their families in Israel.\n\nIsraeli troops returned to Jabaliya and the surrounding areas in northern Gaza in early May, months after an earlier operation. The United Nations said that about 100,000 Palestinians were displaced in northern Gaza following Israel's evacuation orders.\n\nNorthern Gaza was the first target of Israel's ground offensive launched after Hamas and other militants attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7, killing around 1,200 people.\n\nIsraeli troops have relaunched attacks in the north as Hamas repeatedly returns to areas that Israel withdraws from.\n\nAIRSTRIKES IN CENTRAL GAZA KILL AT LEAST A DOZEN PEOPLE\n\nDEIR AL-BALAH -- At least a dozen people were killed, including children, in two airstrikes Friday in Central Gaza, according to hospital officials and Associated Press journalists who counted the bodies.\n\nThe strikes hit Nuseirat and Bureij, two children and four women were among those killed and the bodies were brought to the Al Aqsa Hospital in Deir al-Balah.\n\nA funeral for all 12 people was held Friday.\n\nIsrael's campaign of bombardment and offensives in Gaza has killed more than 36,000 Palestinians and wounded more than 80,000, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. Its count does not differentiate between civilians and combatants.\n\nAIRSTRIKES TARGETING YEMEN'S HOUTHI REBELS KILL AT LEAST 16\n\nDUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Joint British-United States airstrikes targeting Yemen's Houthi rebels killed at least 16 people and wounded 42 others, the rebels said Friday -- the highest publicly acknowledged death toll from the multiple rounds of strikes carried out over the rebels' attacks on shipping.\n\nThe Houthis have stepped up attacks on shipping in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, demanding that Israel end the war in Gaza, which has killed more than 36,000 Palestinians there. The war began after Hamas-led militants attacked Israel on Oct. 7, killing about 1,200 people and taking around 250 hostage.\n\nHouthis said Friday morning that one of the strikes struck a building housing Hodeida Radio and civilian homes in the port city on the Red Sea. Their Al Masirah satellite news channel aired images of one bloodied man being carried downstairs and others receiving aid in the hospital. It said all the dead and nearly all the wounded from the strikes came from there.\n\nThe Houthis described all those killed and hurt in Hodeida as civilians, something The Associated Press couldn't immediately confirm. The rebel force that's held Yemen's capital, Sanaa, since 2014 includes fighters who often are not in uniform.\n\nOther strikes hit outside of Sanaa near its airport and communication equipment in Taiz, the broadcaster said. Little other information was released on those sites -- likely signaling that Houthi military sites had been struck. One person was wounded in Sanaa.\n\nThe U.S. and the U.K. have launched strikes against the Houthis since January. Abdul Malik al-Houthi, the Houthis' secretive supreme leader, offered an overall death toll for the strikes up to that point as 40 people killed and 35 others wounded. He did not offer a breakdown between civilian and combatant casualties at the time.\n\nThe Houthis have launched more than 50 attacks on shipping, killed three sailors, seized one vessel and sunk another since November, according to the U.S. Maritime Administration. This week, they attacked a ship carrying grain to Iran, the rebels' main benefactor.", "source": {"uri": "yakimaherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yakima Herald-Republic"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The Israeli military launched its incursion into Rafah in early May despite international objections over the fate of Palestinian civilians sheltering there.\n\nA strike over the weekend that started a fire and killed dozens in a displacement camp drew a wave of fresh condemnation, including a social media campaign with the slogan \"All eyes on Rafah\" that has been shared by tens of millions of users.\n\nIsrael, which has repeatedly vowed to destroy Hamas after the Palestinian group attacked southern Israel on October 7, said on Wednesday its forces had taken over the 14-kilometre (8.5-mile) Philadelphi corridor on the GazaEgypt border, which it suspects was used for weapons smuggling.\n\nMilitary spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari announced Israel had taken \"operational control\" of the narrow border area, where he said troops had \"discovered around 20 tunnels\". Egypt, a longtime mediator in the conflict which has become increasingly vocal in its criticism of the Israeli operation, has rejected claims of smuggling tunnels running beneath the buffer zone.\n\n\"Israel is using these allegations to justify continuing the operation on the Palestinian city of Rafah and prolonging the war for political purposes,\" a high-level Egyptian source was quoted as saying by state-linked Al-Qahera News.\n\nEgyptian officials have said a potential Israeli takeover of Philadelphi could violate the two countries' landmark 1979 peace deal, though there has been no official comment from Cairo since the military's announcement.\n\nOn a visit in Beijing, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi called for increased humanitarian assistance to besieged Gaza, and reiterated his country's longstanding opposition to \"any attempt at forcing Palestinians to forcibly flee their land\".\n\nChinese leader Xi Jinping, meanwhile, called yesterday for a \"broad-based, authoritative and effective international peace conference\" to address the war, as he hosted Arab leaders including Sisi.\n\nOn the ground in the Gaza Strip, witnesses reported fighting in central and western Rafah. Witnesses also said Israeli forces had demolished several buildings in the city's eastern areas where the Israeli incursion began on May 7, initially focusing on the vital Rafah border crossing, a key entry point for humanitarian aid.\n\nUN draft resolution\n\nAn AFP correspondent reported artillery and gunfire in Gaza City's southern neighbourhood of Zeitun, in the territory's north, where witnesses saw thick plumes of smoke rising over Jabalia refugee camp and Beit Lahia. A steady stream of civilians have fled Rafah, transporting their belongings on their shoulders, in cars or on donkey-drawn carts.\n\nBefore the Rafah offensive began, the United Nations said up to 1.4 million people were sheltering there. Since then, one million have fled the area, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, has said. The Palestinian Red Crescent reported late Wednesday that two of its paramedics \"were killed as a result of the Israeli occupation's direct bombing\" of an ambulance near Rafah.\n\nThe weekend Israeli strike and ensuing fire which tore through the camp for displaced Palestinians in Rafah, killed 45 people, according to Gaza officials and has prompted two days of discussions at the UN Security Council. Israel has said it targeted a Hamas compound and killed two senior members.\n\nIn the wake of the strike, Algeria presented a draft UN resolution that \"demands an immediate ceasefire respected by all parties\" and the release of all hostages, but it was not clear when it would be put to a vote.", "source": {"uri": "newsofbahrain.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "DT News"}, "authors": [],

Buy a Day Pass or just this story using our new Digital Wallet\n\nIsraeli forces are operating in central parts of Rafah, the military confirmed Friday, widening the invasion of southern Gaza after seizing control of the entire border with Egypt earlier this week\n\nThe offensive in Rafah, which was once the main hub of humanitarian aid operations for the Gaza Strip, has drastically cut off the flow of food, medicine and other supplies to Palestinians facing widespread hunger. Fighting and Israeli evacuation orders forced more than 1 million Palestinians to flee Rafah, most of whom had already been displaced earlier in the war.\n\nStill, the United States says Israel's operations has not crossed the \"red lines\" of a full-fledged invasion of Rafah that the Biden administration has urged them against, citing the risk to civilians.\n\nIsrael has vowed to expunge Hamas and other Palestinian militants from the entire Gaza Strip, and says Rafah is Hamas' last stronghold. Israeli troops in central Rafah uncovered Hamas rocket launchers and tunnels and dismantled a weapons storage facility, the army said Friday.\n\nIsrael faces growing international criticism for its strategy of systematic destruction -- at a huge cost in civilian lives -- in the nearly 8-month-old war against Hamas in Gaza.\n\nIsraeli bombardments and ground offensives in the besieged territory have killed more than 36,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians.\n\nIsrael launched its war in Gaza after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack in which militants stormed into southern Israel, killed some 1,200 people -- mostly civilians -- and abducted about 250. Israel says around 100 hostages are still captive in Gaza, along with the bodies of around 30 more.\n\nCurrently:\n\n-- Houthi rebels say joint U.S.-British airstrikes in Yemen killed at least 16 and wounded 42\n\n-- Slovenia's government endorses recognition of a Palestinian state\n\n-- A pro-Palestinian camp at Wayne State is dismantled while MIT students walk out of commencement\n\n-- A global aid group asks warring forces to respect its neutrality, saying 24 of its aid workers have been killed\n\nFollow AP's coverage of the war in Gaza at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war\n\nHere's the latest:\n\nISRAELI AIRSTRIKE IN SOUTH LEBANON KILLED A HEZBOLLAH PARAMEDIC, THE GROUP SAYS\n\nBEIRUT -- An Israeli airstrike in south Lebanon killed Friday a member of the Hezbollah militant group's paramedic arm and wounded another, the group's Al-Manar TV reported.\n\nThe strike Friday afternoon on the coastal border town of Naqoura came amid a violent day along the border during which Hezbollah attacked Israeli military posts with explosive drones and rockets with heavy warheads while Israel's air force struck areas on the Lebanese side of the border.\n\nAl-Manar identified the dead member of Hezbollah's Islamic Health Society as Haidar Juhair adding that his death brings to 10 the number of paramedics with the group who have been killed over the past seven months.\n\nThere was no immediate comment from the Israeli military.\n\nThe Lebanon-Israel border has between witnessing almost daily exchange since a day after the Israel-Hamas war started on Oct. 7.\n\nTens of thousands of people have been displaced on both sides of the border and since Oct. 8, more than 400 people have been killed in Lebanon, most of them fighters, but they also include more than 70 civilians and non-combatants. On the Israeli side, 15 soldiers and 10 civilians have been killed during the same period.\n\nISRAEL CONFIRMS ITS FORCES ARE IN CENTRAL RAFAH IN EXPANDING OFFENSIVE IN THE SOUTHERN GAZA CITY\n\nJERUSALEM, Israel -- The Israeli military has confirmed that its forces are operating in central parts of Rafah in its expanding offensive in the southern Gaza city.\n\nThe military said in a statement Friday that its troops in central Rafah had uncovered Hamas rocket launchers and tunnels and dismantled a weapons storage city of the group.\n\nThe statement did not specify where in central Rafah the operations were taking place, but previous statements and witness reports have pointed to raids in the Shaboura refugee camp and other sites near the city center.\n\nMore than 1 million Palestinians have fled the city since the assault began, scattering around southern and central Gaza..\n\nISRAELI GOVERNMENT TELLS HOSTAGE FAMILIES THAT IT'S NOT READY TO SIGN A DEAL TO BRING BACK ALL HOSTAGES\n\nTEL AVIV, Israel -- In an aggressive meeting Thursday, Israel's national security adviser told hostage families that the government wasn't ready to sign a deal to bring all of the hostages home and that there was no plan B.\n\nGil Dickmann, who's cousin Carmel is being held hostage, told The Associated Press that during a face-to-face meeting with Tzachi Hanegbi and several hostage families, they were told the government wasn't prepared to end the war to bring their loved ones back.\n\n\"I said: 'Does that mean that we're doomed, we're lost?'

Fighting and Israeli evacuation orders forced more than 1 million Palestinians to flee Rafah, most of whom had already been displaced earlier in the war.\n\nStill, the United States says Israel's operations has not crossed the \"red lines\" of a full-fledged invasion of Rafah that the Biden administration has urged them against, citing the risk to civilians.\n\nIsrael has vowed to expunge Hamas and other Palestinian militants from the entire Gaza Strip, and says Rafah is Hamas' last stronghold.

Still, U.S. President Joe Biden has said Israel has not crossed the \"red lines\" of a full-fledged invasion that he has urged them against.\n\nFriday's statement by the Israeli military suggested its forces have been operating in most parts of the city. For its first weeks, the Israeli assault focused on in Rafah's eastern districts and in areas close to the border with Egypt. Israeli troops seized the Rafah crossing into Egypt on the first day of the offensive and have since claimed control over the Philadelphi Corridor, a road running the length of the Gaza-Egypt border on the Gazan side.\n\nSisters, 8 and 10, who died in wreck on I-270 were best friends, family says Two children found dead in Jefferson County, mother arrested Girl found dead in Jefferson County was aspiring softball pitcher, 'loved everybody' Tornado confirmed in South St. Louis County during Sunday storm Cardinals lose to the Reds, and Nolan Arenado talks bluntly about feeling lost at the plate A mad dash.

It did not specify where in central Rafah the operations were taking place, but previous statements and witness reports have pointed to raids in the Shaboura refugee camp and other sites near the city center.\n\nIsrael has said an offensive in Rafah is vital to uprooting Hamas fighters in its military's campaign to destroy the group after its Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel.\n\nPalestinians who fled the city have scattered around southern and central Gaza, most of them living in squalid tent camps. Up to around 300,000 people are believed to remain in the area, some of them still in the central urban parts of the city, a U.N. official said, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to the press. Shaina Low, a spokesperson for the Norwegian Refugee Council, a humanitarian group that operates in the area, said most have flocked to rural area west of the city near the coast -- an area that has seen deadly Israeli strikes and shelling the past week.\n\n0 Comments", "source": {"uri": "stltoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "St. Louis Post-Dispatch"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The military announced Wednesday it had gained operational control of the area along the Gaza-Egyptian border known as the Philadephi Corridor.\n\n\"IDF troops in central Rafah located Hamas rocket launchers, terror tunnel shafts, and weapons. The troops also dismantled a Hamas weapons storage facility in the area,\" the Israel Defense Forces said in a statement.\n\nIsraeli leaders have frequently repeated the need for its forces to conduct operations in Rafah because it is Hamas's last remaining stronghold in the enclave, valuable to Hamas's smuggling efforts in its tunnel systems and essential to ensure the lasting defeat of Hamas, and Hamas is holding Israeli hostages in Rafah.\n\nSeveral international leaders, including President Joe Biden, have urged Israel against going ahead with military operations in Rafah due to concerns that it could lead to grave civilian casualties. More than a million Palestinians fled to Rafah over the course of the war as Israeli forces operated in central and southern Gaza, and a significant portion of them have fled from Rafah now.\n\nThere are believed to be around 300,000 people still in Rafah, some of them in the central parts of the city, a United Nations official said, according to the Associated Press.\n\nBiden warned on May 8 that the United States would withhold offensive military aid to Israel if it began attacks on \"population centers,\" while U.S. officials have repeatedly said the administration does not support a full-scale ground invasion.\n\nNational Security Council spokesman John Kirby described it as \"thousands and thousands of troops moving in a maneuvered, concentrated, coordinated way against a variety of targets on the ground.\"\n\nLast weekend, Israel carried out an airstrike targeting two Hamas leaders in Rafah, but the strike caused a subsequent explosion and fire, resulting in another 45 deaths. Israel said it had been a precise strike, but the dozens of civilian casualties underscore the difficulties of urban combat.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken described the strike as one that had \"unintended but horrific consequences of military action in a place where the people you're going after are so closely embedded with civilians.\"\n\nKirby said the strike did not cross the administration's red line despite the high civilian casualty count, though Vice President Kamala Harris said of the incident on Tuesday, \"The word tragic doesn't even begin to describe it.\"", "source": {"uri": "washingtonexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Examiner"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mike_brest@washingtonexaminer.com", "name": "Mike Brest", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafah", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_operation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Military operation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hostage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antony_Blinken", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Antony Blinken"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Kirby_(admiral)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John Kirby (admiral)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_warfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Urban warfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_National_Security_Council", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States National Security Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Secretary of State"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airstrike", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Airstrike"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Defense", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Defense", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military_Science", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military Science", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Weapons_and_Equipment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Weapons and Equipment", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/AP24149607454295.jpg.optimal.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9613852", "eventUri": "eng-9613852", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-06", "textStart": 38, "textEnd": 43}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-08", "textStart": 1372, "textEnd": 1377}], "sentiment": -0.192156862745098, "wgt": 149, "relevance": 1}

Around half of those hostages have since been freed, most in swaps for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel during a weeklong cease-fire in November.\n\nAfter months of on-and-off negotiations, cease-fire talks are at a standstill.\n\nDickmann said it was the harshest and most difficult meeting with officials since the war began, because it left them hopeless.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nAt one point in the meeting, Hanegbi lashed out at one of the women who criticized Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, telling her she was \"full of hate\", said Dickmann.\n\nHanegbi told the hostage families the only way to possibly get the government to sign a deal was through public pressure, said Dickmann. Opinion polls need to show that most Israelis are willing to bring the hostages back at the cost of ending the war, he said.\n\nIsraelis are divided into two main camps: those who want the government to put the war on hold and free the hostages, and others who think the hostages are an unfortunate price to pay for eradicating Hamas\n\nHanegbi's office didn't respond to request for comment.\n\nOn Friday, a group supporting the hostages accused the government of making a \"conscious and deliberate decision to sacrifice\" them, forgoing the Israeli principle that it will never leave anyone behind.\n\nISRAELI ARMY SAYS IT COMPLETED MISSION IN PART OF JABALIYA IN NORTHERN GAZA\n\nTEL AVIV, Israel -- Israel's army said Friday that it completed its mission in part of the Gaza Strip's northern city of Jabaliya and will continue operations in other parts of the enclave.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe army said during its operations in eastern Jabaliya that it killed hundreds of fighters, destroyed dozens of targets and combat compounds and located hundreds of weapons.\n\nIt also said it destroyed more than 10 kilometers (6 miles) of underground tunnels and retrieved the bodies of seven hostages and returned them to their families in Israel.\n\nIsraeli troops returned to Jabaliya and the surrounding areas in northern Gaza in early May, months after an earlier operation. The United Nations said that about 100,000 Palestinians were displaced in northern Gaza following Israel's evacuation orders.\n\nNorthern Gaza was the first target of Israel's ground offensive launched after Hamas and other militants attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7, killing around 1,200 people.\n\nIsraeli troops have relaunched attacks in the north as Hamas repeatedly returns to areas that Israel withdraws from.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nAIRSTRIKES IN CENTRAL GAZA KILL AT LEAST A DOZEN PEOPLE\n\nDEIR AL-BALAH -- At least a dozen people were killed, including children, in two airstrikes Friday in Central Gaza, according to hospital officials and Associated Press journalists who counted the bodies.\n\nThe strikes hit Nuseirat and Bureij, two children and four women were among those killed and the bodies were brought to the Al Aqsa Hospital in Deir al-Balah.\n\nA funeral for all 12 people was held Friday.\n\nIsrael's campaign of bombardment and offensives in Gaza has killed more than 36,000 Palestinians and wounded more than 80,000, according to the Gaza Health Ministry.

The war began after Hamas-led militants attacked Israel on Oct. 7, killing about 1,200 people and taking around 250 hostage.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nHouthis said Friday morning that one of the strikes struck a building housing Hodeida Radio and civilian homes in the port city on the Red Sea. Their Al Masirah satellite news channel aired images of one bloodied man being carried downstairs and others receiving aid in the hospital. It said all the dead and nearly all the wounded from the strikes came from there.\n\nThe Houthis described all those killed and hurt in Hodeida as civilians, something The Associated Press couldn't immediately confirm. The rebel force that's held Yemen's capital, Sanaa, since 2014 includes fighters who often are not in uniform.\n\nOther strikes hit outside of Sanaa near its airport and communication equipment in Taiz, the broadcaster said. Little other information was released on those sites -- likely signaling that Houthi military sites had been struck. One person was wounded in Sanaa.\n\nThe U.S. and the U.K. have launched strikes against the Houthis since January. Abdul Malik al-Houthi, the Houthis' secretive supreme leader, offered an overall death toll for the strikes up to that point as 40 people killed and 35 others wounded. He did not offer a breakdown between civilian and combatant casualties at the time.\n\nThe Houthis have launched more than 50 attacks on shipping, killed three sailors, seized one vessel and sunk another since November, according to the U.S. Maritime Administration. This week, they attacked a ship carrying grain to Iran, the rebels' main benefactor.", "source": {"uri": "thestar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Star"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Before the assault on the city, Rafah served as a refuge for over one million displaced Palestinians.\n\nThe Associated Press reported that the Israeli military confirmed its forces were now fighting throughout most of Rafah. President Joe Biden claimed that if Israel attacked the population centers in the city without a plan for the civilians living there, it would cross his \"red line.\"\n\nHowever, as Israeli troops continue to push into the city, killing hundreds in the process and forcing over one million to flee, Biden administration officials have asserted that Tel Aviv has not crossed the red line. After Israel used a US bomb to kill 45 people living in a tent camp in Rafah, White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said, \"As a result of this strike on Sunday, I have no policy changes to speak to.\"\n\nThe assault on Rafah has pushed the overall death toll to over 36,000, including tens of thousands of women and children. The IDF has also sustained losses in Rafah, increasing the number of soldiers killed to 289 since October 7.\n\nAs Israeli forces are pushing deeper into Rafah, the IDF announced the end of weeks of operations in the Jabalia refugee camp, located in northern Gaza. Tel Aviv initially devastated the city in the early months of the war on Gaza, but its forces returned in May. During the operations, the IDF dropped over 200 bombs.\n\nThe attacks on Jabalia and Rafah have caused aid deliveries into Gaza to plummet. Trucks crossing into the Strip in May decreased by two-thirds. This week, two Biden administration officials resigned in part because of the Israeli imposed restrictions on aid deliveries into Gaza and the lack of a response from the White House.\n\nA letter signed by 19 aid agencies released on Tuesday warned that the lack of aid was increasing the risk of death due to starvation and disease. \"As Israeli attacks intensify on Rafah, the unpredictable trickle of aid into Gaza has created a mirage of improved access while the humanitarian response is in reality on the verge of collapse, it says. \"Aid agencies now fear an acceleration in deaths from starvation, disease and denied medical assistance.\"\n\nWhile many are on the brink of death, Tel Aviv says it will not sign on to an agreement that would bring the war to a close and Israeli hostages freed. On Thursday, Hamas officials said the group was willing to come to a \"complete agreement\" that ends the conflict and frees the hostages. On Friday, the Israeli government told the families of the hostages that Tel Aviv was unwilling to end the conflict in exchange for the release of their relatives.", "source": {"uri": "news.antiwar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News From Antiwar.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafah", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_refugees", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian refugees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tel_Aviv", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tel Aviv"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tel Aviv"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jabalia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jabalia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jabalia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Kirby_(admiral)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John Kirby (admiral)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_National_Security_Council", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States National Security Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugee_camp", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Refugee camp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_of_Israel", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarian aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hostage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Immune_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Immune Disorders", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/First_Aid", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/First Aid", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://news.antiwar.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/awc_logo_for-circle-profile_600sq-01.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9613852", "eventUri": "eng-9613852", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 1148, "textEnd": 1157}], "sentiment": -0.5137254901960784, "wgt": 136, "relevance": 1}

Approximately 300,000 to 400,000 noncombatants remain in Rafah, primarily in the coastal area and parts of the city center, Ynet cited army officials as saying.\n\nAlmost all of them -- some 300,000 -- are expected to remain in Rafah, similar to the number of Palestinian civilians who remained in Gaza City following the IDF's ground maneuver there, Ynet added.\n\nSecurity officials were said to have been surprised by the rapid evacuation, including from areas for which no evacuation order was issued.\n\nThe population of Gaza's southernmost city, which stood at 263,876 in early 2022 according to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics, swelled by over a million people in the early weeks of the war as Gaza residents fled from the fighting in northern Gaza.\n\nBiden administration officials had estimated that the humanitarian operation would take at least \"several months,\" The Washington Post reported as recently as May 11.\n\nIsrael's War Cabinet on May 6 decided to \"continue the operation in Rafah to exert military pressure on Hamas in order to promote the release of our hostages and the other goals of the war.\"\n\nIsraeli troops took control of the Gaza side of the Rafah Crossing with Egypt the following morning, as tanks from the IDF's 162nd Division's 401st Armored Brigade rolled up to the border station.\n\nThe Rafah operation, which Israel estimates will last around two months, is being carried out in stages as opposed to a full-scale invasion. The phased nature of the operation allows for it to be paused should a hostage release deal be reached with Hamas.\n\nPresident Joe Biden has frequently made clear that his administration does not support a major offensive in Rafah. Instead, the White House favors a limited operation aimed at attacking high-value Hamas targets and securing the Gaza-Egypt border.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has stated repeatedly that conquering Rafah is essential to winning the war against Hamas. Israel says Hamas's final four battalions, comprising some 3,000 terrorists, are holed up in the city, as well as the terrorist group's senior leadership.\n\nMany of the 128 hostages still in the hands of Hamas after more than 220 days are believed to be held in Rafah.

Identifying these key topics for patients creates a base for clinicians to better understand what type of results patients are looking to receive from their care.\"\n\nAdditional notable findings include that even though clinicians have focused on inducible laryngeal obstruction's impact on breathing, more participants reported that they were troubled by some other symptoms of discomfort as well, such as throat and chest tightness, that occur along with it.\n\nAdditionally, 65% of participants described difficulty getting diagnosed or treated accurately and many reported an emotional consequence from inducible laryngeal obstruction.\n\nSeveral participants described frustration and a sense of stigma from having their symptoms dismissed as anxiety.\n\n\"The results show that patients place emphasis on the emotional and psychosocial consequences of having inducible laryngeal obstruction,\" said McConville. \"Since these seem especially important to patients impacted by the disorder, future efforts to treat inducible laryngeal obstruction and to measure treatment outcomes may be inaccurate if they do not take these parts of their experiences into account adequately.\"\n\nSusan L.

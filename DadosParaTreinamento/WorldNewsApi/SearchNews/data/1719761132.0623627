Trump's show of nerves appeared in a Truth Social post complaining in all-caps of various unsubstantiated claims that his judge is corrupted, the prosecutors have no case, President Joe Biden is out to get him and one person involved is a bum. \"KANGAROO COURT!\" the lengthy missive begins. ALSO READ: What Trump's weird WWE Hall of Fame speech tells us about his presidential debate strategy Trump's rant appeared roughly an hour before the former president was expected to appear in Manhattan criminal court to witness the handover of District Attorney Alvin Bragg's case \u2014 and his lawyers' defense \u2014 to the jurors. Trump has pleaded not guilty to 34 counts of falsifying business records to conceal hush money payments to bury salacious stories that might have torpedoed his 2016 presidential campaign. Despite his adamant and apparently outraged condemnation of Judge Juan Merchan and the star witness in Bragg's case, spectators say the post was a tell of underlying panic. The Lincoln Project, an anti-Trump conservative group, shared the post with a snarky reaction: \"Me when I'm freaking out.\" Former prosecutor Joyce Vance agreed Trump appeared anxious. \"Out of control nerves here,\" she added. \"Trump\u2019s going to be found guilty and he knows it,\" argued X user Travis Matthews. \"The out of control rage tweets are only going to get worse and more frequent.\" Others noted his reference to \"THE BUM THAT GOT CAUGHT STEALING FROM ME\" might skirt a gag order that bars him from publicly attacking trial witnesses such as Michael Cohen, who testified in court that he had taken cash from Trump. \"The bum that got stealing from me?\" replied X user Bill de Mayo. \"I mean it's the end of the trial but if you wanna throw him in jail til verdict I'd laugh.\"", "summary": "<img src=\"https://www.rawstory.com/media-library/trump-political-operation-steers-130-million-in-donor-money-to-cover-legal-fees.jpg?id=34788029&width=1245&height=700&coordinates=0%2C271%2C0%2C272\"/><br/><br/><p>Former President Donald Trump appeared to be \"freaking out\" as he headed toward jury deliberations in his criminal hush money trial, spectators say. </p><p>Trump's show of nerves appeared in a <a href=\"https://www.rawstory.com/trump-kangaroo-court/\" target=\"_blank\">Truth Social post</a> complaining in all-caps of various unsubstantiated claims that his <a href=\"https://www.rawstory.com/jake-tapper-trump/\" target=\"_blank\">judge is corrupted</a>, <a href=\"https://www.rawstory.com/trump-trial-statement-fact-check/\" target=\"_blank\">the prosecutors have no case</a>, <a href=\"https://www.rawstory.com/trump-hush-money-statement-2668105221/\" target=\"_blank\">President Joe Biden is out to get him</a> and one person involved is a bum. </p><p>\"KANGAROO COURT!\" the lengthy missive begins. </p><p><strong>ALSO READ:", "url": "https://www.rawstory.com/trump-truth-social-rant/", "image": "https://www.rawstory.com/media-library/trump-political-operation-steers-130-million-in-donor-money-to-cover-legal-fees.jpg?id=34788029&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C346%2C0%2C347", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 14:11:38", "author": "Kathleen Culliton", "authors": ["Kathleen Culliton"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.525}

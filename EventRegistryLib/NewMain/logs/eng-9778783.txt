despite winning race due to little-known rule", "body": "A Team GB star has been disqualified from an event in the Olympics after he accidentally broke a rule during his heat.\n\nLuke Greenbank had been competing in the men's 200 metre backstroke, an event in which he won the bronze medal in Tokyo 2020, and won his heat.\n\nHowever, the swimmer was distraught to learn that he'd been disqualified from the event after finishing the race in first place.\n\nHaving thought he'd booked his spot in the semi finals and got himself closer to a shot at winning another Olympic medal, Greenbank was instead left with his head in his hands as he looked up at the results board and saw that he'd been hit with a disqualification.\n\nVideo replays revealed the reason why he'll play no further part in the event.\n\nFootage of the race showed that Greenbank had still been underwater after the 15 metre mark of the race.\n\nThe rules of swimming state that a swimmer must break the water and have part of them above the surface by the time they reach 15 metres, and they have to do this for each lap they take as well.\n\nIf you're watching the swimming at the Olympics you'll see that the blue barriers have a couple of circles of red in them a certain way into the pool.\n\nThat denotes 15 metres and the point at which a swimmer needs to have put a part of themselves above the water or face disqualification.\n\nSpeaking after the result came in, Greenbank said: \"I don't know what to say, absolutely gutted.\n\n\"It's really annoying, I feel like I'm on good form.\"\n\nHaving posted a time of 1:56.08 he'd actually been the fastest of all competitors in the heats but that disqualification means it ended up being all for naught.\n\nOlympics fans were gutted for the Team GB swimmer, saying it was 'brutal' and 'heart wrenching'.\n\nAustralian swimming legend Ian Thorpe said it was clear 'how devastated' Greenbank was, but that the officials made the right decision as the swimmer was 'well past that mark'.\n\nFellow Brit Oliver Morgan, who came fifth in the same heat, made it through to the semi finals and will continue Team GB's efforts to collect a medal in this event.\n\nAs well as winning bronze in the 200 metre backstroke in Tokyo, Greenbank was also part of the Team GB squad that won silver in the 4x100 metre medley.", "source": {"uri": "ladbible.com", "dataType":

You can check out at any time. More info\n\nA Team GB swimmer, who once had a fiery altercation with Adam Peaty, has been disqualified from an Olympic event for breaching a little-known rule.\n\nLuke Greenbank had won his heat in the 200m backstroke in Paris, only to be kicked out for swimming more than 15m underwater after the final turn at the 150m mark. Devastated by the decision, the Cumbrian athlete admitted he was \"absolutely gutted\" and that it was \"really annoying\".\n\nThis disqualification comes less than a year after the 26-year-old clashed with former Olympic champion Peaty following a training session. The incident allegedly saw Peaty slap Greenbank on the bum and make a remark about his teammate's girlfriend, Anna Hopkin, another Olympic swimmer. She had previously been in a relationship with Peaty.\n\nREAD MORE: Olympics star vomits live on BBC as athletes collapse amid pollution concerns\n\nDespite the tension, both swimmers were said to have quickly reconciled with a handshake. Following claims that Peaty had suffered an injury which required stitches, an image surfaced online showing him with a cut near his left eye.\n\nAt the time, British Swimming confirmed the scuffle, saying in a statement: \"An incident occurred at a recent training session that was quickly and effectively resolved by the athletes involved and the staff present at the session.\"\n\nSoon after, a source close to Peaty played down the spat, telling Swimming World Magazine: \"There were no punches, let alone stitches. There wasn't even any slapping. Adam made a remark that Greenbank objected to, picked up a piece of training equipment and threw it at Adam. The cut wasn't intentional.\"\n\nPeaty subsequently told The Times, through his management team, that harmony has been restored between him and Greenbank. He also expressed regret that Hopkin had been linked to the incident, insisting that the Tokyo 2020 mixed 4x100m relay gold medallist had not even been mentioned.\n\n\"Me and Luke are fine,\" said Peaty. \"We had a moment and then shook hands immediately after some tension after a hard training set. I have no idea how Anna got dragged into this.

Big names from the world of football and beyond take to the Stamford Bridge pitch this evening for the latest edition of Soccer Aid. Children\u2019s charity UNICEF will again be the beneficiaries, with more than \u00a390m raised since the fixture first took place in 2006. England\u2019s last victory came in 2018, with five straight defeats since then, and it is Frank Lampard and Harry Redknapp in the dugout in west London attempting to end that winless run. Jermain Defoe, Jack Wilshere and Joe Cole are among the former players involved, along with celebrities including Steven Bartlett, Paddy McGuinness and Eddie Hearn. Mauricio Pochettino makes a swift return to Stamford Bridge, having left Chelsea last month, as he manages the World XI side. The likes of Eden Hazard and Michael Essien are also back on familiar territory, while Usain Bolt, who opened the scoring a year ago, also features again.

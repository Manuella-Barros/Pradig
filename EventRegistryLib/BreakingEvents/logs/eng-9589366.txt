An inverted American flag - another symbol carried by rioters - was seen at Alito\u00b4s home outside Washington less than two weeks after the violent attack on the Capitol.\n\nNews of the upside-down American flag sparked an uproar last week, including calls from high-ranking Democrats for Alito to recuse himself from cases related to former President Donald Trump.\n\nAlito and the court declined to respond to requests for comment on how the \"Appeal to Heaven\" flag came to be flying and what it was intended to express. He previously said the inverted American flag was flown by his wife amid a dispute with neighbors, and he had no part in it.\n\nThe white flag with a green pine tree was seen flying at the Alito beach home in New Jersey, according to three photographs obtained by the Times. The images were taken on different dates in July and September 2023, though it wasn't clear how long it was flying overall or how much time Alito spent there.\n\nThe flag dates back to the Revolutionary War, but in more recent years it has become associated with Christian nationalism and support for Trump. It was carried by rioters fueled by Trump's \"Stop the Steal\" movement animated by false claims of election fraud.\n\nFILE - Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito Jr., left, and his wife Martha-Ann Alito, pay their respects at the casket of Reverend Billy Graham at the Rotunda of the U.S. Capitol Building in Washington, Feb. 28, 2018. An upside-down American flag was displayed outside of Alito's home Jan. 17, 2021, days after former President Donald Trump supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol, The New York Times reports. It's a symbol associated with Trump's false claims of election fraud. \"It was briefly placed by Mrs. Alito in response to a neighbor's use of objectionable and personally insulting language on yard signs,\" Alito said in an emailed statement to the newspaper. (AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais, File)\n\nRepublicans in Congress and state officials have also displayed the flag. House Speaker Mike Johnson hung it at his office last fall shortly after winning the gavel. A spokesman said the speaker appreciates its rich history and was given the flag by a pastor who served as a guest chaplain for the House.\n\nAlito, meanwhile, is taking part in two pending Supreme Court cases associated with Jan. 6: whether Trump has immunity from prosecution for his efforts to overturn the 2020 election results and whether a certain obstruction charge can be used against rioters. He also participated in the court\u00b4s unanimous ruling that states can\u00b4t bar Trump from the ballot using the \"insurrection clause\" that was added to the Constitution after the Civil War.\n\nNews of the second flag brought renewed calls for Alito to step aside from the Trump-related cases. \"At this point it is difficult to make any reasonable case for Alito\u00b4s impartiality. It can and must be questioned. As a result, he must not sit on cases about the 2020 election or the insurrection he appears to have supported,\" said Noah Bookbinder, president of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. The group represented Colorado voters in the \"insurrection clause\" case at the high court seeking to bar Trump from the ballot.\n\nThere has been no indication Alito would step aside from the cases.\n\nAnother conservative justice, Clarence Thomas, also has ignored calls to recuse himself from cases related to the 2020 election because of his wife Virginia Thomas' support for efforts to overturn Trump's loss to President Joe Biden.\n\nPublic trust in the Supreme Court, meanwhile, recently hit its lowest point in at least 50 years.\n\nJudicial ethics codes focus on the need for judges to be independent, avoiding political statements or opinions on matters they could be called on to decide. The Supreme Court had long gone without its own code of ethics, but it adopted one in November 2023 in the face of sustained criticism over undisclosed trips and gifts from wealthy benefactors to some justices.

over a home of Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito last summer, the New York Times reported Wednesday.\n\nThe second flag, which the report said is a symbol for a religious strand of the \"Stop the Steal\" campaign, was raised over Alito's New Jersey vacation home in July and September of 2023.\n\nThe Times previously reported that an upside-down American flag flew over the justices Virginia home in January of 2021.\n\nSupreme Court justices are supposed to avoid politics.\n\nAlito told the Times his wife, Martha-Ann Alito, raised the inverted flag in response to a dispute with a neighbor and he \"had no involvement whatsoever.\"\n\nThe Times said Alito declined to respond to questions about the beach house flag.\n\nA spokesperson for the Supreme Court did not immediately respond to a request for comment from USA TODAY to the latest report.\n\nMore Justices Thomas, Alito complain about 'nastiness' and 'imperiled' freedom of religion\n\nThe high court is deciding two cases related to former President Donald Trump and his supporters' efforts to overturn the results of the election, decisions that will affect the criminal election interference charges pending against Trump.\n\nAfter news of the inverted flag broke, Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin, D-Ill., who heads the Senate Judiciary Committee, called on Alito to recuse himself from cases related to the 2020 election in a statement.\n\nRelated Supreme Court grapples with limits on obstruction charge in Jan. 6 cases\n\n'Freak flag': Senate Democrats bash Supreme Court Justice Alito for upside-down

An inverted American flag -- another symbol carried by rioters -- was seen at Alito's home outside Washington less than two weeks after the violent attack on the Capitol.\n\nNews of the upside-down American flag sparked an uproar last week, including calls from high-ranking Democrats for Alito to recuse himself from cases related to former President Donald Trump.\n\nAlito and the court declined to respond to requests for comment on how the \"Appeal to Heaven\" flag came to be flying and what it was intended to express. He previously said the inverted American flag was flown by his wife amid a dispute with neighbors, and he had no part in it.\n\nThe white flag with a green pine tree was seen flying at the Alito beach home in New Jersey, according to three photographs obtained by the Times. The images were taken on different dates in July and September 2023, though it wasn't clear how long it was flying overall or how much time Alito spent there.\n\nThe flag dates back to the Revolutionary War, but in more recent years it has become associated with Christian nationalism and support for Trump. It was carried by rioters fueled by Trump's \"Stop the Steal\" movement animated by false claims of election fraud.\n\nRepublicans in Congress and state officials have also displayed the flag. House Speaker Mike Johnson hung it at his office last fall shortly after winning the gavel. A spokesman said the speaker appreciates its rich history and was given the flag by a pastor who served as a guest chaplain for the House.\n\nAlito, meanwhile, is taking part in two pending Supreme Court cases associated with Jan. 6: whether Trump has immunity from prosecution for his efforts to overturn the 2020 election results and whether a certain obstruction charge can be used against rioters. He also participated in the court's unanimous ruling that states can't bar Trump from the ballot using the \"insurrection clause\" that was added to the Constitution after the Civil War.\n\nNews of the second flag brought renewed calls for Alito to step aside from the Trump-related cases. \"At this point it is difficult to make any reasonable case for Alito's impartiality. It can and must be questioned. As a result, he must not sit on cases about the 2020 election or the insurrection he appears to have supported,\" said Noah Bookbinder, president of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. The group represented Colorado voters in the \"insurrection clause\" case at the high court seeking to bar Trump from the ballot.\n\nThere has been no indication Alito would step aside from the cases.\n\nAnother conservative justice, Clarence Thomas, also has ignored calls to recuse himself from cases related to the 2020 election because of his wife Virginia Thomas' support for efforts to overturn Trump's loss to President Joe Biden.\n\nPublic trust in the Supreme Court, meanwhile, recently hit its lowest point in at least 50 years.\n\nJudicial ethics codes focus on the need for judges to be independent, avoiding political statements or opinions on matters they could be called on to decide. The Supreme Court had long gone without its own code of ethics, but it adopted one in November 2023 in the face of sustained criticism over undisclosed trips and gifts from wealthy benefactors to some justices. The code lacks a means of enforcement, however.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

McConnell Tells Critics to Leave Supreme Court Alone", "body": "The comment came after Justice Alito admitted that an inverted flag hung outside his home after January 6, prompting Democrats to demand that he recuse himself.\n\nCritics need to leave the Supreme Court \"alone,\" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said on May 21. The comment came days after Justice Samuel Alito acknowledged that his wife briefly flew a U.S. flag upside down outside their Virginia home 11 days after the security breach at the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021.\n\nFlying the American flag upside-down has come to be known as a symbol of distress or as a protest. After January 6, supporters of then-President Donald Trump borrowed the symbol as part of the \"Stop the Steal\" movement to protest irregularities they claim plagued the 2020 election, as well as the decision by Congress to certify the election of President Joe Biden.\n\nPresident Trump, a Republican, and President Biden, a Democrat, are set to square off again in the upcoming Nov. 5 election.\n\nFederal law contains an unenforceable provision stating the American flag \"should never be displayed with the union down, except as a signal of dire distress in instances of extreme danger to life or property.\" There is no actual penalty prescribed for flying the flag upside down.\n\n\"It seems to me there are nonstop attacks on the Supreme Court, week after week after week, so I'm not going to dignify that with a response,\" the senator said at his weekly news conference. Mr. McConnell had been asked if displaying the flag that way was appropriate and if Justice Alito should recuse himself in any cases about the 2020 election.\n\n\"We need to leave the Supreme Court alone, protect them from people who went into their neighborhoods and tried to do them harm. Look out for the Supreme Court -- that's part of the job of the administration,\" Mr. McConnell said.\n\nJustice Alito said the display of the inverted flag was connected to conflict with neighbors, not to the congressional security breach, which Democrats label an \"insurrection.\"\n\n\"I had no involvement whatsoever in the flying of the flag,\" Justice Alito told The New York Times, which published a photograph of the flag dated Jan. 17, 2021. \"It was briefly placed by Mrs. Alito in response to a neighbor's use of objectionable and personally insulting language on yard signs,\" he said.\n\nThe justice told Fox News that a neighbor had erected a \"[expletive] Trump\" sign near a school bus stop used by the couple's children. The neighbor also put up another sign blaming the justice's wife for the events of January 6 and used profanity in her presence.\n\nJustice Alito said his spouse was distraught and displayed the flag upside down \"for a short time.\"\n\nRowdy protests rocked the neighborhood of Justice Alito and other conservative Supreme Court justices in 2022 after a draft court opinion written by Justice Alito overturning Roe v. Wade was leaked. Activists protested outside the Alitos' home in Alexandria, Virginia.\n\nOn June 8, 2022, Nicholas John Roske was arrested for attempting to assassinate Justice Brett Kavanaugh at his Maryland home. Mr. Roske reportedly said he wanted to kill the justice to prevent him from voting to overturn abortion rights and gun control laws. Later that month, Mikeal Deshawn Archambault was arrested for threatening on social media to \"kill everyone\" at the Supreme Court with an AK-47 rifle.\n\nJustice Alito's admission that the flag flew the wrong side up a week and a half after the events of January 6 has led to an escalation in Democrat rhetoric against the court, which currently has a 6-3 conservative majority. Six of the justices were appointed by Republican presidents, while three were appointed by Democrats.\n\nDemocrats claim the flag incident is proof that Justice Alito, 74, who was appointed in 2006 by Republican President George W. Bush, cannot be trusted to be impartial in his rulings. Democrat lawmakers on Capitol Hill are demanding that the justice recuse himself from cases related to the 2020 election and to January 6, including a case the Supreme Court is currently deliberating about President Trump's legal immunity in an election subversion case.\n\nOn the same day as Mr. McConnell spoke, 45 House Democrats sent a letter to Justice Alito asking him to recuse himself \"from any further participation in the cases of Trump v. United States, Fischer v. United States, and any other cases that may arise from the events surrounding January 6 or the 2020 election.\"\n\n\"It is incontrovertible that at the time the upside down flag flew from your front lawn, 'Stop the Steal' activists had adopted the inverted flag as their symbol of protest. Their belief that widespread election fraud had thrown the election from former President Trump to then President-Elect Biden has never been supported by any evidence.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court heard Trump v. United States on April 25. The case is about whether President Trump enjoys immunity from prosecution for official acts carried out during his time in office.\n\nThe court heard Fischer v. United States on April 16. In the case, a former police officer was charged under an accounting reform law after he entered the U.S. Capitol for four minutes on Jan. 6, 2021. The case is being closely watched because once the Supreme Court rules, its decision could affect hundreds of January 6 prosecutions, including one of the cases against President Trump.\n\nDemocrats also say the flag incident adds to their arguments in support of the proposed Supreme Court Ethics, Recusal, and Transparency Act (SCERT), which would create a system allowing members of the public to file complaints against justices for violating a proposed code of conduct or for engaging \"in conduct that undermines the integrity\" of the court. It would empower a panel of lower court judges to investigate complaints against the justices and order disciplinary actions. The Senate Judiciary Committee approved the bill on a party-line vote in July 2023.\n\nThe Epoch Times has reached out to Justice Alito for comment.", "source": {"uri": "theepochtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.theepochtimes.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "2020 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Alito", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Samuel Alito"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judicial_disqualification", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Judicial disqualification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Flag of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitch_McConnell", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mitch McConnell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempts_to_overturn_the_2020_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Attempts to overturn the 2020 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Press conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minority_leader", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minority leader"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Capitol", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Capitol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brett_Kavanaugh", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brett Kavanaugh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_control", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gun control"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion-rights_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Abortion-rights movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Roe v.

Please try again later{{ /verifyErrors }}\n\nAnother flag carried by January 6 rioters was seen flying outside the New Jersey beach home of Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito on multiple occasions last year, according to a report.\n\nThe \"Appeal to Heaven\" flag, was carried by rioters during the pro-Trump attack on the US Capitol in 2021, was flown outside the vacation home of Justice Alito during the summer of 2023. Also known as the \"Pine Tree flag\", it dates back to the Revolutionary War.\n\nIt comes days after reports from The New York Times, that a flagpole on the judge's front lawn at a property in Virginia had flown an upside-down American flag in late 2020 and early 2021, in the days after Joe Biden took office.\n\nThe \"Appeal To Heaven\" flag and the inverted US flag were both embraced by supporters of Donald Trump's \"Stop The Steal\" campaign, which falsely claimed Mr Biden's was fraudulent.\n\nThree photos obtained by the newspaper, along with accounts from a half-dozen neighbors and passers-by given to the outlet, confirmed that the \"Appeal to Heaven\" flag was flying at the Alitos' home on Long Beach Island in July and September of 2023.\n\nA Google Street View image from August 2023 also shows the flag flying.\n\nThe newspaper noted that the photographs it had obtained were each taken independently and were from four different dates, though it was not clear whether the flag was displayed continuously during those months or how long it was flown overall.\n\nThe Independent has contacted the Supreme Court for comment about the flag outside the Alitos' New Jersey property. Mr Alito declined to comment to the Associated Press.\n\nNews of the upside-down American flag at the Alitos' Virginia home in 2020/ 2021 sparked an uproar last week.\n\nMr Alito previously said the inverted American flag was flown \"for a short time\" by his wife amid a dispute with neighbors, and he had no part in it.\n\nThe flag was visible up to 17 January 2021, The New York Times reported, 11 days after the violent insurrection in Washington DC, and three days before Mr Biden's inauguration.\n\nThe traditional military distress symbol was repurposed as a political symbol to indicate rejection of the legitimacy of Mr Biden's election victory.\n\nThe flag furore comes ahead of two pending Supreme Court cases associated with January 6. Justices will decide whether Mr Trump has immunity from prosecution for his efforts to overturn the 2020 election results and whether a certain obstruction charge can be used against rioters.\n\nJustice Alito also participated in the court's unanimous ruling that states can't bar the former president from the ballot using the \"insurrection clause\", added to the Constitution after the Civil War.\n\nDespite Justice Alito's denial about his involvement with the flag in Virginia, the Senate Judiciary Committee's top Democrat, Senator Richard Durbin of Illinois, previously called for him to recuse himself from the cases related to the January 6 attack.\n\nNews of the second flag has brought renewed calls for Mr Alito to step aside from the Trump-related cases.\n\n\"At this point it is difficult to make any reasonable case for Alito's impartiality. It can and must be questioned. As a result, he must not sit on cases about the 2020 election or the insurrection he appears to have supported,\" Noah Bookbinder, president of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington told AP.\n\nThe group represented Colorado voters in the \"insurrection clause\" case at the high court seeking to bar Trump from the ballot.\n\nThere has been no indication Mr Alito will be stepping aside from the cases.\n\nRep Adam Schiff also called for Justice Alito to recuse himself.\n\n\"The \"Appeal to Heaven\" flag was carried by rioters at the Capitol on January 6. It was also flown -- apparently for months -- outside of Justice Samuel Alito's other home. It's yet another demonstration of his clear bias. And it demands his recusal from Jan. 6th related cases,\" he wrote on X.", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

An inverted American flag \u2013 another symbol carried by rioters \u2013 was seen at Alito\u2019s home outside Washington less than two weeks after the violent attack on the Capitol.\n\nNews of the upside-down American flag sparked an uproar last week, including calls from high-ranking Democrats for Alito to recuse himself from cases related to former US president Donald Trump.\n\nAlito and the court declined to respond to requests for comment on how the \u201cAppeal to Heaven\u201d flag came to be flying and what it was intended to express. He previously said the inverted American flag was flown by his wife amid a dispute with neighbours, and he had no part in it.\n\nThe white flag with a green pine tree was seen flying at the Alito beach home in New Jersey, according to three photographs obtained by the Times. The images were taken on different dates in July and September 2023, though it was not clear how long it was flying overall or how much time Alito spent there.\n\nThe flag dates back to the Revolutionary War, but in more recent years it has become associated with Christian nationalism and support for Trump. It was carried by rioters fuelled by Trump\u2019s \u201cStop the Steal\u201d movement animated by false claims of election fraud.\n\nRepublicans in Congress and state officials have also displayed the flag. House Speaker Mike Johnson hung it at his office last fall shortly after winning the gavel. A spokesman said the speaker appreciates its rich history and was given the flag by a pastor who served as a guest chaplain for the House.\n\nAlito, meanwhile, is taking part in two pending Supreme Court cases associated with January 6: whether Trump has immunity from prosecution for his efforts to overturn the 2020 election results and whether a certain obstruction charge can be used against rioters.\n\nHe also took part in the court\u2019s unanimous ruling that states cannot bar Trump from the ballot using the \u201cinsurrection clause\u201d that was added to the Constitution after the Civil War.\n\nNews of the second flag brought renewed calls for Alito to step aside from the Trump-related cases.\n\n\u201cAt this point it is difficult to make any reasonable case for Alito\u2019s impartiality.

Steve Cohen introduced a resolution to censure Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito after reports circulated that an upside-down American flag was hung outside his home in the aftermath of the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol.\n\nThe inverted flag is a symbol of the \"Stop the Steal\" movement of former President Donald Trump's supporters who falsely claimed that there was widespread fraud in the 2020 presidential election.\n\nTrump has long alleged that the election he lost by more than 7 million votes was \"stolen,\" but he has not presented evidence to back his claim during the past four years.\n\nHis allegations have repeatedly been shot down in subsequent court cases.\n\nThe New York Times first reported on the inverted flag at Alito's residence, saying in a story last week that it was displayed less than two weeks after the Jan. 6 insurrection.\n\nAlito claimed in a statement to the newspaper that he had no role in displaying the flag, blaming it on his wife who he said, \"briefly placed\" it there \"in response to a neighbor's use of objectionable and personally insulting language on yard signs.\"\n\nThe display has prompted calls from a wide segment of Democrats, for Alito to recuse himself from cases that come before the Court related to Trump's alleged efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election, and the attack on the Capitol two months later.\n\nCohen, in a statement, said that by flying the inverted flag at his residence, Alito \"publicly engaged in political activity and demonstrated his bias, a breach of judicial ethics, and called into question Supreme Court impartiality.\n\n\"Beyond poor judgment, Justice Alito's misuse of the American flag is a knowing and shameless demonstration of his political bias. He literally flew a flag in front of his house showing the world he supported the January 6th insurrectionists,\" he said Tuesday as he introduced his resolution.\n\n\"What's more, he continues to participate in litigation directly related to the 2020 election and the Insurrection, in direct violation of the federal recusal statute and the Supreme Court's own ethics rules,\" he added.\n\nThe resolution is unlikely to advance in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives, but a letter urging Alito to recuse himself from all Jan. 6-related cases gained signatures from 45 Democrats in the chamber on Tuesday.\n\nSenate Republican Whip John Thune told CNN on Tuesday that flying an inverted flag was a \"bad decision\" for Alito.\n\n\"I don't know how you explain that,\" said Thune.\n\nRepublican Sen. Lindsey Graham also called it a \"mistake.\"\n\n\"It creates a bad image,\" Graham told CNN. \"It created a situation that we're all talking about.

An inverted American flag -- another symbol carried by rioters -- was seen at Alito's home outside Washington less than two weeks after the violent attack on the Capitol.\n\nNews of the upside-down American flag sparked an uproar last week, including calls from high-ranking Democrats for Alito to recuse himself from cases related to former President Donald Trump.\n\nAlito and the court declined to respond to requests for comment on how the \"Appeal to Heaven\" flag came to be flying and what it was intended to express. He previously said the inverted American flag was flown by his wife amid a dispute with neighbors, and he had no part in it.\n\nThe white flag with a green pine tree was seen flying at the Alito beach home in New Jersey, according to three photographs obtained by the Times. The images were taken on different dates in July and September 2023, though it wasn't clear how long it was flying overall or how much time Alito spent there.\n\nThe flag dates back to the Revolutionary War, but in more recent years its become associated with Christian nationalism and support for Trump. It was carried by rioters fueled by Trump's \"Stop the Steal\" movement animated by false claims of election fraud.\n\nRepublicans in Congress and state officials have also displayed the flag. House Speaker Mike Johnson hung it at his office last fall shortly after winning the gavel. A spokesman said the speaker appreciates its rich history and was given the flag by a pastor who served as a guest chaplain for the House.\n\nAlito, meanwhile, is taking part in two pending Supreme Court cases associated with Jan. 6: whether Trump has immunity from prosecution for his efforts to overturn the 2020 election results and whether a certain obstruction charge can be used against rioters. He also participated in the court's unanimous ruling that states can't bar Trump from the ballot using the \"insurrection clause\" that was added to the Constitution after the Civil War.\n\nThere has been no indication Alito would step aside from the cases.\n\nAnother conservative justice, Clarence Thomas, also has ignored calls to recuse himself from cases related to the 2020 election because of his wife Virginia Thomas' support for efforts to overturn Trump's loss to President Joe Biden.\n\nPublic trust in the Supreme Court, meanwhile, recently hit its lowest point in at least 50 years.\n\nJudicial ethics codes focus on the need for judges to be independent, avoiding political statements or opinions on matters they could be called on to decide. The Supreme Court had long gone without its own code of ethics, but it adopted one in November 2023 in the face of sustained criticism over undisclosed trips and gifts from wealthy benefactors to some justices. The code lacks a means of enforcement, however.", "source": {"uri": "apnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "AP NEWS"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The Times report comes a week after it was revealed that Alito's home also flew a \"Stop the Steal\" flag, an upside American flag, in the weeks following Trump's bid to retain power and his supporters' violent effort to stop the certification of the 2020 presidential election.\n\n\"This time, it was the 'Appeal to Heaven' flag, which, like the inverted U.S. flag, was carried by rioters at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Also known as the Pine Tree flag, it dates back to the Revolutionary War, but largely fell into obscurity until recent years and is now a symbol of support for former President Donald J. Trump, for a religious strand of the 'Stop the Steal' campaign and for a push to remake American government in Christian terms,\" reported the Times on the second controversial flag.\n\nThe Times collected testimonials from \" half-dozen neighbors and passers-by\" who saw the flag and confirmed it \"aloft at the Alito home on Long Beach Island in New Jersey in July and September of 2023.\" The report also noted that \"a Google Street View image from late August also shows the flag.\"\n\nAlito has been hammered by critics, including Republicans, since the initial Times report over what they see as the justice advertising both his pro-Trump and anti-liberal bias. Alito told Fox News's Shannon Bream that his wife put out the \"Stop the Steal\" flag after a neighbor used the word \"cunt\" in their presence for complaining about anti-Trump signage in their yard.\n\n\"Justice Alito says he and his wife were walking in the neighborhood and there were words between Mrs. Alito and a male at the home with the sign,\" reported Bream. \"Alito says the man engaged in vulgar language, 'including the c-word.'\"\n\n\"I had no involvement whatsoever in the flying of the flag,\" Alito later told the Times in a statement. \"It was briefly placed by Mrs. Alito in response to a neighbor's use of objectionable and personally insulting language on yard signs.\"\n\nThe second flag flying outside the Alitos' home is raising questions about the justice's denial regarding the first flag.

He previously said the inverted American flag was flown by his wife amid a dispute with neighbors, and he had no part in it.\n\nThe white flag with a green pine tree was seen flying at the Alito beach home in New Jersey, according to three photographs obtained by the Times. The images were taken on different dates in July and September 2023, though it wasn't clear how long it was flying overall or how much time Alito spent there.\n\nThe flag dates back to the Revolutionary War, but in more recent years its become associated with Christian nationalism and support for Trump. It was carried by rioters fueled by Trump's \"Stop the Steal\" movement animated by false claims of election fraud.\n\nRepublicans in Congress and state officials have also displayed the flag. House Speaker Mike Johnson hung it at his office last fall shortly after winning the gavel. A spokesman said the speaker appreciates its rich history and was given the flag by a pastor who served as a guest chaplain for the House.\n\nAlito, meanwhile, is taking part in two pending Supreme Court cases associated with Jan. 6: whether Trump has immunity from prosecution for his efforts to overturn the 2020 election results and whether a certain obstruction charge can be used against rioters. He also participated in the court's unanimous ruling that states can't bar Trump from the ballot using the \"insurrection clause\" that was added to the Constitution after the Civil War.\n\nThere has been no indication Alito would step aside from the cases.\n\nAnother conservative justice, Clarence Thomas, also has ignored calls to recuse himself from cases related to the 2020 election because of his wife Virginia Thomas' support for efforts to overturn Trump's loss to President Joe Biden.\n\nPublic trust in the Supreme Court, meanwhile, recently hit its lowest point in at least 50 years.", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Alito", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Samuel Alito"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Flag of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempts_to_overturn_the_2020_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Attempts to overturn the 2020 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judicial_disqualification", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Judicial disqualification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_nationalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Christian nationalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Revolutionary_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American Revolutionary War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Johnson_(Louisiana_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mike Johnson (Louisiana politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ginni_Thomas", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ginni Thomas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Constitution of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2020 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaplain", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chaplain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarence_Thomas", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Clarence Thomas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_immunity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Legal immunity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebellion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebellion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pastor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pastor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American Civil War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Home_and_Garden/Flags_and_Banners", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Home and Garden/Flags and Banners", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://bostonglobe-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/-cRjCyCRuhqHAP4GPJEKTCKIeYk=/506x0/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bostonglobe/UOCYL35OI2OKYGKYDPMINV4KZE.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9589366", "eventUri": "eng-9589366", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-01-06", "textStart": 1428, "textEnd": 1434}], "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

Multiple such cases are pending before the court, including one on whether Donald Trump himself is immune from prosecution for his role in the coup attempt.\"\n\nCohen's statement echoes that of a conservative member in the upper chamber, Senator Lindsey Graham, who said the flag choice was \"not good judgment.\" But not all GOP lawmakers felt similarly.

Oral arguments indicated that even the conservative justices have some concerns about that stance, but we've now learned that Justice Samuel Alito seems pretty on board with Trump's coup attempt.\n\nIt's yet another ethics scandal for the Court, and it's a reminder that the right-wing justices operate in a realm of complete unaccountability.\n\nLast week, the New York Times broke news that on January 17, 2021 -- 11 days after Trump exhorted his supporters to storm the Capitol and three days before President Joe Biden's inauguration -- an upside-down American flag hung outside the Alito home in Alexandria, Virginia. Hanging the flag upside down is literally prohibited by the flag code, save for \"as a signal of dire distress in instances of extreme danger to life or property.\" There's a long tradition of upside-down flags being flown by protesters on the left and the right, but by January 17, 2021, it was widely known as a symbol used by \"Stop the Steal\" supporters.\n\nHow long the upside-down flag hung at the Alito home isn't clear. The Times reviewed a January 18, 2021, email from a neighbor that said that it had been upside down for a number of days by that point. Several neighbors spoke to the Times about it but requested to remain anonymous, in part because they feared reprisal. Alito made a brief email statement to the Times, and while the statement succeeded in throwing his wife under the bus, it didn't do much else. Alito said he \"had no involvement whatsoever in the flying of the flag\" as it was \"briefly placed by Mrs. Alito in response to a neighbor's use of objectionable and personally insulting language on lawn signs.\"\n\nEven if one takes this statement at face value, it falls far short of an explanation. Several days after an attempted insurrection, a Supreme Court justice let his wife hang a well-known symbol of that attempted insurrection because she got into a spat with the neighbors? Even if the lawn signs were \"personally insulting\" to the Alitos in some way, how is flying an upside-down flag a legitimate response?\n\n*snip*", "source": {"uri": "democraticunderground.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Democratic Underground"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Alito", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Samuel Alito"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempts_to_overturn_the_2020_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Attempts to overturn the 2020 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_argument", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oral argument"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_immunity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Legal immunity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Right-wing politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coup_d'\u00e9tat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coup d'\u00e9tat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inauguration_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inauguration of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Flag of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Capitol", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Capitol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Email"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria,_Virginia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alexandria, Virginia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alexandria, Virginia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebellion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebellion"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Home_and_Garden/Flags_and_Banners", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Home and Garden/Flags and Banners", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 90}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9589366", "eventUri": "eng-9589366", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-01-06", "textStart": 53, "textEnd": 62}, {"amb": false, "date": "2017-01-", "textStart": 677, "textEnd": 687, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "date": "2018-01-", "textStart": 1348, "textEnd": 1358}], "sentiment": -0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

Also known as the Pine Tree flag, it dates to the Revolutionary War, but largely fell into obscurity until recent years and is now a symbol of support for former President Donald Trump, for a religious strand of the \"Stop the Steal\" campaign and for a push to remake American government in Christian terms.\n\nThree photographs obtained by The New York Times, along with accounts from a half-dozen neighbors and passersby, show that the Appeal to Heaven flag was aloft at the Alito home on Long Beach Island in July and September 2023. A Google street view image from late August also shows the flag.\n\nThe photographs, each taken independently, are from four dates. It is not clear whether the flag was displayed continuously during those months or how long it was flown overall.\n\nAlito declined to respond to questions about the beach house flag, including what it was intended to convey and how it comported with his obligations as a justice. The court also declined to respond.\n\nIn commenting for the Times report last week about the upside-down American flag at his Virginia home in 2021, Alito said that it had been raised by his wife, Martha-Ann Alito, during a clash with a neighbor.\n\nThe revelation about that flag prompted concerns from legal scholars and ethicists, and calls from dozens of Democratic lawmakers that the justice recuse himself from cases related to Jan. 6. The news also drew criticism from some conservative politicians, including Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., who said that displaying the inverted flag was \"not good judgment.\"\n\nDuring the period the Appeal to Heaven flag was seen flying at the justice's New Jersey house, a key Jan. 6 case arrived at the Supreme Court, challenging whether those who stormed the Capitol could be prosecuted for obstruction.\n\nIn coming weeks, the justices will rule on that case, which could scuttle some of the charges against Trump, as well as on whether he is immune from prosecution for actions he took while president. Their decisions will shape how accountable he can be held for trying to overturn the last presidential election and his chances at regaining the White House in the next one.\n\nThe disclosure about the new flag is troubling, several ethics experts said in interviews, because it ties Alito more closely to symbols associated with the attempted election subversion on Jan. 6, and because it was displayed as the obstruction case was first coming for consideration by the court.\n\nJudges are not supposed to give any impression of bias, yet the flag could be seen as telegraphing the Alitos' views -- and at a time when the justices were on the cusp of adopting a new ethics code. \"We all have our biases, but the good judge fights against them,\" said Charles Geyh, a law professor at Indiana University Bloomington. \"When a judge celebrates his predispositions by hoisting them on a flag,\" he added, \"that's deeply disturbing.\"\n\nRecords show that the Alitos have owned the beach house since 2014, and he is a well-known presence in the waterfront community. Residents said they recalled seeing the justice last summer, although it is unclear how much time he spent there. Neighbors said that once they realized what the flag signified, they were surprised to see it displayed, particularly in a prominent spot where many boaters glide by. The six people who shared their accounts and photographs asked not to be identified because they didn't want to antagonize a longtime neighbor. When the Times visited the house Wednesday, the flagpole was bare.\n\nUntil about a decade ago, the Appeal to Heaven flag was mostly a historical relic. But since then it has been revived to represent \"a theological vision of what the United States should be and how it should be governed,\" said Matthew Taylor, a religion scholar at the Institute for Islamic, Christian and Jewish Studies. He is also the author of a forthcoming book tracing how a right-wing Christian author and speaker who repopularized the flag helped propel Trump's attempt to overturn the election.\n\nThat figure, Dutch Sheets, has led a yearslong campaign to present the flag to political figures, including Sarah Palin, the former Alaska governor and vice presidential pick, and an Indiana gubernatorial candidate whom Sheets wrapped in the flag at a recent rally. Republican members of Congress and state officials have displayed the flag as well, among them Doug Mastriano, a Pennsylvania state senator and a leader of the \"Stop the Steal\" campaign. The highest-ranking elected official known to show the flag is Rep. Mike Johnson, who hung it at his office last fall shortly after becoming speaker of the House.\n\nA spokesperson for Johnson said that the speaker \"has long appreciated the rich history of the flag, as it was first used by General George Washington during the Revolutionary War.\" It was a gift, the spokesperson said, from pastor Dan Cummins, a guest chaplain for the House of Representatives.\n\nSince its creation during the American Revolution, the flag has carried a message of defiance: The phrase \"appeal to heaven\" comes from 17th-century philosopher John Locke, who wrote of a responsibility to rebel, even use violence, to overthrow unjust rule. \"It's a paraphrase for trial by arms,\" Anthony Grafton, a historian at Princeton University, said in an interview. \"The main point is that there's no appeal, there's no one else you can ask for help or a judgment.\"\n\nIn 2013, Sheets, a prominent figure in a far-right evangelical movement that scholars have called the New Apostolic Reformation, discovered the nearly forgotten flag and made it the symbol of his ambitions to steep the country and the government in Christianity, he wrote in a 2015 book also titled \"An Appeal to Heaven.\"\n\n\"Rally to the flag,\" he wrote. \"God has resurrected it for such a time as this. Wave it outwardly: wear it inwardly. Appeal to heaven daily for a spiritual revolution that will knock out the Goliaths of our day.\"\n\nHe placed the high court at the center of his mission. In 2015, the court's ruling that states must allow same-sex marriage had galvanized the movement and helped it to grow. In a speech three years later, he said, \"There's no gate that has allowed more evil to enter our nation than that of the Supreme Court.\"\n\nBut Sheets and fellow leaders described Alito, the member of the court most committed to expanding the role of faith in public life, as their great hope: a vocal defender of religious liberty and opponent of the right to abortion and same-sex marriage.\n\n\"You can't say that marriage is a union between one man and one woman,\" the justice said in a 2020 speech. \"Until very recently that's what the vast majority of Americans thought. Now it's considered bigotry,\" he said, a point he had made strongly in his dissent to the ruling.\n\nThe religious leaders cast Trump as another of their heroes. A few weeks before the 2020 election, at a Las Vegas megachurch prayer service for his second term, a pastor from the group presented Trump with an \"Appeal to Heaven\" flag from the stage. When he lost, Sheets and a team of others formed an instant, ad hoc religious arm of the \"Stop the Steal\" campaign, blitzing swing state megachurches, broadcasting the services at each stop and drawing hundreds of thousands of viewers.\n\nOn Jan. 6, the \"Appeal to Heaven\" flag was prominent: at the Washington Monument, where throngs gathered to hear Trump deliver a speech contesting the election results, and later above the angry mob that surrounded the Capitol. The flag was visible above clashes with law enforcement on the building's west terrace, as rioters breached police lines underneath the scaffolding set up for President Joe Biden's inauguration, and finally, inside the building.\n\nBy that day, scholars say, the flag had become popular enough to sometimes be used by a few other groups, including militia members. But most often, they said, it is tied directly to Sheets, his contemporaries and adherents and their vision for a more Christian America.\n\nIn October, soon after the flag was last documented at the Alito beach home, Sheets devoted a prayer session to the court, this time sounding triumphant. He cited the Dobbs decision, overturning the federal right to abortion, in which the majority decision had been written by Alito.\n\n\"We have reached another phase in the process of shifting the Supreme Court,\" he announced. Through the justices, he said, \"God's intent for institutions of government can now be fulfilled.\"", "source": {"uri": "staradvertiser.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Honolulu Star Advertiser"},

Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.), a member of the Judiciary Committee, introduced the censure resolution Tuesday, \"for knowingly violating the federal recusal statute and binding ethics standards and calling the impartiality of the Supreme Court of the United States into question.\"\n\nAlito has maintained he had \"no involvement\" in flying the upside-down flag outside his home in January 2021, instead placing the blame on his wife. He said it was \"briefly placed by Mrs. Alito in response to a neighbor's use of objectionable and personally insulting language on yard signs.\"\n\nNews of the upside-down flag was first reported last week by The New York Times. The gesture has often been associated with \"stop the steal\" efforts that are based on unsubstantiated claims of voter fraud in the 2020 election.\n\nThe incident has sparked outrage from Democrats, who have called the reports \"alarming\" and \"appalling.\" Some Democrats have also called on Alito to recuse himself from cases in connection to the 2020 election and the Jan. 6 insurrection, including former President Trump's presidential immunity case.\n\nCohen said in a statement that the incident shows \"a knowing and shameless demonstration of his political bias.\"\n\n\"He literally flew a flag in front of his house showing the world he supported the January 6th insurrectionists,\" the lawmaker said. \"What's more, he continues to participate in litigation directly related to the 2020 election and the Insurrection, in direct violation of the federal recusal statute and the Supreme Court's own ethics rules.\"\n\n\"There must be accountability to protect the integrity and impartiality of the High Court. We must protect the Constitutional rights to fair and impartial proceedings,\" he continued. \"Justice Alito should be censured for flagrant breaches of the law and court rules, and he must recuse himself from all other 2020 election and January 6th related litigation.\"\n\nCopyright 2024 Nexstar Media, Inc.

After Biden won the 2020 election, it was adopted by supporters of former President Donald Trump who subscribed to Trump's lies that the race had been stolen, culminating in a Trump rally where his followers attacked the Capitol building to try to prevent Congress from certifying Biden's victory.\n\nAlito told the Times that he had \"no involvement whatsoever\" in flying the flag at his home. It was raised, he said, by his wife in response to yard signs featuring \"objectionable and personally insulting language\" outside their neighbor's home.\n\nLegal experts told the Times and other news outlets that the flag was a clear violation of judicial ethics rules, which bar judges from making political statements that might undermine the public's faith in their ability to be impartial in divisive cases. Unlike other federal courts, though, the Supreme Court enforces its own rules, meaning any response to the flag could only come from the justices themselves.\n\nThe judicial code also calls for judges to recuse themselves from cases in which their \"impartiality might reasonably be questioned.\" But like the ethics rules, recusal decisions are left up to individual judges. Liberal Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, for example, chose not to take part in recent cases challenging Harvard's admissions procedures because of her involvement at the school both as a student and a member of its board. Though Alito has recused himself as much as any of his colleagues in recent years, he has thus far declined to step aside from cases involving the 2020 election.\n\nAlito isn't the only conservative justice on the court to face ethical questions related to the \"Big Lie.\" His colleague Clarence Thomas also faced calls to recuse himself from cases related to the election and Jan. 6, which he ignored, because of his wife's involvement in efforts to overturn the results.\n\nThomas has also been at the center of controversy over his friendship with a wealthy conservative political operative, who reportedly brought Thomas along on dozens of lavish vacations over the past several decades. Alito has faced similar questions about his relationship with a different conservative billionaire who later had cases before the Supreme Court. Both justices have asserted that there is nothing improper about their actions. However, the incidents helped prompt the court to adopt a new voluntary ethics code.\n\nDemocrats have characterized the flag report as yet more evidence that at least two of the Supreme Court's conservative justices can't be trusted to fairly rule on anything related to Jan. 6. Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin, chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, insisted that both Alito and Thomas recuse themselves from any cases on the issue -- including the question of whether Trump has presidential immunity from prosecution, which is currently being considered by the court. Durbin also reiterated his call, echoed by other members of his party, for Congress to pass legally-binding ethics rules for justices.\n\nSome left-leaning legal analysts have gone even further, arguing that Alito's willingness to have such an inflammatory symbol outside his home is a sign of how the Supreme Court's conservative majority feels no obligation to display even the appearance of political impartiality.\n\nJudicial experts also worry about how this situation might further erode the public's faith in the country's highest court, which has hit record lows in recent years amid a wave of recent scandals and deeply controversial rulings -- most notably the decision that overturned abortion rights established by Roe v. Wade.\n\nSome Republicans have said they wish Alito had given more consideration to how the flag might be perceived. But they have roundly rejected suggestions that it indicates he's incapable of doing his job fairly, arguing that it's absurd to make the assumption that his wife's response to a neighborhood spat in any way reflects on his ability to make sound decisions on the court. In the eyes of many conservatives, this controversy -- along with broader criticism of conservative justices -- is part of a Democratic campaign to pressure the justices into issuing less-conservative rulings or delegitimize the decisions that don't fit their liberal worldview.\n\nSome Senate Democrats have called for an investigation into the flag incident, but Durbin is opposed to the idea, meaning it likely won't happen.\n\nThe court is expected to release decisions in two major Jan. 6 cases -- one concerning charges brought against hundreds of people who stormed the Capitol, the other on Trump's immunity claims -- within the next few weeks.\n\nAnyone who is OK with the Big Lie can't be impartial on Jan. 6 cases\n\n\"Who can possibly think he will decide this case in a neutral manner? Of course, Justice Alito's political leanings were already well-known. But the flag flying incident indicates he has strong views about the facts underlying this case. His decision seems pre-ordained.\" -- Leslie Levin, University of Connecticut law professor, to Salon\n\nThere's zero reason to question Alito's ability to rule fairly\n\n\"The left wants to tarnish Justice Alito's reputation, as well as cause him to recuse himself from participating in any case involving Mr. Trump.

Why did the Supreme Court justice do this, or allow 'Mrs. Alito' -- on whom he pinned the blame -- to do it? He knew it was petty.

Alito will be on the court to hear Trump's arguments in those cases, too.

The harder edge was apparent from Saturday's show introduction, using the upside-down American flag that flew over Alito's home in January 2021 to condemn the conservative Supreme Court.\n\nAnchor Laura Barron-Lopez: Tonight on PBS News Weekend, the Supreme Court's credibility is called into question after a photo emerged of a Stop the Steal flag outside a justice's home....\n\nDuring the seven-minute story which appeared under the graphic \"Election Denialism,\" she used Trump's \"lie that President Biden stole the 2020 presidential election, which led to the violent January 6 insurrection,\" as her segue to a wild extrapolation.\n\nBarron-Lopez: \"And we also learned this week that a symbol of the Stop the Steal movement reached the highest court in the land. The New York Times reported that in January of 2021, an upside-down American flag, an emblem now widely associated with the lie of a stolen 2020 election, was flying at the home of Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito. I spoke with Jody Kantor, the New York Times reporter who broke the story, earlier today. We discussed the implications of such a symbol flying at Alito's home 11 days after rioters stormed the Capitol.\n\nKantor; ....At this point, that flag had really become a symbol of the Stop the Steal campaign. And neighbors are just having a kind of 'what the heck' reaction. Because first of all, these are Washington, D.C. area people they know that federal judges are never supposed to make political displays. That is a very bedrock rule. And second of all, they're looking at and saying wait a second, are the Alitos insurrectionists who oppose the peaceful transfer of power? It leads to these bedrock questions about law and trust and rules and democracy.\n\nShort answer? No. But Democrats inside and outside the media want \"Democracy\" to be an issue, meaning conservatives hate Democracy.\n\nBarron-Lopez relayed Justice Alito's explanation that his wife placed the flag upside down in response to a neighbor's display (a sign with a four-letter insult of Trump). Always a willing partisan, Barron-Lopez used the controversy to tar another conservative justice through something his wife did.\n\nBarron-Lopez: Alito isn't the only Supreme Court justice with apparent ethics violations. Justice Clarence Thomas's wife, Ginny Thomas was directly involved in the efforts to overturn the 2020 election and he has refused to recuse himself from any related cases. Do you think that this time will be any different?\n\n....\n\nBarron-Lopez: Jodi, finally, the Stop the Steal lies about a stolen 2020 election haven't gone away. Donald Trump continues to say that he won in 2020. Election denialism is essentially a litmus test for entrance to the GOP. What do you think this flag incident means looking forward to the 2024 election?\n\nKantor was eager for her Alito scoop to impact the election, and insisted Justice Alito himself was all to blame for the flag controversy:\n\nKantor: So first of all, I think we have to see, we just broke this news a few days ago. Let's see how it enters the bloodstream. But the idea of a Supreme Court justice flying this flag outside his home, even if it was his wife, as he says, I think does connote a kind of mainstreaming of Stop the Steal, it says that, you know, this was accepted by a lot of people, a lot of people in power, and that even if it was his wife who did it, that flag didn't come down for a couple of days....\n\nThis anti-Alito segment was brought to you in part by Consumer Cellular.\n\nLAURA BARRON-LOPEZ: The lie that President Biden stole the 2020 presidential election which led to the violent January 6 insurrection is alive and well. A CBS investigation found that there are nearly 80 officials overseeing elections across seven battleground states who don't believe the 2020 election results or supported the actions of January 6.\n\nOn the campaign trail Saturday, former president Donald Trump again lied about his 2020 defeat.\n\nDONALD TRUMP, Former U.S. President: But they want to rigged that just like they rigged the presidential election of 2020. They want to rig it.\n\nLAURA BARRON-LOPEZ: And we also learned this week that a symbol of the Stop the Steal movement reached the highest court in the land. The New York Times reported that in January of 2021, an upside down American flag and emblem now widely associated with the lie of a stolen 2020 election was flying at the home of Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito, I spoke with Jody Kanter, The New York Times reporter who broke the story earlier today.\n\nWe discussed the implications of such a symbol flying Alito's home 11 days after rioters stormed the Capitol.\n\nJodi Kantor, The New York Times: I kind of want to start with the neighbors and what they saw. They're walking down the street during this very fret period, as you say, right after January 6, but also critically, it's three days before President Biden's inauguration. And they see this upside down flag hanging outside the Alito home.\n\nAt this point, that flag had really become a symbol of the Stop the Steal campaign. And neighbors are just having a kind of what the heck reaction. Because first of all, these are Washington DC area people they know that federal judges are never supposed to make political displays. That is a very bedrock rule.\n\nAnd second of all, they're looking at and saying wait a second, are the Alito's insurrectionists who oppose the peaceful transfer of power? It leads to these bedrock questions about law and trust and rules and democracy.\n\nLAURA BARRON-LOPEZ: In response to your reporting, Justice Alito said that he had, quote, no involvement in placing the flag that his wife, Mrs. Alito put up the flag in response to a neighbor of theirs a display that they had.\n\nSo I just want to dive into this because what are the implications of his response? Did he not know that this upside down flag was flying outside of his home for multiple days?\n\nJODI KANTOR: Well, the response is a fascinating one, because first of all, he's not denying that it was there. He's not denying knowledge that it was there. And he's not denying that this was a Stop the Steal symbol. He's making a kind of surprising argument, which is to say, even though this was my home, and even though judicial ethics rules are all about the impression of a lack of fairness, they're not only focused on what you actually do as a judge. They're focused on the impression you give other people.\n\nAnd he's saying despite all of that, this was, you know, just something my wife did and part of a neighborhood spat.\n\nLAURA BARRON-LOPEZ: Why does this revelation matter? Now, as the Court prepares to rule on two cases involving the January 6 insurrection?\n\nJODI KANTOR: In the next few weeks, we are going to get two major decisions from the Supreme Court that are going to shape the legacy of January 6, the accountability for January 6. Former President Trump's scope of accountability, it may shape the future criminal trial, if one takes place, it could really also directly affect the next election because polls are showing that whether or not former President Trump is convicted might have some impact on what voters think of him.\n\nSo, the court already had an enormous challenge in getting these decisions kind of accepted by the American people. It's such a partisan time. Everything is so fractured. These cases are so politically fraught. It makes it much more challenging for the court to earn broad acceptance of whatever their legal reasoning is, and whatever the outcome is.\n\nLAURA BARRON-LOPEZ: Alito isn't the only Supreme Court justice with apparent ethics violations. Justice Clarence Thomas's wife, Ginny Thomas was directly involved in the efforts to overturn the 2020 election and he has refused to recuse himself from any related cases.\n\nDo you think that this time will be any different?\n\nJODI KANTOR: So recusal is an interesting question. On the one hand, so there are two categories of rules we're dealing with. One is the code of conduct for judges. That's really the ethics code. That's voluntary. The court recently adopted a new one, it's pretty loose. It's not that strong. That is what govern things like political displays.\n\nThe second set of rules we're dealing with is a federal recusal statute that binds all federal judges, including Supreme Court justices. But at the Supreme Court, it's essentially self-administered. And the Court has said that justices have to police their own recusal.\n\nSo, I don't think Justice Alito has spoken directly to this. But as you know, he was already involved in the case. And I don't see any sign right now that he's planning to recuse himself halfway through the process.\n\nLAURA BARRON-LOPEZ: Jodi, finally, the Stop the Steal lies about a stolen 2020 election haven't gone away. Donald Trump continues to say that he won in 2020. Election denialism is essentially a litmus test for entrance to the GOP. What do you think this flag incident means looking forward to the 2024 election?\n\nJODI KANTOR: So first of all, I think we have to see, we just broke this news a few days ago. Let's see how it enters the bloodstream. But the idea of a Supreme Court justice flying this flag outside his home, even if it was his wife, as he says, I think does connote a kind of mainstreaming of stop the steal, it says that, you know, this was accepted by a lot of people, a lot of people in power, and that even if it was his wife who did it, that flag didn't come down for a couple of days.\n\nSo I think you're right to ask the question, and let's see how this becomes part of the bigger story of what happened in the last election and what will happen in the next one.\n\nLAURA BARRON-LOPEZ: Jodi Kantor of The New York Times,

It happened repeatedly in the Clarence Thomas financial scandals, and now it's happening to Samuel Alito.\n\nThe first Alito story found that the justice had flown an upside-down American flag, a symbol used by stop-the-stealers, in January 2021. It was a scandal because judges are not supposed to engage in political displays and because it associated Alito with an especially nutty faction of right-wing politics (and one that calls into question his ability to fairly adjudicate cases related to Trump's coup attempt).\n\nAlito and his allies came back with several defenses. They insisted the flag had been flown by Alito's wife in response to the provocations of a rude neighbor. This defense did not explain why Alito was unaware of a flag flying at his own house, nor why his wife chose to respond to a neighborhood quarrel by endorsing Trump's election lies. And they insisted she briefly flew the flag because \"it was a very heated time in January 2021.\"\n\nA series of conservative writers rushed to Alito's defense by insisting nobody knew the upside-down flag signified support for Trump's election lies.\n\nNow, the New York Times reports that Alito flew another flag associated with Trump's insurrection, the \"Appeal to Heaven\" flag, which was carried by insurrectionists on January 6. The flag was confirmed to have flown over Alito's beach house in July and September 2023.\n\nNote how the old Alito defenses are totally useless in the face of this new case. It can't be chalked up to a dispute with a neighbor, unless the same neighbor happens to own property near Alito in two different states. The wife excuse is also threadbare. (Indeed, Alito, who blamed his wife in a response to the first Times story, has no comment in response to the second one.) And the excuse that it was \"a heated time in January 2021\" obviously does not explain why the Alito home continued to display insurrectionist flags two and a half years later.\n\nNow maybe they will try to say that they also didn't realize what the Appeal to Heaven flag signifies and that the Alitos coincidentally flew two different insurrectionist flags by mistake. But the meaning of this flag was well known on the far right; here is an article about it from 2021. You could invent a barely plausible story about how a non-insurrectionist would have a regular American flag on hand and fly it upside down in a fit of pique. It's pretty hard to explain why they would also have an obscure flag used by Trump coup enthusiasts.\n\nHowever, we can be sure Alito's defenders will come up with something!", "source": {"uri": "nymag.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NYMag"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jonathan_chait@nymag.com", "name": "Jonathan Chait", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Alito", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Samuel Alito"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mootness", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mootness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarence_Thomas", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clarence Thomas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebellion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rebellion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Right-wing politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ethics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_coup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trump coup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Flag of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Home_and_Garden/Flags_and_Banners", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Home and Garden/Flags and Banners", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 68}], "image": "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/b9c/fec/81093bb7ecd59e8f937be5b17b4bad19f3-Chait-V4-FINAL-Alito-flag.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9589366", "eventUri": "eng-9589366", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-01-06", "textStart": 1536, "textEnd": 1545}], "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

They seem to think the wife can't act independently of her husband.\n\nThen, they linked to all their evidence that it was a Stop the Steal message.

An upside-down flag is a distress signal -- a way that soldiers or ships at sea show that they are in extraordinary danger.\n\nTaken in isolation, it's hard to draw sweeping conclusions from this flag. The Times reports that many supporters of the \"Stop the Steal\" campaign -- former President Donald Trump's failed effort to overthrow the 2020 presidential election -- embraced an inverted American flag to signal their belief that the United States was in grave danger. Alito claims that the flag was raised by his wife \"in response to a neighbor's use of objectionable and personally insulting language on yard signs.\"\n\nBut this flag is hardly an isolated incident. On the bench, Alito is the Supreme Court's most unrelenting Republican partisan -- a reliable vote for whatever outcome is preferred by the GOP's right wing, regardless of whether there is any legal support for that position. Alito isn't simply a bad judge; he is the negation of law, frequently embracing claims that even intellectual leaders within the conservative movement find risible.\n\nThe morning before the Times published its flag scoop, for example, Alito published a dissenting opinion claiming that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the brainchild of Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren, was unconstitutional. The opinion was so poorly reasoned that Justice Clarence Thomas, ordinarily an ally of far-right causes, mocked Alito's opinion for \"winding its way through English, Colonial, and early American history\" without ever connecting that history to anything that's actually in the Constitution.\n\n*snip*", "source": {"uri": "democraticunderground.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Democratic Underground"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Alito", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Samuel Alito"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Flag of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_6_United_States_Capitol_attack", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "January 6 United States Capitol attack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inauguration_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inauguration of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarence_Thomas", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clarence Thomas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempts_to_overturn_the_2020_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Attempts to overturn the 2020 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2020 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Constitution of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partisan_(politics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Partisan (politics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_Financial_Protection_Bureau", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Consumer Financial Protection Bureau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutionality", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Constitutionality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Right-wing politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Warren", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elizabeth Warren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "History of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Home_and_Garden/Flags_and_Banners", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Home and Garden/Flags and Banners", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 94}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9589366", "eventUri": "eng-9589366", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-16", "textStart": 158, "textEnd": 164}, {"amb": false, "date": "-01-06", "textStart": 236, "textEnd": 245}], "sentiment": -0.1450980392156863, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

Alito Jr., another provocative symbol was displayed at his vacation house in New Jersey, according to interviews and photographs.\n\nThis time, it was the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Appeal to Heaven\u00e2\u20ac flag, which, like the inverted U.S. flag, was carried by rioters at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.

Trump, for a religious strand of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Stop the Steal\u00e2\u20ac campaign and for a push to remake American government in Christian terms.\n\nThe New York Times has photographs, witnesses, and even a Google Street View picture of the flag flying at Alito's summer home. The excuse Justice Alito had been floating involved a neighborhood dispute after the 2020 election, and the Justice tried to pin flying the upside-down flag on his wife.\n\nThe truth is emerging that a Supreme Court justice publicly supports Trump's efforts to overthrow the United States government. There are no mitigating factors or excuses. Samuel Alito supports the destruction of American democracy. Justice Alito isn't behaving like a neutral jurist but as a radical right-wing political activist.\n\nThe Supreme Court majority is a threat to democracy, as Alito is showing with SCOTUS reform is urgent and vital.\n\nA Special Message From PoliticusUSA\n\nIf you are in a position to donate purely to help us keep the doors open on PoliticusUSA during what is a critical election year, please do so here.\u00c2\n\nWe have been honored to be able to put your interests first for 14 years as we only answer to our readers and we will not compromise on that fundamental, core PoliticusUSA value.", "source": {"uri": "politicususa.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "POLITICUSUSA"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jason_easley@politicususa.com", "name": "Jason Easley", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Alito", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Samuel Alito"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebellion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rebellion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Flag of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Capitol", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Capitol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Revolutionary_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American Revolutionary War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Christianity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2020 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Political movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurist", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jurist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Politics of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Home_and_Garden/Flags_and_Banners", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Home and Garden/Flags and Banners", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 70}], "image": "https://www.politicususa.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/300px-Samuel_Alito_official_photo.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9589366", "eventUri": "eng-9589366", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

Alito told the New York Times that the inverted flag had been placed by his wife, Martha-Ann Alito, after a dispute with a neighbor over a sign on the neighbor's lawn that was critical of Republican then-President Trump.\n\nThe inverted U.S. flag became a symbol of protest by Trump supporters as he sought to overturn his loss to Biden with false claims of widespread voting fraud.

The flag, which has a history dating to the Revolutionary War, has also become a symbol for supporters of former President Donald Trump. The flag is white and includes a green evergreen tree and the words \"An Appeal to Heaven\" at the top.\n\nAlito and the Supreme Court did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nIt's the second revelation in as many weeks about a controversial display outside Alito's property. The New York Times last week published a photograph of an inverted American flag raised at Alito's home in Virginia in 2021. Alito said the upside-down US flag was raised by his wife and was a response to a spat with neighbors.\n\nThe episode has drawn fire from critics, including Democrats and key GOP senators, who have called on the justice to recuse himself from cases involving Trump and the 2021 attack on the Capitol.\n\nLike the inverted US flag, the Appeal to Heaven flag - also known as the Pine Tree flag - was seen during the attack on the Capitol.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson faced blowback for displaying the same flag outside his office last year before assuming the leadership post. The Appeal to Heaven flag remains outside his office as of Wednesday.\n\nJohnson told CNN on Wednesday that \"it's George Washington's flag. It goes back to the founder's era.

Following a report from The New York Times that highlighted potential conflicts of interest for the conservative justices, MoveOn launched the petition.\n\nThe Times reported that an upside-down American flag, a symbol associated with the twice-impeached and four-times indicted Trump's false claims of election fraud, was displayed outside Alito's home in January 2021. The flag appeared outside the Alito residence in Alexandria, Virginia, on January 17, just days after Trump supporters stormed the Capitol. Alito told the Times that the flag was \"briefly placed\" there by his wife during a disagreement with neighbors.\n\nThe revelation has again raised concerns about Alito's impartiality as the Supreme Court considers two significant cases: one addressing charges against the January 6 rioters and another determining whether Trump can claim immunity from prosecution on election interference charges. Justice Thomas also faces scrutiny for his involvement in cases related to the 2020 election, particularly because his wife, Ginni Thomas, contacted Trump officials and lawmakers, urging them to overturn the election results.\n\nMoveOn's petition argues that Alito must be held accountable for what they describe as a breach of ethics. \"He must recuse himself immediately or be removed by Chief Justice John Roberts, and the Senate Judiciary Committee must swiftly investigate and take action on conflicts of interest,\" the petition states.\n\nRahna Epting, MoveOn's political action executive director, emphasized the need for immediate action to restore public trust in the Supreme Court. \"The only way to begin to restore any trust in the Supreme Court -- and to ensure any semblance of a fair hearing on Trump's baseless immunity claims -- is for Justices Alito and Thomas to recuse themselves, or be removed by Chief Justice Roberts,\" Epting said.\n\nHe criticized Chief Justice John Roberts for failing to address these \"conflicts of interest,\" contributing to the Supreme Court's lowest public approval ratings ever. \"Justice Roberts' failure to act -- and allow these conflicts to go unchecked, has put the Supreme Court at its lowest public approval ever, with the public losing trust in the institution's integrity and seeing it as the tool of a partisan right-wing agenda that it is,\" Epting added.\n\nThe petition also calls for the Senate Judiciary Committee to investigate the alleged conflicts of interest and consider impeachment if necessary. \"Our country and our democracy deserve better,\" Epting asserted.\n\nDemocratic Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois, chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, has also urged Alito to recuse himself from cases related to the 2020 election and the Capitol attack. \"Flying an upside-down American flag -- a symbol of the so-called 'Stop the Steal' movement -- clearly creates the appearance of bias,\" Durbin said in a statement.\n\nIn response to growing public pressure, the Supreme Court adopted a code of ethics in November last year, following reports of undisclosed luxury trips and gifts received by some justices, including Thomas and Alito. However, the code lacks enforcement mechanisms, prompting continued calls for stronger accountability.", "source": {"uri": "greaterdiversity.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Greater Diversity

Their belief that widespread election fraud had thrown the election from former President Trump to then-President-Elect Biden has never been supported by any evidence,\" a letter signed by the Democrats states.\n\nThe lawmakers cite a section of the U.S. Flag Code -- which is legally unenforceable -- barring the display of inverted American flags \"except as a signal of dire distress in instance of extreme danger to life or property.\"\n\n\"No such dire distress was in existence at the time the inverted flag flew from your front yard,\" the letter notes. \"Indeed, your own public statement attempts to pass responsibility to your wife, but you nonetheless acknowledge that it was a political statement in support of Donald Trump's effort to overturn the 2020 election.\"\n\nAlito told the Times he \"had no involvement whatsoever in the flying of the flag,\" which he said \"was briefly placed by Mrs. Alito in response to a neighbor's use of objectionable and personally insulting language on yard signs.\"\n\nThe lawmakers' letter continues:\n\nEven if you had \"no involvement\" in the display yourself, the fact of such a political statement at your home creates, at minimum, the appearance of improper political bias. According to Canon 5 of the recently promulgated, non-binding, non-enforceable U.S. Supreme Court ethics guidelines, on which you are listed as a signatory, a justice \"should refrain from political activity.\" In fact, the court's own employee guidelines explicitly prohibit public displays of political views -- including yard signs and bumper stickers -- because they create an appearance of a conflict of interest...\n\nIn Canon 3B, the guidelines declare that \"a justice should disqualify himself or herself in a proceeding in which the justice's impartiality might reasonably be questioned, that is, where an unbiased and reasonable person who is aware of all relevant circumstances would doubt that the justice could fairly discharge his or her duties.\"\n\nThere are currently two cases related to January 6 and the 2020 election before the court. Trump v. United Statesconcerns the presumptive 2024 GOP nominee's claim he has absolute presidential immunity for any official acts -- in this case, trying to subvert the 2020 election -- while Fischer v. United States is about whether January 6 insurrections committed felony obstruction of an official proceeding.\n\n\"Sadly, you are now the second justice who has demonstrated at least an appearance of a conflict of interest related to the events surrounding the January 6 insurrection,\" the letter laments. \"In the aftermath of the 2020 election, text messages revealed that Virginia 'Ginni' Thomas, the wife of Justice Clarence Thomas, was actively strategizing with the White House chief of staff about how to overturn the election results and attending the January 6 'Stop the Steal' rally -- precisely the same underlying conduct charged in Trump and Fischer.\"\n\n\"Although Justice Thomas seemingly acknowledged this conflict of interest by recusing himself from the court's case related to Trump attorney John Eastman, he has shockingly refused to recuse himself from Trump and Fischer,\" the lawmakers noted.\n\n\"Undoubtedly, public trust and confidence in the Supreme Court is in shambles, which jeopardizes our democracy and the rule of law upon which it is based. And given that your decisions in Trump and Fischer will profoundly affect the future of a past and potentially future president, and of democracy itself, it is essential that the court attempt to bolster the public's trust in the integrity of the court,\" the letter to Alito states.\n\n\"In order to protect the legitimacy of the court's ultimate decision in these historic cases,\" it concludes, \"it is clear that both you and Justice Thomas must recuse yourselves from participating any further in these, or any other cases, related to January 6 or the 2020 election.\"", "source":

The justices are also weighing a challenge by a Pennsylvania man to a federal criminal charge of obstruction that he faces for his involvement in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol by Trump supporters.\n\nThe Appeal to Heaven organization says on its website that the flag, which shows a white pine tree under the slogan, was flown by order of George Washington in October 1775.\n\nThe organization says that it \"exists to honor the Lord by networking elected officials who are believers in Jesus Christ, who regularly attend and display a commitment to an evangelical, Gospel-centered church and who will commit to live and govern based on biblical, constitutional and Federalist principles.\"\n\n(Reporting by John Kruzel; Editing by Scott Malone and Leslie Adler)\n\nSign Up for Springs AM Update Your morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

The justice has said that his wife hung the inverted flag in response to a political dispute with a neighbor.\n\nRegardless, House Democrats led by Georgia Representative Hank Johnson slammed Alito for associating himself with a symbol of election denial, writing that it was \"incontrovertible\" that the upside-down American flag had been adopted by \"Stop the Steal\" activists at the time.\n\n\"Even if you had 'no involvement' in the display yourself,\" they said, referring to Alito's contention that his wife was responsible for flying the flag, \"the fact of such a political statement at your home creates, at minimum, the appearance of improper political bias.\"\n\nThe Democrats argued Alito may have violated the terms of the Supreme Court's recently adopted ethics guidelines, which prohibit justices from engaging in political activity. The lawmakers also pointed out that the framework requires the justices to recuse themselves from proceedings where their impartiality may be questioned -- although they acknowledged that the new ethics standards are non-binding and lack an enforcement mechanism.\n\nGiven Alito's decision to allow a symbol of election denial to fly above his home, the Democrats contended that he should step away from Supreme Court deliberations on Trump's claim that he should be immune to prosecution over his attempts to overturn the 2020 election. The justice should also recuse himself in a similar case about whether the government can charge Jan. 6 rioters with obstructing official proceedings, the lawmakers wrote.\n\n\"Reasonable people will doubt that you can be impartial in deciding whether Mr. Trump should face criminal prosecution for his actions arising from the \"Stop the Steal\" movement,\" they told Alito.\n\nPointing to similar conduct involving Justice Clarence Thomas, whose wife Ginni was involved in efforts to overturn election results, the Democratic lawmakers posed Alito's recusal as necessary to protect the high court's integrity.\n\n\"Undoubtedly, public trust and confidence in the Supreme Court is in shambles, which jeopardizes our democracy and the rule of law upon which it is based,\" the lawmakers wrote. \"[I]t is essential that the court attempt to bolster the public's trust in the integrity of the court.\"\n\nTuesday's letter comes just days after Johnson and a group of House Democrats announced the formation of the Court Reform Now task force, a congressional working group advocating for legislative action on issues such as high court ethics and judge shopping.\n\nSpeaking at a news conference last week, the Georgia lawmaker accused the Supreme Court's conservative supermajority of \"usurping both legislative and executive authority\" with judicial activism and a series of decisions which he argued ignore precedent in favor of political results.\n\nIn the Senate, Democrats have for months heaped pressure on the high court over the ethically dubious conduct of some justices, including Alito and Thomas. Both justices have been mired in controversy amid reports that they failed to disclose lavish vacations and other gifts provided to them by wealthy conservative benefactors.\n\nThe upper chamber's Judiciary Committee last year approved Rhode Island Senator Sheldon Whitehouse's Supreme Court Ethics, Recusal and Transparency Act, which if made law would force the court to draft a binding code of ethics in the public eye. The legislation, which enjoys the support of the House's newly formed court reform group, has yet to get a vote in the full Senate.\n\nHowever, Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin, chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee and a fierce advocate for Supreme Court ethics reform, has signaled that his panel will not conduct any oversight on a \"Stop the Steal\" symbol over Alito's home.", "source": {"uri": "tucsonsentinel.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tucson Sentinel"}, "authors": [{"uri": "benjamin_s_weiss@tucsonsentinel.com", "name": "Benjamin S.

Alito's response was to note that \"It was briefly placed by Mrs. Alito in response to a neighbor's use of objectionable and personally insulting language on yard signs.\"\n\nBut that wasn't enough for The Usual Suspects including the NYT, who used the hit piece to try and discredit/disqualify Alito from the Supreme Court by insinuating the upside-down flag - which they said was a \"Stop the Seal\" symbol, made him ethically compromised.\n\nREAD MORE: It Must Be the 11th Hour - Leftist Hacks Attempt to Smear Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito\n\nHere we are again, and not even a week after that story went live we have another flag-related hit piece on Alito, this time related to one that allegedly has been flown at his beach house. This is the flag:\n\nIt, too, is \"linked to Jan. 6,\" they say, and as a result, this is - in their (insinuated) view - further confirmation that Alito is unfit to serve on any case related to the Capitol riot:\n\nThree photographs obtained by The New York Times, along with accounts from a half-dozen neighbors and passers-by, show that the Appeal to Heaven flag was aloft at the Alito home on Long Beach Island in July and September of 2023. A Google street view image from late August also shows the flag.\n\nThe photographs, each taken independently, are from four different dates.

One expert on the symbols associated with the insurrection said this new flag was an even more direct gesture of solidarity with their cause.\n\nThe New York Times reported Wednesday on photos that show a flagpole outside the justice's home in Long Beach Township, NJ flying a flag with the Appeal to Heaven logo (also known as the Pine Tree Flag), which rioters were seen carrying during their siege of the U.S. Capitol on January 6. That flag was flown in summer of 2023, which was two years after the incident in which neighbors documented an upside-down American flag being flown outside of the conservative jurist's home in Alexandria, Virginia the week of President Joe Biden's inauguration.\n\nDisplaying an inverted American flag is traditionally meant to be interpreted as a sign of distress, though the symbol was co-opted by election deniers in the wake of former President Donald Trump's election loss in 2020. Alito maintained that displaying the upside-down American flag was his wife's idea, provoked by neighbors who displayed an anti-Trump sign.\n\nREAD MORE: Why Alito's response to inverted flag controversy is as troubling as symbol itself: analysis\n\nAs of Wednesday evening, Alito had not responded to the Times' report about the Pine Tree Flag flown at his New Jersey home in July and September of last year. The outlet noted that while the flag \"fell into obscurity\" following its inception in the Revolutionary War, it has since come back largely due to its embrace by the extreme right fringe of the GOP and the \"Stop the Steal\" movement to overturn the 2020 election.\n\nAccording to Tim Heaphy -- the lead investigator for the House Select Committee on the January 6 Attack -- the meaning of the Appeal to Heaven flag is much more difficult to misinterpret. Heaphy simply characterized the symbol displayed outside of Justice Alito's New Jersey beach home \"a protest flag carried by insurrectionists.\"\n\n\"There were a lot of icons, flag, symbols on these flags that were literally carried by the insurrectionists at the Capitol. This was one of those flags that was carried as people were fighting with Capitol police officers,\" Heaphy told MSNBC's Niccole Wallace. \"It's a pine tree, but the Appeal to Heaven is essentially return to Christian principles.\"\n\n\"There's a strong strain of Christian nationalism that was present at the Capitol that's emergent in sort of far-right circles. It sort of advocates this return to Biblical principles, completely different from the separation from church and state that's enshrined in our Constitution,\" he added.\n\nREAD MORE: (Opinion) Say it: Samuel Alito is a fascist insurrectionist\n\nExperts interviewed by the Times confirmed also confirmed the flag's association with Christian nationalist elements within the GOP. Far0right evangelical figure Dutch Sheets said in 2013 that the flag symbolized the struggle to restructure the American government to be explicitly pro-Christian.\n\n\"God has resurrected it for such a time as this,\" Sheets said of the Pine Tree Flag. \"Wave it outwardly: wear it inwardly.

Alito has blamed the placement of that flag -- which is typically only to be flown to signify national distress, including when the government has fallen -- on his wife Martha-Ann. He characterized her action as the result of a heated dispute with neighbors over a coarse anti-Trump political yard sign.\n\nBut now the New York Times is reporting that an even more provocative flag was seen flying at the Alito's vacation home on the New Jersey Shore last year. The Alito home on Long Beach Island was photographed flying the \"Appeal to Heaven\" flag, also known as the Pine Tree Flag, during the summer months of 2023.\n\nThat flag was originally flown during the American Revolution. It carries a quote from the Enlightenment philosopher John Locke, who argued that when a just people are faced with injustice in the political realm, and have exhausted all avenues for redress, that they can move to violence -- and God will judge the righteousness of their action. \"Where there lies no appeal on Earth,\" the philosopher wrote, \"they have just cause to make their appeal to heaven.\"\n\nThis flag was laregly a relic of history until it was revived by a far-right religious leader named Dutch Sheets, who has transformed the flag into a banner for Christian nationalists. The pine tree on the flag was originally a symbol of protest for British exploitation of the colonies; the monarchy exported the tallest and truest pine trees from New England for the masts on British navy ships. But in Sheets' appropriation, the tree now is said to symbolize God's covenant with Abraham -- and with America as a supposedly divinely chartered nation.\n\nThe Appeal to Heaven flag is now associated with a militant arm of Christian nationalism. It waved as a battle flag by many of the Jan. 6 insurgents, who stormed the U.S. Capitol in 2021 seeking to keep Donald Trump in office and prevent the peaceful transfer of power to President Joe Biden.\n\nThe flag has continued to be displayed by the kinds of religious-right politicians who baselessly cast doubt on the legitimacy of the outcome of the 2020 election, including by failed Pennsylvania GOP gubernatorial candidate Doug Mastriano, as well as House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.), as Rolling Stone reported last November.\n\nThe symbolism of the flag is no longer oblique. It is a potent symbol for American zealots who breed distrust in American democracy and seek a vast expansion of religion in public life. The notion that a sitting Supreme Court justice would have this flag waving, unabashedly, above his home casts doubt on his impartiality in significant matters before the court, including cases involving Jan. 6 defendants, and the questions about whether Donald Trump can be prosecuted for allegedly criminal acts he undertook as president.\n\nAlito did not answer the New York Times' questions about what message was intended to be sent by the flying of the banner above his home. The paper published photographs of the flag taken by neighbors, as well as a Google Street View image of the justice's home that captured the flag. It is no longer flying above the Jersey Shore home.", "source": {"uri": "rollingstone.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Rolling Stone"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tim_dickinson@rollingstone.com", "name":

Also known as the Pine Tree flag, it dates to the Revolutionary War, but largely fell into obscurity until recent years and is now a symbol of support for former president Donald Trump, for a religious strand of the \"Stop the Steal\" campaign, and for a push to remake American government in Christian terms.\n\nThree photographs obtained by The New York Times, along with accounts from a half-dozen neighbors and passersby, show that the Appeal to Heaven flag was aloft at the Alito home on Long Beach Island in July and September 2023. A Google street view image from late August also shows the flag.\n\nThe photographs, each taken independently, are from four dates. It is not clear whether the flag was displayed continuously during those months or how long it was flown overall.\n\nAlito declined to respond to questions about the beach house flag, including what it was intended to convey and how it comported with his obligations as a justice. The court also declined to respond.\n\nIn commenting for the Times report last week about the upside-down American flag at his Virginia home in 2021, Alito said that it had been raised by his wife, Martha-Ann Alito, during a clash with a neighbor.\n\nThe revelation about that flag prompted concerns from legal scholars and ethicists, and calls from dozens of Democratic lawmakers that the justice recuse himself from cases related to Jan. 6. The news also drew criticism from some conservative politicians, including Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, who said that displaying the inverted flag was \"not good judgment.\"\n\nDuring the period the Appeal to Heaven flag was seen flying at the justice's New Jersey house, a key Jan. 6 case arrived at the Supreme Court, challenging whether those who stormed the Capitol could be prosecuted for obstruction.\n\nIn coming weeks, the justices will rule on that case, which could scuttle some of the charges against Trump, as well as on whether he is immune from prosecution for actions he took while president. Their decisions will shape how accountable he can be held for trying to overturn the last presidential election and his chances at regaining the White House in the next one.\n\nThe disclosure about the new flag is troubling, several ethics experts said in interviews, because it ties Alito more closely to symbols associated with the attempted election subversion on Jan. 6, and because it was displayed as the obstruction case was first coming for consideration by the court.\n\nJudges are not supposed to give any impression of bias, yet the flag could be seen as telegraphing the Alitos' views -- and at a time when the justices were on the cusp of adopting a new ethics code. \"We all have our biases, but the good judge fights against them,\" said Charles Geyh, a law professor at Indiana University Bloomington. \"When a judge celebrates his predispositions by hoisting them on a flag,\" he added, \"that's deeply disturbing.\"\n\nRecords show that the Alitos have owned the beach house since 2014, and he is a well-known presence in the waterfront community. Residents said they recalled seeing the justice last summer, although it is unclear how much time he spent there. Neighbors said that once they realized what the flag signified, they were surprised to see it displayed, particularly in a prominent spot where many boaters glide by. The six people who shared their accounts and photographs asked not to be identified because they didn't want to antagonize a longtime neighbor. When the Times visited the house Wednesday, the flagpole was bare.\n\nSince its creation during the American Revolution, the flag has carried a message of defiance: The phrase \"appeal to heaven\" comes from 17th-century philosopher John Locke, who wrote of a responsibility to rebel, even use violence, to overthrow unjust rule. \"It's a paraphrase for trial by arms,\" Anthony Grafton, a historian at Princeton University, said in an interview. \"The main point is that there's no appeal, there's no one else you can ask for help or a judgment.\"\n\nIn 2013, Dutch Sheets, a prominent figure in a far-right evangelical movement that scholars have called the New Apostolic Reformation, discovered the nearly forgotten flag and made it the symbol of his ambitions to steep the country and the government in Christianity, he wrote in a 2015 book also titled \"An Appeal to Heaven.\"\n\n\"Rally to the flag,\" he wrote. \"God has resurrected it for such a time as this. Wave it outwardly: wear it inwardly. Appeal to heaven daily for a spiritual revolution that will knock out the Goliaths of our day.\"\n\nHe placed the high court at the center of his mission. In 2015, the court's ruling that states must allow same-sex marriage had galvanized the movement and helped it to grow. In a speech three years later, he said, \"There's no gate that has allowed more evil to enter our nation than that of the Supreme Court.\"\n\nBut Sheets and fellow leaders described Alito, the member of the court most committed to expanding the role of faith in public life, as their great hope: a vocal defender of religious liberty and opponent of the right to abortion and same-sex marriage.\n\nOn Jan. 6, the \"Appeal to Heaven\" flag was prominent: at the Washington Monument, where throngs gathered to hear Trump deliver a speech contesting the election results, and later above the angry mob that surrounded the Capitol. The flag was visible above clashes with law enforcement on the building's west terrace, as rioters breached police lines underneath the scaffolding set up for President Joe Biden's inauguration, and finally, inside the building.", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Alito",

The harder edge was apparent from Saturday's show introduction, using the upside-down American flag that flew over Alito's home in January 2021 to condemn the conservative Supreme Court.\n\nAnchor Laura Barron-Lopez: Tonight on PBS News Weekend, the Supreme Court's credibility is called into question after a photo emerged of a Stop the Steal flag outside a justice's home....\n\nDuring the seven-minute story which appeared under the graphic \"Election Denialism,\" she used Trump's \"lie that President Biden stole the 2020 presidential election, which led to the violent January 6 insurrection,\" as her segue to a wild extrapolation.\n\nBarron-Lopez: \"And we also learned this week that a symbol of the Stop the Steal movement reached the highest court in the land. The New York Times reported that in January of 2021, an upside-down American flag, an emblem now widely associated with the lie of a stolen 2020 election, was flying at the home of Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito. I spoke with Jody Kantor, the New York Times reporter who broke the story, earlier today. We discussed the implications of such a symbol flying at Alito's home 11 days after rioters stormed the Capitol.\n\nKantor; ....At this point, that flag had really become a symbol of the Stop the Steal campaign. And neighbors are just having a kind of 'what the heck' reaction. Because first of all, these are Washington, D.C. area people they know that federal judges are never supposed to make political displays. That is a very bedrock rule. And second of all, they're looking at and saying wait a second, are the Alitos insurrectionists who oppose the peaceful transfer of power? It leads to these bedrock questions about law and trust and rules and democracy.\n\nShort answer? No. But Democrats inside and outside the media want \"Democracy\" to be an issue, meaning conservatives hate Democracy.\n\nBarron-Lopez relayed Justice Alito's explanation that his wife placed the flag upside down in response to a neighbor's display (a sign with a four-letter insult of Trump). Always a willing partisan, Barron-Lopez used the controversy to tar another conservative justice through something his wife did.\n\nBarron-Lopez: Alito isn't the only Supreme Court justice with apparent ethics violations. Justice Clarence Thomas's wife, Ginny Thomas was directly involved in the efforts to overturn the 2020 election and he has refused to recuse himself from any related cases. Do you think that this time will be any different?\n\n....\n\nBarron-Lopez: Jodi, finally, the Stop the Steal lies about a stolen 2020 election haven't gone away. Donald Trump continues to say that he won in 2020. Election denialism is essentially a litmus test for entrance to the GOP. What do you think this flag incident means looking forward to the 2024 election?\n\nKantor was eager for her Alito scoop to impact the election, and insisted Justice Alito himself was all to blame for the flag controversy:\n\nKantor: So first of all, I think we have to see, we just broke this news a few days ago. Let's see how it enters the bloodstream. But the idea of a Supreme Court justice flying this flag outside his home, even if it was his wife, as he says, I think does connote a kind of mainstreaming of Stop the Steal, it says that, you know, this was accepted by a lot of people, a lot of people in power, and that even if it was his wife who did it, that flag didn't come down for a couple of days....\n\nPBS News Weekend\n\n5/19/24\n\n7:05:27 p.m. (ET)\n\nLAURA BARRON-LOPEZ: The lie that President Biden stole the 2020 presidential election which led to the violent January 6 insurrection is alive and well. A CBS investigation found that there are nearly 80 officials overseeing elections across seven battleground states who don't believe the 2020 election results or supported the actions of January 6.\n\nOn the campaign trail Saturday, former president Donald Trump again lied about his 2020 defeat.\n\nDONALD TRUMP, Former U.S. President: But they want to rigged that just like they rigged the presidential election of 2020. They want to rig it.\n\nLAURA BARRON-LOPEZ: And we also learned this week that a symbol of the Stop the Steal movement reached the highest court in the land. The New York Times reported that in January of 2021, an upside down American flag and emblem now widely associated with the lie of a stolen 2020 election was flying at the home of Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito, I spoke with Jody Kanter, The New York Times reporter who broke the story earlier today.\n\nWe discussed the implications of such a symbol flying Alito's home 11 days after rioters stormed the Capitol.\n\nJodi Kantor, The New York Times: I kind of want to start with the neighbors and what they saw. They're walking down the street during this very fret period, as you say, right after January 6, but also critically, it's three days before President Biden's inauguration. And they see this upside down flag hanging outside the Alito home.\n\nAt this point, that flag had really become a symbol of the Stop the Steal campaign. And neighbors are just having a kind of what the heck reaction. Because first of all, these are Washington DC area people they know that federal judges are never supposed to make political displays. That is a very bedrock rule.\n\nAnd second of all, they're looking at and saying wait a second, are the Alito's insurrectionists who oppose the peaceful transfer of power? It leads to these bedrock questions about law and trust and rules and democracy.\n\nLAURA BARRON-LOPEZ: In response to your reporting, Justice Alito said that he had, quote, no involvement in placing the flag that his wife, Mrs. Alito put up the flag in response to a neighbor of theirs a display that they had.\n\nSo I just want to dive into this because what are the implications of his response? Did he not know that this upside down flag was flying outside of his home for multiple days?\n\nJODI KANTOR: Well, the response is a fascinating one, because first of all, he's not denying that it was there. He's not denying knowledge that it was there. And he's not denying that this was a Stop the Steal symbol. He's making a kind of surprising argument, which is to say, even though this was my home, and even though judicial ethics rules are all about the impression of a lack of fairness, they're not only focused on what you actually do as a judge. They're focused on the impression you give other people.\n\nAnd he's saying despite all of that, this was, you know, just something my wife did and part of a neighborhood spat.\n\nLAURA BARRON-LOPEZ: Why does this revelation matter? Now, as the Court prepares to rule on two cases involving the January 6 insurrection?\n\nJODI KANTOR: In the next few weeks, we are going to get two major decisions from the Supreme Court that are going to shape the legacy of January 6, the accountability for January 6. Former President Trump's scope of accountability, it may shape the future criminal trial, if one takes place, it could really also directly affect the next election because polls are showing that whether or not former President Trump is convicted might have some impact on what voters think of him.\n\nSo, the court already had an enormous challenge in getting these decisions kind of accepted by the American people. It's such a partisan time. Everything is so fractured. These cases are so politically fraught. It makes it much more challenging for the court to earn broad acceptance of whatever their legal reasoning is, and whatever the outcome is.\n\nLAURA BARRON-LOPEZ: Alito isn't the only Supreme Court justice with apparent ethics violations. Justice Clarence Thomas's wife, Ginny Thomas was directly involved in the efforts to overturn the 2020 election and he has refused to recuse himself from any related cases.\n\nDo you think that this time will be any different?\n\nJODI KANTOR: So recusal is an interesting question. On the one hand, so there are two categories of rules we're dealing with. One is the code of conduct for judges. That's really the ethics code. That's voluntary. The court recently adopted a new one, it's pretty loose. It's not that strong. That is what govern things like political displays.\n\nThe second set of rules we're dealing with is a federal recusal statute that binds all federal judges, including Supreme Court justices. But at the Supreme Court, it's essentially self-administered. And the Court has said that justices have to police their own recusal.\n\nSo, I don't think Justice Alito has spoken directly to this. But as you know, he was already involved in the case. And I don't see any sign right now that he's planning to recuse himself halfway through the process.\n\nLAURA BARRON-LOPEZ: Jodi, finally, the Stop the Steal lies about a stolen 2020 election haven't gone away. Donald Trump continues to say that he won in 2020. Election denialism is essentially a litmus test for entrance to the GOP. What do you think this flag incident means looking forward to the 2024 election?\n\nJODI KANTOR: So first of all, I think we have to see, we just broke this news a few days ago. Let's see how it enters the bloodstream. But the idea of a Supreme Court justice flying this flag outside his home, even if it was his wife, as he says, I think does connote a kind of mainstreaming of stop the steal, it says that, you know, this was accepted by a lot of people, a lot of people in power, and that even if it was his wife who did it, that flag didn't come down for a couple of days.\n\nSo I think you're right to ask the question, and let's see how this becomes part of the bigger story of what happened in the last election and what will happen in the next one.\n\nLAURA BARRON-LOPEZ: Jodi Kantor of The New York Times, thank you for your time.\n\nJODI KANTOR: Thanks for having me.", "source": {"uri": "newsbusters.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "https://newsbusters.org/"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Mitch McConnell is complicit in the Supreme Court corruption.\n\nSen. Minority Leader Mitch McConnell was asked about the report last week that Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito had flown a \"Stop the Steal\" solidarity flag at his house during the period in which the court was considering 2020 election cases. Let's be clear: Alito was not flying a pro-Trump flag but an anti-democracy, pro-insurrection flag. If that's not grounds for impeachment (and it should be), at the very least Alito should be required to recuse himself from any case related to January 6 or the 2020 presidential election.\n\nBut Alito has not recused himself from any such cases. That includes the current presidential immunity case that Donald Trump is using to try and wriggle out of the federal criminal case against him for trying to overturn the 2020 election.\n\nIf McConnell had any decency, he'd signal to Alito he should recuse himself. Instead, McConnell suggested that Alito deserves special protection to promote his open antagonism toward American democracy and the Constitution.\n\nEven worse, McConnell blamed President Biden for not being more supportive of poor, persecuted Alito and the blatantly corrupt and likely law-breaker Clarence Thomas. Here's McConnell's loathsome response to a reporter asking if it was appropriate for Alito to fly his flag and whether he should recuse himself from related cases.\n\nMCCONNELL: It seems to me there are just nonstop attacks on the Supreme Court week after week after week, and so I'm not going to dignify that with a response.

The banner, also referred to as the \"Pine Tree flag,\" was reportedly photographed at the house on four occasions in that time frame, and also appears on a Google street view capture of the home from August.\n\nConsidered a symbol showing support for former President Donald Trump, the flag shows a green pine tree with the phrase \"An Appeal to Heaven\" emblazoned over top of it. Though it has roots going back to the Revolutionary War, the \"Appeal to Heaven\" flag today is often associated with a religious contingent of the \"Stop the Steal\" campaign, the Times reports.\n\nThe flag is the second Jan. 6-related banner to be seen flying at an Alito-owned property. Last week, the Times reported that an inverted American flag had been spotted at Alito's home in Virginia in 2021. That flag, Alito told the Times, was hung by his wife following a dispute with a neighbor.\n\nAlito has not yet publicly addressed the Times' report regarding the \"Appeal to Heaven\" flag seen at his New Jersey property, which the newspaper said he has owned since 2014.\n\nThe \"Appeal to Heaven\" phrase itself is a \"paraphrase for trial by arms,\" Princeton University historian Anthony Grafton told the Times. Dating back to the 17th century, the phrase was popularized by philosopher John Locke.\n\n\"The main point is that there's no appeal, there's no one else you can ask for help or a judgment,\" Grafton said.\n\nEthicists interviewed by the Times said the flag being flown at Alito's home is concerning, as it may further associate him with symbols utilized during the Jan. 6 insurrection. Additionally, the time period during which the \"Appeal to Heaven\" flag was spotted coincides with the time when the Supreme Court began hearing a case focused on whether individuals who participated in the insurrection should face obstruction charges.\n\nThat case is pending before the Supreme Court, as is another case that would decide whether Trump is immune from election subversion charges.\n\nA number of Republican members of Congress and state leaders have also displayed the flag recently, including Pennsylvania State Sen. Doug Mastriano, the Times reports. House Speaker Mike Johnson also faced criticism for his use of the flag, telling CNN Wednesday that \"it's George Washington's flag\" and that it has \"nothing to do\" with \"Stop the Steal\" protests.\n\nWhile the \"Appeal to Heaven\" flag was spotted at Alito's New Jersey home last year, the Times reports that it wasn't clear how long it had been displayed.", "source": {"uri":

This is not true of most reporters, but you can still find some who choose not to affiliate with a political party nor even to cast a ballot. They liken it to umpires calling balls and strikes. What if the men and women behind the plat\n\ne had skin in the game for one team over the other? Or just the appearance of such? This was how seriously they took their jobs. They were willing to surrender their ability to vote, one of our most precious rights, for the sake of what they viewed as an even more important role in a democracy.\n\nMy own views are not quite so extreme, but they have been consistent. I vote, but I do not lend any direct support to a candidate, not a campaign contribution, not a yard sign, not even a petition signature. And my wife has followed suit. This was true even when a close family friend ran for office. And keep in mind that for the last 20 years or so, I've been an opinion writer. My role is to assert my point of view, not to be neutral. Yet even so, I don't believe I should be actively campaigning for a candidate, a party or a cause. My job is more like that of a judge -- to weigh the pros and cons of any circumstance and then render an opinion.\n\nI mention all this because I am flabbergasted that any member of the U.S. Supreme Court -- or their significant other -- could have even the slightest doubt about the importance of neutrality. Yet that seems to be the case with Supreme Court Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. Outside his home in Alexandria, Virginia, an upside-down American flag, a symbol of the \"Stop the Steal\" protest, was flown for some undetermined period of time. It was even photographed flying on Jan. 17, 2021, the image shared with The New York Times by a neighbor. The act was clearly meant to show solidarity with the Jan. 6 rioters, although Justice Alito told the Times that it was \"briefly placed by Mrs. Alito in response to a neighbor's use of objectionable and personally insulting language on yard signs.\"\n\nThat's not much of an explanation. First, it seeks to casually justify an act of pettiness, a behavior ill-suited for a justice on the highest court in the land. But second, it suggests that either his wife was unclear about his day job (unlikely) or just didn't care. Oh, and the family seems perfectly fine with claiming the 2020 election was stolen. Who thinks for even a nanosecond this is appropriate? Happily, my neighbors aren't given to posting obscene messages on signs, but if one did, I feel confident it would wind up before the homeowner's association, not escalate into a demonstration of who can sink lower faster.\n\nGranted, there's no shortage of incivility and nastiness in the public square these days. From graduation ceremonies to congressional markup sessions, the nation seems to be on something of a streak of churlishness with a bit of racism and misogyny thrown in. And that's without mentioning Donald Trump's bizarre tribute to the fictional Hannibal Lecter, a mass-murdering cannibal he apparently prefers to immigrants. Seriously, you can't make this stuff up.\n\nJudges aren't supposed to be like that. Since this incident was first reported by the Times last week, there's been a call for Alito to recuse himself on pending cases related to the Jan. 6 insurrection. That's reasonable. How can Americans have any faith whatsoever in the justice's impartiality? This isn't just about what might be in his heart. It's also about appearances. And it's pretty hard to display bias quite as flagrantly as an inverted flag.\n\nBut I would go further and suggest that the 74-year-old jurist ought to step down from the bench entirely. Judges aren't politicians. They aren't even journalists. They're supposed to be above all that. This is not a new standard. Judicial independence is a longstanding tradition in this country. Supreme Court employees aren't even supposed to display bumper stickers on the back of their cars. This didn't just cross a line, it obliterated it and then hung it upside down for the world to see.

The newspaper reported that the flag was visible in a Google street view image from late August. It remains unclear whether the flag was flown consistently throughout last summer.\n\nThe New York Times report comes just days after it reported that an upside-down American flag was flown outside Alito's Virginia home just days after the January 6 Capitol riots.\n\nThe Appeal to Heaven flag, also commonly known as the Pine Tree flag, was spotted among other controversial flags waved in Washington on 6 January when rioters and insurrectionists stormed the US Capitol, encouraged by Trump, then the president, over the false belief that the 2020 election was won by him and not the actual victor, Joe Biden.\n\nThe Capitol attack was aimed at stopping the official certification by Congress of Biden's victory, which was delayed by the violence but finally happened in the early hours of the following morning.\n\nThe Pine Tree flag was originally used on warships commanded by George Washington during the Revolutionary war. It has since been adopted by Christian nationalists who advocate for an American government based on Christian teachings.\n\nThe first report of the Stars and Stripes being flown upside-down outside an Alito residence provoked outrage about the further politicization of the supreme court, but Alito simply said his wife had done it and it was displayed only briefly.\n\nThe Guardian contacted the supreme court for comment on the latest report but did not receive an immediate response.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Alito", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Samuel Alito"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Capitol", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Capitol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extremism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Extremism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Flag of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Revolutionary_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American Revolutionary War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Christianity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Beach_Island", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Long Beach Island"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Long Beach Island"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_6_United_States_Capitol_attack", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "January 6 United States Capitol attack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supreme court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_United_States_Electoral_College_vote_count", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2021 United States Electoral College vote count"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2020 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_nationalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christian nationalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stars_and_Stripes_(newspaper)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stars and Stripes (newspaper)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "George Washington"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Guardian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Home_and_Garden/Flags_and_Banners", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Home and Garden/Flags and Banners", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/theguardian_763/29454c8878804b27782d21a48812d57a", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9589366", "eventUri": "eng-9589366", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-01-06", "textStart": 1135, "textEnd": 1144, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

While everyone wondered why a Supreme Court justice decided to post the internet's favorite \"Down to Insurrect\" sign outside his house in 2021, Alito just blamed his wife.\n\nBecause obviously the job of hoisting the flag at the Alito home belongs to Mrs. Alito, a law librarian by training, and not Sam, A FORMER CAPTAIN IN THE U.S. ARMY. Specifically, a Captain in the Signal Corps... the flag symbol people.\n\nAnyway, it seems as though Captain Wrongway Flagfuzz over here has managed to nick himself with Occam's Razor yet again. Just like when he denies involvement in the Dobbs leak despite being tied to past leaks by a former right-wing activist or claims he didn't really know the billionaire who gave him free private plane rides even though ABOVE THE LAW WROTE A FIRSTHAND ACCOUNT OF THEM PALLING AROUND IN 2009.\n\nBut at least Alito's decided to quit while he's behind and just let his wife sit under the bus he backed over her. His defenders aren't quite as satisfied and have decided that Alito's official explanations are so bad that they're going to go ahead and invent new ones:\n\n\"Zillow Ed,\" of course, refers to Ed Whelan. Whelan regales readers with the history of judicial nominations over at his Confirmation Tales Substack. You know my personal favorite \"Confirmation Tale\" is the time Whelan used Zillow floorplans to try to Sherlock his way to debunking Christine Blasey Ford's story and failing that took Brett Kavanaugh's high school yearbook and suggested some other random guy committed sexual assault. It's the gold standard of unhinged conspiracy mongering.\n\nWhile the official Alito line is that Mrs. Alito got mad at her anti-Trump neighbors and decided to retaliate with a Trump election fight symbol that she somehow knew, Bernstein decided to argue... what if Alito had a completely different defense? Bernstein, an ASS Law professor, decided to party like it's 1999 and perform a Google boolean search to prove that no one was talking about upside-down flags in January of 2021 and the flag was put up wrong for who knows what reason. Case closed!\n\nExcept... from the original Times article:\n\nA flood of social media posts exhorted Trump supporters to flip over their flags or purchase new ones to display upside down.\n\n\"If Jan. 6 rolls around and Biden is confirmed by the Electoral College our nation is in distress!!\" a poster wrote on Patriots.win, a forum for Trump supporters, garnering over a thousand \"up\" votes. \"If you cannot go to the DC rally then you must do your duty and show your support for our president by flying the flag upside down!!!!\"\n\nTwitter? Never heard of her. Are you talking about X?\n\nAs an encapsulation of the originalist mind virus, it doesn't get much better than \"here is a search I've tailored that produced zero results and therefore I need not acknowledge any of the actual, specific historical artifacts the rest of you found.\" Alito's defense rests on the idea that his wife knew what she was doing but that he wasn't involved! If she did not know what she was doing, then Alito would have said that. This just makes Alito seem like an even more sniveling coward for blaming his wife for being a hot head when he could've said -- if not convincingly -- \"it was an accident.\"\n\nBernstein's not alone in making up nonsense to defend Alito, even if he is taking the outlier step of trying to rewrite the original public meaning of January 6. Josh Blackman's Volokh Conspiracy post tried to swap out the meaning of the gesture:\n\nIs there any evidence, whatsoever, that Justice Alito or Martha-Ann Alito, intended to fly the flag upside-down as some sort of secret signal to overturn the election? Of course not. My guess? Mrs. Alito used the upside-down flag as a symbol of distress to clap back at her neighbors. Justice Alito indicated that the attacks were \"personal,\" and his wife felt helpless to respond.\n\nHm....\n\nPutting aside the goose's valid question, Blackman is leaning on the popular \"oh, it's just a symbol of distress\" explanation, which is both (a) question begging because the whole reason it became a symbol of the stop the steal folks is that it is about \"distress\" and (b) a devastating blow to Alito's \"take my wife, please\" defense because the sort of person who knew that this symbolized \"distress\" absent the stop the steal chatter is the sort of person who SERVED IN THE SIGNAL CORPS.\n\nWe can goof on these tweebs all day, but the real question is why are these folks so quick to beclown themselves to make up excuses for their judges? Even if the contrived excuse undermines the judge's official excuse? Because I'm looking at their arguments and... well, they're the ones in distress.", "source": {"uri": "abovethelaw.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Above the Law"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The reason? To call attention to the true, real plight of Black Americans whose lives seem not to matter as much as white ones -- part of the unfinished business of American democracy. For this, he is booed, vilified, and effectively banned from the NFL. He never works as a quarterback again.\n\nNow picture a second protest. A sitting Supreme Court justice (or perhaps his wife, but with the justice's obvious consent) flies a flag upside-down in front of his house on January 17, 2021. The reason? To support the lie, disproven hundreds of times, that the 2020 election was stolen, to protest the peaceful transition of power that was about to take place. For this, the justice and his wife suffer no consequences at all.\n\nThis is the country we live in: a country in which Justice Samuel Alito -- a man with massive power over all our lives, who wrote the court opinion overturning Roe v. Wade -- can engage in overtly anti-democratic activity, and the only response is a few angry opinion pieces in newspapers and some gentle chiding from lawmakers. There are hardly any binding rules governing Supreme Court justices, and they serve for life, subject to no review and no accountability, save an impeachment process so difficult and untested that it has only been done once in American history -- in 1804.\n\nColin Kaepernick was shunned; but Justice Samuel Alito is one of the most powerful men in America.\n\nNor is Alito alone in cozying up to those who spread demonstrably false lies to subvert democracy. He is joined on the court by Clarence Thomas, whose wife Ginni was, in the weeks after the 2020 election, emailing and texting with Trump associates pressuring Vice President Mike Pence to reject the election results, demanding that the state of Arizona select a new slate of electors to support Trump, and calling the election a \"heist.\" She even testified before the House Jan. 6 committee, under threat of subpoena.\n\nLet's be clear that this is not about ideology. The Supreme Court is dominated by conservatives, mostly drawn from Leonard Leo's dark-money funded, far-right network which promoted and advocated for Justices Brett Kavanaugh, Amy Coney Barrett, and Neil Gorsuch, Donald Trump's three appointees to the court, as well as Justice Alito and John Roberts. But while the Trump justices frequently vote in a conservative way (all three voted to overturn Roe, for example), they have no record of being anti-democracy conspiracy theorists -- or married to them.\n\nThat's an important distinction, especially as we consider the real possibility that Donald Trump may become president again. If elected, he has promised to engage in a wide variety of authoritarian, anti-democratic actions: rounding up immigrants (mostly those whose immigration status is not yet determined -- i.e., they may be here legally) for mass deportation; using the Justice Department to go after political enemies; sending the National Guard into cities; and retaliating against media outlets and other perceived enemies.\n\nFor a traditional conservative, such actions run afoul of deeply held beliefs in limited government. But for a far-right MAGA populist, they are necessary to 'save America,' fight the globalist elites, and so on. If Donald Trump does become president again, will Justices Alito and Thomas do anything to curb his authoritarian plans?\n\nThat hardly seems likely. As horrifying as it may seem to a progressive, the fate of civil rights in America now rests mostly on those three Trump appointees, Gorsuch, Barrett, and Kavanaugh. There are three liberals on the court, plus Chief Justice Roberts, who is a quasi-moderate (on some issues, anyway), and then two authoritarian sympathizers on the other side. That makes the conservatives the swing votes.\n\nEven if Trump doesn't win this November, the authoritarian leanings of Alito and Thomas are already impacting important Supreme Court cases about the extent of Trump's power. Right now, the court is considering whether Trump is immune from being prosecuted for criminal acts he may have committed while in office (including by inciting the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol), and if the Jan. 6 cases ever progress, they will likely be asked to rule on them too. Not to mention the bevy of challenges to the 2024 election that will be filed if Trump does lose.\n\nIf this were any other court in the country, Justices Alito and Thomas would be required to recuse themselves from all these cases. They are far too close to the subject matter, with their own wives (at least) being activists on one side of these disputes. Indeed, on other courts, any display of political ideology -- even a bumper sticker -- is against the rules. But Alito's house can fly an American flag upside down, and can give speeches to the Federalist Society blaming liberals for the demise of free speech and warning hat religious freedom and gun ownership are becoming \"second-class rights,\" despite both being greatly expanded in recent years... and nothing happens. No sanctions, no recusals... nothing.\n\nThe court has long since lost its 20th century role as guardian of civil liberties -- indeed, that period in the court's history is now regularly derided as an aberration of \"judicial activism\" by conservatives. Now it is in danger of losing its stature as part of our democratic system.\n\nFinally, Justices Alito and Thomas have wedded their anti-democratic activism with old fashioned corruption -- another recurring feature of Trump's MAGA movement, which is filled with grifters, self-dealers, and con artists, beginning with Trump himself. The shamelessness, as recently noted by Jesse Wegman in The New York Times, is staggering.\n\nIn 2008, as exposed by Pro Publica, Alito accepted a gift of a luxury vacation from billionaire Paul Singer, including a private jet flight to Alaska paid for by Singer, and failed to disclose the gift on his annual financial disclosures. Singer's hedge fund subsequently was involved in at least 10 cases before the Supreme Court, and Alito never recused himself despite the close personal relationship. In one case, the court backed Singer's yearslong debt fight with Argentina, helping Singer's hedge fund ultimately secure $2.4 billion.\n\nOh, and that Alaska trip? It was organized by Leonard Leo.\n\nFor the record, Alito wrote in a preposterous Wall Street Journal op-ed that the disclosure rules didn't cover \"accommodations and transportation for social events\" and he somehow didn't know that the hedge fund was in any way related to Singer.\n\nJustice Thomas has been even more egregiously corrupt, accepting two decades' worth of luxury trips from conservative activist Harlan Crow, including cruises on the billionaire's yacht, flights in his private jet, and stays at his private resort. The ProPublica investigation exposing this largesse estimated the cost of just one of those trips at over $500,000. None of them were disclosed by Thomas.\n\nCrow, meanwhile, has donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to a political organization where Ginni Thomas worked; his donations literally paid Ginni Thomas's salary. Crow and his wife also serve on the boards of American Enterprise Institute, the Hoover Institution, and other conservative organizations that regularly write \"friend of the court\" briefs and take policy positions on issues the court is considering. Yet despite public outcry at all of this, Justice Thomas has faced no consequences for his misdeeds.\n\nWill any of this matter? It's not yet clear. Public opinion of the Supreme Court is at an all-time low. And for good reason: People are aware of the corruption, the duplicity, and above all, the ways in which the court's conservative majority acts more like a partisan political actor than an impartial judicial one.\n\nYet it's not clear if this discontent has yet impacted the 2024 election. Progressive voters are rightly dissatisfied with many of President Biden's actions, but if the result of that dissatisfaction is the election of Donald Trump, the consequences will be severe: massive assaults on civil liberties, democratic norms, and policies that Americans overwhelmingly support (Trump says he is open to states banning birth control, for example), as well as, of course, the population of the federal bench with more judges like Alito and Thomas. And when those actions are challenged, we may find that the United States Supreme Court has gone from protecting civil liberties to helping an autocrat take them away.", "source": {"uri": "rollingstone.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Rolling Stone"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jay_michaelson@rollingstone.com", "name": "Jay Michaelson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Alito", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Samuel Alito"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarence_Thomas", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Clarence Thomas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authoritarianism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Authoritarianism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "2020 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Roe v.

However, just over a week after the January 2021 Capitol attack, when this flag was seen flying over the home of Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito, it took on a more troubling meaning.\n\nThis upside-down flag came back into media on Friday when the New York Times published a piece about the incident, framing it in the context of two important Supreme Court decisions that will come down in June, essentially determining former President Trump's legal exposure for, as the Times phrased it, \"his efforts to subvert the election.\"\n\nThe events of January 6, 2021, when a mob stormed the U.S. Capitol in an attempt to overturn the presidential election results, marked a dark chapter in American history.\n\nThe involvement of Trump supporters, spurred by unfounded claims of election fraud, led to an attack on the U.S. Capitol that threatened the core of democratic governance.\n\nIn the wake of these events, the Supreme Court has been tasked with handling cases related to the rioters and the broader implications. The flag incident at Alito's home raises critically important questions about the potential biases that may influence these critical decisions.\n\nThe recent revelation about the flag at Alito's residence adds another layer of controversy to a court already grappling with unprecedented cases related to Trump and the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. This development highlights growing concerns about the impartiality and integrity of the highest court in the land and underscores the pressing need for transparency and accountability within the judiciary.\n\nThe Supreme Court, designed as the pinnacle of judicial authority and impartiality, is facing a crisis of confidence. Recent polls indicate a significant decline in public trust, with many Americans expressing skepticism about the court's ability to remain unbiased.\n\nAs Pittsburgh lawyer Jason Matzus points out, \"This erosion of trust is not just a passing phase but a serious threat to the fabric of American democracy. The sight of an upside-down flag at Alito's home is more than just a political statement; it is a symbol of the deep divisions and challenges facing the Supreme Court today.\"\n\nPublic perception of the judiciary's integrity is crucial for maintaining the legitimacy of the Supreme Court. When justices appear to be influenced by partisan politics, it erodes the public's confidence in their rulings. The recent incident involving Justice Alito's home is a stark reminder of the importance of maintaining a clear separation between personal beliefs and judicial responsibilities. Any indication that a justice might sympathize with extremist views can have far-reaching consequences for the court's reputation and its ability to function effectively.\n\nJustices, like all public officials, should be held to the highest standards of conduct. This includes clear guidelines for recusals in cases where there may be a conflict of interest or perceived bias. The court should also be far more transparent about its decision-making processes and the influences that might affect its rulings. By doing so, it can begin to rebuild public trust and reinforce its role as an impartial judicial body.\n\nThis is where things get very thorny very fast.\n\nA Supreme Court that is perceived as biased or influenced by partisan politics poses a serious threat to democracy. The judiciary must be seen as a check on the other branches of government, ensuring that laws and executive actions adhere to the Constitution.\n\nWhen the court's impartiality is perceived to be in doubt, it weakens this critical check and balance, potentially allowing for the erosion of democratic norms and principles.\n\nThis is why the incident at Alito's home is so critically important today. It is just one more in a powerful, growing line of vivid illustrations of the broader issues at play, underscoring the need for immediate reforms to safeguard the court's integrity.\n\nTo say that this weekend was a bad weekend for the Supreme Court would be a supreme understatement.\n\nWith Alito having dug himself in on the paper-thin defense that it was his wife who briefly put up the upside-down flag at their home, Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) said Sunday on MSNBC, \"If SCOTUS justices want to control women's bodies across the country, they should be able to control what flag is flown outside their house.\"\n\nThe same MSNBC show asked what would happen if Justice Sonia Sotomayor showed a similar disrespect to the American flag -- a question far too terrifying to even imagine in the current political climate.\n\nAny corruption in the court or even perception of corruption clearly can't be self-policed by the court. This new flag incident shows how important it is to immediately revamp the ethical guidelines under which Supreme Court justices operate.\n\nThough the court released a statement in November to essentially serve as such a code, it lacks much-needed teeth. As the Brennan Center very directly pointed out, it is a remarkably weak set of guidelines that is poised to fail.\n\nWhat is desperately needed -- and this can't be repeated enough -- is a strong and forward-looking ethical code that takes away unnecessary judgment calls. A real ethical code wouldn't leave it to Alito to decide whether he can continue to sit on cases related to Jan. 6 -- it would clearly and absolutely mandate recusal.", "source": {"uri": "thehill.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hill"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_6_United_States_Capitol_attack", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "January 6 United States Capitol attack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Alito", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Samuel Alito"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impartiality", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Impartiality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempts_to_overturn_the_2020_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Attempts to overturn the 2020 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_trust", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public trust"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Flag of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "History of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bias"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judiciary", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Judiciary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparency_(behavior)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Transparency (behavior)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Capitol", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Capitol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supreme court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_powers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Separation of powers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accountability", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Accountability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Politics of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extremism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Extremism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Constitution of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pramila_Jayapal", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pramila Jayapal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonia_Sotomayor", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sonia Sotomayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSNBC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "MSNBC"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Home_and_Garden/Flags_and_Banners", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Home and Garden/Flags and Banners", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme_Parks/Six_Flags", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme Parks/Six Flags", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Racquetball/Courts", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Racquetball/Courts", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bocce", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bocce", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/06/print-illustration_062123mm-ap-gn_alito_web.png?strip=1&w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9589366", "eventUri": "eng-9589366", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-01-06", "textStart": 1425, "textEnd": 1431, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "wgt": 151, "relevance": 1}

Text \"Alerts\" to (201) 335-0739 or sign up here.\n\nThe Times' reporting on Alito's flag flying comes as the Supreme Court prepares to rule on two cases related to efforts to overturn the 2020 election, taking up former President Donald Trump's motion to dismiss the federal charges against him for trying to overturn the election and criminal charges brought against a Jan. 6 rioter. Ethics experts have argued Alito should recuse from those cases in light of the flag's symbolism, though he's unlikely to do so. \"I think it would be better for the court if he weren't involved in cases arising from the 2020 election,\" former federal judge and Berkeley Judicial Institute director Jeremy Fogel told the Times. \"But I'm pretty certain that he will see that differently.\"\n\nAlito has strongly opposed the ethics controversies involving him that have recently sprung up, and told the Times that he \"had no involvement whatsoever in the flying of the flag,\" claiming \"it was briefly placed by Mrs. Alito in response to a neighbor's use of objectionable and personally insulting language on yard signs.\" He has not yet responded to the controversy over his Anheuser-Busch shares. In his Wall Street Journal op-ed that came out ahead of ProPublica's allegations involving Singer, Alito wrote that he had \"no obligation to recuse\" in any cases that involved Singer or his hedge fund, he did not believe that he had to disclose the trip per Supreme Court rules, and justified the trip itself, saying he flew on Singer's private jet \"in a seat that, as far as I am aware, would have otherwise been vacant.\" \"I marvel at all the nonsense that has been written about me in the last year,\" Alito told the Journal when the publication later interviewed him in July, saying that while \"the traditional idea about how judges and justices should behave is they should be mute\" in the face of criticism and let others defend them, \"that's just not happening. And so at a certain point I've said to myself, nobody else is going to do this, so I have to defend myself.\"\n\nIn the early days of his judicial career, Alito was nicknamed \"Scalito\" for his similarities with late conservative Justice Antonin Scalia, a nickname that dates back to as early as 1992, CBS News reported in 2005.\n\nForbes estimates Alito's net worth at $10 million, making him the second-richest justice behind Chief Justice John Roberts. Alito's wealth is largely based on his sizable inheritance and investment portfolio. Associate Supreme Court justices take an annual salary of roughly $300,000.\n\nAlito's controversies make up only a portion of the ethics scandals that have plagued justices in recent years, as criticism over the Supreme Court's alleged ethics infractions has ramped up. Justice Clarence Thomas has come under fire repeatedly for his association with real estate magnate Harlan Crow, who has spent decades treating Thomas to luxury vacations, and for his wife Ginni Thomas' right-wing activism and efforts to help overturn the 2020 election. (Thomas, like Alito, has also not recused from any Jan. 6-related cases.) Justice Sonia Sotomayor has also come under scrutiny after the Associated Press reported Sotomayor's staff have \"prodded\" public institutions where the justice was speaking to buy copies of her books, and Justice Neil Gorsuch faced questions over a Politico report that he sold real estate to the head of a law firm with business before the court in 2017, among other controversies. Justices have denied any wrongdoing, though the court announced a new code of ethics in November designed to help address some of the public concerns. Legal experts have criticized that code for not going far enough, however, most notably by not imposing any consequences should justices violate it.", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType":

The phrase refers to a government's people having no person on Earth to defend them, promoting the idea that protection of their way of life comes from a higher power or themselves, even if that means taking up arms or violence to overthrow unjust rule. The flag, which has become a symbol of support for conservative causes and Trump, has more recently been flown to promote the idea that the U.S. government should be remade in Christian terms, the Times notes.\n\nAlito's flying of the \"Appeal To Heaven\" flag, in addition to the flying of the upside-down American flag outside his Alexandria, Virginia, home, is one of multiple controversies faced by the justice.

It has since been adopted by Christian nationalists who advocate for an American government based on Christian teachings.\n\nThe first report of the Stars and Stripes being flown upside-down outside an Alito residence provoked outrage about the further politicization of the supreme court, but Alito simply said his wife had done it and it was displayed only briefly.\n\nThe Guardian contacted the supreme court for comment on the latest report but did not receive an immediate response.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Alito Jr., another provocative symbol was displayed at his vacation house in New Jersey, according to interviews and photographs.\n\nThis time, it was the \"Appeal to Heaven\" flag, which, like the inverted U.S. flag, was carried by rioters at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Also known as the Pine Tree flag, it dates back to the Revolutionary War, but largely fell into obscurity until recent years and is now a symbol of support for former President Donald J. Trump, for a religious strand of the \"Stop the Steal\" campaign and for a push to remake American government in Christian terms.\n\nThree photographs obtained by The New York Times, along with accounts from a half-dozen neighbors and passers-by, show that the Appeal to Heaven flag was aloft at the Alito home on Long Beach Island in July and September of 2023. A Google street view image from late August also shows the flag.\n\nThe photographs, each taken independently, are from four different dates.

Direct to your inbox. Sign up for the Morning Report newsletter\n\nPrimary voters in Georgia went to the polls Tuesday and supported officials at the center of the state's prosecution of former President Trump.\n\nIn Fulton County where Democrats dominate, District Attorney Fani Willis (D), whose office is prosecuting Trump for election interference amid a turbulent period in which she conceded a romance with a now-former colleague, defeated Democrat and former prosecutor Christian Wise Smith. Willis is expected to prevail in November against Republican Courtney Kramer, a former legal intern in the Trump administration and former litigation consultant to the Trump campaign.\n\nThe House GOP padded its narrow majority in Washington as Republican California state legislator Vince Fong defeated Republican Tulare County Sheriff Mike Boudreaux Tuesday in a special election and runoff to fill the seat vacated last year by ousted former Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.).\n\nMeanwhile, Republicans and Democrats in the Capitol are busy messaging to respective supporters using political weaponry guised as statutory punishments.\n\nHouse and Senate Democrats want to turn up the heat on conservative Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito following a New York Times report and photo showing an American flag flown upside down at his home shortly after the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol. An upside-down flag is a distress signal and was a symbol of the \"Stop the Steal\" conservative movement that opposed Biden's 2020 victory. The photo also triggered reactions of outrage from progressives across media platforms, perceived as a positive reaction by Democrats eager to motivate prospective voters this year.\n\nAsserting political bias on the part of Alito, at least 45 Democrats signed a letter seeking the justice's recusal from all pending Jan. 6-related cases. Supreme Court justices are largely self-policing when it comes to recusals and disclosures of conflicts of interest but ethics controversies forced the court to publicize nonbinding guidelines last year. Alito has blamed the flag on his wife's spat with a neighbor.\n\n\"Your own public statement attempts to pass responsibility to your wife, but you nonetheless acknowledge that it was a political statement in support of Donald Trump's effort to overturn the 2020 election,\" the lawmakers wrote.\n\n\"The fact of such a political statement at your home creates, at minimum, the appearance of improper political bias,\" they added.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said Tuesday he's considering bringing a Supreme Court ethics bill to the floor this week in reaction to Alito's flag flying, which Schumer said calls into question the conservative justice's impartiality. The majority leader said he will confer with Judiciary Committee Chair Dick Durbin (D-Ill.).\n\nAlito remains a Democratic political target as the lead author of the majority opinion that overturned Roe v. Wade and sent to the states in 2022 decisions about abortion restrictions. Alito was nominated to the high court by former President George W. Bush and was confirmed by a nearly party-line vote in the Senate, 58-42. Four Democrats from red states voted with all Republicans to confirm him in 2006.\n\nCBS News: Not only is Trump \"obsessed with losing 2020, he's clearly become unhinged,\" Biden told donors during a campaign event in Boston Tuesday night, according to pool reporting from one of two events. \"He's a threat to the planet.\"\n\nBIPARTISANSHIP HAS EVAPORATED on border security legislation in the Senate, as Republicans will vote in party line against the border security deal that Schumer is bringing back to the floor this week. Even though Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) once hailed the proposal as a \"huge success by any objective measure,\" partisan politics have ramped up five months out from the election, writes The Hill's Alexander Bolton.\n\nMcConnell, who helped negotiate the border security package earlier this year when it was attached to $61 billion in Ukraine aid, on Tuesday called the Democrats' plan to bring it back to the floor \"a gimmick.\" He instead urged Biden in a phone call to address the border crisis through executive actions, even though administration officials have said for months they have limited authority to stop border crossings without congressional action.\n\n\"I said to him ... Mr. President, you caused this problem. There's no legislation that allows the problem to be fixed. Why don't you just allow what the previous administration was doing,\" McConnell said, recounting his conversation with Biden.\n\nREPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS: Sen. Ted Cruz (Texas), a staunchly anti-abortion Republican, introduced a bill he said is aimed at protecting access to in vitro fertilization (IVF), in the latest sign the GOP feels vulnerable on reproductive rights and is trying to shore itself up against Democratic attacks. The Hill's Nathaniel Weixel reports Cruz is facing a reelection battle against well-funded Rep. Colin Allred (D-Texas), who quickly jumped on the attack, accusing Cruz of trying to cover up his record.\n\n\"Let's be clear, Ted Cruz's long-standing support for an extreme ban on abortion which is now threatening IVF is why we are here,\" Allred said.\n\nBIDEN MAY LOSE support among young Black voters come November as the war in Gaza continues. Young Black voters have grown increasingly disillusioned with the Democratic Party and some polls suggest the key voting bloc may opt not to participate in the fall to protest U.S. policies supporting Israel's military campaign against Hamas and the resulting civilian casualties. Black Americans say they identify with Palestinians' struggles in Gaza.\n\n\"This is the subtle life we live with every day,\" Quintin Cross, senior policy adviser at the Hudson/Catskill Housing Coalition, told The Hill's Cheyanne M. Daniels. \"Whether it's police violence, government attack or just a general disregard for Black lives, we can relate.\"\n\nCOURTS\n\nTrump trial: The former president's defense team rested its case Tuesday in the Manhattan hush money trial after calling two witnesses, neither of whom was Trump. The defense team has asserted bias and untruths within the prosecution's criminal indictment of Trump for allegedly falsifying business records meant to influence voters during the 2016 election. The defense's legal strategy has not focused on refuting all witness testimony harmful to Trump, but instead to raise reasonable doubt about witness recollections, character and their motivations. The defendant, who has outlined his theories to reporters beyond the courtroom, opted not to take the stand on Day 20, a choice many legal experts expected. Closing arguments are set Tuesday following the Memorial Day weekend, after which the jury could reach a verdict that impacts the 2024 presidential election and enters the history books. The trial takes a break today. Here are at least five big moments the jury will have to weigh.\n\nClassified documents: In the Justice Department's prosecution of Trump for illegally taking national security and other documents to Mar-a-Lago after leaving office, it now comes to light in a court filing that more records were discovered in Trump's Florida bedroom after the FBI's search. The former president says he's not guilty of violating the Presidential Records Act or obstructing a federal investigation. A trial in Florida may not occur this year because of slow deliberations by the federal judge managing the case.\n\nGuns: If the Supreme Court rules this summer that bump stocks are not machine guns, such a decision could open doors to unfettered new rapid-fire devices.\n\nElection interference: Former New York mayor and erstwhile Trump ally Rudy Giuliani pleaded not guilty in Arizona on Tuesday to nine felony charges stemming from his role in trying to overturn the 2020 election results. He was ordered to post a $10,000 bond, and a judge said he must travel to Arizona within 30 days to post it personally. Giuliani filed for bankruptcy in December stemming from his 2020 election interference efforts in Georgia.\n\nBACKLASH HAS BEEN SWIFT to the International Criminal Court's (ICC) Monday announcement that the chief prosecutor is seeking arrest warrants for war crimes in Gaza for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, as well as leaders of Hamas. Biden and other U.S. officials have denounced the ICC's move, saying the ICC has no jurisdiction in the matter.\n\nLawmakers from both parties condemned the ICC's actions Monday, and Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) said House Republicans are looking into sanctioning the court, of which neither Israel nor the U.S. are members (The Hill). Secretary of State Antony Blinken said at a Tuesday Senate hearing that he is open to working with Congress on legislation to penalize the court, indicating the Biden administration's willingness to act against the body (CNN).\n\n\"Given the events of yesterday, I think we have to look at the appropriate steps to take to deal with, again, what is a profoundly wrongheaded decision,\" Blinken said.\n\nNetanyahu himself compared the requests for arrest warrants to charging former President Roosevelt and former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, calling the charges \"outrageous\" in a Tuesday interview on CNN's \"The Lead\" with Jake Tapper.\n\n\"They're beyond outrageous,\" Netanyahu said. \"This is a rogue prosecutor that has put false charges, and created false symmetries that are both dangerous and false.\"\n\nThe Hill's Laura Kelly reports from Tel Aviv that frustration, incomprehension, hurt and defiance are some of the reactions in Israel toward the possible warrants. While Netanyahu holds nearly unprecedented low approval ratings domestically, few Israelis are likely to say his conduct is on par with intentional targeting of civilians by Hamas.\n\nAfter President Ebrahim Raisi's death, Iran's political establishment must choose between opening the upcoming elections and facing moderate rivals or limiting candidates and risking the embarrassment of low turnout (The New York Times).\n\nJohnson, who had been a powerful and experienced former Senate leader, followed the assassination of President John F. Kennedy as his successor by crafting an ambitious array of domestic initiatives, legislation and programs aimed at ending poverty, curbing crime, tackling inequality (including through the creation of Medicare and Medicaid in 1965) and conserving the environment.\n\nHe used his address to ask young people to join what he called a \"battle\" to fulfill the aims of the nation's founders.", "source":

It has been nearly a week since the New York Times broke the news that a flag associated with Donald Trump's baseless fraud claims about the 2020 election flew outside the house of the conservative supreme court justice Samuel Alito, and Democrats appear to be gearing up to respond. Congressman Steve Cohen has proposed censuring Alito, while yesterday Chuck Schumer, the Senate's Democratic leader, said flying the flag \"casts some doubt on [his] impartiality\", and added he would be looking for ways to respond. Last year, Democrats convened the Senate judiciary committee to try to build support for legislation requiring the court to impose an enforceable code of ethics following earlier reports of ties between conservative justices and wealthy parties with interests before the court. But that legislation went nowhere in the face of Republican opposition, and there is no sign of that calculus changing today. Meanwhile, the conservative-dominated court is considering cases whose outcomes could weigh on the November presidential election, including Trump's bid for immunity from charges related to his attempt to stop Joe Biden from taking office.

As a political writer, Burris has had bylines at CNN, Salon.com, BNR, and AlterNet and serves as a senior digital editor for RawStory.com.\n\nA former ethics czar for George W. Bush once helped Justice Samuel Alito prepare for his Senate confirmation hearing. Now he's furious at Alito's behavior and wants him recused from any case involving Jan. 6.\n\nSpeaking to WBUR, Richard Painter, a professor at the University of Minnesota Law School,- confessed that he is very disappointed reading the report that Alito had a flag flying upside down outside his home.\n\nThus far, 45 Democrats have signed onto a letter demanding that Alito recuse himself and even Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) called the move \"not good judgment.\"\n\nALSO READ: Federal Election Commission kills anonymous donor proposal\n\n\"I'm very shocked by this, Justice Alito,\" Painter said to Here & Now's Robin Young. He confessed Alito has been \"someone I have a lot of respect for\" and he's \"very shocked that this would happen outside his home.\"\n\nAlito claimed that his wife was the one behind the flag, not him, but Painter called it \"irrelevant.\"\n\n\"I can't imagine that flag could have been flown upside down without his permission,\" said Painter. \"We now have two Supreme Court justices whose spouses were very, very much involved in supporting Donald Trump's effort to be re-elected.\"\n\nThe second is Justice Clarence Thomas, who has had repeated run-ins with the ethics rules. His wife, Ginni, was actively involved in the attempt to overthrow the election by pressuring lawmakers in Arizona.\n\nRecently, the Supreme Court relaxed its ethics rules, removing the demand that they \"shall\" recuse themselves from cases that are conflicts.

But legal experts say Alito likely did not act illegally.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe initial May 16 New York Times article reported that the upside-down flag, a longstanding sign to communicate distress in \"instances of extreme danger to life or property,\" was by then a common symbol for supporters of outgoing President Donald Trump's effort to overturn his 2020 election loss. \"A flood of social media posts exhorted Trump supporters to flip over their flags or purchase new ones to display upside down,\" the Times reported.\n\nAdvertisementBreaking News\n\nGet the latest breaking news from North Texas and beyond.\n\nSIGN UP\n\nOr with:\n\nGoogleFacebook\n\nBy signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nThe justice later told Fox News that he had no role in the flag being flown in that manner. Rather, he said, his wife Martha-Ann Alito had raised the upside-down flag \"for a short time\" as a response to verbal attacks by her neighbors.\n\nAs the controversy developed, Alitos's Democratic critics urged him to recuse himself from cases involving Trump and his actions during that period, saying the justice's impartiality could not be assured. Supreme Court recusals are up to the justice, with no external mechanism to require them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut the episode has spotlighted an even more basic question: Was flying the flag upside down against the law?\n\nIn a technical sense, perhaps. In a practical sense, no, legal experts say.\n\nU.S. law lays out lengthy instructions for the proper display and treatment of the flag.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor the Alitos, the most relevant portion of U.S. Code is: \"No disrespect should be shown to the flag of the United States of America. ... The flag should never be displayed with the union down, except as a signal of dire distress in instances of extreme danger to life or property.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe notion of hanging a flag upside down to communicate distress has a long history in maritime culture, likely dating back to the British Isles in the 17th century, according to the North American Vexillological Association, an organization of flag scholars and enthusiasts. It was commonly used by ships through the 18th and 19th centuries until the development of more effective communication systems, notably radio.\n\nBy now, \"neither the International Code of Signals nor U.S. inland rules of the road recognize the inverted ensign as a distress signal,\" and \"signal books published by the U.S. maritime agencies specifically discourage its use.\" (Today, ships in dire distress are supposed to signal with \"N\" and \"C\" international code flags -- which stand for \"November\" and \"Charlie\" -- or other specified flags.)\n\nAs a result, an inverted flag \"has largely become a political signal,\" the association has written.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor instance, prior to becoming an election-denial symbol in 2020, \"many Cuban-Americans in Miami used it to protest the federal government taking Elian Gonzalez from his Miami relatives and sending him back to his father in the spring of 2000,\" said Howard M. Wasserman, a Florida International University law professor.\n\nBut despite being part of U.S. law, it provides no enforcement mechanism for flying the flag right side up. In addition, the flag code's text uses the softer term \"should\" when it discusses how flags should be treated, rather than \"shall.\"\n\n\"The U.S. Flag Code can be understood as an etiquette manual,\" Ted Kaye, the North American Vexillological Association's secretary, told PolitiFact.\n\nAnd even if U.S. law did specify an enforcement mechanism, it would be impractical to charge all violators with criminality.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor instance, another portion of the flag code forbids flags from being \"used for advertising purposes in any manner whatsoever\" and being printed \"on paper napkins or boxes or anything that is designed for temporary use.\" This is a common practice today and is never prosecuted.\n\nA big reason for the hands-off approach: Several rulings, most recently Texas v. Johnson in 1989, affirmed First Amendment protections for mistreating a flag. Since the 1989 decision, efforts to amend the Constitution to allow the prosecution of flag burning have come to naught.\n\n\"Punishing someone for flag misuse or desecration violates a bedrock free speech principle -- that government has no power to punish a speaker based on the message they seek to convey, including through the potent symbol of the U.S. flag,\" said Timothy Zick, a William & Mary law professor.\n\n\"Flying the flag upside down to send a political message is protected by the First Amendment,\" said Gregory P. Magarian, a law professor at Washington University in St. Louis.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith the Supreme Court having taken the flag's mistreatment out of the legal realm more than three decades ago, questions of flag-display propriety shift instead to the world of norms, Magarian said.\n\n\"Alito couldn't be prosecuted for altering the flag to send a political message,\" he said. \"However, the statute still makes a normative statement about behavior of which society should disapprove. I think that's the likeliest sense in which the statute could be relevant for the present discussion.\"\n\nBy Louis Jacobson, PolitiFact staff writer", "source": {"uri": "dallasnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Dallas Morning News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Alito", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Samuel Alito"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Law of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Flag of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_6_United_States_Capitol_attack", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "January 6 United States Capitol attack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2020 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PolitiFact", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PolitiFact"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_North_Texas", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of North Texas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_Vexillological_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "North American Vexillological Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Flag_Code", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Flag Code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Code_of_Signals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International Code of Signals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ensign_(rank)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ensign (rank)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Code", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanging", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hanging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Isles", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "British Isles"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Constitution of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuban_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cuban Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_v._Johnson", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Texas v.

The photos were first reported by the New York Times last week. Alito said his wife arranged the flag that way.\n\nIt is unclear how long the flag flew upside down outside of the post office in Fort Pierce, or who was responsible. A POW-MIA flag, honoring prisoners of war and soldiers missing in action, was flying correct-side-up just below the upside-down American flag Wednesday.\n\nManagement at the post office, which is a federal building, declined to comment Wednesday, directing all questions to a corporate spokesperson. Debra Jean Fetterly, USPS spokesperson for South Florida, said she would call the local postmaster to inquire about the flag.\n\n\"The U.S. Postal Service takes pride in displaying the American flag at its facilities,\" Fetterly later said in an email. \"We appreciate being made aware of this situation, which appears to be an unintended error and which local management is investigating. As soon as we became aware, the issue was immediately corrected, and the U.S. flag is now flying properly. We sincerely apologize for this inadvertent occurrence.\"\n\nSt. Lucie County narrowly voted for Trump with just over 50% of the vote in 2020. However, a majority of Fort Pierce voters backed Biden, including more than 75% of voters in the precinct where the Orange Avenue post office is located and more than 92% in the precinct with boundaries that begin just across the street.\n\nMeanwhile, about a mile east on Orange Avenue, a hearing was under way at the Alto Lee Adams Sr., U.S. Courthouse, where attorneys for Trump were once again asking U.S. District Court Judge Aileen M. Cannon to throw out charges against him in a case about his retention and storage of classified federal documents at Mar-a-Lago, his home and club in Palm Beach. Trump was not in attendance.\n\nWicker Perlis is TCPalm's Watchdog Reporter for St. Lucie County.

Last week saw the earthquake report that his wife flew a flag upside down -- signaling either that the country is in danger or that the election was stolen -- in the days after the Jan 6 attack on the capitol. This week, the New York Times further reports that Alito was flying an \"Appeal to Heaven\" flag at his New Jersey beach house this past summer. That flag is not merely another January 6 signifier but also rooted in John Locke's \"appeal to heaven,\" meaning \"a responsibility to rebel, even use violence, to overthrow unjust rule.\"\n\nIn some ways, this is another very ridiculous, very 2024 story about the lengths to which ostensible adults will go toward owning the libs, and one justice's fantastically bad judgment and cluelessness about the appearance of impropriety. But this is not even about Samuel Alito. Neither, actually was the bombshell report about his alleged leak of the outcome of the Hobby Lobby decision in 2014 to wealthy religious Supreme Court lobbyists about Samuel Alito. To expend energy railing against this one petty, petty little man is to inveigh against the symptom, as opposed to the problem.\n\nIt is just as easy to be enraged at Clarence Thomas and his myriad and corrosive ethics violations. His wife has texted with Mark Meadows over what she believed to be a stolen 2020 election, tried to encourage state legislators to support a slate of dummy electors, attended part of the Stop the Steal rally on Jan 6, and testified before the Jan 6 committee that she still believed that election was stolen. And Thomas has declined to recuse himself from the three Jan 6 cases heard at the high court this year. But again, this is not about Ginni or Clarence Thomas. To expend energy hopelessly trying to shame Clarence Thomas or Samuel Alito is an act of incalculable futility.\n\nIt is not even, I fear, about Chief Justice John Roberts, who might have, in a different time and under different circumstances, been the type of history-minded leader who would have dealt with this shameless and flagrant squandering of the court's reputation as a serious body. After all, Roberts once told Jeffrey Rosen in the Atlantic that \"the Court is also ripe for a similar refocus on functioning as an institution, because if it doesn't it's going to lose its credibility and legitimacy as an institution.\" But that Chief Justice left the chat at least a decade ago. In failing to act, over and over, he has been a powerful actor.\n\nIn Legitimacy Roberts' stead we have been left with yet another defensive, thin-skinned thunderer about judicial independence and a longtime coddler of insurrectionists and grifters. Which is why calling on Roberts to take a page from Chief Justice Earl Warren's playbook and use his moral authority to do something about Alito and Thomas -- as Warren once did about Abe Fortas -- is almost as futile as calling for him to put real teeth into an ethics code or conduct a meaningful investigation of the Dobbs leak. John Roberts, respectfully, has long ago taken the decision that he is simply one coequal vote among nine. He neither wants nor possesses the authority to reign in the MAGA justices. He may vote as though he cares about court legitimacy but he chief justices like the harassed mother of a kid tantruming at Safeway -- all shrugs and eyerolls. We can and should demand that Roberts account for what he knew and when he knew it, but Roberts will not solve the problem he has allowed to fester and grow,\n\nSo if the real problem here is not Sam Alito, or Clarence Thomas, or Chief Justice John Roberts, why have we wasted years of ink and umbrage and energy trying to change their behavior? Alito and Thomas will not be recusing from either Fisher or the Trump immunity case. The Chief Justice will not be urging them to do so. No lawyer arguing in front of the court will demand a recusal or an investigation of Justices with blatant conflicts of interest hearing these Jan 6 cases as Sherrilyn Ifill has been urging, because, as Noah Bookbinder of CREW recently told us on the Amicus podcast, to ask the very people you want to cast votes for you to find themselves conflicted is rank insanity. \"The system of leaving it up to litigants to challenge justices as potentially conflicted doesn't make any sense,\" Bookbinder said. \"Of course that's not going to work. And leaving justices to make that determination doesn't make any sense. You need to have some kind of outside body who can evaluate those kinds of questions.\"\n\nWho who who, might that outside body be? Tapping my chin -- you tap yours.\n\nBookbinder's answer points beautifully to the real problem: We have a judicial enterprise that rules over us with absolutely no one ruling over them. Nobody should be all that surprised that Sen. Dick Durbin has announced that the Senate Judiciary Committee will not launch a probe into Alito's recent conduct. The Senate has also been trying to unearth the financing for Thomas's quarter million dollar salt-of-the-earth RV amid other ethics violations, and Leonard Leo has declined to comply with subpoenas related to it. Yes, the Senate should be acting to resolve this problem, but that seems to have largely stalled at \"asking them to recuse.\"\n\nSo just to review, this isn't really a Sam Alito problem, or a Clarence Thomas problem, or a John Roberts problem -- but it also isn't even a Senate-Dems-who-can't-muster-the-energy-to-close-the-deal problem.\n\nNo, I have come to conclude is that this is an us problem. Because rather than hurling ourselves headlong into the \"Alito Must Recuse\" brick wall of \"yeah, no,\" we need to dedicate the upcoming election cycle, and the attendant election news cycle to a discussion of the courts. Not just Sam Alito or Clarence Thomas who happen to go to work every day at the court, and not just Dobbs and gun control, which happens to have come out of the very same court, but the connection between those two tales: what it means to have a Supreme Court that is functionally immune from political pressure, from internal norms of behavior, from judicial ethics and disclosure constraints, and from congressional oversight and why that is deeply dangerous. Moreso, why justices who were placed on the court to behave as well-compensated partisan politicians would do so in public as well as on paper. Until we do that, Justice Alito will continue to fly around the world giving speeches about his triumph in Dobbs and that Clarence Thomas will keep taking gifts and failing to disclose them. That won't be the end of the Supreme Court story, it will just be the start of it.\n\nMy friend Jennifer Rubin unspooled a call for Democrats to run in November on the promise of abortion rights, court and filibuster reform. That, too, will be a start. But Donald Trump is already training us to accept the argument that presidents need to be able to order the assassination of their rivals, and Justice Alito is training us to tolerate the notion that if we don't grant the president immunity for such acts, they won't agree to peacefully leave office. In the span of a week, Alito has also trained us to accept that justices can fly whatever inciting and ideological symbols they like, even if the guys who work at the SCOTUS mailroom can't, because Justices are also the recipients of blanket immunity. The problem with these arguments about offering immunity to bad actors is that you can metabolize the helplessness almost as rapidly as you metabolize the idea of immunity itself. It's not merely the idea that law is for suckers that we have normalized in this precarious moment, it's the tragic collective conclusion that there is nothing to be done about the fact that the light is the really flashing red right now.\n\nAn imperial court is the problem, not Martha Ann Alito's childish tantrums and not whatever her husband will tell Fox News tomorrow about how the haters made him fly a Christian Nationalist flag as the court took on the mifepristone case. Please don't let the rapid riptides of the news cycle or the sense that God wants us all to live under the fist of an imperial court forever and ever amen distract from the fact that term limits, court expansion, an Inspector General, filibuster reform, all of this is possible, and none of it is happening in the wake of the Alito flag revelations, just as none of it was happening when Ginni Thomas showed up at an insurrection rally. The court is hearing cases on the docket while some justices are living life off the docket that prove one thing only: That institutional immunity is not so much taken as silently and invisibly conferred. If we have learned anything at all in the recent past, it's that it's also contagious.", "source": {"uri": "slate.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Slate Magazine"}, "authors": [{"uri":

But while the Nigerian has continued to bang in the goals, his side have put up a disappointing defence of their title.\n\nThey sit ninth in the Serie A table and are an astonishing 39 points adrift of this year's champions Inter Milan. With European football off the table next season, Osimhen appears ready to move on.\n\nHe still has two years remaining on his contract, allowing Napoli to charge a high fee for his services. But he is still drawing interest, with Chelsea joining PSG in the race to sign the 25-year-old.\n\nAccording to Sky Sport Italia, Chelsea have had 'inital contacts' with Napoli over Osimhen's future. The Blues are said to be trying to facilitate a deal costing up to \u00a377m, that would see Lukaku and a young player move to Italy in exchange for Osimhen.\n\nLukaku is reportedly a target of Napoli's incoming sporting director Giovanni Manna, who previously tried to sign him for Juventus. While negotiations are progressing, 'the will' of both Osimhen and Lukaku will also have to be assessed.\n\nBefore pressing on with their transfer plans, Napoli's priority is on selecting a new coach. Stefano Pioli, Vincenzo Italiano, Gian Piero Gasperini and Antonio Conte are all candidates, with the latter thought to be a fan of Lukaku.\n\nHAVE YOUR SAY! Would Victor Osimhen be a good signing for Chelsea? Comment below.\n\nPochettino is set to reignite his interest in Victor Osimhen\n\nDespite that, Napoli owner Aurelio De Laurentiis has already admitted that he believes Osimhen will be on the move this summer. He ranked the striker among the club's greatest players and revealed he would not stand in the way of a transfer,\n\n\"Victor is another good player that Napoli have. We had (Edinson) Cavani, (Gonzalo) Higuain, (Ezequiel) Lavezzi and we had (Dries) Mertens, we had a lot of people who were fantastic,\" De Laurentiis said in January.\n\n\"And there are others who are attracted by Real Madrid, by Paris Saint-Germain, by Arsenal, Manchester City, Chelsea. So you cannot stop them, especially when they have a fixed amount of money where they can be bought.\n\n\"Osimhen is a very great player -- but you know Napoli is a fantastic place. There are certain players who fell in love with Napoli and stayed, like (Marek) Hamsik for 11 years. Or like others for eight years.\n\n\"He has a release clause. It's a very big amount of money. Who knows who will leave, we will see. The money is the last problem for Napoli. We always made very good acquisitions as we did in the past.\n\n\"We will do (so) in the future. The problem is just sentimental problems. When you see a player leave, it's like a son. You are also happy if this son has fantastic success everywhere else.\"\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

The Blues are said to be getting creative with their planned proposal to lure Osimhen to Stamford Bridge amid looming Financial Fair Play regulations.\n\nPochettino has endured a disappointing first season as Chelsea's head coach, partly due to his misfiring attack, which Cole Palmer has rescued from a total disaster.\n\nIt isn't easy to picture the depths Chelsea may have descended into this term had it not been for Palmer's incredible introduction after a \u00a340million switch from Manchester City.\n\nThe 21-year-old has registered 23 goals and 13 assists in all competitions, only joined in double figures by Nicolas Jackson, who has netted 14 times.\n\nChristopher Nkunku has barely kicked a ball during an injury-stricken maiden campaign after his \u00a353m arrival last summer. Armando Broja has had a similarly limited role through fitness issues of his own, and is now on loan at Fulham.\n\nSo Chelsea will reportedly return to the market for a new striker this summer, and Osimhen has emerged as a possible target.\n\nAccording to Sky Sport Italia, the West London giants have joined Paris Saint-Germain in the frame for Osimhen's signature.\n\nInitial contact is said to have been made with Napoli, where the 25-year-old has scored 75 goals in 130 games across four years since joining from LOSC Lille.\n\nChelsea are claimed to be readying an approach worth \u00a369m to \u00a377m with the inclusion of Romelu Lukaku and a young player.\n\nLukaku flopped after returning to Stamford Bridge in a \u00a397.5m deal in 2021 and was sent back to Inter Milan on loan last season.\n\nHe remained in Italy this term at AS Roma, scoring 19 goals in 43 games, and could sign for a third Serie A giant in as many years if Napoli are interested in his services.\n\nThe report adds that incoming sporting director Giovanni Manna has identified Lukaku as a target, having previously wanted to take him to Juventus in a swap deal with Dusan Vlahovic.\n\nBut it remains to be seen whether Osimhen or Lukaku would be interested in joining the respective clubs.\n\nChelsea and Napoli may not be in European football altogether next season, with the latter's drop-off even more staggering after winning the Serie A title last year.\n\nFor now, Napoli are said to have prioritised the appointment of a new head coach.

Currently sitting ninth in the Serie A table and a staggering 39 points behind champions Inter Milan, Napoli look set to miss out on European football next season, prompting Osimhen to consider his options.\n\nDespite having two years left on his contract, which allows Napoli to demand a hefty fee, interest in Osimhen remains high, with Chelsea joining PSG at the front of the race for the 25-year-old striker.\n\nSky Sport Italia reports that Chelsea have made 'initial contacts' with Napoli regarding Osimhen's future. The Blues are reportedly trying to orchestrate a deal worth up to \u00a377m, which would see Lukaku and a young player head to Italy in exchange for Osimhen.\n\nLukaku is said to be on the radar of Napoli's incoming sporting director Giovanni Manna, who previously attempted to sign him for Juventus. While negotiations are underway, the desires of both Osimhan and Lukaku will also need to be considered.\n\nNapoli's search for a new manager is taking precedence over transfer business, with Stefano Pioli, Vincenzo Italiano, Gian Piero Gasperini, and former Chelsea boss Antonio Conte on the shortlist. The latter is reportedly an admirer of Romelu Lukaku.\n\nREAD MORE: How Chelsea can qualify for the Europa League with Man United and Newcastle outcome explained\n\nREAD MORE: Every word Mauricio Pochettino said on Chelsea win, Madueke, Cucurella role, mentality change\n\nAurelio De Laurentiis, Napoli's president, has conceded that Osimhen is likely to depart in the upcoming transfer window. He praised him as one of Napoli's elite, akin to past stars such as Cavani, Higuain, Lavezzi, and Mertens, and indicated he wouldn't obstruct a move.\n\n\"Victor is another good player that Napoli have. We had (Edinson) Cavani, (Gonzalo) Higuain, (Ezequiel) Lavezzi and we had (Dries) Mertens, we had a lot of people who were fantastic,\" De Laurentiis remarked earlier this year.\n\n\"And there are others who are attracted by Real Madrid, by Paris Saint-Germain, by Arsenal, Manchester City, Chelsea. So you cannot stop them, especially when they have a fixed amount of money where they can be bought.\n\n\"Osimhen is a very great player - but you know Napoli is a fantastic place. There are certain players who fell in love with Napoli and stayed, like (Marek) Hamsik for 11 years. Or like others for eight years.\n\n\"He has a release clause. It's a very big amount of money. Who knows who will leave, we will see. The money is the last problem for Napoli. We always made very good acquisitions as we did in the past.\n\n\"We will do (so) in the future. The problem is just sentimental problems. When you see a player leave, it's like a son. You are also happy if this son has fantastic success everywhere else.\"", "source": {"uri": "football.london", "dataType": "news", "title": "footballlondon"}, "authors": [{"uri": "amie_wilson@football.london", "name": "Amie Wilson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "jacob_leeks@football.london", "name": "Jacob Leeks", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.S.C._Napoli", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "S.S.C.

Another target that United set their sights on was Napoli goal machine Victor Osimhen.\n\nScoring a whopping 31 goals in 39 appearances in all competitions, Osimhen played a crucial role in leading his team to last season's Serie A title; their first in over 30 years.\n\nThis season, he has remained clinical in front of goal, bagging 14 goals in 22 Serie A matches.\n\nIn January, Napoli President Aurelio De Laurentiis revealed that his star striker is on his way out of the club this summer. While the striker signed a new deal with the club, it appears as if this was done just to protect his market value.\n\nWith Osimhen seemingly ready to depart Napoli, United appear to have reignited their interest in the player, with The Peoples Person relaying last month that United are ready to move for him so as to relieve the heavy goalscoring burden faced by Rasmus Hojlund.\n\nNow, a former United striker appears to be the deciding factor in whether Napoli will indeed allow a deal with United to ultimately advance.\n\nCalcio Mercato reported that Napoli are considering Romelu Lukaku as a replacement for Osimhen this summer.\n\nWith Lukaku currently on loan at Roma, the report claims that upon his return to parent club Chelsea, Napoli could make a move for the Belgian. Still, this would require the Italians to send Osimhen to Stamford Bridge, with the Premier League club looking to fill his boots in attack.\n\nAs a result, Lukaku could very well cause his former club to miss out on signing Osimhen should a swap deal with Chelsea be reached.\n\nStill, even if United miss out on Osimhen, one couldn't help but wonder whether this outcome would actually be for the best given the Nigerian's \u20ac130 million release clause which would cause a major dent in the club's budget.", "source": {"uri": "thepeoplesperson.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Peoples Person | MUFC News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mathew_cohen@thepeoplesperson.com", "name": "Mathew Cohen", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.S.C._Napoli", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "S.S.C.

While Paris Saint-Germain are after the 25-year-old, the English side have been known to be a longtime fan of him.\n\nAfter helping Napoli win the Scudetto for the first time in 33 years last season, Osimhen became the most desirable striker in Europe. The Nigerian striker has been a constant source of brilliance for the Azzurri since he arrived from Lille in 2020.\n\nOver his four years in Naples, he has amassed an outstanding record, scoring 75 goals and assisting on 18 more. Thus, the club wasted no time in renewing his contract in December of last year. But they included a release clause worth around $140 million.\n\nDuring the upcoming summer transfer window, Osimhen is reportedly a target for both Chelsea and Paris Saint-Germain. The Blues are looking to add a striker of his caliber to their offense. Meanwhile, the French giants would love to have him on board as a high-profile replacement amid Kylian Mbappe's exit.\n\nThroughout his career, Osimhen has spoken about his admiration for and aspiration to play in the Premier League. His praise for Didier Drogba, a legend for Chelsea and the Ivory Coast, only served to strengthen this view.\n\nStill, he has enough experience from his one season with Lille, scoring 13 goals in 27 games before joining Serie A. Thus, a return to France is still a considerable possibility.\n\nReportedly, Chelsea have already plotted their strategy to outbid PSG for Victor Osimhen as the summer transfer window draws near. Sky Italia's Gianluca Di Marzio has stated that the London club has allegedly approached Napoli with a contract proposal.\n\nIt is quite likely that the club would take advantage of the possible sale of one their most prized assets; especially in order to strengthen their team for the next season. Apparently, the Italians see Osimhen's departure as a critical chance to acquire vital finances to support their transfer market goals.\n\nThey have also gained a significant asset in the Nigerian star, a talented player wanted by other elite teams. And the first hopeful buyers have already begun to test the waters. Chelsea have made contact with Napoli, including Romelu Lukaku and an unnamed young player a part of their $97 million bid.\n\nIn the next few days, the Partenopei will likely announce Giovanni Manna as their new director of sports. The report adds that Manna has his eye on the powerful Belgian striker and that he had previously tried to get him to join Juventus. While Lukaku has not yet found his footing at Chelsea, he has been a revelation in Serie A with Inter Milan and Roma.\n\nWith 29 appearances for the Giallorossi this season, the 30-year-old has scored 11 goals and added three assists in Italy's top division.

Nicolas Jackson's big-chance conversion rate raises Chelsea's need for a reliable goal scorer. The Blues have had a poor season despite spending big last summer but they could splash the cash again this time around with the Napoli star a prime target.\n\nChelsea, in their bid to sign Napoli's Victor Osimhen, are willing to offer \u00a377 million plus two players in the summer transfer window as a means of bolstering their attacking ranks, according to Italian journalist Gianluca Di Marzio.\n\nThe Blues' longstanding pursuit of a striker has been no secret. For a side looking to re-enter the top four of the Premier League on a more regular basis, Chelsea's desire to bring in someone of Osimhen's calibre is understandable on the basis that he's scored 14 goals in 22 league outings for a beleaguered Napoli side.\n\nAnd the west London-based outfit's need for a reliable source of goals has been boosted tenfold after Nicolas Jackson's wastefulness in front of goal has raised eyebrows at Stamford Bridge.\n\nJackson's Premier League goal tally of 11 is, by no means, a bad return - but given the Senegal international is among the strikers with the worst big-chance conversion rate in Europe's top five leagues, acquiring Osimhen is now at the top of their priority list once July hits.\n\nJackson vs Osimhen - 23/24 League Statistics\n\nStatistic\n\nJackson\n\nOsimhen\n\nAppearances\n\n27(4)\n\n20(2)\n\nGoals\n\n11\n\n14\n\nAssists\n\n4\n\n3\n\nShots per game\n\n2.1\n\n3.8\n\nKey passes per game\n\n1\n\n1\n\nPassing accuracy (%)\n\n77.7\n\n71.5\n\nOverall rating\n\n6.96\n\n7.00\n\nChelsea Willing to Offer Two Stars in Swap Deal Romelu Lukaku involved\n\nLast summer, Todd Boehly and co forked out huge sums of money to bring in the likes of Moises Caicedo, Jackson and Christopher Nkunku but with them sitting in eighth place, 16 points off fourth-placed Aston Villa.\n\nAs a way of not splashing the cash aimlessly and, in turn, complying with the Premier League's financial rules, the west Londoners' top brass are willing to offer two of their own players to see Osimhen finally come to Stamford Bridge alongside a fee of \u00a377 million.\n\nRomelu Lukaku, who is currently on loan at Roma, is believed to be one of the two that Chelsea are willing to send in the opposite direction, while a youngster - who has remained unnamed - is also thought to be a part of the mammoth package the Blues are planning to table.\n\nGIVEMESPORT Key Statistic: In 22/23, Victor Osimhen's league return of 26 goals was the most by an African player in Serie A history.\n\nDi Marzio has suggested that Chelsea have initiated contact with the Italian giants, who won the Scudetto in remarkable fashion last season, while Paris Saint-Germain have also been mooted as a potential destination for the Nigerian marksman.\n\nSince joining Napoli in the summer of 2020 from Lille, Osimhen - considered to be one of the best strikers in the world - has scored 75 goals and recorded an additional 18 assists in 130 outings for his current employers, proving himself to be quite the goal threat and emerging as one of the most sought-after forwards in the game.\n\nChelsea to Face Premier League Competition for Osimhen Manchester United, Liverpool and Arsenal all credited with interest\n\nNot only will Chelsea face stiff competition from PSG, who are planning for a potential life without Kylian Mbappe, but Liverpool have also been credited with an interest ahead of an all-important summer at Anfield.\n\nIt has recently been suggested by Italian outlet Corriere dello Sport (via SportWitness) that the Merseysiders, as they enter a new dawn with Arne Slot at the helm, are also interested in the 25-year-old's services amid Darwin Nunez, Mohamed Salah and the like facing difficulties in front of goal.\n\nRelated Victor Osimhen Now a Target for Liverpool This Summer Liverpool could be in the market for a new striker during the summer transfer window, and reports have suggested Victor Osimhen could be an option.\n\nThe report also suggests that English top tier duo Manchester United and Arsenal are also keen admirers of the \u00a3250-a-week earner.

The Blues have been continually linked with the Nigeria international in search for an answer to their significant goal-scoring woes.\n\nNicolas Jackson and Christopher Nkunku were acquired ahead of the 2023/24 campaign although both have struggled. While Nkunku has been plagued by injuries, the pressure has been on Jackson to deliver and even though he has struggled at points, the Senegal international netted his 15th goal of the season against West Ham.\n\nEven though Jackson has been among the goals in recent weeks, Chelsea could still look to sign Osimhen. Having signed a new contract, a \u00a3113million release clause was made active but the Blues may have found an attractive way around that for Napoli.\n\nWith that in mind, here are five players the Blues could look to include in a player-plus cash deal to bring Osimhen to Stamford Bridge.\n\nRomelu Lukaku\n\nThe most likely permanent exit this summer is Romelu Lukaku and a move to Napoli would provide the Serie A side with an immediate Osimhen replacement. Loan spells back in Italy at Inter and AS Roma have followed his 2021 transfer to Chelsea and another season there is likely.\n\nAccording to Gianluca Di Marzio, Chelsea are hopeful of including Lukaku in a potential swap deal to sign Osimhen. The Belgium international has scored 19 goals this season and is very clearly comfortable when playing his football in Italy.\n\nREAD MORE: Chelsea vs West Ham LIVE - Palmer and Gallagher goals give Blues two-goal advantage\n\nREAD MORE: Chelsea player ratings as Madueke magic, Palmer superb and Jackson brace in easy win vs West Ham\n\nCesare Casadei\n\nAnother arrival from Serie A was Cesare Casadei but he has struggled to make an impact despite starring in the FIFA U-20 World Cup. A loan spell at Leicester City this season was cut short with many Chelsea midfielders injured, however he has still been given limited minutes.\n\nDespite Chelsea's plan to develop wonderkids and flip for profit, it may be time for Chelsea to cut their losses and that could arrive in a swap deal involving Osimhen.\n\nIan Maatsen\n\nThe stock of Ian Maatsen has risen significantly in the last few months courtesy of his superb loan spell at Borussia Dortmund. In his new contract, there is a \u00a335million release clause and while the German side could look to activate that, the Blues may opt to try and send him elsewhere.\n\nMaatsen joining Napoli is certainly something that is possible and if accepted by Napoli, it could significantly bring down Osimhen's triple-figure asking price.\n\nDiego Moreira\n\nAs part of the Todd Boehly project, Diego Moreira was signed as an exciting talent for the future. However, a failed loan move at Lyon has seen him return to Chelsea's academy side.\n\nAgain, it could be beneficial for the Blues to move him on and doing so in turn to obtain the services of Osimhen would be a smart play\n\nAndrey Santos\n\nOne of the first young stars to be signed under the stewardship of Clearlake Capital was Andrey Santos join as he joined for \u00a318million.\n\nThe 20-year-old has been sent on loan to three different clubs since joining the Blues permanently with each move not going to plan. After returning to boyhood club Vasco da Gama, Santos joined Nottingham Forest but that was cut short after he barely featured.\n\nSantos then joined Chelsea's sister-club Strasbourg in France but he has again featured minimally and therefore it may be worth parting ways, with Napoli having the incentive to be given the services of a very talented midfielder.", "source": {"uri": "football.london", "dataType": "news", "title": "footballlondon"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kieran_horn@football.london", "name": "Kieran Horn", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.S.C._Napoli", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "S.S.C.

The Blues are fearful of Champions League semi-finalists Paris Saint-Germain beating them to the Nigeria international's signature. Osimhen has been pinpointed as Chelsea's leading striker target ahead of the transfer window reopening in the summer.\n\nChelsea have been boosted in their pursuit of Victor Osimhen as the Napoli striker is open to sealing a summer switch to Stamford Bridge despite also gaining interest from Champions League semi-finalists Paris Saint-Germain ahead of the transfer window reopening, GIVEMESPORT sources have revealed.\n\nThe Blues have scored 13 unanswered goals over the course of their last three home fixtures, thanks to consigning West Ham United to a 5-0 thumping last weekend, and Mauricio Pochettino's side have found themselves within touching distance of bagging a European qualification spot for next season.\n\nAmerican businessman Todd Boehly has not been afraid to splash the cash since leading a \u00a34.25billion takeover of Chelsea in May 2022, which ended Roman Abramovich's trophy-laden stewardship, and plans have been put in place to strengthen the forward line despite an upturn in fortunes in the final third of the pitch.\n\nOsimhen Open to Sealing Stamford Bridge Arrival Nigeria international pinpointed as capital club's leading target\n\nOsimhen is interested in joining Chelsea after being identified as their top striker target, according to GMS sources, but there are fears that Ligue 1 title-holders PSG could beat them to his signature as they are in line to be able to offer Champions League action next season.\n\nThe Blues' links to the Nigeria international have continued to crop up since the winter transfer window slammed shut, largely thanks to him racking up 16 goals and providing his teammates with a further four assists over the course of 29 appearances this term, but the west Londoners are aware that they have a battle on their hands for his signature.\n\nPSG have an abundance of cash to spend in the coming months as Kylian Mbappe is preparing to walk away from the Parc des Princes at the end of his contract, which will cut up to \u00a3114million off the wage bill every year, and GMS sources understand that they are ready to make Osimhen their talisman if he agrees to head to the French capital.\n\nGIVEMESPORT Key Statistic: Victor Osimhen registered 11 shots during Napoli's 2-2 home draw with Roma last month, which is the highest number of attempts he has recorded in a single Serie A appearance this season\n\nChelsea would have significant confidence of being able to sign the frontman, who is pocketing in the region of \u00a3255,000-per-week in his current surroundings, if Les Parisiens were not in the race for his signature as they can guarantee regular title wins due to their superiority in Ligue 1 - and often go far in the Champions League - while the west Londoners are in the midst of a rebuilding process.\n\nDespite Nicolas Jackson making an impact following his arrival at Stamford Bridge less than 12 months ago, with him taking his tally up to 16 goals for the season following his brace against West Ham on Sunday, Osimhen is firmly on Pochettino and Boehly's radar ahead of the summer.\n\nVictor Osimhen's statistical averages per 90 minutes this season compared to Nicolas Jackson\n\nVictor Osimhen\n\nNicolas Jackson\n\nPercentage of aerial duels won\n\n43.6\n\n39.3\n\nShots\n\n3.94\n\n2.60\n\nShots on target\n\n1.62\n\n1.25\n\nExpected goals\n\n0.74\n\n0.61\n\nGoals\n\n0.71\n\n0.46\n\nStatistics correct as of 06/05/2024\n\nPochettino Concerned PSG Have Already Made Osimhen Proposal West Londoners refusing to give up despite fears of move to Paris\n\nGMS sources have been informed that Chelsea are refusing to give up in their attempts to convince Osimhen to choose Chelsea as his next destination, but there are concerns that PSG have already lodged a lucrative proposal and are the frontrunners in the hunt for his services.\n\nAlthough the Blues have remained adamant that they will make a move for the 25-year-old happen if they are given assurances that it is possible, with Napoli insisting they will not accept a bid which falls short of his \u00a3113million release clause, Pochettino has also listed a number of back-up options to ensure he will still be in a strong position to improve his attacking options.\n\nRelated 7 Greatest Thiago Silva Moments for Chelsea (Ranked) After Chelsea announced Thiago Silva will depart Stamford Bridge at the end of this season, we look at the Brazilian's best moments for the Blues.\n\nGMS sources recently revealed that Girona marksman Artem Dovbyk is among the strikers listed as alternative recruits to Osimhen, but Chelsea are doing all they can to ensure that PSG are left frustrated in the coming months instead of themselves.\n\nAll statistics courtesy of WhoScored and FBref", "source": {"uri": "givemesport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GiveMeSport"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.S.C._Napoli", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "S.S.C.

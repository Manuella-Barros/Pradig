The cause of death was not announced. Cepeda\u2019s death comes just 11 days after his teammate, Willie Mays, died at 93 years old. \u201cWe lost a true gentleman and legend,\u201d Giants chairman Greg Johnson said in a statement, according to MLB.com \u201cOrlando was a great ambassador for the game throughout his playing career and beyond. He was one of the all-time great Giants and he will truly be missed.\u201d Cepeda\u2019s wife, Nydia, said he was surrounded by his family and \u201clistening to his favorite music\u201d as he passed away at home. Born in Puerto Rico, Cepeda, known as \u201cThe Baby Bull,\u201d came up to the big leagues in 1958 and quickly established himself as one of the premier players in the game, winning National League Rookie of the Year honors during the Giants\u2019 first year in San Francisco after leaving New York. Cepeda, also named National League MVP with the Cardinals in 1967, did it all with the bat during his career that saw him reach 11 All-Star teams. Arguably his finest season came in 1961 when he led the NL in homers (46) and the majors in RBIs (142). Cepeda, who also played with the Braves, A\u2019s, Royals and Red Sox, finished his 17-year career with 379 home runs and a .297/.350/.499 slash line. In 1999, five years after falling off the Baseball Writers\u2019 Association of America ballot, he was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame by the Veterans Committee. \u201cThis is truly a sad day for the San Francisco Giants,\u2019\u2019 Giants president and chief executive officer Larry Baer said in a statement, per MLB. \u201cFor all of Orlando\u2019s extraordinary baseball accomplishments, it was his generosity, kindness and joy that defined him. No one loved the game more.\u201d", "summary": "San Francisco Giants and Baseball Hall of Famer Orlando Cepeda has died at 86 years old, his family confirmed in a statement via the team on Friday night.", "url": "https://nypost.com/2024/06/29/sports/orlando-cepeda-baseball-hall-of-famer-and-san-francisco-giants-legend-dead-at-86/", "image": "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/cepeda.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1719621466&w=1200", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 04:39:27", "author": "Andrew Battifarano", "authors": ["Andrew Battifarano"], "language": "en", "catgory": "entertainment", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.678}

Cesar Maia, 78, of Rio de Janeiro\u2019s city hall, logged in for his Zoom meeting with other councillors on Wednesday while sitting on the toilet. The politician appeared to quickly realise his mistake after being seen by others on the call with his trousers around his ankles. He quickly brought the camera up to feature his face but not before fellow participants had noted his curious choice of location. Footage shows how Pablo Mello, the councillor leading the session, was amused by Maia\u2019s blunder, and suggested he simply turn his camera off. The clip has since caused something of a storm online, being shared countless times across various social media platforms. Nor is it the only story of people patching into important calls from weird places to have made headlines in recent weeks.

Corey Harris was appearing at a pre-trial hearing for driving with a suspended licence in Washtenaw County District Court in Michigan, US. As the judge opened proceedings, Harris was heard to say: \u2018I\u2019m pulling into my doctor\u2019s office actually, so just give me one second, I\u2019m parking right now.\u2019 The stunned judge said to Mr Harris\u2019s lawyer: \u2018So maybe I don\u2019t understand something. This is a driver with a licence suspended?\u2019 The lawyer replied: \u2018It\u2019s with the charges your honour, yes.\u2019 The judge then said: \u2018He\u2019s suspended and he\u2019s just driving. \u2018I don\u2019t know why he would do that.\u2019 Harris has since been booked into jail before being released on bond.

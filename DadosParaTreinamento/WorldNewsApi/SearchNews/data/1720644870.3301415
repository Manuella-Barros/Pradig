Smith had a succinct but dire warning to Dan Hurley as he weighs a blockbuster offer to become the next head coach of the Lakers. \u201cDon\u2019t fall for it,\u201d Smith wrote on X, though tagging the wrong account and not the two-time defending national champion UConn head coach\u2019s official on in the message. Smith played his high school ball under Hurley at New Jersey\u2019s St. Benedict\u2019s Prep from 2002-04. Earlier this week, ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski reported that the Lakers were \u201ctargeting\u201d Hurley for the vacant head coach position after the team fired Darvin Ham. It\u2019s an ominous statement from Smith, who played with LeBron James for three-plus years in Cleveland. Smith also briefly played with James on the Lakers during the 2019-20 season, appearing in six games off the bench in his final season in the NBA. James has a player option that would pay him about $51 million for the 2024-25 season that he must exercise or opt out of by the end of the month. The Lakers coaching job has had constant turnover in recent memory \u2014 the next coach will be the eighth in the last 15 years. The Post\u2019s Dave Blezow caught up with St. John\u2019s head coach Rick Pitino at Saratoga on Friday, and Pitino was of the belief that Hurley would rebuff the Lakers\u2019 offer. \u201cWhat I\u2019m hearing \u2014 and I have no [inside information] \u2014 is that his father [Bob Hurley Sr.] and his wife [Andrea] are very strong in his life and they don\u2019t want to go,\u201d Pitino said. \u201cI think he\u2019s going to try it, no different than [John] Calipari tried it or I tried it. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s going to take the job, but I think he\u2019s going to try the pros some day.\u201d", "summary": "J.R.

Storms that developed overnight in Kansas, Oklahoma and Missouri are now moving east toward the lower Ohio River Valley, triggering a new tornado watch for parts of Arkansas, Illinois, Kentucky, Missouri and Tennessee until 10 a.m. CT, according to the Storm Prediction Center. Northwest Arkansas, Eastern Kansas, Western Missouri and Northeast Oklahoma are also still under tornado watch until 5 a.m. CT. There is a Level 3 of 5 risk of severe thunderstorms over parts of the Mississippi and Ohio valleys into Monday morning, and EF2 to EF5 tornadoes and wind gusts of 74 mph are possible, according to the Storm Prediction Center. A Level 4 of 5 risk of severe thunderstorms also exists in parts of the Central and Southern Plains through Sunday morning. Sunday to see two waves of storms Sunday will bring a second wave of storms when a line forms across the Ohio and Tennessee River Valleys. Robust thunderstorms will continue over parts of the Mississippi Valley through Sunday morning before gradually losing their strength. But a new round of damaging storms is expected to arrive quickly after. Thunderstorms will develop over parts of the Midwest by Sunday afternoon and grow farther south and east through the evening and overnight hours. Powerful storms could ultimately stretch from the Great Lakes to the South Sunday night. Storms will move toward the East Coast Monday, bringing disruptive high winds and large hail from DC through the southeast. The travel hubs of Chicago, Indianapolis, St. Louis and Nashville could have to contend with damaging storms, leading to delayed or canceled flights. The potential for heavy rain over parts of the Ohio and Tennessee Valleys, middle Mississippi Valley, and Central Appalachians prompted the slight risk, Level 2 of 4, of excessive rainfall in those regions through Monday morning. Cities like Louisville, Kentucky; Cincinnati; St. Louis; Nashville, Tennessee; and Indianapolis are among the cities included in the Level 3 threat. It\u2019s possible the severe weather could affect the Indianapolis 500 race slated for noon ET on Sunday. The National Weather Service office in Indianapolis forecast showers and thunderstorms, mainly before 4 p.m. ET in Speedway, Indiana, on Sunday, with an 80% chance of precipitation and gusts as high as 25 mph. The last time rain shortened the Indy 500 race was in 2007 after 166 laps, according to the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. Record-breaking heat possible for some cities The unofficial start of summer is also ushering in sweltering heat, reaching potentially record high temperatures for parts of the US on Monday. Houston; New Orleans; Miami; Mobile, Alabama, Tampa, Florida; and Charleston, South Carolina, are among locations where warm weather will feel more like July than late May through the holiday weekend. A subtropical upper-level high over Mexico will help spawn excessive heat warnings and heat advisories over southern Texas through Monday, according to the Storm Prediction Center. \u201cThe ridging will create a dangerous early-season heat wave over south Texas and southern Florida,\u201d according to the center. Daily high temperatures and heat index reading exceeding 115 are possible in some areas, the Storm Prediction Center noted. Those spending time outdoors or who are dealing with a loss of power should drink enough water, dress in lightweight clothing and locate cooling centers if necessary.

{"id": 223712812, "title": "Dense breast patients battle to get coverage for cancer screenings", "text": "According to the National Institute of Cancer, the most common form of cancer is breast cancer. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) say each yearabout 240,000 cases of breast cancer are diagnosed in women in the U.S. and about 2,100 in men. And each year, 42,000 women and 500 men will die from breast cancer. That\u2019s why national panels have released new guidance for screenings, but some people are finding out that insurance companies don't cover them all. Candace Strowbridge is a 40-year-old Fort Lauderdale woman who last year saw news reports and commercials advising women to check themselves. \u201cI felt a lump, did a self-exam, and felt the lump and then made an appointment for a mammogram,\u201d said Strowbridge, while waiting for her appointment at Broward Health Hospital. It was her first mammogram. And that led to a diagnosis of a stage three cancer in her left breast. \u201cI thought about getting it but I never did,\u201d Strowbridge said. \u201cMy best friend just passed away from colon cancer and she never got a chance to do the mammograms or anything either. So, I kind of just checked out on myself and said I have to do something to not have the family worry.\u201d Strowbridge is proof that the new recommendation released last month by the United States Preventive Services Task Force is essential. The new directive recommends that all women get screened every other year starting at age 40. \u201cIt\u2019s extremely important, because most patients don\u2019t know what to look for, and we don\u2019t expect you to know what to look for\", explained Dr. Alia Abdulla, a Breast Surgical Oncologist at Broward Health. Abdulla says that she is seeing more and more patients getting diagnosed with breast cancer at a younger age, and more disparities with populations of color. \u201cAfrican Americans and Hispanics when they are diagnosed with breast cancer it\u2019s typically at younger ages and its typically more aggressive so anything we can do to catch it earlier would help to benefit our patients,\u201d she explains. According to the American Cancer Society, black women have the highest rate of death from breast cancer compared to other races or ethnic groups, with the median age of diagnosis being 60 years old. Asian, White, and Pacific Islander women are more likely than other groups to be diagnosed with localized breast cancer. Because of this new recommendation for those 40 and older to get mammograms every two years, insurance companies will now be mandated to cover these procedures. Abdulla says patients should not have a co-pay. PROBLEMS WITH INSURANCE But that\u2019s not the case if additional imaging is done. It\u2019s something Alexandra Bussa has had to experience, \u201cIt is frustrating that the doctor is recommending it, you need it, you genuinely want to have it and there is just a lot of obstacles to that.\u201d Those obstacles are insurance companies not covering her recommended screenings. There are different types of screenings. Mammograms are a form of an x-ray. Ultrasounds, otherwise known as a sonogram, use sound waves to produce an image. And occasionally an MRI is used, using magnetic fields to produce images. Bussa has had all three screenings. She was diagnosed at the age of 38 with dense breasts, and every time she gets checked, she pays. \u201cWhen she told me I needed a mammogram, then that\u2019s when I tried to utilize my insurance benefits. And going through those loops and they weren\u2019t covering at all, I had to pay out of pocket. It was several hundreds of dollars to have that testing done,\u201d explains Bussa. She says ultrasounds have cost her roughly $600 and MRI\u2019s about $500. She\u2019s hoping now that she\u2019s 40, she won\u2019t have to pay for mammograms. But, she will still have to pay for other procedures. \"Healthcare in our society is not warranted or geared towards prevention, it\u2019s geared towards you are already sick or you already have an active diagnosis. So young women like myself, like ourselves, who want to have that preventative testing in place to avoid the diseases and conditions, I don\u2019t think the platforms and the structures of insurances right now are really set up to really facilitate that for us, unfortunately.\u201d NBC6 reached out to all the top insurance companies utilized in the state of Florida. Among the list are: KAISER PERMANENTECIGNAAETNA/CVS PHARMACYUNITED HEALTHCAREAMBETTEROSCARFLORIDA BLUEFLORIDA HEALTHCARECAPITALHEALTH FIRSTAMERIHEALTH CARITASMOLINA HEALTHCAREAVMEDBLUE CROSS BLUE SHIELD Some of these companies answered questions as to whether or not they cover screenings for those with dense breasts. UnitedHealthcare released this statement saying:Preventive services are an important part of staying healthy, and UnitedHealthcare\u2019s commercial benefit plans already cover a preventive screening mammography, for members age 40 and older, without member cost sharing in accordance with the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and applicable state law. We also generally cover diagnostic ultrasound and digital mammography for members with dense breasts, according to their benefit plan. A spokesperson for Florida Blue shared:\u201cFlorida Blue\u2019s policies and services are guided by evidence-based clinical standards of care. Since 2002, under our preventative care policies, all of our plans have covered annual screening mammograms for women aged 40 and older, many for as low as a $0 copay. For members with dense breast tissue, we cover additional screenings such as ultrasounds and magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI, when it is deemed medically necessary by a member\u2019s physician. More information about breast cancer screening is available on www.Floridablue.com.\u201d Health First shared this response: Health First, a not-for-profit healthcare system, is committed to the early detection and prevention of breast cancer. We continually review and align our services with the recommendations from the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) and the Woman\u2019s Preventive Services Initiative (WPSI) to ensure our members have access to essential preventive services. To address your specific questions: Mammography Coverage: Health First Health Plans, our not-for-profit health insurance service, provides coverage for preventive mammograms for women aged 40 and over, annually. We also cover one baseline screening mammogram for women aged 35-39 within a 5-year period, recognizing the importance of early detection across different age groups. Ultrasound Coverage for Dense Breasts: For women who require additional testing due to dense breast tissue or other factors, medically necessary ultrasounds are covered under their applicable plan benefits. This ensures that our members receive comprehensive diagnostic services when a standard mammogram might not provide clear results. And Aetna Insurance released this statement: Aetna clinical policies are evidence-based and follow the recommended screening guidelines of several medical professional organizations that already support annual mammography screening beginning at age 40. We will continue to encourage our members to complete preventive screenings such as mammograms so they can address health issues as early as possible. The USPSTF noted that there is insufficient evidence to support breast ultrasound as a primary screening recommendation. Aetna covers breast ultrasound under either the medical benefit or preventive benefit in compliance with federal and state regulations and plan-specific benefits. Members should call Aetna customer service for plan-specific benefit information. The question is, what would supply sufficient evidence to get ultrasounds covered for those with dense breasts at any age? \u201cIn order to have the USPSTF create a recommendation that mandates ultrasounds for dense breasts we would need strong evidence, so that means level 1 evidence and double-blind studies. So, in general we need more research related to breast cancer,\u201d states Abdulla. Abdulla says right now, there is no clear evidence that ultrasounds are absolutely necessary. Which is why if you are 40 and older, you typically will first be offered a mammogram. But those who have dense breasts, and haven\u2019t met the age threshold of 40 for a covered mammogram, are expected to keep paying. \u201cIf we are diagnosed earlier or sooner, we will prevent other expenditures or healthcare costs down the road. So, I hope that there is an ease or facilitation between young healthy women who are pre-disposed to certain conditions and getting the screenings they need, especially at the doctors\u2019 recommendations. And maybe even having other things like pre-authorizations or other policies that they could implement for people like us who need every six months,\u201d says Bussa. \u201cEvery year isn\u2019t going to cut it, we need six months. So, hopefully that will happen. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s in place now but hopefully that insurance structure will change.\u201d Strowbridge is now in her second round of chemo, encouraging others to make an appointment. \u201cIt\u2019s very important. As mothers, we don\u2019t always, we let daily life go by, we don\u2019t check up on ourselves all the time it\u2019s always family. So, to get that checked out early enough to get that treated in the proper way, that will be good.\u201d She wishes if she did things differently, she would have get checked sooner because \"the earlier the better. I think the earlier the better.\u201d If you believe you might have dense breasts, a lump, or want to receive care, below are names of Diagnostic Centers, Cancer Institutes, and Hospitals in Miami-Dade and Broward County that offer care.", "summary": "<p>According to the National Institute of Cancer, the most common form of cancer is breast cancer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) say each yearabout 240,000 cases of breast cancer are diagnosed in women in the U.S. and about 2,100 in men.

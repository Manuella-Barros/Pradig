Both charges are misdemeanors, according to the NYPD.\n\nThe Secret Service said Heymann's mug shot will not be released, and that the NYPD reports he has no known prior arrests\n\nHowever, he is known to the police after complaining about an obscured license plate in the same section of the Tribeca neighborhood.\n\nHeymann said in his account on X that the NYPD closed out his request and said that police action was \"not necessary.\"\n\n\"Apparently driving around in a ghost car is perfectly fine with @NYPD1Pct if you've got a fireman's placard and blue tape on your truck,\" he posted on July 9, including photos of the plate and the department's response.\n\nThe incident occurred as the Secret Service has been under fire after the attempted assassination of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump at his July 13 campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania.\n\nThe former president's right ear was grazed, and the shooter, Thomas Crooks, was killed by the Secret Service.\n\nSandy

Video obtained by TMZ showed Emhoff being ushered into a black SUV and a man being led away in handcuffs.\n\n\"At no point was any protectee in danger as a result of this incident,\" Byrne said.\n\nHeymann was charged with obstructing governmental administration and criminal mischief. He did not respond to a phone call seeking comment and it was not clear whether he had a lawyer.\n\nLaw enforcement officials did not provide details about Heymann's alleged motivations or the extent to which the license plates were damaged, but the incident comes amid a years-long effort by a small group of guerilla activists to undo illegal alterations some drivers make to their license plates.\n\nTolling systems on the city's bridges and tunnels now use license plate readers to bill drivers and traffic cameras use plate readers to ticket speeders or people who run red lights. Those automated systems, though, can be defeated if the plate number is obscured.\n\nGersh Kuntzman, the editor of a news site Streetsblog NYC, popularized the citizen enforcement push in 2022 with a series of videos -- and a recent Daily Show appearance -- showing him personally \"un-defacing\" license plates.\n\nKuntzman and his followers have used markers to redraw plate numbers that have been scraped away, removed tape and stickers, fixed bent plate or unscrewed coverings that render plates unreadable by the automated cameras. Their repair efforts often focus on the private vehicles of law enforcement officers and court system personnel parked near police precincts and courthouses.\n\nAn X profile associated with Heymann showed dozens of posts about obscured license plates and illegally parked police vehicles in Manhattan.\n\n\"I do feel a certain amount of responsibility here,\" Kuntzman told the Associated Press Wednesday.\n\nA spokesperson for the Secret Service didn't respond to a question about whether the two vehicles may have featured license plate covers or other obstructions.\n\n\"Like this gentleman who may or may not have broken the law, I have been outraged by the way in which public officials, including those whose job it is to enforce the law, have willfully broken the law and made our roads less safe,\" Kuntzman added.\n\nHe continued: \"As members of the public, we do have a responsibility to play a role in keeping the roadways safe. If that means cleaning up a piece of state property that is required by law to be readable, I'm okay with that.

A Manhattan software developer was arrested and charged Tuesday, July 30, 2024, with damaging the license plate covers on two SUVs belonging to a Secret Service detail assigned to Vice [...]\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- A Manhattan software developer was arrested and charged Tuesday with damaging the license plate covers on two SUVs belonging to a Secret Service detail assigned to Vice President Kamala Harris' stepdaughter.\n\nThe man, Harry Heymann, appeared to be a supporter of a small group of citizen activists who call attention to -- and sometimes personally modify -- the obstructed license plates often used by motorists to evade tolls and traffic enforcement in New York.\n\nHeymann, 45, approached the unmarked vehicles outside a Tribeca restaurant, then broke off their license plate covers on the back, according to a criminal complaint.\n\nThe vehicles belonged to Secret Service agents assigned to protect the vice president's stepdaughter, Ella Emhoff, as she ate lunch at Bubby's, a nearby restaurant. Video obtained by TMZ showed Emhoff being ushered into a black SUV and a man being led away in handcuffs.\n\n\"At no point was any protectee in danger as a result of this incident,\" said James Byrne, a spokesperson for the Secret Service.\n\nHeymann was charged with obstructing governmental administration and criminal mischief. He did not respond to a voicemail and his attorney declined to comment.\n\nDrivers in New York often use illegal plate covers to avoid tolling systems and traffic cameras that rely on automated license plate readers.\n\nIn recent years, a small group of citizen activists have taken countermeasures to stop drivers from obscuring their license plates. Gersh Kuntzman, the editor of news site Streetsblog NYC, popularized the efforts in 2022 with a series of videos -- and a recent Daily Show appearance -- showing him personally \"un-defacing\" license plates.\n\nKuntzman and his followers have used markers to redraw plate numbers that have been scraped away, removed tape and stickers, fixed bent plates or unscrewed coverings that render plates unreadable. Their repair efforts often focus on the private vehicles of law enforcement officers and court system personnel parked near police precincts and courthouses.\n\nAn X profile associated with Heymann showed dozens of posts about obscured license plates and illegally parked police vehicles in Manhattan.\n\n\"I do feel a certain amount of responsibility here,\" Kuntzman told The Associated Press Wednesday.\n\nA spokesperson for the Secret Service didn't respond to a question about why the two vehicles featured license plate covers.\n\n\"Like this gentleman who may or may not have broken the law, I have been outraged by the way in which public officials, including those whose job it is to enforce the law, have willfully broken the law and made our roads less safe,\" Kuntzman added.\n\nHe continued: \"As members of the public, we do have a responsibility to play a role in keeping the roadways safe. If that means cleaning up a piece of state property that is required by law to be readable, I'm OK with that.

Video obtained by TMZ showed Emhoff being ushered into a black SUV and a man being led away in handcuffs.\n\n\"At no point was any protectee in danger as a result of this incident,\" said James Byrne, a spokesperson for the Secret Service.\n\nHeymann was charged with obstructing governmental administration and criminal mischief. He did not respond to a phone call seeking comment.\n\nDrivers in New York often use illegal plate covers to avoid tolling systems and traffic cameras that rely on automated license plate readers.\n\nIn recent years, a small group of citizen activists have taken countermeasures to stop drivers from obscuring their license plates. Gersh Kuntzman, the editor of a news site Streetsblog NYC, popularized the efforts in 2022 with a series of videos -- and a recent Daily Show appearance -- showing him personally \"un-defacing\" license plates.\n\nKuntzman and his followers have used markers to redraw plate numbers that have been scraped away, removed tape and stickers, fixed bent plates or unscrewed coverings that render plates unreadable. Their repair efforts often focus on the private vehicles of law enforcement officers and court system personnel parked near police precincts and courthouses.\n\nAn X profile associated with Heymann showed dozens of posts about obscured license plates and illegally parked police vehicles in Manhattan.\n\n\"I do feel a certain amount of responsibility here,\" Kuntzman told the Associated Press Wednesday.\n\nA spokesperson for the Secret Service didn't respond to a question about why the two vehicles featured license plate covers.\n\n\"Like this gentleman who may or may not have broken the law, I have been outraged by the way in which public officials, including those whose job it is to enforce the law, have willfully broken the law and made our roads less safe,\" Kuntzman added.\n\nHe continued: \"As members of the public, we do have a responsibility to play a role in keeping the roadways safe. If that means cleaning up a piece of state property that is required by law to be readable, I'm OK with that. That said, I have never messed with the Secret Service.\"", "source": {"uri": "wivb.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "wivb4"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@wivb.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "jake_offenhartz@wivb.com", "name": "Jake Offenhartz", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle_registration_plate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vehicle registration plate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secret_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Secret Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SUV", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "SUV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_police", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Traffic police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribeca", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tribeca"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tribeca"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Police car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_president", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice president"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toll_road", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toll road"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complaint", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Complaint"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ella_Emhoff", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ella Emhoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_number-plate_recognition", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Automatic number-plate recognition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_camera", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Traffic camera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handcuffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Handcuffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TMZ", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TMZ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement officer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Themes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Themes", "wgt": 51}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Non-Vessel_Operating_Common_Carrier_-_NVOCC", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Non-Vessel Operating Common Carrier - NVOCC", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/License_Plates", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/License Plates", "wgt": 42}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Licensing", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Licensing", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Open_Source/Licenses", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Open Source/Licenses", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://www.wivb.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/97/2022/07/wivbcom-top-of-site-WHITE.png?strip=1&w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9779688", "eventUri": "eng-9779688", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3333333333333334, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

New York Post reported that when Ella was having lunch inside a New Yorker confronted her security personnel outside without realizing that he was a part of the Secret Service.\n\nThe report said that the agitator ripped a license plate off on off the black SUVs parked on the street during the argument following which ethe NYPD was called to the scene.Emhoff was rushed out and placed in one of the SUVs. The man was arrested but the charges against him were not known, the report said. There was no danger to anyone, Secret Services confirmed to NYP.\n\nThe agitator was apparently complaining about the NYPD parking passes used by the Security Services to allow them to park on busy streets.\n\nElla Emhoff is a 25-year-old model who came to news recently after she supported her 'momala' Kamala Harris who came under the \"childless\" jibe. Ella was also noticed for her initiative in raising fund for Gaza. Though her father Douglas Emhoff is a Jewish, Ella was not raised as a Jew and she does not identify with the religion, it was confirmed by her spokesperson who said that she did not grow up with Judaism.\n\n\"It's not surprising that Ella is engaging in her step-mom's race for president. She is pro-Hamas just like Kamala,\" GOP strategist Garrett Ventry said.\n\nThe incident took place as the Secret Service is under fire following the assassination bid on Donald Trump in Pennsylvania.\n\nAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Video obtained by TMZ showed Emhoff being ushered into a black SUV and a man being led away in handcuffs.\n\n\"At no point was any protectee in danger as a result of this incident,\" Byrne said.\n\nHeymann was charged with obstructing governmental administration and criminal mischief. He did not respond to a phone call seeking comment and it was not clear whether he had a lawyer.\n\nLaw enforcement officials did not provide details about Heymann's alleged motivations or the extent to which the license plates were damaged, but the incident comes amid a years-long effort by a small group of guerilla activists to undo illegal alterations some drivers make to their license plates.\n\nTolling systems on the city's bridges and tunnels now use license plate readers to bill drivers and traffic cameras use plate readers to ticket speeders or people who run red lights. Those automated systems, though, can be defeated if the plate number is obscured.\n\nGersh Kuntzman, the editor of a news site Streetsblog NYC, popularized the citizen enforcement push in 2022 with a series of videos -- and a recent Daily Show appearance -- showing him personally \"un-defacing\" license plates.\n\nKuntzman and his followers have used markers to redraw plate numbers that have been scraped away, removed tape and stickers, fixed bent plate or unscrewed coverings that render plates unreadable by the automated cameras. Their repair efforts often focus on the private vehicles of law enforcement officers and court system personnel parked near police precincts and courthouses.\n\nAn X profile associated with Heymann showed dozens of posts about obscured license plates and illegally parked police vehicles in Manhattan.\n\n\"I do feel a certain amount of responsibility here,\" Kuntzman told the Associated Press Wednesday.\n\nA spokesperson for the Secret Service didn't respond to a question about whether the two vehicles may have featured license plate covers or other obstructions.\n\n\"Like this gentleman who may or may not have broken the law, I have been outraged by the way in which public officials, including those whose job it is to enforce the law, have willfully broken the law and made our roads less safe,\" Kuntzman added.\n\nHe continued: \"As members of the public, we do have a responsibility to play a role in keeping the roadways safe. If that means cleaning up a piece of state property that is required by law to be readable, I'm okay with that. That said, I have never messed with the Secret Service.\"\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Donate today\n\nA vigilante who regularly calls attention to toll evasion caused a brief national security scare Tuesday after he ripped off license plate covers from cars assigned to the U.S. Secret Service detail protecting Vice President Kamala Harris' stepdaughter, prosecutors said.\n\nHarry Heymann, 46, was arrested by NYPD officers around 12:40 p.m. on Hudson Street near North Moore Street and charged with criminal mischief after first being detained by Secret Service agents, according to a spokesperson for the agency. The agents were protecting Harris' 25-year-old stepdaughter Ella Emhoff, authorities confirmed.\n\nThe arrest drew national attention, with MSNBC reporting on \"the incident involving VP Harris' stepdaughter's U.S. Secret Service security detail.\"\n\nThe Secret Service did not say why the vehicles had license plate covers, which are illegal in New York state and have been subject to intense crackdowns.\n\nIn May, Mayor Eric Adams ordered law enforcement to target vehicles with the plate covers.\n\nHeymann, a Manhattan software developer, did not immediately return a request for comment. He's previously corresponded with Gothamist about unlawfully obstructed license plates.\n\nHeymann was released without bail.\n\nStreetsblog editor Gersh Kuntzman, who has gained notoriety for his own activism targeting toll evaders, said that \"ghost cars\" with obscured or missing plates have been involved in serious crimes and deadly crashes. He frequently highlights vehicles with obstructed plates and placards on the dash indicating the driver is in law enforcement.\n\n\"It's even worse because they're the ones charged with enforcing this very kind of crime,\" Kuntzman said.\n\n\"And when they commit that crime, it's an egregious affront to public decency and also an abrogation of their responsibility.\"\n\nKuntzman estimates he's removed obstructions from or otherwise fixed about 200 license plates, including many associated with law enforcement - but never the Secret Service.\n\n\"I generally do not go after Secret Service vehicles for the obvious reason that by definition work being done by the Secret Service is sort of at a high level of safety for very important people,\" he said.\n\nLicense plate vigilantes have been charged with criminal mischief in the past, including lawyer Adam White, who was arrested after he said he tried to \"fix\" an obstructed license plate in Brooklyn in 2022.", "source": {"uri": "gothamist.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Gothamist"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secret_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Secret Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gothamist", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gothamist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigilantism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vigilantism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Moore_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North Moore Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquor_store", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liquor store"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle_registration_plate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vehicle registration plate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_Police_Department", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City Police Department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hudson_County,_New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hudson County, New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hudson County, New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ella_Emhoff", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ella Emhoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Adams", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John Adams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mischief", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mischief"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSNBC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "MSNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bail", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Repair", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Repair", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Driving_and_Safety", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Driving and Safety", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Auctions/Autos", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Auctions/Autos", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://api-prod.gothamist.com/images/335507/fill-1200x650|format-webp|webpquality-85/", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9779688", "eventUri": "eng-9779688", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

Video obtained by TMZ showed Emhoff being ushered into a black SUV and a man being led away in handcuffs.\n\n\"At no point was any protectee in danger as a result of this incident,\" said James Byrne, a spokesperson for the Secret Service.\n\nHeymann was charged with obstructing governmental administration and criminal mischief. He did not respond to a voicemail and his attorney declined to comment.\n\nDrivers in New York often use illegal plate covers to avoid tolling systems and traffic cameras that rely on automated license plate readers.\n\nIn recent years, a small group of citizen activists have taken countermeasures to stop drivers from obscuring their licence plates. Gersh Kuntzman, the editor of news site Streetsblog NYC, popularised the efforts in 2022 with a series of videos -- and a recent Daily Show appearance -- showing him personally \"un-defacing\" licence plates.\n\nKuntzman and his followers have used markers to redraw plate numbers that have been scraped away, removed tape and stickers, fixed bent plates or unscrewed coverings that render plates unreadable. Their repair efforts often focus on the private vehicles of law enforcement officers and court system personnel parked near police precincts and courthouses.\n\nAn X profile associated with Heymann showed dozens of posts about obscured licence plates and illegally parked police vehicles in Manhattan.\n\n\"I do feel a certain amount of responsibility here,\" Kuntzman told The Associated Press Wednesday.\n\nA spokesperson for the Secret Service didn't respond to a question about why the two vehicles featured licence plate covers.\n\n\"Like this gentleman who may or may not have broken the law, I have been outraged by the way in which public officials, including those whose job it is to enforce the law, have wilfully broken the law and made our roads less safe,\" Kuntzman added.\n\nHe continued: \"As members of the public, we do have a responsibility to play a role in keeping the roadways safe. If that means cleaning up a piece of state property that is required by law to be readable, I'm OK with that.

Three adults and five dogs were trapped inside, Hillsborough County Fire Rescue said in a statement.\n\nHillsborough County Sheriff Chad Chronister said in a news release 25-year-old Shawn Gossett set the fire on purpose. Gossett is charged with four counts of first-degree murder while engaged in arson, three counts of aggravated cruelty to animals, and one arson count, the sheriff said.\n\nCourt records did not list an attorney to speak on Gossett's behalf. It also wasn't immediately clear what relationship he may have had with the others in the house, whose identities were not immediately released.\n\nTexas floating barrier can stay for now\n\nAUSTIN, Texas -- A floating barrier in the Rio Grande meant to discourage migrants from trying to cross from Mexico into Texas can stay for now, a full federal appeals court ruled Tuesday.\n\nThe decision by the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned a previous decision by a panel of the court. In December, a divided panel of the 5th Circuit sided with a federal district judge in Texas who said the buoys must be moved.\n\nThe entire appeals court Tuesday said it abused its discretion in granting the preliminary injunction.\n\nThe broader lawsuit is set for a trial beginning Aug. 6 in district court, where the Biden administration accuses Texas of violating the federal Rivers and Harbor Act. Vanita Gupta, associate attorney general, said Texas \"flouted federal law\" and risks damaging U.S. foreign policy.\n\nThe series of linked, concrete-anchored buoys that stretches roughly the length of three soccer fields was installed along the international border with Mexico between Eagle Pass, Texas, and Piedras Negras, Coahuila.\n\nThe Justice Department had asked a federal court to order Texas to remove the buoys, citing humanitarian and environmental concerns. The Biden administration also is fighting to cut razor-wire fencing at the border and access a city park at the border that the state fenced off.\n\nGeorgia glitch shows voter personal data\n\nATLANTA -- Georgia election officials are encouraging people to use a state website to cancel voter registrations when someone moves out of state or dies, a nod to Republican concerns that there are invalid registrations on the rolls. But Monday's rollout of the site by Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger was marred by a glitch that allowed people to access information needed to verify a person's identity and allow a registration to be canceled.\n\nFor a brief time after the site was unveiled Monday, the system preprinted the voter's name, address, birth date and driver's license number and the last four digits of their Social Security number on the affidavit. With that information, someone could then start over and cancel a registration without sending in the sworn statement.\n\nRaffensperger spokesperson Mike Hassinger said the problem lasted less than an hour. In a statement Tuesday, he said a temporary error \"is believed to be the result of a scheduled software update.\"\n\n\"The error was detected and fixed within an hour,\" Hassinger said.\n\nUntil now, few people have canceled their registration.\n\nIf someone doesn't have personal information, the system as of Tuesday offered to print out a blank copy of a sworn statement asking that a registration be canceled.\n\nMan arrested in security SUVs' vandalism\n\nNEW YORK -- A Manhattan software developer was arrested and charged Tuesday with damaging the license plate covers on two SUVs belonging to a Secret Service detail assigned to Vice President Kamala Harris' stepdaughter.\n\nHarry Heymann, 45, approached the unmarked vehicles outside a Tribeca restaurant, then broke off their license plate covers on the back, according to a criminal complaint.\n\nThe vehicles belonged to Secret Service agents assigned to protect the vice president's stepdaughter, Ella Emhoff, as she ate lunch at a nearby restaurant.\n\n\"At no point was any protectee in danger as a result of this incident,\" said James Byrne, a spokesman for the Secret Service.\n\nHeymann was charged with obstructing governmental administration and criminal mischief. He did not respond to a voicemail and his attorney declined to comment.\n\nIn recent years, a group of citizen activists have taken countermeasures to stop drivers from obscuring their license plates.\n\nAn X profile associated with Heymann showed dozens of posts about obscured license plates and illegally parked police vehicles in Manhattan.\n\nA spokesperson for the Secret Service didn't respond to a question about why the two vehicles featured license plate covers.", "source": {"uri": "arkansasonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ArkansasOnline"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

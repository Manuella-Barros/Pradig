While former Ireland captain John O'Shea took charge of the team for two interim spells over the past few months.\n\nHallgr\u00edmsson, however, has emerged as a shock appointment. His first game in charge will be against England in the Uefa Nations League in September.\n\nThe Icelandic coach, 57, was Iceland's joint manager alongside Lars Lagerb\u00e4ck when the nation famously beat England at Euro 2016.\n\nHe was then the sole manager when Iceland reached the 2018 World Cup. Hallgr\u00edmsson resigned after the country failed to progress from the group stage in their first appearance at the World Cup.\n\nHallgr\u00edmsson, who is a trained dentist, then had a spell as Al-Arabi's coach in Qatar.\n\nIn his most recent role, the 57-year-old was Jamaica manager. He resigned last week, however, after the Caribbean nation finished bottom of their group at the Copa America without earning a point.\n\nIn a statement released on Wednesday afternoon, Hallgr\u00edmsson said it was an 'honour' to be appointed as Ireland head coach.\n\n\"It is an honour to be appointed Head Coach of the Ireland Senior Men's National Team,\" Hallgr\u00edmsson said.\n\n\"Ireland is rightly a proud footballing nation which has consistently produced talented players and enjoyed many memorable moments at major international tournaments.\n\n\"We have a young and exciting team that has genuine potential. I am looking forward to working closely with the players to help coach and guide them towards improved performances and results ensuring we qualify and compete at major tournaments on a regular basis. We have important and exciting games coming up in the UEFA Nations League later this year and a massive FIFA World Cup qualification campaign coming up next year.\n\n\"Finally, I am also looking forward to getting to know the people of Ireland and in particular the wonderful fans of Irish football. It is my responsibility to coach, prepare and develop our team as best as possible to deliver results on the pitch and to make our supporters happy and proud.\"\n\n\"We are thrilled to announce Heimir as our new Head Coach. Earlier this year, we identified Heimir as our number one candidate whose capabilities and experience aligned with our criteria. Not only does Heimir have significant experience at international level with two different countries, but crucially he also has a track record of qualifying for major international tournaments and taking teams up the FIFA World rankings.\n\n\"It was also important for us that we recruited a Head Coach who is interested in the overall development of football in Ireland as outlined in the FAI's football pathways plan and in particular someone who is interested in the development of our underage international teams both of which Heimir is hugely passionate about.\n\nHallgr\u00edmsson will

The Breakdown On Heimir Hallgr\u00edmsson | Balls.ie", "body": "The long drawn out process to appoint the new Republic of Ireland manager finally concluded this afternoon, with the shock announcement that Heimir Hallgr\u00edmsson has been appointed as the new head coach of the men's national team.\n\nThe 57-year old is not someone who was heavily linked with the role during the FAI's recruitment process, where the likes of Lee Carsley, Anthony Barry, Gus Poyet, and Willy Sagnol had all been linked at various points.\n\nMany had assumed that interim boss John O'Shea would end up with the role on a permanent basis, with this news catching many off guard.\n\nConsidering the lack of speculation linking Heimir Hallgr\u00edmsson with the role, what do we know about the new Ireland manager?\n\nREAD HERE: Lyon Set Record Breaking Asking Price For Ireland's Jake O'Brien\n\nHeimir Hallgr\u00edmsson was born in Vestmannaeyjar in the south of Iceland, playing for a number of Icelandic clubs during his own football career. He also worked as a dentist throughout this period, with his first steps into coaching coming in the women's game while he was still playing himself in the early 90s.\n\nHe spent most of his early management career with IBV, swapping between the men's and women's sides. He would eventually be appointed as assistant manager of the Iceland men's side in 2011, working under Lars Lagerb\u00e4ck.\n\nHallgr\u00edmsson would become joint manager of the side in 2014, leading the nation to their first ever major tournament berth at Euro 2016. Here they would finish second in a group also consisting of Hungary, Portugal, and Austria.\n\nIceland would go on to produce one of the biggest shocks of all-time in the last-16, where they defeated England 2-1. They would go on to lose to hosts France in the quarter-finals.\n\nHallgr\u00edmsson would take over as the sole manager of the team in the aftermath of that tournament, going on to lead Iceland to their first ever World Cup after topping a qualifying group that also featured Croatia, Ukraine, and Turkey.\n\nIceland would draw with Argentina in the opening game of the tournament in Russia, before losing to Croatia and Nigeria.\n\nHallgr\u00edmsson resigned after the World Cup, going on to take up a role as manager of Qatari side Al-Arabi. He spent two-and-a-half years in the Gulf state.\n\nHe would be appointed as manager of Jamaica in September 2022, where he resigned following their group stage exit at the Copa America this summer.\n\nHis first game in charge of Ireland will come on September 7th, where they will face England at the Aviva Stadium in the first game of their 2024 UEFA Nations League campaign.\n\nHere's hoping that the appointment will be a successful one.", "source": {"uri": "balls.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.balls.ie"}, "authors": [{"uri": "gary_connaughton@balls.ie", "name": "Gary

Everything to know about new Ireland manager", "body": "Heimir Hallgr\u00edmsson has been named Ireland's new manager, with the dentist appointed as Stephen Kenny's successor, but who is the man tasked with leading the boys in green?\n\nIreland have been without a permanent manager for the past eight months following Kenny's exit, with former Man United star John O'Shea filling in on an interim basis.\n\nThe FAI's search for a new manager has seen Ireland linked with the likes of England Under-21 manager Lee Carsley, Neil Lennon, Chris Coleman, Chris Hughton and even Roy Keane.\n\nHowever, in the end, Hallgr\u00edmsson will be in charge of trying to bring Ireland to their first World Cup since 2002.\n\nHallgr\u00edmsson's first game in charge will be against England on September 7 in the UEFA Nations League clash, with the game being played in Dublin's Aviva Stadium. It remains unclear how long his contract is.\n\n'It is an honour to be appointed Head Coach of the Ireland Senior Men's National Team. Ireland is rightly a proud footballing nation which has consistently produced talented players and enjoyed many memorable moments at major international tournaments.\n\n'We have a young and exciting team that has genuine potential. I am looking forward to working closely with the players to help coach and guide them towards improved performances and results ensuring we qualify and compete at major tournaments on a regular basis.\n\n'We have important and exciting games coming up in the UEFA Nations League later this year and a massive FIFA World Cup qualification campaign coming up next year.\n\n'Finally, I am also looking forward to getting to know the people of Ireland and in particular the wonderful fans of Irish football. It is my responsibility to coach, prepare and develop our team as best as possible to deliver results on the pitch and to make our supporters happy and proud,' he said.\n\nDuring his playing days with Icelandic side H\u00f6ttur in 1993, Hallgr\u00edmsson began coaching the side's women's team, giving him a taste of what his post-playing days would hold.\n\nThe 2000s saw Hallgr\u00edmsson manage both the \u00cdBV's men's and women's senior teams twice. The highlight of his time with the Vestmannaeyjar establishment, located off the south coast of Iceland establishment, was when he won the Icelandic Cup final with the women's team in 2004.\n\nIn 2011, Hallgr\u00edmsson was appointed as assistant coach of the Iceland national football team alongside Lars Lagerb\u00e4ck as coach, helping them reach the 2014 World Cup play-off stage, where they lost to Croatia.\n\nWith Icelandic football on the up, Hallgr\u00edmsson and Lagerb\u00e4ck were then appointed joint coaches of the team, leading them to a famous win against England in the Round of 16 of Euro 2016. Following their exit from the competition, Hallgr\u00edmsson coached the team on his own as Lagerb\u00e4ck joined the Norway international team.\n\nHallgr\u00edmsson's time as his nation's manager came to an end in July 2018 after they failed to make it out of the group stage of the 2018 World Cup, despite holding Lionel Messi's Argentina to a 1-1 draw in their opening game.\n\nPrior to an influx of football stars heading to Qatar for the 2022 World Cup, Hallgr\u00edmsson managed Al-Arabi from 2018 until 2021.\n\nThe last two years have seen Hallgr\u00edmsson managing Jamaica, with his final game arriving just two weeks ago in a 3-0 loss to Venezuela which left them pointless from their three games in the Copa America.\n\nHallgr\u00edmsson has been practising dentistry since his playing days, balancing his work on the dugout with his work fixing teeth in his home village. Even when he was working as the Icelandic national team boss, Hallgr\u00edmsson continued pursuing his dentistry career.\n\nWhile attending a match during the summer of 2016, Hallgr\u00edmsson helped a player who had a tooth knocked out at a local women's game. Putting the tooth back in place, he then performed the tooth repair at a nearby dental office.", "source": {"uri": "extra.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "Extra.ie"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

The FAI insist he was their number one target for the job since earlier this year.\n\nHe will be formally unveiled at an official press conference at the Aviva Stadium on Thursday.\n\nA statement read: \"Hallgr\u00edmsson was identified as the FAI's number one candidate earlier this year with his experience aligning perfectly with the Association's search criteria.\n\nREAD NEXT: FAI 'appalled' after Sunday Independent/RTE report into women's soccer abuses\n\n\"These criteria included, amongst other factors, previous international Head Coach experience, an ability to move international teams up the FIFA world rankings, a track record of qualifying and competing at major tournaments and experience in the development and progression of young players.\"\n\nHeimir's international experience started with Iceland where he was first assistant manager to Lars Lagerback from 2011 to 2013, joint Head Coach alongside Lagerback until 2016 and then sole Head Coach from 2016 to 2018.\n\nHis time at the helm of the Iceland national team coincided with one of their most successful periods famously reaching the quarter-finals of UEFA EURO 2016, eliminating England in the last 16. In this time Iceland also qualified for the 2018 FIFA World Cup and reached a qualification playoff for the 2014 FIFA World Cup. Over the course of his time with Iceland, the team reached its highest ever FIFA ranking of 18th.\n\nMost recently, Hallgr\u00edmsson was the Head Coach of Jamaica (2022 - 2024), where he led the team to qualification for this summer's Conmebol Copa America 2024. His time with Jamaica also saw the team rise from 64th to 53rd in the FIFA World rankings. Hallgr\u00edmsson resigned from his role as Head Coach of Jamaica following the conclusion of their Copa America 2024 campaign at the start of this month (July).\n\nIn between his international roles with Jamaica and Iceland, Hallgr\u00edmsson gained club experience as Head Coach for the Qatar Stars League club Al-Arabi between 2018 and 2021. He is also a dentist in his native Iceland.\n\nCommenting on his appointment, Heimir Hallgr\u00edmsson said: \"It is an honour to be appointed Head Coach of the Ireland Senior Men's National Team. Ireland is rightly a proud footballing nation which has consistently produced talented players and enjoyed many memorable moments at major international tournaments.\n\n\"We have a young and exciting team that has genuine potential. I am looking forward to working closely with the players to help coach and guide them towards improved performances and results ensuring we qualify and compete at major tournaments on a regular basis. We have important and exciting games coming up in the UEFA Nations League later this year and a massive FIFA World Cup qualification campaign coming up next year.\n\n\"Finally, I am also looking forward to getting to know the people of Ireland and in particular the wonderful fans of Irish football. It is my responsibility to coach, prepare and develop our team as best as possible to deliver results on the pitch and to make our supporters happy and proud.\"\n\nFAI Director of Football Marc Canham commented: \"We are thrilled to announce Heimir as our new Head Coach. Earlier this year, we identified Heimir as our number one candidate whose capabilities and experience aligned with our criteria. Not only does Heimir have significant experience at international level with two different countries, but crucially he also has a track record of qualifying for major international tournaments and taking teams up the FIFA World rankings.\n\n\"It was also important for us that we recruited a Head Coach who is interested in the overall development of football in Ireland as outlined in the FAI's football pathways plan and in particular someone who is interested in the development of our underage international teams both of which Heimir is hugely passionate about.\n\n\"I also want to thank and pay tribute to John O'Shea and his staff who have guided the team through recent friendly internationals preparing the team impeccably, creating a brilliant environment for the players and achieving positive results on the pitch.\"\n\nFAI Interim CEO David Courell added: \"This is a significant day for Irish football with the announcement of Heimir as our new head coach. There has been huge interest in this appointment which ultimately is testament to how much people care about Irish football. We are delighted to have secured a Head Coach with the experience we were seeking but more importantly one that shares our vision for Irish Football. Heimir was the outstanding candidate, and I am hugely excited at what he brings to the role.\"\n\nFAI President Paul Cooke commented: \"This is an important day for the Association as we confirm Heimir Hallgr\u00edmsson as the Head Coach to take the team forward in the coming years. When I met Heimir, I was I extremely impressed by his level of professionalism, experience, integrity, and deep knowledge of the game. I would like to thank my fellow members of the recruitment panel, David Courell, Aoife Rafferty, Packie Bonner and in particular our Director of Football Marc Canham who collectively ran a very thorough and confidential process which was respectful of the candidates involved and which identified and secured the standout candidate.\"\n\nTony Keohane, Chair of the FAI Board commented: \"This is a tremendous appointment for the Association. Heimir Hallgr\u00edmsson's impressive achievements and experience in international coaching and management align perfectly with the criteria we set out with, and I am really excited at what he will bring to Irish football. The Board of the FAI is fully behind this appointment, and we look forward to seeing the team develop under his guidance.\"\n\nFans have so far displayed a mixed reaction to the news which came as a major surprise to most. One person wrote on X: \"We signed a dentist... and he's still going to be better than Stephen Kenny ever was.\"\n\nAnother added: \"Not buzzing about this but he'll have my support,\" while a third posted: \"Jesus, that's some terrible appointment. It looks like the cheap option.\"\n\nOthers were far more positive. One fan wrote: \"Welcome on board Heimir. We've got a great young squad and hopefully you can get us back qualifying for major tournaments. It's been too long.\"\n\nAnother Icelandic native responded to the news by saying: \"The luck of the Irish! Great appointment. You will soon fall in love with Heimir Hallgrimsson and his charisma.\"\n\nA third added: \"Seems like a very reasonable appointment by FAI. That Iceland team were savage at the Euros and qualified for World Cup very well winning a stacked group with Croatia, Ukraine and Turkey. More importantly they looked very well coached. Not guaranteed success but I am happy.\"", "source": {"uri": "leitrimobserver.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "Leitrim Observer"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

He also guided his country to the 2018 World Cup where they drew 1-1 with Argentina during the group stages.\n\nUntil elimination from the Copa America earlier this month, Hallgr\u00edmsson took Jamaica to 10 wins, seven draws and 10 defeats, culminating in a 3-0 loss to Venezuela on July 1st.\n\nA former Icelandic club defender, who began coaching women's teams in the 1990s before being named Iceland assistant coach in 2011, he will hold a press conference at the Aviva stadium on Thursday.\n\n\"We have a young and exciting team that has genuine potential,\" said Hallgr\u00edmsson via an FAI press release. \"I am looking forward to working closely with the players to help coach and guide them towards improved performances and results ensuring we qualify and compete at major tournaments on a regular basis.\n\n\"It is my responsibility to coach, prepare and develop our team as best as possible to deliver results on the pitch and to make our supporters happy and proud.\"\n\nIn between coaching Iceland and Jamaica, Hallgr\u00edmsson spent two years in Qatar with Al-Arab, a period that yielded more defeats (25) than wins (22).

Getty Images\n\nThe Football Association of Ireland (FAI) announced the appointment of Heimir Hallgr\u00edmsson as the new Head Coach of the Senior Men's National Team today, July 10.\n\nHallgr\u00edmsson, the former head coach of Iceland and Jamaica, will lead the team for the UEFA Nations League and FIFA World Cup 2026 campaigns.\n\nHallgr\u00edmsson will assume charge of his first competitive fixture this September as Ireland face England in the UEFA Nations League.\n\nThe new Head Coach will be formally unveiled at an official press conference tomorrow July 11 at Dublin's Aviva Stadium.\n\nThe FAI said on Wednesday that Hallgr\u00edmsson was identified as their number one candidate earlier this year with his experience aligning perfectly with the Association's search criteria.\n\nThese criteria included, amongst other factors, previous international Head Coach experience, an ability to move international teams up the FIFA world rankings, a track record of qualifying and competing at major tournaments and experience in the development and progression of young players.\n\nHallgr\u00edmsson's international experience started with Iceland where he was first assistant manager to Lars Lagerback from 2011 to 2013, joint Head Coach alongside Lagerback until 2016, and then sole Head Coach from 2016 to 2018.\n\nHis time at the helm of the Iceland national team coincided with one of their most successful periods, famously reaching the quarter-finals of UEFA EURO 2016, eliminating England in the last 16.\n\nIn this time, Iceland also qualified for the 2018 FIFA World Cup and reached a qualification playoff for the 2014 FIFA World Cup. Over the course of his time with Iceland, the team reached its highest-ever FIFA ranking of 18th.\n\nMost recently, Hallgr\u00edmsson was the Head Coach of Jamaica (2022 - 2024), where he led the team to qualification for this summer's Conmebol Copa America 2024.\n\nHis time with Jamaica also saw the team rise from 64th to 53rd in the FIFA World rankings. Hallgr\u00edmsson resigned from his role as Head Coach of Jamaica following the conclusion of their Copa America 2024 campaign at the start of this month (July).\n\nIn between his international roles with Jamaica and Iceland, Hallgr\u00edmsson gained club experience as Head Coach for the Qatar Stars League club Al-Arabi between 2018 and 2021.\n\nCommenting on his appointment, Hallgr\u00edmsson said, \"It is an honour to be appointed Head Coach of the Ireland Senior Men's National Team.\n\n\"Ireland is rightly a proud footballing nation which has consistently produced talented players and enjoyed many memorable moments at major international tournaments.\n\n\"We have a young and exciting team that has genuine potential. I am looking forward to working closely with the players to help coach and guide them towards improved performances and results ensuring we qualify and compete at major tournaments on a regular basis.\n\n\"We have important and exciting games coming up in the UEFA Nations League later this year and a massive FIFA World Cup qualification campaign coming up next year.\n\n\"Finally, I am also looking forward to getting to know the people of Ireland and in particular the wonderful fans of Irish football. It is my responsibility to coach, prepare and develop our team as best as possible to deliver results on the pitch and to make our supporters happy and proud.\"\n\nFAI Director of Football Marc Canham commented, \"We are thrilled to announce Heimir as our new Head Coach.\n\n\"Earlier this year, we identified Heimir as our number one candidate whose capabilities and experience aligned with our criteria.\n\n\"Not only does Heimir have significant experience at international level with two different countries, but crucially he also has a track record of qualifying for major international tournaments and taking teams up the FIFA World rankings.\n\n\"It was also important for us that we recruited a Head Coach who is interested in the overall development of football in Ireland as outlined in the FAI's football pathways plan and in particular someone who is interested in the development of our underage international teams both of which Heimir is hugely passionate about.\n\n\"I also want to thank and pay tribute to John O'Shea and his staff who have guided the team through recent friendly internationals preparing the team impeccably, creating a brilliant environment for the players and achieving positive results on the pitch.\"\n\nFAI Interim CEO David Courell added: \"This is a significant day for Irish football with the announcement of Heimir as our new head coach. There has been huge interest in this appointment which ultimately is testament to how much people care about Irish football.\n\n\"We are delighted to have secured a Head Coach with the experience we were seeking but more importantly one that shares our vision for Irish Football.\n\n\"Heimir was the outstanding candidate, and I am hugely excited at what he brings to the role.\"\n\nFAI President Paul Cooke commented, \"This is an important day for the Association as we confirm Heimir Hallgr\u00edmsson as the Head Coach to take the team forward in the coming years.\n\n\"When I met Heimir, I was I extremely impressed by his level of professionalism, experience, integrity, and deep knowledge of the game.\n\n\"I would like to thank my fellow members of the recruitment panel, David Courell, Aoife Rafferty, Packie Bonner, and in particular our Director of Football Marc Canham who collectively ran a very thorough and confidential process which was respectful of the candidates involved and which identified and secured the standout candidate.\"\n\nTony Keohane, Chair of the FAI Board commented: \"This is a tremendous appointment for the Association.\n\n\"Heimir Hallgr\u00edmsson's impressive achievements and experience in international coaching and management align perfectly with the criteria we set out with, and I am really excited at what he will bring to Irish football.\n\n\"The Board of the FAI is fully behind this appointment, and we look forward to seeing the team develop under his guidance.\"", "source": {"uri": "irishcentral.com", "dataType": "news",

"body": "THE APPOINTMENT of Heimir Hallgr\u00edmsson as new Ireland head coach was a decision that caught many Irish fans by surprise.\n\nBut Hallgr\u00edmsson is an appointment that comes with an impressive (and unique) CV.\n\nWhen he's not coaching, Hallgr\u00edmsson works part time as as a dentist.\n\nThe former defender, who first cut his teeth in management at Icelandic side Hottur's women's team while playing for the men in 1993, opened his own clinic nearly 30 years ago.\n\nHe combines his pro career on the pitch by seeing patients in the dentist chair.\n\nHallgrimmsson told SunSport in 2018: \"I still have my clinic and I like to keep my fingers working.\n\n\"So I try to go there as much as I can in my spare time and do some dentistry.\n\n\"Some coaches go and play golf, I do dentistry.\n\n\"The reality of a football coach, you never know when you are out of a job so it's good to have another profession to jump into.\n\n\"The clients love it, and I love it too.\n\n\"They talk about football until I'm fed up... and then I give them anaesthesia!\"\n\nHallgrimmsson even had to step into action while watching a game from the stands in 2016 - even having to repair a tooth.\n\nHe added: \"I was watching a local women's game when one of the players got knocked out and her tooth came out.\n\n\"So I jumped on the pitch and put the tooth back in, took her to a dental office and fixed it.\n\n\"That kind of thing can happen.\"\n\nIt may seem like two totally different careers - football management and dentistry.\n\nBut Hallgrimmsson certainly sees some similarities, adding: \"Working as a dentist has helped me a lot as you're always working one-on-one.\n\nHe practices in his hometown of Vestmannaeyjar, an archipelago off the coast of Iceland.\n\nHe did put the fillings and treatments on the backburner when he co-managed Iceland at Euro 2016 and then took over singlehandedly for the nation's first World Cup appearance in 2018.\n\nHallgr\u00edmsson, 57, helped push Iceland through an exciting 2016 European Championship appearance - reaching the quarter-final.\n\nThey knocked out Roy Hodgson's England side in the Round of 16 before bowing out to hosts France.\n\nDuring his time as Iceland's sole head coach, Hallgr\u00edmsson led the squad to its first-ever World Cup in 2018 - another first for the nordic country.\n\nIceland stunned Argentina, 2014's runner-up, with a 1-1 tie in its World Cup debut.\n\nHallgr\u00edmsson stepped down following their group stage exit.\n\nIn December of the same year Heimir was hired as Head Coach for the Qatar Stars League club Al-Arabi.\n\nIn September 2022, the Jamaican Football Federation announced Hallgr\u00edmsson as the new coach of their national team.\n\nHe resigned after Jamaica's poor showing at the 2024 Copa Am\u00e9rica.\n\nHallgr\u00edmsson is excited for a return to European football.\n\nAt his unveiling today, he said: \"It is an honour to be appointed today.\n\n\"Ireland is rightly a proud footballing nation which has consistently produced talented players and enjoyed many memorable moments at major international tournaments.\n\n\"We have a young and exciting team that has genuine potential.\n\nI am looking forward to working closely with the players to help coach and guide them towards improved performances and results ensuring we qualify and compete at major tournaments on a regular basis.\n\n\"We have important and exciting games coming up in the UEFA Nations League later this year and a massive FIFA World Cup qualification campaign coming up next year.\n\n\"Finally, I am also looking forward to getting to know the people of Ireland and in particular the wonderful fans of Irish football.\n\nIt is

He is also half of Icelandic football's greatest double act with former Swedish international Lars Lagerb\u00e4ck.\n\nThe duo guiding the minnows to the quarter-finals of Euro 2016. Four years earlier, Iceland won just of eight qualifiers for Euro 2012.\n\nAnd, after 231 days of searching for Stephen Kenny's successor, Hallgr\u00edmsson is Ireland's new manager. Those who suggested the national team required root canal work to turn things around may not have been expected such a literal response from the FAI.\n\nRead next: James McClean's daughter in hospital after 'taking turn for the worst'\n\nRead next: Former Glentoran teen star keen to follow Trai Hume's path for club and country\n\n\"That is, in Iceland, probably my main job, and has been,\" Hallgr\u00edmsson laughed when asked about his dentristry work in the Westman Islands, the remote southern coast archipelago with a population of just over 4,000 where he was raised.\n\n\"For a coach it sounds strange, I know. When I was doing my pro license in England, they said, 'Don't tell anyone you're a dentist!' But I never think that education can do you any harm. I'm proud of being a dentist.\"\n\nIreland fans will be scratching their heads over an appointment that has taken far too long and has delivered a name unfamiliar to many after the previous links with Lee Carsley and a host of others, and after John O'Shea did the job on an interim basis not once, but twice, since March.\n\nHallgr\u00edmsson comes from a humble background in football terms. He played for local club \u00cdthr\u00f3ttabandalag Vestmannaeyja - mercifully, they're better known as \u00cdBV - before taking charge of the women's team, and later the men's side. Under his guidance, the team reached the Europa League qualifying stages three times on the bounce.\n\nKS\u00cd - Iceland's FAI - took him on board as Lagerb\u00e4ck's assistant in 2011 before they became joint managers in 2013.\n\nAnd what Hallgr\u00edmsson did, in partnership with Lagerb\u00e4ck, was to guide Iceland to victory over England in the last 16 of Euro 2016. His first game in charge will be against the same opposition at the Aviva Stadium on September 7.\n\n\"It doesn't matter who we play or what the score line is, we try to never change our priorities,\" said Hallgr\u00edmsson during those championship finals.\n\n\"We do not think of ourselves as a small country in these moments. We know we don't have the individual players of Holland or Turkey. We win on unity and hard work and organization, and we have to be better than everyone else in these areas.\"\n\nPerhaps that will ring a bell with long-suffering Ireland supporters.\n\nHallgr\u00edmsson also took solo charge of his national team after Lagerb\u00e4ck stepped away after that championship. Iceland qualified for the World Cup finals for the first time two years later - he resigned his post after the team failed to progress beyond the group stages.\n\nBy December, he was on his way to Qatar as head coach of Al-Arabi and, in September 2022, he returned to international football with Jamaica.\n\n\"Coming from Iceland, the heat doesn't go hand in hand,\" he said after settling into the role. \"Luckily, I've always had a strange personal thermostat, so I've been good with that! Probably the easiest job in the world would be to be a weatherman in Jamaica, because it is always the same, always amazing.\n\n\"I spend most of my time in Jamaica. Ever since I got the job, I thought it was very important to learn about the people and the culture. The people are welcoming, laid back, so it's easy to get to know them. Back home and in Europe, things can be stressful and chaotic. Here, nothing is a problem for them. There are also beautiful beaches and beautiful nature. It's a great place to be.\"\n\nFor a while, anyway. His time with the Reggae Boyz ended late last month after a disappointing Copa Am\u00e9rica campaign.\n\nNext up, Dublin's chilly summer. If he has done a deep drill down into what is needed to turn around Ireland's decaying fortunes (sorry), Hallgr\u00edmsson will know the extent of the task now facing him.\n\nSign up to our free

All you need to know about the new Ireland manager", "body": "Heimir Hallgr\u00edmsson is a dentist. He is also half of Icelandic football's greatest double act with former Swedish international Lars Lagerb\u00e4ck.\n\nThe duo guiding the minnows to the quarter-finals of Euro 2016. Four years earlier, Iceland won just of eight qualifiers for Euro 2012.\n\nAnd, after 231 days of searching for Stephen Kenny's successor, Hallgr\u00edmsson is Ireland's new manager. Those who suggested the national team required root canal work to turn things around may not have been expected such a literal response from the FAI.\n\nREAD MORE: Star midfielder back in Ireland squad after four year gap with one-year-old daughter joining her in camp\n\nREAD MORE: Fans react to Roy Keane's Ireland manager admission\n\n\"That is, in Iceland, probably my main job, and has been,\" Hallgr\u00edmsson laughed when asked about his dentristry work in the Westman Islands, the remote southern coast archipelago with a population of just over 4,000 where he was raised.\n\n\"For a coach it sounds strange, I know. When I was doing my pro license in England, they said, 'Don't tell anyone you're a dentist!' But I never think that education can do you any harm. I'm proud of being a dentist.\"\n\nIreland fans will be scratching their heads over an appointment that has taken far too long and has delivered a name unfamiliar to many after the previous links with Lee Carsley and a host of others, and after John O'Shea did the job on an interim basis not once, but twice, since March.\n\nHallgr\u00edmsson comes from a humble background in football terms. He played for local club \u00cdthr\u00f3ttabandalag Vestmannaeyja - mercifully, they're better known as \u00cdBV - before taking charge of the women's team, and later the men's side. Under his guidance, the team reached the Europa League qualifying stages three times on the bounce.\n\nKS\u00cd - Iceland's FAI - took him on board as Lagerb\u00e4ck's assistant in 2011 before they became joint managers in 2013.\n\nAnd what Hallgr\u00edmsson did, in partnership with Lagerb\u00e4ck, was to guide Iceland to victory over England in the last 16 of Euro 2016. His first game in charge will be against the same opposition at the Aviva Stadium on September 7.\n\n\"It doesn't matter who we play or what the score line is, we try to never change our priorities,\" said Hallgr\u00edmsson during those championship finals.\n\n\"We do not think of ourselves as a small country in these moments. We know we don't have the individual players of Holland or Turkey. We win on unity and hard work and organization, and we have to be better than everyone else in these areas.\"\n\nPerhaps that will ring a bell with long-suffering Ireland supporters.\n\nHallgr\u00edmsson also took solo charge of his national team after Lagerb\u00e4ck stepped away after that championship. Iceland qualified for the World Cup finals for the first time two years later - he resigned his post after the team failed to progress beyond the group stages.\n\nBy December, he was on his way to Qatar as head coach of Al-Arabi and, in September 2022, he returned to international football with Jamaica.\n\n\"Coming from Iceland, the heat doesn't go hand in hand,\" he said after settling into the role. \"Luckily, I've always had a strange personal thermostat, so I've been good with that! Probably the easiest job in the world would be to be a weatherman in Jamaica, because it is always the same, always amazing.\n\n\"I spend most of my time in Jamaica. Ever since I got the job, I thought it was very important to learn about the people and the culture. The people are welcoming, laid back, so it's easy to get to know them. Back home and in Europe, things can be stressful and chaotic. Here, nothing is a problem for them. There are also beautiful beaches and beautiful nature. It's a great place to be.\"\n\nFor a while, anyway. His time with the Reggae Boyz ended late last month after a disappointing Copa Am\u00e9rica campaign.\n\nNext up, Dublin's chilly summer. If he has done a deep drill down into what is needed to turn around Ireland's decaying fortunes (sorry), Hallgr\u00edmsson will know the extent of the task now facing him.\n\nGet the latest sports

Step forward Heimir Hallgr\u00edmsson.\n\nNot exactly a household name, Hallgr\u00edmsson's moment in the managerial sun came during his time as joint-coach of the Icelandic national team that defied all odds and reached the quarter-finals of Euro 2016, boasting a shock victory against England in the process.\n\nDuring that tournament, much was made of Hallgr\u00edmsson's side-hustle as the dentist for his local village - a role he held onto even as he managed the his home country's national side between 2013 and 2018.\n\nFollowing the departure of his coaching partner Lars Lagerb\u00e4ck in the wake of that tournament, Hallgr\u00edmsson then guided Iceland to qualification for the 2018 World Cup, where they were eliminated at the group stage. Hallgr\u00edmsson resigned in the wake of that tournament as the only manager to have guided the Iceland team to qualification of both the Euros and the World Cup.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSince then, Hallgr\u00edmsson plied his trade for three seasons in the Qatar All Stars league as manager of Al Arabi before taking over as manager of the Jamaican men's national team. Under Hallgr\u00edmsson, Jamaica topped their qualifying group for this summer's Copa America, which is currently underway in the United States.\n\nHallgr\u00edmsson resigned from the Jamaica job two weeks ago following his team's poor showing at the tournament. Jamaica were eliminated after losing every game in a group that also featured Venezuela, Ecuador and Mexico, finishing with a goal difference of -6.\n\nIn a farewell article published in the Jamaica Observer two weeks ago, Hallgr\u00edmsson's time in charge of the Reggae Boyz was described as \"less than convincing\" but also \"fairly respectable,\" having racked up a win percentage of over 40% across 26 games. By contrast, Stephen Kenny's win percentage as Ireland manager was 27.5%.\n\nOne notable feature of Hallgr\u00edmsson's time as Jamaica manager was his attempts for bring on board foreign players with Jamaican ancestry, such as the Arsenal squad player Reiss Nelson i.e. the 'granny rule' so heavily relied upon by Ireland throughout the years.\n\nHallgr\u00edmsson also showed a willingness to reintroduce Aston Villa attacker Leon Bailey to his squad despite the winger's public criticisms of poor organisation and a lack professionalism within the Jamaican Football Federation -- a drama with at least one very high-profile parallel in Irish football history. There have also been reports that Hallgr\u00edmsson's relationship with some key players has \"soured,\" which is hardly an alien concept to followers of the Irish football team.\n\nHallgr\u00edmsson comes as a shock announcement, ending the FAI's search for manager that has been ongoing since Kenny was sacked in November of last year. Many of the names touted throughout the search - including Lee Carsley, Gus Poyet and Willy Sagnol - had begged off the job for one reason or another. Ireland's last two sets of fixtures have been helmed by former international John O'Shea.\n\nThe 57-year-old tooth-puller now faces a baptism of fire, set to take charge of Ireland's opening Nations League game against England on 7 September.\n\nReaders like you are keeping these stories free for everyone...

He had been in the position for two years.\n\nHis final game was a 3-0 loss to Venezuela, leaving the 'Reggae Boyz' pointless from their three games in the competition.\n\nHallgr\u00edmsson, 57, was on the coaching staff of Iceland's national team from 2013-16, during Lars Lagerb\u00e4ck's spell as coach, including for the 2016 European Championship defeat of England.\n\nHe took over as manager when Lagerb\u00e4ck left for Norway and Hallgr\u00edmsson led Iceland to qualification for the 2018 World Cup, as they became the smallest nation to reach the finals. He stepped down after that tournament as Iceland failed to emerge from their group.\n\nA former defender, he also coached Qatar's Al-Arabi from 2018-21.\n\nThe FAI has confirmed Hallgr\u00edmsson's first game in charge will be the meeting with England on September 7.\n\nHis appointment will end the FAI's 231-day search for a replacement for Stephen Kenny, who left his job as Ireland boss following failure to qualify for Euro 2024.\n\nCommenting on his appointment, Heimir Hallgr\u00edmsson said, \"It is an honour to be appointed Head Coach of the Ireland Senior Men's National Team.\n\n\"Ireland is rightly a proud footballing nation which has consistently produced talented players and enjoyed many memorable moments at major international tournaments.\n\n\"We have a young and exciting team that has genuine potential. I am looking forward to working closely with the players to help coach and guide them towards improved performances and results ensuring we qualify and compete at major tournaments on a regular basis.\n\n\"We have important and exciting games coming up in the UEFA Nations League later this year and a massive FIFA World Cup qualification campaign coming up next year.\n\n\"Finally, I am also looking forward to getting to know the people of Ireland and in particular the wonderful fans of Irish football.\n\n\"It is my responsibility to coach, prepare and develop our team as best as possible to deliver results on the pitch and to make our supporters happy and proud.\"\n\nFAI Director of Football Marc Canham commented, \"We are thrilled to announce Heimir as our new Head Coach. Earlier this year, we identified Heimir as our number one candidate whose capabilities and experience aligned with our criteria.\n\n\"Not only does Heimir have significant experience at international level with two different countries, but crucially he also has a track record of qualifying for major international tournaments and taking teams up the FIFA World rankings.\n\n\"It was also important for us that we recruited a Head Coach who is interested in the overall development of football in Ireland as outlined in the FAI's football pathways plan and in particular someone who is interested in the development of our underage international teams both of which Heimir is hugely passionate about.\n\n\"I also want to thank and pay tribute to John O'Shea and his staff who have guided the team through recent friendly internationals preparing the team impeccably, creating a brilliant environment for the players and achieving positive results on the pitch.\"\n\nFAI Interim CEO David Courell added, \"This is a significant day for Irish football with the announcement of Heimir as our new head coach. There has been huge interest in this appointment which ultimately is testament to how much people care about Irish football.\n\n\"We are delighted to have secured a Head Coach with the experience we were seeking but more importantly one that shares our vision for Irish Football.\n\n\"Heimir was the outstanding candidate, and I am hugely excited at what he brings to the role.\"", "source": {"uri": "echolive.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "Echo Live"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_Association_of_Ireland", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Football Association of Ireland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iceland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iceland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iceland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heimir_Hallgr\u00edmsson", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Heimir Hallgr\u00edmsson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iceland_women's_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iceland women's national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_European_Under-17_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA European Under-17 Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lars_Lagerb\u00e4ck", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lars Lagerb\u00e4ck"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Arabi_SC_(Qatar)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Al-Arabi SC (Qatar)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Copa Am\u00e9rica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qatar", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Norway"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Norway"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Kenny_(football_manager)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Kenny (football manager)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup_qualification", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup qualification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Nations_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Nations League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghana_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ghana national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_O'Shea", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John O'Shea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FIFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhibition_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Exhibition game"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Non-FIFA_Nations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Non-FIFA Nations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.echolive.ie/cms_media/module_img/8397/4198855_1_seoimageog_GettyImages-2160002215_1_.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9721847", "eventUri": "eng-9721847", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-07", "textStart": 1057, "textEnd": 1068}], "sentiment": -0.1686274509803921, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

The 57-year-old, a qualified dentist, is best known for being joint-coach - with Lars Lagerb\u00e4ck - of the Iceland team that reached the Euro 2016 quarter-finals, most famously beating England in Nice on the way, and was most recently coach of Jamaica.\n\nHis predecessor, Stephen Kenny, was sacked in November after another Irish failure to qualify for a major tournament - their last such appearance was at Euro 2016. John O'Shea has been caretaker for Ireland's four friendlies since then, even pulling off a June win over Euro 2024 finalists Hungary before a 3-0 loss to Portugal ended that tenure.\n\nThe Football Association of Ireland's director of football, Marc Canham, and chief executive, Jonathan Hill, both English, were tasked with finding the new man, before Hill resigned in April, the same month the FAI had previously declared the new appointment would be made. Lee Carsley, the former Ireland international who coached England Under-21s to winning last year's Euros, was long viewed as the leading candidate but Canham, who led the process, could not tempt him.\n\nOther candidates, such as Gus Poyet, most recently Greece manager, Roy Keane and Neil Lennon had been linked, as was Georgia's Euro 2024 manager, Willy Sagnol, but the lengthy process eventually alighted on Hallgr\u00edmsson, whose Jamaica team competed at this summer's Copa Am\u00e9rica but exited after three group-stage defeats. He also led Iceland to the 2018 World Cup finals, resigning after a first-round exit from Russia.\n\n\"Ireland is rightly a proud footballing nation which has consistently produced talented players and enjoyed many memorable moments at major international tournaments,\" Hallgr\u00edmsson said. \"We have a young and exciting team that has genuine potential. I am looking forward to working closely with the players to help coach and guide them towards improved performances and results ensuring we qualify and compete at major tournaments on a regular basis.\"\n\nCanham said: \"We are thrilled to announce Heimir as our new head coach.\n\nEarlier this year, we identified Heimir as our number one candidate whose capabilities and experience aligned with our criteria. Not only does Heimir have significant experience at international level with two different countries, but crucially he also has a track record of qualifying for major international tournaments and taking teams up the Fifa world rankings.\"", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "john_brewin@theguardian.com", "name": "John

However, he became available in recent weeks after leaving his role with the nation after their recent Copa America exit.\n\nHallgr\u00edmsson first came to prominence during his time in charge of his native country, guiding them to the quarter-finals of Euro 2016 and a first ever World Cup berth in 2018.\n\nWhile this seems like a shrewd appointment, the FAI have come under some heavy criticism for the process that led them to this point.\n\nStephen Kenny was dismissed as manager back in November, meaning it is around eight months since a permanent boss was in place. As well as that, there were a number of false dawns in recent months, with promised deadlines not met and John O'Shea serving as interim manager for two international windows.\n\nIndeed, comments made by the new manager would lead to some questions about the FAI's efforts.\n\nREAD HERE: Report - Alan Browne Set To Seal Free Transfer To Championship Club\n\nThe FAI claimed to be close to appointments on a couple of occasions, most notably in March when they said that a new manager had been all but sealed, but could not be announced until early April due to 'existing contractual obligations'.\n\nHeimir Hallgr\u00edmsson would have been in charge of Jamaica during this period, although he also knew that he would be there until this summer's Copa America. That would suggest that he was not the candidate the FAI had in mind.\n\nIn his first interview as Ireland boss, he suggested that real contact was only made with him in the aftermath of Jamaica's Copa America exit on July 1st. He also summed up why the Ireland offer was an exciting one for him to take on.\n\nIt was some time back I heard (about Ireland interest).\n\nLike others that contacted, I told them I would be focused on the Copa America. We would decide after the Copa what we would do.\n\nIt was just an honour to be thought of as the next possible coach for the Republic...\n\nIt has been quite a hectic time since I stopped (with Jamaica). There have been a lot of things going on, but finally this is a done deal.\n\nI'm really happy to be here...\n\nIt's an exciting project. I think Ireland have underperformed a little in recent years.\n\nIt's a young and talented squad, but still with a lot of international experience. They have games under their belt.

What did it mean for his present but future too?\n\nThe dentist was happy to open up about it all. He looked forward to the Copa America and what it could mean on the road to the 2026 World Cup, when the same Toronto stadium would be one of the venues.\n\nEight months later Hallgr\u00edmsson is still focused on 2026 but, suddenly, as Ireland manager. If Wednesday's announcement, 231 days later, came as a bolt from the blue for most of a green persuasion, there are insights from watching Hallgr\u00edmsson up close in that two-legged Copa America playoff late last year. Across his Jamaica tenure, there are some pointers for where he may now take Ireland.\n\nInstitutionalised to the chaos\n\nIn the first 20 words of his post-match press conference, Hallgr\u00edmsson pointed to how important Copa qualification was, not for his team but for the national federation: \"The biggest thing is financial for the JFF, which doesn't have a lot of money.\" Hallgr\u00edmsson had worked small wonders in cash-strapped, institutionally chaotic surroundings. Abbotstown may not be Kingston but there could be loose similarities of circumstances nonetheless. The coach has shown he can thrive amid uncertainty.\n\nHallgr\u00edmsson and his staff had leaned heavily into a thorny topic, using the granny rule liberally to call up British-based players of Jamaican heritage.\n\nIn doing so, they trawled the lower half of the Championship and League One, his squads often featuring as many as 15 or 16 players from England's second and third tier. Ireland's talent pool occupies similar spaces and the FAI have signalled even more of a focus on identifying dual nationals.\n\nSubstance, style and spikiness\n\nHaving lost the first leg 2-1 while playing 4-3-3 in Kingston, Hallgr\u00edmsson switched to a 4-4-2 in Toronto with little joy, his side now 3-1 down on aggregate with 45 minutes of the tie to go.\n\nHe made a drastic change moving imposing defender Damion Lowe into central midfield. It was a masterstroke as his side scored three in 15 startling minutes. \"We don't have too many options in that [CM] position playing at a high level,\" admitted Hallgr\u00edmsson afterwards. He'll find similar issues in his new role. Perhaps giving Nathan Collins the Lowe treatment could change that.\n\nThe team had come in for strong criticism from the Jamaican press after the first leg. With his clear but stern deliveries Hallgr\u00edmsson wasn't afraid to throw it back to news crews in victory: \"I guess some of the media will still give the players some shit.\" He won't be backward in coming forward.\n\nAsked later how the win had changed things for him, Hallgr\u00edmsson replied: \"[Qualifying for the Copa] was always my plan so it doesn't change anything.\"", "source": {"uri": "irishexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Irish Examiner"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joe_callaghan@irishexaminer.com", "name": "Joe Callaghan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Copa Am\u00e9rica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Hodgson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Roy Hodgson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMO_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "BMO Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-legged_tie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Two-legged tie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nice", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nice"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nice"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EFL_League_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "EFL League One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EFL_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "EFL Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Formation (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingston,_Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kingston, Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kingston, Jamaica"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damion_Lowe", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Damion Lowe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_Association_of_Ireland", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Football Association of Ireland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Part-Time_Employment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Part-Time Employment", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.irishexaminer.com/cms_media/module_img/8398/4199128_2_articlelarge_GettyImages-2159416306_1_.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9721847", "eventUri": "eng-9721847", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

[It's] a young and talented squad but [there's] still a lot of international experience, so that is one thing. Secondly, I really like the administration, how they approached, their professionalism and how they treated me with respect, so that was another thing that really impressed me.'\n\nHallgr\u00edmsson was most recently in charge of the Jamaica national team and following their group stage exit from the Copa America, he stepped down from his role. He admitted he had heard from the FAI regarding their interest in him before that, but added he had made it clear that his focus would remain on the tournament.\n\n'It was some time back I heard [of the FAI's interest],' he explained. 'But I told them I would be focused on Copa America and we would decide after the Copa what we would do. It was an honour to be thought of as the next possible coach for the Republic.\n\n'There is a lot of similarities between the Irish and the Icelanders. The character is hardworking, honest people [who] enjoy life - normally when they have a drink or two they start to sing, both countries! I think the values are similar and I think we can do similar things on the pitch as well. It's going to be exciting - but of course it will take time.'\n\nWhen quizzed on his vision for the team's style of play, Hallgr\u00edmsson paid homage to interim manager O'Shea's willingness to mix it up and shift focus from a solely possession-based approach, noting that going \"back to basics\" was the best starting point.\n\nHe continued: 'What has been done in the past [under previous coaches] has been really helpful, learning from what they have been doing.. [Going] from a little bit more ball possession type football.. I thought John O'Shea took it a little bit back to more kind of basics, and we should always start from basics and build on from there.'\n\nThe 57-year-old described his new post as a \"unique\" position as he heaped more praise on the match-going Irish public.\n\n'This is unique, really, really unique,' he said. 'I think the Irish are hardworking but they're also proud people, proud of their heritage and who they are.\n\n'You can always build a lot around hardworking people and proud people. If you can implement some other aspects then the team should represent those characteristics on the pitch.

The appointment of Hallgr\u00edmsson will not assuage the growing number of people in Irish life who agree with the former Chelsea winger.\n\nBut the Icelander ticks Canham's many boxes. Genuine international experience, check. On-the-grass-coach, check.\n\nHallgr\u00edmsson is charismatic enough to hold a room of players, media, even fans, and clearly the 57-year-old is a decent operator. His club record in Iceland and Qatar is average at best, as his teams conceded more than they scored, but what Iceland achieved when he was co-manager at Euro 2016 and the lone gaffer at the 2018 World Cup are almost beyond comprehension.\n\nThe Second Captain's jingle about \"Sigth\u00f3rsson's\" goal to knock England out of that Euros, and launch their greatest ever major tournament revival under Gareth Southgate, should get an airing this week. As will the 1-1 draw with Argentina in Moscow when Lionel Messi was unable to beat Hannes Halldorsson.\n\nOf greater relevance, as Jamaica manager until earlier this month, his team won 10, lost 10 while scoring and conceding 37 goals.\n\nNonetheless, the FAI have their man, and if their press release is to be believed, Hallgr\u00edmsson was Canham's first choice all along. Not Lee Carsley. Not Roy Keane. Not Willy Sagnol, Gus Poyet, Chris Hughton, Duff, and especially not interim manager John O'Shea.\n\n\"Earlier this year, we identified Heimir as our number one candidate whose capabilities and experience aligned with our criteria,\" said Canham.\n\nEarlier than March 4th, when he stated that \"existing contractual obligations\" had slowed the appointment until \"early April\"?\n\nJamaica qualified for the Copa America way back in November 2023.\n\nDespite allegations of inappropriate behaviour by male coaches towards Irish female footballers in the 1990s and a previous intent not to overshadow the current women's team before they play England on Friday in a Euro 2025 qualifier, there was a celebratory tone as the FAI executives lined up to provide snap quotes.\n\n\"This is a significant day for Irish football,\" said David Courell, the interim chief executive. \"A tremendous appointment for the association,\" said Tony Keohane, chairperson of the board.\n\nBut it was Paul Cooke, the current FAI president, who provided some fresh information: \"I would like to thank my fellow members of the recruitment panel, David Courell, Aoife Rafferty, Packie Bonner and in particular our Director of Football Marc Canham who collectively ran a very thorough and confidential process which was respectful of the candidates involved and which identified and secured the standout candidate.\"\n\nThis suggests all is well in Irish football again. In reality, the climate Hallgr\u00edmsson arrives into has Duff expressing a desire to \"raze Abbotstown to the ground\" and \"sack 90 per cent of the workforce.\"\n\n\"Success is not a destination,\" Hallgr\u00edmsson told the New York Times in 2018. \"It's a continuous journey. That's the only way you can think when you're an underdog.\"\n\nThe dentist turned gaffer is about to discover the 20-year facilities drive that allowed Iceland to build a football industry is currently in year-minus-one on the neighbouring Atlantic island.

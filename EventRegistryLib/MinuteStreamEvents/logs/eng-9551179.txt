Andy Ogles of Tennessee indicated that a bill he filed Wednesday is aimed at pro-Hamas students who have participated in this spring's spate of anti-Israel protests, according to the Daily Caller.\n\nThe bill would revoke the visa of a student \"arrested for rioting or unlawful protest,\" or who authorities have \"arrested while establishing, participating in, or promoting an encampment\" at a college.\n\nIt would also mandate six months of \"community service\" in Gaza.\n\n\"These antisemitic, anti-America riots have wreaked havoc and chaos on campuses, leading to the cancellation of commencements and in-person classes. It is unacceptable that we would allow non-Americans to terrorize our institutions of higher learning,\" he said.\n\n\"It's time to send a clear message to foreign, Hamas-sympathizing students rioting: if you bring chaos to our universities, you can study abroad somewhere else. Might I recommend Iran, Qatar, or Gaza? They seem more your speed,\" he added.\n\nOgles said those who are allowed into America to study have an obligation to respect the nation giving them an unparalleled education.\n\n\"The ability to receive higher education in the United States is truly a privilege. Previously known for their prestige and unparalleled academics, many elite American universities have damaged their hard-earned reputations by opening their doors to impressionable terrorist sympathizers,\" he said.\n\n\"In the last several weeks, our nation has seen these institutions overrun and terrorized by young people calling for a third intifada,\" Ogles said.\n\nRepublican Rep. Jeff Duncan of South Carolina, who co-sponsored the bill, said supporting Hamas should be an automatic ticket out of the country for foreign students.\n\n\"If you come to America on a student visa and support a terrorist organization like Hamas, then you are in violation of your visa,\" he told the Daily Caller. \"We do not need Hamas sympathizers on American soil breaking our laws and influencing our youth to hate America and freedom. You riot on behalf of a terrorist organization, then say goodbye to your visa.\"\n\n\"Students have abandoned their classes to harass other students and disrupt campus-wide activities, including university commencement ceremonies nationwide. Enough is enough,\" Ogles said, according to Fox News.\n\n\"That's why I introduced legislation to send any person convicted of unlawful activity on the campus of an American university since October 7th, 2023, to Gaza to complete a minimum of six months of community service,\" he said.\n\nRep. Randy Weber of Texas, who co-sponsored the bill, said those who hate America deserve to live with others of the same ilk.\n\n\"If you support a terrorist organization, and you participate in unlawful activity on campuses, you should get a taste of your own medicine. I am going to bet that these pro-Hamas supporters wouldn't last a day, but let's give them the opportunity,\" he said.\n\nHomeland Security Investigations, a part of the Department of Homeland Security, has said that under current rules, a suspension could trigger a chain of events that could theoretically lead to deportation, according to Fox News.\n\n\"A temporary suspension, even if that were a final determination for a student, does not necessarily mean that the student would fall below 'normal progress' in his/her course of study,\" a DHS representative said.\n\nThe representative indicated that the impact of the suspension on a student's progress is the deciding factor.\n\n\"If a student were to be suspended, DHS would need reason to believe that the student would not be able to make normal progress in his/her course of study,\" the representative said, noting each case is reviewed and that even if a student's visa is revoked, it would likely lead to a ban on future entry, and not deportation.", "source": {"uri": "westernjournal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Western Journal"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jack_davis@westernjournal.com", "name": "Jack Davis", "type":

The bill would revoke the visa of any immigrant, legal or illegal, who participates in pro-Hamas protests.\n\nRep. Andy Ogles (R-TN) introduced the legislation on Wednesday according to an exclusive report from The Daily Caller.\n\nThe Daily Caller first obtained a copy of the legislation, which is titled the Study Abroad Act. The bill would specifically \"revoke the F, J, or M visa\" of any illegal immigrant who authorities have \"arrested for rioting or unlawful protest,\" or who authorities have \"arrested while establishing, participating in, or promoting an encampment\" at an institute of higher education.\n\n\"The ability to receive higher education in the United States is truly a privilege. Previously known for their prestige and unparalleled academics, many elite American universities have damaged their hard-earned reputations by opening their doors to impressionable terrorist sympathizers. In the last several weeks, our nation has seen these institutions overrun and terrorized by young people calling for a third intifada,\" Ogles told the Caller before introducing the bill.\n\n\"These antisemitic, anti-America riots have wreaked havoc and chaos on campuses, leading to the cancellation of commencements and in-person classes. It is unacceptable that we would allow non-Americans to terrorize our institutions of higher learning. It's time to send a clear message to foreign, Hamas-sympathizing students rioting: if you bring chaos to our universities, you can study abroad somewhere else. Might I recommend Iran, Qatar, or Gaza? They seem more your speed,\" he added.\n\nRep. Randy Weber (R-TX), who co-sponsored the legislation, told The Daily Caller, \"If you hate America so much, you should get the first ticket back to your country and attend college there.\"\n\nThe bill comes amid numerous reports of anti-Israel protests, including activists advocating for similar goals as Hamas. Many of these demonstrations have devolved into violence and threats, prompting responses from law enforcement.\n\nIt was recently revealed that many of those participating in the demonstrations, which are at least partly funded by groups connected to George Soros, have received training from various hard leftist groups whose members have taught them various tactics while they are on college campuses or out in the streets.\n\nThe tactics used by protesters are not anything they have come up with on their own. They have consulted with left-wing radical groups like National Students for Justice in Palestine (NSJP) and Samidoun: Palestinian Prisoner Solidarity Network. The meetings have resulted in months of planning, training, and encouragement. So what sort of \"training\" did these would-be revolutionaries receive? Aspiring protesters at Columbia University attended a \"teach-in\" led by two former members of the Black Panthers. The topics included how to handle any internal disputes within the movement, likely to keep everyone focused on the ultimate goal. The former Black Panthers also discussed some similarities between gentrification that occurred in Harlem and the Israel-Palestine conflict, a potential tactic designed to make black students feel a connection with the plight of Palestinians and thus keep on board with the protests.\n\nGiven the makeup of the Senate, it is unlikely that such a bill would pass. The Democrats who dominate the upper chamber would never allow for it. However, if some of these students feel that they would be more comfortable in an America-hating school, an Iranian university, as well as one run by the Houthis, indicated they would be happy to receive them.", "source": {"uri": "redstate.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Redstate"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jeff_charles@redstate.com", "name": "Jeff Charles", "type": "author", "isAgency":

Andy Ogles desperately wants to punish protesting students.\n\nA group of Republican lawmakers introduced a bill on Wednesday which would send \"any person convicted of unlawful activity\" at a college or university, to do community service in Gaza for six months.\n\nThe bill, dubbed the \"Antisemitism Community Service Act,\" was introduced by Rep. Andy Ogles (R-TN), and backed by Representatives Jeff Dunch (R-SC) and Randy Weber (R-TX), as part of two bills which take aim at college students.\n\nThe bill seeks to punish students opposing the U.S.-backed genocide, by sending them to the very place where Israel has used U.S. funds and weapons to kill over 34,700 people, obliterating homes, and displacing millions of Palestinians.\n\nStrangely, the bill appears to refer to any \"unlawful activity on the campus of an institution of higher education beginning on and after October 7, 2023\" but does not specifically mention the ongoing student protests, rendering it stupidly broad.\n\nOgles spoke with Fox News about the bill, saying that, \"If you support a terrorist organization, and you participate in unlawful activity on campuses, you should get a taste of your own medicine.

Andy Ogles (R-Tenn.) introduced a bill in the U.S. House of Representatives yesterday that would require any person \"convicted of unlawful activity\" on a college campus after Oct. 7, 2023, to do community service in Gaza. On Oct. 7, Hamas, a Palestinian militant group, attacked Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking 240 hostages.\n\nOgles also introduced a bill that would revoke the student visa of college protestors who aren't American citizens.\n\nThe Tennessee politician has been vocally opposed to pro-Palestinian protests and protest encampments on college campuses. The protests at schools across the country were in support of a ceasefire in the Israeli-Hamas war and Palestinian liberation. Since Oct. 7, over 34,000 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli offensives.\n\nOgles sees the protests differently, though.\n\n\"These riots aren't about Gaza; they're about rejecting Western civilization and American principles,\" Ogles tweeted yesterday in response to the D.C. student protestors projecting the message \"Gaza lights the spark that will set the empire ablaze\" onto an American flag hanging at George Washington University (GWU).\n\nAfter assembling a protest encampment at GWU two weeks ago, D.C. college students were raided by D.C. Metro police yesterday and the encampment was shut down. Thirty-three students were arrested.\n\nAt similar encampments across the country, thousands of students have been arrested over the last two weeks by local authorities.\n\nOgles' bill \"to require a person convicted of unlawful activity on the campus of an institution of higher education beginning on or after October 7, 2023, to provide community service in Gaza\" is also known as the Antisemitism Community Service Act.\n\nSome college protestors have made anti-Semitic remarks, though the protests have generally aligned themselves as anti-Zionist, or in opposition to Israel and its siege on Gaza.\n\nThe proposed legislation would send offenders to Gaza for no less than six months. Gaza is facing severe famine and almost 2 million Palestinians have been displaced since October 7.\n\nAnd though thousands of students were arrested as a result of college protests, the bill -- if passed by Congress and signed by the president -- would only affect those convicted of crimes, meaning students that were arrested, charged, tried in a court of law, and found guilty of crimes.\n\nRep. Randy Weber (R-Tex.) and Jeff Duncan (R-S.C.) are co-sponsors on the bill. Weber tweeted yesterday that he was proud to introduce the legislation.\n\n\"I am going to bet that these pro-Hamas supporters wouldn't last a day,\" Weber said. \"But let's give them the opportunity.\"\n\nOgles also introduced the \"Study Abroad Act\" yesterday, which would revoke student or exchange visitor visas from student protestors who are not American citizens.\n\n\"If you're a student visa holder rioting AGAINST American values and FOR Hamas terrorists,\" Ogles tweeted, \"you can go study abroad in Gaza.\"\n\nDespite the attempts, the sensational bill is almost certainly to fail.\n\n\"Dude, have some self-respect,\" derided someone else.", "source": {"uri": "dailydot.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Dot"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tricia_crimmins@dailydot.com",

That cohort is behind the newly introduced Antisemitism Community Service Act, which seeks to follow suit with the recent trend of proposed legislation made by the House Of Representatives to exploit the antisemitic hysteria arising from protests across college campuses nationwide to deprive American citizens of their constitutional rights. Under the proposal, anyone arrested and convicted of unlawful activity on the campus of an institution of higher education would be required to perform at least 6 months of community service in the Gaza Strip.\n\nCurrently, the way the bill has been written makes no distinction between what unlawful activity would constitute such a punitive measure. However, given that it is in its infancy, it seems clear that future drafts of the proposed legislation seek to apply the penalty to protesters who have been charged with crimes in relation to protests against Israel. However, the bill refers to any conviction following October 7th, 2023 which would mean crimes committed before the onset of these widespread protests would qualify under the potential law.\n\nOgles, the bill's author, took to Fox News to discuss his proposed legislation. \"If you support a terrorist organization, and you participate in unlawful activity on campuses, you should get a taste of your own medicine. I am going to bet that these pro-Hamas supporters wouldn't last a day, but let's give them the opportunity.\" he said. This isn't the first time that Ogles has made controversial headlines regarding his position on Israel's war in Gaza. In February, the Representative of Tennessee's 5th Congressional District was confronted regarding his unconditional support for Israel in the wake of growing concern over the toll of civilian casualties in Gaza.\n\nWhen asked about his concern for the Palestinian civilians killed in the conflict Ogles remarked \"You know what? So, I think we should kill 'em all, if that makes you feel better,\" Before qualifying his position in the heat of the moment to by clarifying his remarks were meant to refer to \"Everybody in Hamas.\" However, Ogles continued on in his exchange with broader comments that convey his sentiments extended to beyond members of Hamas by stating \"Hamas and the Palestinians have been attacking Israel for 20 years. And It's time to pay the piper,\" before ending his exchange declaring \"Death to Hamas!\"\n\nAlthough those remarks were subsequently debated with Ogles defending himself be reiterating his calls to \"kill 'em all\" only referred to Hamas, his proposal to send criminals convicted with so much as misdemeanors into a war zone is another episode of his overzealous subservience to Israel's cause. Given that Ogles has received just $12,000 from the pro-Israel lobby, it appears it didn't cost it too much to curry his favor.\n\nIn addition to the Antisemitism Community Service Act, Ogles also introduced the Study Abroad Act which aims to cancel the visas of students studying abroad in the US if they're merely arrested for \"unlawful protests\" meaning the penalty they face would not require a criminal conviction under the parameters of the present draft of the bill. House GOP Representatives Randy Weber of Texas and Jeff Duncan of South Carolina joined Ogles in co-sponsoring this proposed legislation as well. Ogles again defended his proposed legislation stating \"My message is clear: if you're a student visa holder rioting AGAINST American values and FOR Hamas terrorists, you can go study abroad in Gaza.\" At the time of Ogle's comments, the IDF has bombed the Islamic University of Gaza, al-Azhar University, al-Israa University, Gaza International College, and al-Quds Open University since the onset of the war.\n\nWhat makes potential laws like Ogles' Antisemitism Community Service Act so problematic is that they lack any nuance is examining the complexities of the issue behind the protests they seek to address. For instance, over 108 demonstrators were arrested at Northeastern University in Boston weeks ago after one yelled \"Kill all Jews!\" It was only after those arrests that it was determined the demonstrator who shouted that call to violence was actually a pro-Israel counter protester whose message was designed to agitate his opposition. As such, questions arise as to whether the penalties set forth under Ogles' bill would qualify to pro-Israel demonstrators like the example of the one at Northeastern. If not, as one would imagine Ogles would have it, the proposed legislation demonstrates the selective application of policing speech.\n\nGiven the constitutional issues that literally shipping non-violent criminals overseas into a war zone represents, in particular the Eighth Amendment which protests citizens against cruel and unusual punishment, it is hard to envisage that it will become the law of the land. Regardless, it adds to significant concerns that the war in Gaza has become a political vehicle to violate Americans constitutional rights as recently evidenced by the Antisemitism Awareness Act. This is nothing new in American history. It isn't even particularly new to recent history given the similarities behind the political climate cultivated to pass laws like the PATRIOT Act in the early part of the century. These examples show that it isn't just Israelis or Palestinians who come under attack if congress is handed a blank check to respond to geopolitical crises like these that they have help foment to begin with but American citizens whose constitutional rights seem to matter less to elected officials than their donors with ties to foreign governments.", "source": {"uri": "zerohedge.com",

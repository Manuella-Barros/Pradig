(Atlanta News First) - More than a dozen people were arrested on Emory University's campus Thursday morning as multiple groups gathered to protest the Israel-Hamas war and Atlanta Public Safety Training Center.\n\nNews crews saw at least 15 people detained as protesters clashed with police and Georgia State Patrol.\n\nAccording to organizers, protesters were demanding \"total divestment from Israeli apartheid and Cop City.\" \"Defend the Atlanta Forest\" posted on X that the protesters at Emory University are part of the Gaza Solidarity/Stop Cop City Encampment.\n\nThose arrested appear to be students, non-students and professors. Some protesters are seen holding \"Stop Cop City\" signs, while other areas show items laid out on the lawn that resemble bloody bodies in reference to the ongoing war.\n\nIn a statement, Emory University said several dozen protesters trespassed onto the private school's campus early Thursday morning and set up tents in the Quad. The school's police department told the group to leave and called Atlanta police and state patrol for help.\n\n\"These individuals are not members of our community. They are activists attempting to disrupt our university as our students finish classes and prepare for finals,\" the statement continues. \"Emory does not tolerate vandalism or other criminal activity on campus.\"\n\nOne Emory Ph.D. student said the arrests make him feel sad -- not just for the university, but for the state of the country.\n\n\"What the hell is this?

They are activists attempting to disrupt our university as our students finish classes and prepare for finals,\" the statement continues. \"Emory does not tolerate vandalism or other criminal activity on campus.\"\n\nThose arrested appear to be students, non-students and professors. Some protesters are seen holding \"Stop Cop City\" signs, while other areas show items laid out on the lawn that resemble bloody bodies in reference to the ongoing war.\n\nGerald Griggs, the Georgia NAACP president, posted on X that he's requesting a meeting with Emory President Gregory Fenves \"to discuss the events on the campus as soon as possible.\"\n\nEmory joins the ranks of several universities whose campuses have become the site of heated demonstrations and protests surrounding Israel and Palestine. The movement swept through the nation after more than 100 people were arrested at Columbia University in New York last Thursday.\n\nIn Georgia, Kennesaw State University students held a rally and walkout Thursday morning on campus in support of Palestine. Student protesters at Georgia Tech also gathered Wednesday night to call on their school to do more for Palestinians.\n\nThe protests came days after some Morehouse College students, faculty and alumni voiced their concern about President Joe Biden speaking at the school's graduation commencement next month, arguing he hasn't done enough to end the war.", "source": {"uri":

The lawn of the university's Decatur campus was occupied with dozens of people with signs and tents.\n\nMondoweiss.net said that the protest was in support of Palestine's people and against the Atlanta Public Safety Training Center. The protesters included a group of students from across several Atlanta universities, it has been reported.\n\nThe demonstrators organised the protest against Cop City - a name they have given to the training centre. The protesters reportedly said they are \"demanding total institutional divestment from Israeli apartheid and Cop City at all Atlanta colleges and universities.\"\n\n\"We are occupying Emory, not because it is the only institution that is complicit in genocide and police militarization, but because its ties are some of the strongest. Emory University, the Atlanta University Center Consortium, Georgia State University, and Georgia Tech have all intimidated and repressed students and employees who spoke out in support of Palestinians. These institutions have all refused to divest from Cop City and the Zionist occupation,\" the protesters said.\n\nA video shared on X appears to show Georgia police officers firing rubber bullets into a crowd at Emory University. It is unclear how many people have been arrested in Atlanta. Across the US, however, 400 protesters from various universities have been taken into custody.\n\n\"The fight against Cop City and for Palestinian liberation are both frontiers in the same struggle against the mechanisms of state-sanctioned violence and repression,\" the Atlanta protesters said.\n\n\"As residents of Atlanta and participants in this global community, our challenge is to recognize these connections and mobilize. This involves not only resisting specific projects like Cop City but also advocating for a transformation in how our institutions -- be they educational, political, or social -- invest in community safety and our humanity,\" they added.\n\nAmong other arrests that have been reported, at least 108 protesters at Emerson College have been arrested by the Boston police. As many as 93 people refusing to disperse from the University of Southern California campus were arrested by the Los Angeles police. 57 people were reportedly arrested by police in riot gear at the University of Texas in Austin. Columbia University and NYU have long been making headlines for the demonstrations and subsequent arrests.

They are activists attempting to disrupt our university as our students finish classes and prepare for finals.\"\n\nVideos posted online late Thursday morning appeared to show police officers and state troopers clashing with protesters as some people were taken into custody. Atlanta police officers carrying rifles and zip ties could be seen walking through the makeshift encampment as some demonstrators were led away with their hands behind their backs.\n\nAn Atlanta police spokeswoman confirmed officers were sent to the campus at the university's request. She would not say how many arrests had been made, referring all questions to Emory officials. Georgia State Patrol troopers were at the scene assisting Atlanta police, a GSP spokesperson said.\n\nMeanwhile, some Emory employees reported that they were instructed to remain inside their offices. The university sent an alert to students and faculty to avoid the quad.\n\nActivists started gathering around 7:30 a.m., according to organizers. They are demanding a \"total divestment from Israeli apartheid\" and the training center, they posted on social media.\n\nOne speaker referenced an Emory professor and doctor who was placed on leave after making \"antisemitic comments.\" The university later confirmed the Palestinian-American doctor was no longer employed by the university or its hospital system but did not confirm if she was fired or resigned.\n\nSeveral Georgia colleges and universities, including Emory, have already held rallies and demonstrations since the war began Oct. 7 with Hamas' attack on Israel that killed an estimated 1,200 Israelis and foreigners. More than 34,000 Palestinians have been killed during the conflict, according to health officials, at least two-thirds of them women and children.\n\nThere are believed to be about 130 Israeli hostages still held in Gaza, of the roughly 240 initially taken by Hamas, according to CBS News. On Wednesday, Hamas released a video appearing to show one of its Israeli hostages delivering an address in captivity. In the video, a man identifies himself as Israeli-American Hersh Goldberg-Polin before delivering a statement. A U.S. official noted it was the first time Hamas has publicly released a video of a U.S. citizen hostage.\n\n-------\n\n(Staff writer Cassidy Alexander contributed to this article.)\n\n-------",

A spokesperson for the APD confirmed to NPR that it is \"providing support and assistance at the request of the Emory Police Department.\"\n\nSocial media posts, including from the Emory Wheel, and local media reports show law enforcement officers using handcuffs, tasers, tear gas and pepper balls on individuals in the crowd. Witnesses reported seeing people detained and loaded into police vans.\n\nNearly 100 undergraduate and graduate students at Princeton attended a sit-in in a campus courtyard on Thursday morning, with some setting up tents despite the university's warnings.\n\nProtesters called on the university to -- among other demands -- divest from companies that profit from or engage in Israel's war effort and refrain from associating with Israeli academic institutions and businesses, according to the Daily Princetonian.\n\nPrinceton President Christopher Eisgruber had warned the previous day in an op-ed that the school's free expression policy includes a \"clear and explicit prohibition upon encampments.\"\n\nAnd Vice President for Campus Life Rochelle Calhoun wrote in an email to undergraduates the same day that any student participating in an \"encampment, occupation, or other unlawful disruptive conduct who refuses to stop after a warning will be arrested and immediately barred from campus.\"\n\nA Princeton spokesperson told NPR that a \"small number\" of participants began erecting \"about a half-dozen tents.\"\n\n\"After repeated warnings from the Department of Public Safety to cease the activity and leave the area, two graduate students were arrested for trespassing,\" the spokesperson said, adding that the students have been barred from campus pending a disciplinary process.\n\nProtesters voluntarily took down the remaining tents, the spokesperson added.\n\nBoston police tore down a pro-Palestinian encampment at Emerson College in the early morning hours, clashing with protesters and ultimately taking more than 100 into custody.\n\nEmerson College students had been camping since Sunday night in Boston's Boylston Place Alley.\n\nPresident Jay Bernhardt warned earlier this week that the alley is not solely owned by the college and has a \"public right-of-way requirement to access non-Emerson buildings, including the State Transportation Center, and is a fire alley that is under the jurisdiction of the Boston Police Department.\"\n\nIn a Wednesday update, college officials said fire and police commissioners had informed them that some of the protesters' actions amounted to noise violations and fire hazards \"in direct violation of city ordinances, which could result in imminent law enforcement action.\"\n\nThey said Emerson had also received \"credible reports that some protesters are engaging in targeted harassment and intimidation of Jewish supporters of Israel and students, staff, faculty, and neighbors seeking to pass through the alley.\"\n\nLocal media report that police announced just after 1 a.m. Thursday that anyone in the alley would be arrested; officers entered the area about an hour later. Footage posted to social media shows protesters linking arms and raising umbrellas to try to form a wall against police, who start grabbing and pulling them out of the crowd.\n\n\"The big vans, they came in, they parked right in front of this alleyway and the cops came up and they started arresting students, forcing their way into the encampment and everything, pushing students to the ground,\" Emerson sophomore Kyle Graff told NBC Boston. \"I saw one student get shoved into the pavement and their hands forced to be put behind them.\"\n\nNBC Boston reports that police cleared the alley within 30 minutes.\n\nBoston Police Department spokesperson Sgt. John Boyle told local media that 108 people were arrested and are expected to be arraigned in Boston Municipal Court. He said four police officers were injured, one seriously.\n\nSeveral other Boston-area schools, including MIT and Tufts, have set up similar encampments. Harvard students set up tents in Harvard Yard -- which is temporarily closed to the public -- on Wednesday.\n\n\"There is significant activity at the center of the UPC campus due to a demonstration. There may be difficulty accessing that area,\" USC posted to X late Wednesday morning.\n\nIn subsequent updates, the school told people to avoid the center of campus, referred to as University Park Campus (UPC), and that if they were to come to that area, they would need to show their student IDs at the gates.\n\nThe UPC area was closed down later in the evening. The Los Angeles Police Department said it showed up at about 4 p.m. Pacific Time, and had arrested 93 people by 10 p.m. for trespassing, a misdemeanor offense. One arrest was made for assault with a deadly weapon, though the department did not specify the weapon that was used.\n\nNo injuries were reported, and LAPD will continue patrolling the area into Thursday, it said.\n\n\"The university is a private campus, and the group had been violating some of their orders, and it was a trespass at that point, and we assisted with those arrests,\" LAPD Cpt. Kelly Muniz said.\n\nThe protests follow the school's decision last week to cancel the commencement speech for valedictorian Asna Tabassum, who posted pro-Palestinian and anti-Israel content on her social media. The school said it scrapped the speech for safety reasons.\n\nAt The University of Texas at Austin, hundreds of people protested in support of Palestinians. University officers and Texas state troopers responded to the scene in riot gear, and arrested dozens of students who did not leave the area, according to NPR member station KUT.\n\n\"Arrests being made right now & will continue until the crowd disperses,\" Texas Gov. Greg Abbott posted on X. \"These protesters belong in jail. Antisemitism will not be tolerated in Texas. Period. Students joining in hate-filled, antisemitic protests at any public college or university in Texas should be expelled.\"\n\nUT Austin President Jay Hartzell commended the school and law enforcement for showing \"extraordinary restraint,\" and said the organizers of the protest intended to violate school policies.\n\n\"The group that led this protest stated it was going to violate Institutional Rules,\" Hartzell said. \"Our rules matter, and they will be enforced. Our University will not be occupied. The protesters tried to deliver on their stated intent to occupy campus. People not affiliated with UT joined them, and many ignored University officials' continual pleas for restraint and to immediately disperse.\"\n\nStudents at Cornell University and George Washington University set up solidarity encampments on Thursday morning, the latest in a fast-growing list of such campus demonstrations.\n\nFor weeks, students at major colleges and universities across the country -- including Yale, Vanderbilt, the University of Pennsylvania, University of Michigan, New York University and Columbia University -- have been protesting in support of Palestinians and have faced repercussions, such as arrests and expulsions.\n\nColumbia University has twice extended its deadline -- originally midnight on Tuesday -- for students to clear their campus encampment.\n\nOfficials first delayed the deadline until Wednesday morning, and said later in the day that they would continue conversations for another 48 hours in light of \"constructive dialogue\" with student representatives.\n\nThey said student protesters had committed to removing \"a significant number of tents,\" clearing non-Columbia protesters from the area, complying with fire department requirements and prohibiting harassing and discriminatory language.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson visited Columbia on Wednesday and called on President Nemat Shafik to resign.\n\n\"I'm here joining my colleagues and calling on President Shafik to resign if she cannot immediately bring order to this chaos,\" he said during a press conference on campus, in which he was joined by other members of Congress. \"As Speaker of the House, I'm committing today that the Congress will not be silent as Jewish students are expected to run for their lives and stay home from their classes hiding in fear.\"\n\nColumbia's board of trustees said it \"strongly supports President Shafik as she steers the university through this extraordinarily challenging time.\"", "source": {"uri": "kpbs.org",

Other students were seen being led away in handcuffs.\n\nThe Emory protesters were protesting the Israel-Hamas war, but also the construction of a police training facility at an abandoned Atlanta prison, dubbed \"Cop City\" by opponents.\n\nIn an article the Emory protesters published online, the protesters wrote they were \"demanding total institutional divestment from Israeli apartheid and Cop City at all Atlanta colleges and universities.\"\n\nOn Thursday morning, several dozen people set up camp on the university's lawn with tents and signs.\n\nPresident Gregory Fenves said many of those initial protesters were outsiders.\n\n\"Early this morning, several dozen protesters entered our Atlanta campus and set up an encampment on the Quad,\" Fenves said in an email to the school community.\n\n\"These individuals are largely not affiliated with Emory and were disrupting the university as our students finish classes and prepare for finals. This is completely unacceptable. In response to this encampment, the Emory Police Department notified these individuals that they were trespassing. When they refused to leave, law enforcement cleared the Quad,\" Fenves said.\n\nEmory police Commander Thomas Mann agreed, saying some of the protesters were not affiliated with the university.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE DAILYWIRE+ APP\n\n\"The ones that were arrested, there wasn't anything peaceful about what was going on,\" the police commander told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.\n\nSome of those arrested will be charged with criminal trespass and assaulting police officers, he said.\n\nRowdy protests have also broken out over the last week at other universities across the country.\n\nIn New York City, demonstrations erupted at Columbia, Harvard, and New York University, where 133 protesters were arrested. In the Boston area, students protested at both Harvard and Northeastern University. Another Ivy League school, Brown University in Rhode Island, saw protests as well. Yale University in Connecticut saw more than 40 protesters arrested.\n\nIn Texas, the University of Texas at Austin saw students demonstrate as police struggled to control the crowd, at one point knocking over a man holding a large camera.\n\nIn California, students protested at University of Southern California where 93 people were arrested.", "source": {"uri": "dailywire.com", "dataType":

Jayson Tatum and Al Horford, who were key to the Celtics\u2019 Game 1 win over the Mavericks, believe Kidd was trying to put a wedge in between the team\u2019s stars. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Tatum said he had \"no reaction\" to Kidd\u2019s remarks but knew what he was trying to do. \"This is a team sport. We understand that. We wouldn\u2019t be here if we didn\u2019t have JB (Jaylen Brown) on our team.\" Tatum said. \"We could say that for a lot of guys. We all play a part to get to where we\u2019re at. We understand that people try to drive a wedge in between us. It\u2019s a smart thing to do, or try to do. \"But we\u2019ve been in this position for many years \u2013 guys trying to divide us, say that one of us should be traded, one\u2019s better than the other. It\u2019s not our first time at the rodeo.\" 2024 NBA PLAYOFF BRACKET: UPDATED SCHEDULE, SCORES, STANDINGS Horford said Kidd was \"sneaky.\" \"J-Kidd, man,\" Horford said smiling. \"I see what he\u2019s doing.

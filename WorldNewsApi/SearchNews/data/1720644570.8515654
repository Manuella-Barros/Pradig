{"id": 231229984, "title": "Craig Gordon breaks Scotland silence on Euro 2024 heartbreak as Hearts keeper reveals four goals set after horror injury", "text": "Craig Gordon has spoken out on being axed from the Scotland squad for Euro 2024. The veteran Hearts keeper won't be going to Germany after Steve Clarke opted to take Angus Gunn, Gordon's Tynecastle teammate Zander Clark and Liam Kelly as his three goalkeepers. Gordon was named on the bench for Friday night's 2-2 draw with Finland as Clarke and his squad were given a big Hampden send off before jetting out to Germany on Sunday. Gordon was brought on to a great reception from the Tartan Army, becoming Scotland's oldest ever player in the process at the age of 41. And while he produced a top reaction save to keep the score at 2-0 after Lawrence Shankland had put the hosts 2-0 up, he was beaten by a Benjamin Kallman header before conceding a harsh late penalty that allowed Oliver Antman to equalise. And while Gordon can't deny his devastation at not being on the plane, he attempted to put things in perspective a little over 18 months after suffering a horror double leg break. He revealed the four goals he set himself after that injury and confirmed he remains available for his country should they still need him. He posted on Instagram: \"When I was in the initial stages of my recovery I set myself four goals. The first was to be out of pain. The seriousness of the break made for complications and further procedures. I went through a lot of pain and wanted to be able to live life without it. I did that. \"The second thing I wanted to achieve was to be back on my feet and able to run around the garden and play football with my children. We\u2019ve done that. Many, many times and they won\u2019t let me stop now. \"The third goal I had was to play for Hearts again. This meant a lot to me. I did that competitively in January, having played my first friendly in November, 10 months after I broke my leg. It was a long wait, but I was ready to play the rest of the season. \"The last thing I hoped to do was to make the Scotland squad again. And to put myself in a position to be at the Euros. Coming into the provisional squad I knew I hadn\u2019t got the games I needed so I trained harder, I trained well and felt, and still feel, very good. I am of course, so disappointed not to be there. \"Playing again for Scotland last night meant I did what I set out to do. And while it wasn\u2019t in the way I wanted, I could never turn down the opportunity to play at Hampden again. Something I have had the honour of doing for over 20 years. The circumstances were tough, it was an extremely emotional night for my family and I. But I\u2019m grateful I got that opportunity. To become the oldest player to play for Scotland, it\u2019s a special record. \"Given how long I\u2019ve been doing this, I\u2019ve experienced so much and I, probably more than others, know all too well, that things don\u2019t always go your way. Decisions go against you. Last night, of all nights, I wished they didn\u2019t but if a nervous 21 year old could have seen that so many years on, through some big challenges, I\u2019d be there at 41 years old, I think I\u2019d be very happy with that. \"I should have been given a smaller shirt on my debut(!), but I knew that if I played for the badge on the front, people would remember the name on the back. I hope I\u2019ve done that, and will continue to do so for as long as I feel good enough. 75 caps. Thank you.\"", "summary": "The veteran keeper became Scotland's oldest ever player against Finland but won't be going to Germany.", "url": "https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/craig-gordon-breaks-scotland-silence-32988459", "image": "https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article32988463.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_JS335760347.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 12:47:55", "author": "Ross Pilcher", "authors": ["Ross Pilcher"], "language": "en", "catgory": "entertainment", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.02}

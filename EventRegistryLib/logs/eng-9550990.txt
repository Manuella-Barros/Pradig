On Wednesday, the group said that if their lengthy list of demands, which included better food options and work permits, is met, they will voluntarily leave their tents and go to city-funded shelters. Denver Human Services has tried to persuade the migrants to get off the streets, and according to city officials, even with the demands, that offer still remains for those who leave.\n\nV Reeves (pictured), a migrant advocate, told KDVR, 'The camp as a collective came up with a list of demands.' The list, which has circulated on social media, was created after the city started to move migrants from encampments under train tracks and into shelters early Wednesday. 'This morning, they sent buses to take people over without presenting that document and without having any kind of signature for accountability,' Reeves said.\n\nMigrant demands to accept DCC shelter. 1. Migrants will cook their own food with fresh, culturally appropriate ingredients provided by the City instead of premade meals- rice, chicken, flour, oil, butter, tomatoes, onions, etc... Also people will not be punished for bringing in and eating outside food. 2. Shower access will be available without time limits and can be accessed whenever- we are not in the military, we're civilians. 3. Medical professional visits will happen regularly and referrals/connections for specialty care will be made as needed.\n\n4. All will receive that same housing support that has been offered to others. They cannot kick people out in 30 days without something stable established. 5. There needs to be a clear, just process before exiting someone for any reason- including verbal, written and final warnings. 6. All shelter residents will receive connection to employment support, including work permit applications for those who qualify.\n\n7. Consultations for each person/family with a free immigration lawyer must be arranged to discuss/progress their cases, and then the City will provide on-going legal support in the form of immigration document clinics, and including transportation to relevant court dates. 8. The City will provide privacy for families/ individuals within the shelter. 9. No more verbal or physical or mental abuse will be permitted from the staff, including no sheriff sleeping inside & monitoring 24/7- we are not criminals and won't be treated as such.\n\n10. Transportation for all children to and from their schools will be provided until they finish in 3 weeks. 11. No separating families, regardless of if family members have children or not. The camp will stay together. 12. The City must schedule a meeting with the Mayor & those directly involved in running the Newcomer program ASAP to discuss further improvements & ways to support migrants.\n\n13. The City must provide all residents with a document signed by a City official in English & Spanish with all of these demands that included a number to call to report mistreatment. Reeves believes that instead of meeting their demands, the city chose to take matters into their own hands. He said that the shelters will offer 'three square meals a day' and that people can even cook for themselves should they wish.\n\nIn response to the migrants' new demands, the city said that they have been trying to work with them. 'We've been offering timing shelter, basically just trying to get families to leave the camp and come inside,' Jon Ewing with Denver Human Services said. Ewing explained that the shelters will come with better conditions than what the migrants are dealing with currently. He said that the shelters will offer 'three square meals a day' and that people can even cook for themselves should they wish. 'We've been offering timing shelter, basically just trying to get families to leave the camp and come inside,' Jon Ewing with Denver Human Services said. He said: 'What might be something that is a feasible path for you to success that is not staying on the streets of Denver?'\n\nEwing added that the city has tried to find a 'compromise' with migrants and that the hope is to not have 'families on the streets of Denver.' It is unclear if the city will meet the migrant's demands and what will happen next. For now, the city has decided to keep shuttling buses to the encampment for migrants that want to leave the streets and go to an indoor city-run shelter or hotel. In April, Denver Communications Liaison Andres Carrera begged migrant families to move on to other sanctuary cities like New York or Chicago. Carrera warned them that Colorado did not have the proper resources to take care of them and that they would 'suffer.' 'The opportunities are over,' Carrera said in Spanish. 'New York gives you more. Chicago gives you more. So I suggest you go there where there is longer-term shelter. There are also more job opportunities there.'\n\nThe overburdened city has allocated more than $100 million to provide housing, medical care and education for asylum seekers, according to Mayor Mike Johnston. But amid the ongoing migrant crisis, that number could reach $180 million - 15 percent of Denver's annual budget. Other sanctuary cities have begun to do the same as Chicago previously emptied its state-run shelters at Rogers Park's Leona Beach and Little Village's Pietrowski Park. The crisis has also reached a fever pitch in New York City, which has seen roughly 180,000 migrants enter since 2022. Under its 'Right to Shelter' law, the city must provide food and housing. Mayor Eric Adams beseeched the state to provide more funding during a joint legislative budget hearing last month. 'New Yorkers are already carrying most of the asylum seekers. It is wrong to ask them to do more. It has put the city in a precarious situation,' he said at the time.\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

After struggling for more than a year to shelter and feed the army of illegal migrants that have flooded into the city, Denver finally began imposing some limits on how long people could stay in the municipal intake shelters. This angered some of the migrants who were forced to leave the shelters and a group of them set up an encampment on public property as the spring weather began to improve. The encampment is located under an overpass near the railroad tracks. The Mayor's office repeatedly requested that the migrants evacuate the encampment and move to other shelters that were set up to house them. But the migrants refused, and now they have sent an advocate with a list of demands that they say must be met before they will agree to relocate to a shelter. If you think this sounds like an outtake from the movie Idiocracy, you're not alone. (KDVR News)\n\nA group of migrants staying at an encampment in Denver sent a list of demands to the mayor's desk.\n\nThat group said if their demands are met, they will voluntarily stay in city-funded shelters and leave their encampment where families, including young children, still live in tents.\n\nThe migrants have been lobbied by Denver Human Services to get off the street and into shelters -- an offer that remains, according to city officials. But they are holding out and said the city has reneged on its deal with them, while the city maintains it will continue to offer services to migrants that choose shelter over encampments.\n\nJust try to imagine the nerve of these people. They are in the country illegally having violated our laws. They are milling around in an eyesore of an encampment after being repeatedly told that they need to relocate to a shelter operated by the city where they would have a roof, a bed, running water, and three meals a day. But now they are issuing a list of demands that they say will have to be met before they agree to relocate.\n\nSo what are the demands of the migrants? First of all, they are complaining about the food at the shelters. They claim it is sometimes not of good enough quality or the portions are too small. Really? What sort of food are you getting under the highway overpass and who is delivering it? Welcome to America. We have a saying here about how beggars can't be choosers. You need to ponder that.\n\nAnother demand is that they want work permits delivered to them. Some of the migrants at the shelters have eventually qualified for temporary work permits, so this group believes they should be automatically entitled to them also. Perhaps they are unaware that it is a crime for employers to hire illegal aliens. We have a process whereby immigrants can gain work permits, but it involves emigrating to our country legally. We are supposed to be finding jobs for our own citizens and legal immigrants first, at least in theory.\n\nThere were a total of 13 demands included in the list, all along similar lines. The crazy part is that the Mayor is reportedly considering granting at least some of them. These people don't belong in a makeshift encampment under a bridge or even in a shelter that's offered at the expense of the taxpayers. They should be in a deportation detention center being fully vetted, after which they should be \"rewarded\" with a bus trip back to their country of origin. But this is the \"new normal\" that we live with in the midst of the Biden border crisis. We can't entirely blame the migrants for believing they are so entitled. That's the expectation that Joe Biden built up in their community. Come to America where everything is free and you won't have to work. For Pete's sake, we really need to have a major housecleaning take place.", "source": {"uri": "hotair.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "HotAir"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jazz_shaw@hotair.com", "name": "Jazz Shaw", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overpass", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Overpass"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rail_transport", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rail transport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Illegal immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spanish language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KDVR", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "KDVR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_permit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Work permit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporary_work", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Temporary work"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridge", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bridge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deportation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Deportation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Immigration"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free_Services", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 68}], "image": "https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2023/334/6c7dae8e-027f-4ad7-b709-4f587294f351.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550990", "eventUri": "eng-9550990", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.08235294117647063, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

This comes after the city swept two encampments in one day.\n\nThe city has repeatedly cleared out camps and encouraged migrants to move into shelters, but it has not always worked, which is why camps continue to reappear. But that changed Wednesday when the city offered even more help.\n\n\"We were trying to resolve the encampment this morning. We found that pretty much everyone, most of the people there, had dispersed overnight,\" said Jon Ewing, with Denver Human Services.\n\nA group of migrants left an encampment under Central Park Boulevard Tuesday night.

So we had around 18 people go into shelter this morning, all of them families.\"\n\nDenver offers migrants new shelter deal\n\nThe remaining migrants moved their encampment under the A Line near Pe\u00f1a Boulevard in far east Denver. The city then swept up that camp, but not without adjusting their offer to these folks.\n\n\"This time we said, for the singles, the individuals without kids,\" Ewing said. \"We said how about seven days in shelter. It'll be a hotel shelter. Seven days, aggressive case management.\"\n\nSingles had previously only been offered 72 hours in a city-funded shelter.\n\n\"Getting a full week with case management is a huge win,\" said Amy Beck, an advocate for the migrants.\n\nBeck and other advocates called it a win. The city has often been at odds with these folks, who are voluntarily offering their own guidance to migrants.\n\n\"I think it can cause some problems when you have multiple factions running an encampment, or something along those lines,\" Ewing said. \"We saw that happen and it caused a lot of confusion, and there were a lot of people who felt like they were being torn different ways.\"\n\nWith the encampment cleared out and migrants off the street, all sides are hoping they will start to earn their own keep.\n\n\"With intensive case management,\" Beck said, \"there's a good chance that many of them will get housed and be able to stay in our community.\"", "source": {"uri": "kdvr.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FOX31 Denver KDVR"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rogelio_mares@kdvr.com", "name": "Rogelio Mares", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KDVR", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "KDVR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Line_(RTD)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "A Line (RTD)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pe\u00f1a_Boulevard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pe\u00f1a Boulevard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Central Park"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Day", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Day", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Organizations/Animal_Welfare", "label": "dmoz/Society/Organizations/Animal Welfare", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Homeless", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Homeless", "wgt": 18}], "image": "https://kdvr.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2024/05/Screen-Shot-2024-05-08-at-8.19.45-PM.png?strip=1&w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550990", "eventUri": "eng-9550990", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

Instead, the individuals have set up tents underneath a bridge by train tracks.\n\n\"We are not criminals & won't be treated as such,\" wrote the group of immigrants who illegally entered the country.\n\nJon Ewing with Denver Human Services told KDVR, \"We've been offering time and shelter, basically just trying to get families to leave that camp and come inside.\"\n\nEwing explained that the taxpayer-funded shelters provide \"three square meals a day\" and allow the illegal immigrants to cook their own meals if they prefer. Additionally, individuals who opt to stay in the shelters are often provided assistance in applying for a work permit.\n\nV Reeves, an advocate for the group, told the news outlet that the illegal immigrants \"as a collective came up with a list of demands.\"\n\nThe document sent to the mayor listed 13 demands the city would need to agree to before the illegal immigrants would be willing to get off the street and move into a shelter.\n\n1. Migrants will cook their own food with fresh, culturally appropriate ingredients provided by the City instead of premade meals - rice, chicken, flour, oil, butter, tomatoes, onions, etc... Also people will not be punished for bringing in & eating outside food.\n\n2. Shower access will be available without time limits & can be accessed whenever - we are not in the military, we're civilians.\n\n3. Medical professional visits will happen regularly & referrals/connections for specialty care will be made as needed.\n\n4. All will receive the same housing support that has been offered to others. They cannot kick people out in 30 days without something stable established.\n\n5. There needs to be a clear, just process before exiting someone for any reason - including verbal, written & final warnings.\n\n6. All shelter residents will receive connection to employment support, including work permit applications for those who qualify.\n\n7. Consultations for each person/family with a free immigration lawyer must be arranged to discuss/progress their cases, & then the City will provide on-going legal support in the form of immigration document clinics & including transportation to relevant court dates.\n\n8. The City will provide privacy for families/individuals within the shelter.\n\n9. No more verbal or physical or mental abuse will be permitted from the staff, including no sheriff sleeping inside & monitoring 24/7 - we are not criminals & won't be treated as such.\n\n10. Transportation for all children to & from their schools will be provided until they finish in 3 weeks.\n\n11. No separating families, regardless of if family members have children or not. The camp will stay together.\n\n12. The City must schedule a meeting with the Mayor & those directly involved in running the Newcomer program ASAP to discuss further improvements & ways to support migrants.\n\n13. The City must provide all residents with a document signed by a City official in English & Spanish with all of these demands that includes a number to call to report mistreatment.\n\nReeves explained that instead of complying with the group's list of demands, the city sent a bus to the camp to pick up the illegal aliens and move them to an indoor shelter.\n\n\"This morning, they sent buses to take people over without presenting that document and without having any kind of signature for accountability,\" Reeves said.\n\nReeves claimed that one of the illegal immigrants' most significant grievances has been about the food provided by the city and funded by taxpayers.\n\n\"There have been so many complaints about the food being spoiled or not being enough and malnutrition amongst children,\" Reeves told KDVR. \"They're not receiving any kind of official housing or immigration document support, which is incredibly necessary for them to be able to navigate the bureaucracy around these systems.\"\n\nEwing explained that the city would provide many of the services the illegal immigrants seek if they left the encampment and moved into a shelter.\n\n\"What do you qualify for?

(Drew Angerer/Getty Images)\n\nA group of illegal immigrants staying at an encampment in Denver, Colorado, that is set to be removed are refusing to leave until city leaders meet their demands.\n\nThe group sent a document detailing 13 of their demands to Mayor Mike Johnston, a Democrat, on Wednesday, according to the non-profit Housekeys Action Network Denver.\n\nIn a Facebook post, Housekeys Action Network Denver said the immigrants at the camp had requested that the \"incredibly reasonable and doable changes take place\" to ensure \"long-term stability and opportunities for all.\"\n\nThe non-profit also criticized what it said were the \"poor conditions and lack of accountability that resulted in many of these same individuals finding themselves on the streets after having gone thru [sic] the system.\"\n\nAccording to Housekeys Action Network Denver, the group of immigrants has vowed to voluntarily leave the encampment and stay in indoor shelters funded by the city -- as has been repeatedly requested by Denver Human Services -- so long as their demands are met.\n\nTheir demands include that they are allowed to \"cook their own food with fresh, culturally appropriate ingredients provided by the city instead of premade meals - rice, chicken, flour, oil, butter, tomatoes, onions, etc.\" and that they \"not be punished for bringing in and eating outside food.\"\n\nShower access \"will be available without time limits and can be accessed whenever,\" the list states, with the group of immigrants adding: \"We are not in the military, we are civilians.\"\n\n\"Medical professional visits will happen regularly and referrals/connections for specialty care will be made as needed,\" the list continues.\n\n\"All will receive the same housing support that has been offered to others,\" it adds. \"They cannot kick people out in 30 days without something stable established.\"\n\nElsewhere, the group calls for a \"clear, just process before exiting someone for any reason,\" including verbal, written, and final warnings, and adds that all the immigrants should receive help with employment support, including work permit applications for those who qualify.\n\n\"Consultations for each person/family with a free immigration lawyer must be arranged to discuss/progress their cases, and then the City will provide on-going legal support in the form of immigration document clinics and including transportation to relevant court dates,\" the group writes.\n\nMeanwhile, the group of immigrants asked that city officials provide individuals and families with \"privacy within the shelter\" and transportation for all children to and from schools for the next three weeks.\n\nThe group is also calling for an end to alleged \"verbal, physical and mental abuse\" from staff and that no sheriff be allowed to sleep inside and monitor them 24 hours a day, seven days a week.\n\n\"We are not criminals and won't be treated as such,\" the group writes. It is not clear if the group was referring to a sheriff sleeping inside the encampment or the city-funded indoor shelters.\n\nElsewhere, the group asked that families not be separated, regardless of whether or not they have children.\n\n\"The camp will stay together,\" the group states.\n\nFinally, the group demanded that the city schedule a meeting with Mr. Johnston and other individuals directly involved in running the Denver Newcomer program as soon as possible \"to discuss further improvements and ways to support migrants.\"\n\n\"The City must provide all residents with a document signed by a City official in English and Spanish with all of these demands that include a number to call to report mistreatment,\" the group concluded.\n\nThe group's refusal to leave the encampment comes as Denver is battling with a $180 million budget gap as the illegal immigrant crisis continues to weigh heavily on the city.\n\nIn February, Mr. Johnston told reporters the city needs to slash roughly $18 million per month from public services throughout 2024 in order to fund the costs of providing services to illegal immigrants arriving in the city.\n\nAt the time, the Democrat called the cuts a \"plan for shared sacrifice\" that would help both \"newcomers\" illegally crossing the border and taxpayers who expected certain services in the city.\n\n\"This is what good people do in hard situations as you try to manage your way to serve all of your values. Our values are: we want to continue to be a city that does not have women and children out on the street in intense and 20-degree weather,\" he said.\n\nIn its post on Facebook, Housekeys Action Network Denver said it was not up to Mr. Johnston to \"accept and support the very migrants he says he appreciates and defends in his speeches.\"\n\n\"Now is the time to support these individuals with sustainable, stable plans that also provide them with the autonomy and self-determination they want!!!\" the organization said.\n\nThe Epoch Times reached out to Denver Human Services for further comment but did not receive a response by press time.", "source": {"uri": "ntd.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NTD"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Johnston_(Colorado_politician)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mike Johnston (Colorado politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonprofit_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nonprofit organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Press conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_appropriation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cultural appropriation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Capitol", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Capitol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Illegal immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getty_Images", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Getty Images"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheriff", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sheriff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Onion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomato", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tomato"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flour", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Flour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Petroleum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicken"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Butter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rice", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Privacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epoch_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Epoch Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Autonomy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_service", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Public service"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Lifestyle_Choices", "label": "dmoz/Society/Lifestyle Choices", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/For_Charity", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/For Charity", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Support_Groups/Twelve_Step", "label": "dmoz/Society/Support Groups/Twelve Step", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://i.ntd.com/assets/uploads/2024/05/id991617-Denver-Mayor-Mike-Johnston-.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550990", "eventUri": "eng-9550990", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2018-01-", "textStart": 88, "textEnd": 95}], "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 168, "relevance": 1}

Now, the city is scaling back aid", "body": "DENVER, Colo. -- Denver is among the cities most impacted by the arrival of migrants crossing the Southwestern border in the last two years. More than 40,000 have arrived, many on buses chartered by the governor of Texas. Denver provided shelter for thousands and other forms of help. That's been expensive, and exhausting, and now the city has scaled its efforts back.\n\nWhen Rosbely Sira Linarez, her husband and newborn arrived here last year from Venezuela they got help from the state to move into an apartment.\n\n\"They gave me a month's help plus the deposit,\" she said, in Spanish.\n\nThey found a place. That lasted about 10 months. Her husband lost a job, they fell behind on rent and then were evicted.\n\n\"I was there until they kicked me out,\" Linarez said.\n\nNow they live in one of dozens of tents clustered under a north Denver street bridge, but not for too long. Police recently found this encampment and told residents they have to leave. Like Linarez, most here are newly arrived Venezuelan immigrants.\n\n\"Lately everything has become complicated for us,\" Linarez says.\n\nSince 2023 more than 8,000 people in Denver received help with housing, through a state fund that's still available. But in March, the city started phasing out its short-term sheltering assistance. The problem for Linarez, and most migrants in Denver, is getting authorization to work so they can pay for their own housing.\n\n\"There's people who are going to be systemically homeless if we don't take care of them and get 'em on a path to employment,\" said Arthur Infante, a Denver artist who felt moved to help people in tents a few months ago.\n\n\"The ones who do have work authorization, they're making a go of it, man,\" Infante said. \"They have that idea of the American Dream, and I mean it's even harder for us to attain that these days, but they still have that idea that they can make it.\"\n\nMany migrants who landed in Denver took bus tickets the city's been offering to other cities for the last couple of years. Some, like Linarez, stuck around.\n\nAfter Congress rejected a measure in February that would have sent money to help cities like Denver, Mayor Mike Johnston announced he had to cut $45 million from other departments to address the needs of people arriving.\n\n\"We've been in a kind of a back foot position really for the last 16 months,\" said Jon Ewing, a spokesperson for Denver Human Services.\n\n\"What we're trying to do now is build something that is sustainable,\" he said.\n\nIn March, Mayor Johnston said Denver needed scale back services for new arrivals. In April, he announced the city would house about 800 people for six months, as they wait for asylum applications to process and work authorization to come through - far less than the thousands of people once sheltered in city-run hotel rooms last winter.\n\n\"We'll be providing...workforce training. We're going to be providing them housing assistance,\" Ewing said.\n\nPeople like Linarez, who already got a little help, but is now living under a bridge, don't qualify, and are on their own.\n\n\"I think we all know that we can't do everything for everyone. No city can,\" Ewing said.\n\nIn April, Denver started sending city staffers to Texas, to tell would-be travelers that there are now few resources available if they do decide to come here.\n\nBut as official resources shrink, Denver-area residents continue pitching in to try to give people safe, and sustainable, places to live.\n\nHengerlyth Jimenez said, in Spanish, that her little family is just starting life here, made possible by the kindness of a stranger.\n\n\"I was like, well, I have this fully functional space where people could be living instead of under a bridge,\" said that stranger, Emilie Mitcham, who lives in a Denver suburb. She met Jimenez and another mother through a mutual aid group online and offered up her home.\n\n\"One of the women was pregnant. And so, a pregnant woman with another small child out on the street in flip flops? Yeah, of course I'm going to help them if I can,\" Mitcham said.\n\nThe aid group says they've helped about 500 people find arrangements like this, and now, Denver residents can call 211 to sign up to be a host. Its a middle ground between a full lease that might be tricky to hang onto and a tent.\n\nFor Jimenez and other migrants, this may be the runway they need to make it in this expensive city.\n\n\"Poco dif\u00edcil, pero, s\u00ed, se puede.

An estimated 800 migrants are expected to be among the first to qualify.\n\nIt allows roughly 1,000 asylum seekers to come to Denver but they must wait at least 180 days after applying for asylum to receive legal work authorization. After receiving that authorization, those individuals will be enrolled in a separate program called WorkReady Denver.\n\nThose asylum seekers are also being provided six months of housing assistance, in-depth workforce training and food assistance while they wait for authorization.\n\nThe move came on the heels of a dwindling migrant budget that city officials warned was cutting into funding for other programs and services. The sanctuary city has opened its doors to 41,530 newcomers as of Wednesday, according to the city's migrant dashboard, at a cost of nearly $70 million.\n\nAlso as of Wednesday, there were 25 newcomers in short-term shelters and 595 in hotel shelters.\n\n\"We've been in a kind of a back foot position really for the last 16 months,\" Jon Ewing, a spokesperson for Denver Human Services, said on NPR's Morning Edition. \"What we're trying to do now is build something that is sustainable.\"\n\nBetween April 11 and 24, Denver welcomed 180 newcomers -- an average of 22 arrivals daily, including migrants who traveled on 17 different buses from Texas to Colorado. Of those 180 newcomers, 138 purchased tickets for onward travel to other destinations.\n\nThe city is currently operating one non-congregate hotel shelter, two congregate shelters, and one transitional housing facility. A hotel shelter is intended to be closed by this summer \"after all occupants transition to leased units through rental assistance programs at designated nonprofits.\"\n\nOf the more than $69 million spent towards migrants and associated services since December 2022, $25.06 million (36.49 percent) has gone towards housing/shelter and $20.47 million (29.81 percent) has gone towards payroll.\n\nIn the same time span, meals and onward travel made up 11.25 percent and 10.26 percent of the budget total, respectively.", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nick_mordowanec@newsweek.com", "name": "Nick Mordowanec", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ViVe", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "ViVe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugee", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Refugee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Johnston_(Colorado_politician)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mike Johnston (Colorado politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asylum_seeker", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Asylum seeker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_City_Council", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denver City Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newsweek", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Newsweek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonprofit_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nonprofit organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contract", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Contract"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Email"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Center_Square", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Center Square"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_of_asylum", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Right of asylum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morning_Edition", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Morning Edition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanctuary_city", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sanctuary city"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPR", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NPR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hotel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home", "label": "dmoz/Home", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners", "label": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Apartment_Living", "label": "dmoz/Home/Apartment Living", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Apartment_Living/Roommates", "label": "dmoz/Home/Apartment Living/Roommates", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Homeless", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Homeless", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 74}], "image": "https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2389958/denver-migrants.webp?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=82def2238135ea1803f395065c51dde5", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550990", "eventUri": "eng-9550990", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-11", "dateEnd": "2024-04-24", "textStart": 2850, "textEnd": 2865}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-24", "textStart": 1410, "textEnd": 1418}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-11", "textStart": 1580, "textEnd": 1588}], "sentiment": 0.4039215686274509, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

Our values are: we want to continue to be a city that does not have women and children out on the street in intense and 20-degree weather,\" he said.\n\nIn its post on Facebook, Housekeys Action Network Denver said it was not up to Mr. Johnston to \"accept and support the very migrants he says he appreciates and defends in his speeches.\"\n\n\"Now is the time to support these individuals with sustainable, stable plans that also provide them with the autonomy and self-determination they want!!!\" the organization said.\n\nThe Epoch Times reached out to Denver Human Services for further comment but did not receive a response by press time.", "source": {"uri": "theepochtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.theepochtimes.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Johnston_(Colorado_politician)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mike Johnston (Colorado politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonprofit_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nonprofit organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Illegal immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_appropriation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cultural appropriation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheriff", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sheriff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Onion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomato", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tomato"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flour", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Flour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Petroleum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicken"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Butter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rice", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Privacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epoch_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Epoch Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Autonomy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-determination", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Self-determination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Support_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Society/Support Groups", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Lifestyle_Choices", "label": "dmoz/Society/Lifestyle Choices", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/For_Charity", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/For Charity", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Support_Groups/Twelve_Step", "label": "dmoz/Society/Support Groups/Twelve Step", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/02/10/id5584518-GettyImages-1935881526-1080x720.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550990", "eventUri": "eng-9550990", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1058823529411764, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

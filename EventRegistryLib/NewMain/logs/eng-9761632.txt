You know, our thoughts are with those in impacted areas because we know they'd like that information as soon as possible.

The Regional District of Central Kootenay (RDCK) issued the order Wednesday evening for the village of around 200 people, which is located by Slocan Lake and the Valhalla Provincial Park in southeast B.C., in response to the Aylwin Creek fire. The order also covers 17 surrounding addresses in Electoral Area H. The village is located around 150 km east of Kelowna in southeast B.C.Silverton Mayor Tanya Gordon told CBC News that she's feeling \"a little shocked, nervous and anxious\" after the order went into effect. She also said it's hard to see anything from the village because of the smoke.\"It's very surreal now that it's actually on the doorsteps,\" she said. According to Gordon, residents were \"very prepared\" and most have already left. \"We had a few days to prepare for it,\" she said on Wednesday night. \"And with the winds earlier today, I think a lot of people just expected it to happen.\"The Aylwin Creek fire was discovered on July 18 and is suspected to have been started by lightning, according to the B.C. Wildfire Service (BCWS). The blaze is four square kilometres as of 8:30 p.m. PT on Wednesday.The BCWS also considers it a wildfire of note, which means it's highly visible or poses a potential threat to public safety. It's one of four fires with such a designation in the province, along with the larger Komonko Creek wildfire which is east of it.That wildfire occupies an area of around five square kilometres, with both wildfires having led to the closure of Highway 6 between Slocan and New Denver.The regional district had previously ordered properties south of Silverton, in the Red Mountain Road area and east of Slocan Lake, evacuated due to the two fires.Evacuees have been told to register for emergency services, if needed, at the Nakusp and District Community Complex in Nakusp, B.C.", "source": {"uri": "rsoe-edis.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "rsoe-edis.org"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildfire", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wildfire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valhalla_Provincial_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Valhalla Provincial Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regional_District_of_Central_Kootenay", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Regional District of Central Kootenay"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Regional District of Central Kootenay"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelowna", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kelowna"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kelowna"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silverton,_Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Silverton, Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Silverton, Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slocan_Lake", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Slocan Lake"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBC_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CBC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regional_district", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Regional district"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Columbia_Highway_6", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "British Columbia Highway 6"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Mountain_Resort", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Red Mountain Resort"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nakusp", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nakusp"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nakusp"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provinces_and_territories_of_Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Provinces and territories of Canada"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slocan,_British_Columbia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Slocan, British Columbia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Slocan, British Columbia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Camping", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Camping", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Cosmic_Wimpout", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Cosmic Wimpout", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 65}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9761632", "eventUri": "eng-9761632", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-18", "textStart": 1036, "textEnd": 1043}], "sentiment": -0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

The fires that are directly in or near values or structures in that area,\" said Lawler.\n\n\"We're also conscious of roadways that we've had to close for the safety of the community and first responders, and we understand that that can impact the community, but our first and foremost priority is the safety of the community and our first responders as we move through and try to get a hold of some of these fires.\"\n\nEvacuations\n\nHundreds of residents in the Regional District of Central Kootenay Electoral Area H have been forced to evacuate their homes as a result of the wildfire activity, and Lawler said it's too difficult to say how long people will be displaced.\n\n\"We have to ensure that it is certainly safe for people to return, and that is something that is really difficult to put a metric on. The reality is we only go into an evacuation order as a last resort, but we'll certainly do it in time to allow the public to get out safely.\"\n\nThe community's cooperation right now is critical to the effectiveness of the wildfire service's response, with Lawler asking that people please obey any evacuation alerts, orders, and restrictions issued in the area.\n\n\"It's really important that the community complies and understands that when the alerts are in place, and if an order is put in place, it's essentially done for the safety of the community.\"\n\nResidents should ensure they stay informed and keep an eye out for the alerts and notifications sent out by the wildfire service to stay up to date on the wildfire activity in their area.\n\nArea Restrictions\n\nOn July 22, an area restriction came into effect for the Slocan Lake Complex Area.\n\nAn area restriction, according to the BC Wildfire Service, is a legal order that prohibits access to certain areas to limit the risk of a fire, address public safety concerns, or avoid interference with fire control.\n\nLawler said the area restriction was put into place more for tourists rather than residents, as visitors entering the area may not have the local knowledge necessary to understand the risks in the area.\n\n\"That's really to prevent unintended travellers or holidaymakers from entering areas that we consider to be at risk, but don't have local knowledge and are potentially not equipped to understand the area they're in that may become subject to fire.\"\n\nPeople are asked to be aware of the responders in the area and on the roads, with Lawler asking motorists to avoid driving in the Slocan Valley for the time being to ensure fire crews can do their job.\n\n\"If you don't need to be on the road in the vicinity of those operations, then please take care on the roads.

Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nThe one-hour meeting -- hosted by the Regional District of Central Kootenay's Emergency Operations Centre -- started with an information session on the fires, followed by a lively question period and ended with a sobering declaration that an evacuation order had just been issued for the 200 residents of Silverton.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nAlthough some were dissatisfied with the slow response of the B.C. Wildfire Service, and many questioned the thin contingent of resources being utilized on the fires, it was the proclamation of an evacuation order that many feared.\n\nCiting an age-old sentiment that has been the mantra of valley residents since American Vietnam War resisters headed north in the mid-1960s and settled in the Slocan Valley, one resident asked what the consequences were of defiance of an evacuation order, if it were to be given for Slocan and the surrounding residences.\n\nThe lady acknowledged that firefighters were doing their best to bring the fires under control despite a shortage of resources, but \"our homes are our homes. They mean everything to us while you are trying to fight the fires and protect everybody.\n\n\"My question is this: If we choose not to leave because it is our home and we are going to defend our home, what happens?\" she asked.\n\nThe question drew loud applause from the people. RDCK Community Sustainability manager Dan Seguin said it was a common question at all public information sessions when faced with encroaching wildfires.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"I have not been on an evacuation order in my life, and it is a question I think I would ask myself, too, and I appreciate that,\" he said. \"If you are asked to leave and you have an evacuation order and you choose to stay, that is up to you. And you are allowed to stay there as you want, but you are going to have people coming to check on you and knocking on your door because they are concerned for your safety.\"\n\nSeguin added that people need to be aware of, from a legal safety standpoint, if there are minors (children) in the home, minors cannot stay in a home under evacuation order.\n\nAnother person wondered if it was a contract that would be entered into. The RDCK official replied that there was no contract.\n\nRCMP commander of Slocan and Naksup detachments, Thomas Gill, interjected.\n\n\"In echoing that (thought) we are not going to be pulling people out, but we going to keep coming to check on you as long as it is safe and we will keep recommending that you leave,\" he told the crowd.\n\n\"But if you are staying, we can't have people moving back and forth unless they are wildfire fighters. The only time I would actually physically pull you out of there is if you are interfering with wildfire (fighting). Everyone else that is staying to defend their property, that's fine. But please don't interfere with these guys.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nFive fires threaten the area, including Aylwin Creek, Komonko Creek, Nemo Creek, Ponderosa FSR and Mulvey Creek. An incident management team from Australia has been deployed to the region and has taken command of the Slocan Lake complex beginning July 23.\n\nCurrently, Highway 6 is closed north of Slocan due to the Alwyn and Komonko fires -- the only highway closure at this time -- and an area restriction is in effect for the Slocan Lake Complex, with no current estimated time of reopening.\n\n- Note: check drivebc.ca before traveling.\n\nA state of local emergency has been declared for the area -- the Slocan Valley -- due to the Aylwin Creek wildfire. Under B.C.'s Emergency Program Act, when a state of emergency is declared, it gives the regional district's Emergency Operations Centre \"greater flexibility to access resources and respond efficiently to the imminent threat of wildfire across the region.\"\n\nGetting out\n\nAn evacuation order requires people to leave the area immediately.\n\nEvacuated residents are supposed to go to a pre-arranged emergency location and register online with Emergency Support Services (ESS) at https://ess.gov.bc.ca/.\n\nIf people don't have a pre-arranged location and require support, they can report to the Royal Canadian Legion in Slocan (502 Harold St).\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nShort-term assistance for immediate needs of food, shelter and clothing may be provided by ESS volunteers following registration at the above website.\n\nFor further assistance people can call the RDCK EOC pubic inquiry line at 352-7701.\n\nESS likely won't be able to accommodate pets, so make preparations for pets by having appropriate cages, food, water and bowls, and ensure they are wearing identification.\n\nAccess to the evacuation order area is being controlled. People will not be permitted to return to their homes during and evacuation order unless it is safe to do so and have been given permission by local officials and emergency personnel.\n\nHeating up\n\nThere have been 126 new fires reported across the Southeast Fire Centre region in the last 24 hours.\n\nAccording to the fire centre, weather conditions are working against fire crews. Atmospheric instability has increased wind in many areas, combining with low relative humidity and current fuel conditions to cause fires to become more active and visible to surrounding areas.\n\nThere is hope, however, the Slocan Lake complex information team reporting a change in the weather on the way.\n\n\"As the low moves across, temperatures will decrease and there will be minimally improved recoveries of relative humidity,\" noted an information sheet available at the Winlaw meeting.", "source": {"uri": "thepeterboroughexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

And one family got an up-close-and-personal view of the storm.\n\nOn July 17, Larissa Henschell drove from her home in Keremeos to meet up with her brother and his wife in the Slocan Valley. Her brother regularly boats in the area, and he took her across Slocan Lake to do some boat-accessed camping on the west shore of the lake, across from Silverton.\n\nBut while it was supposed to be a relaxing trip on the lake, it turned out to be anything but. Henschell says they wrapped up dinner at about 8 p.m. and she went down to the lakeshore to take some photos.\n\n\"I kind of noticed a thunderstorm was rolling in, but nothing too much was happening yet. And then I looked back to our campsite and I saw smoke coming up behind our campsite, a little ways away but close enough to be worried,\" Henschell said.\n\n\"And then all of a sudden it just started with the thunder and the lightning all over. It was pretty scary, it was pretty intense.\"\n\nShe says the rapid lightning strikes continued for about two hours, with loud thunder booming directly overhead. But even when the storm moved northward, she says they could see lightning continue through most of the night.\n\nA couple drops of rain fell throughout the evening, but the storm was mostly dry.\n\nHenschell and her family saw at least three wildfires start from lightning strikes, including what she thinks turned into the now 400-hectare Aylwin Creek wildfire, burning just south of Silverton. The fire burning behind their campsite was likely the Nemo Creek wildfire, which has since ballooned to more than 800 hectares in size.\n\n\"We were up all night having an eye on the fire behind us,\" she said. \"We couldn't really leave because of the thunder and we had a metal boat. You don't want to be on the water necessarily in a thunderstorm.\"\n\nThey decided to move their camp to the beach, away from the trees, in case the fire moved closer to them through the night. But Henschell says they weren't able to get much sleep.\n\n\"The thunder made us jump, it was right over us it felt like,\" she said. \"And then seeing the fires start from the lightning, we've never seen anything like it.\"\n\nTo cap off the crazy night, she says a bear actually came down at one point in the night and rummaged through a neighbouring family's camp.\n\n\"Those poor kids, they were just done. They didn't want to be in the tent because of the bear and they didn't want to be at the beach because of the thunder,\" Henschell said. \"Those poor kids were just bawling ... it was just too much.\"\n\nThe next day, Henschell says a ranger came by to tell them they needed to leave the area due to the nearby fire, so they packed up and found a new campsite at the north end of the lake. But by Saturday, they were forced to leave again, having been told the whole area was closed to camping.\n\n\"It was a pretty crazy experience,\" Henschell says.\n\nThis week, six fires that are larger than 100 hectares in size are burning throughout the Slocan Valley, after they were first sparked by last week's storm. An evacuation order extends along Highway 6, from just south of Silverton down to nearly Slocan. Both the communities of Slocan and Silverton are under evacuation alerts and Highway 6 is closed.\n\nPhoto: Larissa Henschell A fire appears to spark from a lightning strike in the Slocan Valley on the evening of July 17, 2024.", "source": {"uri": "castanet.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Castanet"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nicholas_johansen@castanet.net", "name": "Nicholas Johansen", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slocan_Valley", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Slocan Valley"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lightning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildfire", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wildfire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lake"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larissa", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Larissa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Larissa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Greece"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slocan_Lake", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Slocan Lake"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keremeos", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Keremeos"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Keremeos"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunderstorm", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thunderstorm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silverton,_British_Columbia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Silverton, British Columbia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Silverton, British Columbia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Columbia_Highway_6", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "British Columbia Highway 6"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slocan,_British_Columbia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Slocan, British Columbia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Slocan, British Columbia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.castanet.net/content/2024/7/unnamed_p3856694.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9761632", "eventUri": "eng-9761632", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Larissa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Greece"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-17", "textStart": 277, "textEnd": 284}, {"amb": false, "date": "2017-07-", "textStart": 82, "textEnd": 89, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 135, "relevance": 1}

sentenced to jail over vile bestiality acts", "body": "A prominent crocodile expert and Charles Darwin University academic has been jailed for more than 10 years over his 'grotesque' depravity and cruelty in torturing and killing dozens of dogs.\n\nAdam Robert Corden Britton was sentenced in Darwin Supreme Court on Thursday having previously pleaded guilty to 56 offences related to the torture and sexual exploitation of more than 42 dogs on his rural property.\n\nChief Justice Michael Grant warned the public gallery that he would have to describe Britton's offending that included 'grotesque cruelty toward animals'.\n\n'Your depravity falls outside any ordinary human conception,' Justice Grant told Britton.\n\nDespite this Britton's barrister argued a lifetime ban on animal ownership was an 'extreme measure' and that he should be allowed to own or live with any creatures other than 'mammals'.\n\nMembers of the public gallery sobbed and gasped as the details of Britton's extensive and violent offending, resulting in the deaths of 39 dogs, including nine puppies, were read out.\n\nBritton stood in the dock wearing a black suit with grey shirt and did not visibly react to Justice Grant's sentencing remarks.\n\nAdam Britton (pictured has been jailed for more than 10 years over his 'grotesque' depravity and cruelty towards over 2 dogs\n\nAdam Britton (pictured) told a stranger on Telegram that he stopped trying to suppress his violent urges\n\nAnimal advocates earlier demonstrated outside court holding signs labelling Britton a 'zoosadist' who should face the death penalty.\n\nBritton began offending in 2014 and continued until his arrest in April 2022 after a video of his vile acts, which he had shared online, was anonymously provided to Northern Territory animal welfare authorities.\n\nThe agreed facts stated Britton extensively filmed his offending and shared some of the videos online while encouraging others to commit similar offences and offering advice on how to do so.\n\n'Your sheer and unalloyed pleasure is sickeningly evident from the recorded material,' Justice Grant said.\n\nBritton was also sentenced for possessing and transmitting 'the worst category' of child sexual abuse material.\n\nAs well as torturing his own dogs, Britton bought sought canines featured in Gumtree Australia 'free to good home' adverts from unsuspecting owners in the Darwin region.\n\nIn 2016, Britton uploaded a photo of one of his dogs, Bolt, as a puppy (pictured)\n\nThe court heard Britton started abusing his dogs, Ursa and Bolt (pictured), in 2014\n\nThe former academic, who once hosted world-famous broadcaster and biologist David Attenborough, would share videos and images of himself sexually exploiting the dogs on online forums under pseudonyms.\n\nBritton has been remanded in custody since his arrest.\n\nBritton was a prominent NT crocodile expert and a senior researcher at CDU.\n\nNone of his offending is alleged to have been against the reptiles.\n\nBritton was sentenced to 10 years and five months with a non-parole period of six years, backdated to his April 2022 arrest.\n\nJustice Grant ordered that Britton be banned from owning or having on his property mammal-type animals for the term of his natural life.\n\nBut Britton's barrister said it was 'an extreme measure'.\n\n'We certainly don't cavil with this being a case in which such an order would be appropriate but a lifetime and all animals for a person who is motivated to receive treatment and has reasonable prospects of rehabilitation would be too extreme.'\n\nBritton's barrister also read an apology penned from her client in court.\n\n'I take full responsibility for the demeaning crimes that I perpetrated on dogs,' he said.\n\n'I deeply regret the pain and trauma that I caused to innocent animals and consequently to my family, friends and members of the community that I affected, I let you all down and I'm truly sorry.\n\nAdam Britton (centre) with his wife Erin (left) and David Attenborough (right) during filming for a BBC documentary\n\n'I now acknowledge that I've been fighting a rare paraphilic disorder for much of my life and that shame and fear prevented me from seeking the proper help I needed.'\n\nBritton said 'no amount of words can convey how sorry and ashamed I am, nor undo what I did' but he was 'determined to prove I am better than this'.\n\n'That I will seek long term treatment and that I will find a path towards redemption,' he said.\n\n'Please give my family the space they deserve to heal, they were not aware or involved in any way.'", "source": {"uri": "expressdigest.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "expressdigest.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Gecko with his former wife.\n\nThe couple lived in McMinns Lagoon, about 30km south of Darwin, with their two Swiss-Sheppard dogs, Ursa and Bolt, and a number of pet saltwater crocodiles.\n\nCourt documents reveal that from about 2014, Britton began engaging in sexual activities with Ursa and Bolt.\n\nAnd between November 2020 and April 2022, Britton sourced 42 dogs of varying breeds and ages which he later \"tortured and sexually exploited for his own sadistic sexual pleasure\".\n\n\"His deliberate and planned conduct resulted in the intentional killing of at least 39 of those animals,\" the crown facts state.\n\nIn March 2022 his double life began to unravel after an online user spotted a bright orange Darwin council dog leash in the background of a video he had shared.\n\nThe video showed Britton sexually exploiting, torturing and killing one adult female dog and at least eight puppies.\n\nThe anonymous tip-off to authorities sparked Operation Haine -- an investigation by the NT Police and Australian Federal Police's Joint Anti-Child Exploitation Team -- which identified Britton as the perpetrator.\n\nIn April 2022 a search warrant was executed at his home on Darwin's outskirts.\n\nPolice seized 44 items including computers, mobile phones, cameras, external hard drives, tools, weapons, dog paraphernalia and sex toys.\n\nDetectives discovered severed dog limbs in a freezer, a decomposing puppy in a pond, and a severed dog head on a neighbouring property.\n\nPolice also found 15 child abuse material files on Britton's laptop, which he had sourced online, including a toddler being forced to engage in bestiality.\n\nBritton was arrested and has been in custody ever since.\n\nIn September, he pleaded guilty to 60 offences including bestiality, possessing child abuse material and other animal cruelty charges.\n\nDuring that court mention, senior Crown prosecutor Marty Aust told the court Britton had used websites such as Gumtree to source new dogs, promising their former owners he would give them a \"good home\" and then reassuring them that their dogs were \"settling in well\".\n\n\"Unbeknownst to the previous owners the dogs had already been sexually exploited, tortured and killed by the offender,\" Mr Aust said.\n\nAt the time Chief Justice Grant warned the gallery the facts of the offending detailed \"acts that could only be described as grotesque cruelty which are both confronting and distressing\".\n\n\"Which in my assessment have the potential to cause nervous shock or some other adverse psychological reaction to a person exposed to those details,\" he said.\n\nThe offences described in the 83-page Crown Facts, obtained by The Nightly, are too traumatising to publish.\n\nMost of the abuse took place at Britton's home where he filmed himself raping, torturing and killing dogs in a shipping container on his property.\n\nThe 53-year-old would edit the videos and black out identifying features that could be traced back to him, before sharing the videos via two Telegram accounts.\n\nUsing these applications the offender discussed his 'kill count', referred to dogs as 'f--- toys' and described the shipping container on his property as his 'torture room'.\n\n\"The offender utilised the accounts exclusively to engage with likeminded users about bestiality and animal cruelty,\" the crown facts state.\n\n\"Through the material he posted on Telegram, the offender promoted and incited violence against animals as well as the images depicting bestiality, acts of torture and the infliction of extreme violence and cruelty against animals, particularly dogs.\"\n\nInvestigators recovered hundreds of online messages in which Britton advised others on how to source animals to exploit.\n\n\"Most people want to know you're a good person and the dog is going to a good home, it'll have space to play, you'll take it for walks, it might live in the house etc. Telling them you want a new family member after your old dog died from cancer last year hardly ever fails,\" he advised one person.\n\nIn another message Britton mused on \"why I love to hurt dogs\".\n\n\"I wasn't sure at first, but now I live for it. I can't stop myself hurting dogs,\" he said.\n\n\"I always had it in me, I was sadistic as a child to animals, but I had repressed it. In the last few years I let it out again, and now I can't stop. I don't want to.\"\n\nThe depraved crocodile expert said he remembered \"being sadistic to small animals\" when he aged seven or eight, with his interest turning sexual at age 12.\n\n\"I started fence jumping when I was 13 or 14 and molesting horses,\" he said.\n\n\"I repressed it but it really started to come back out again in my fantasies in my 20s and 30s.\"\n\nBefore Justice Grant delivered his sentence on Thursday, Britton's barrister -- who does not want to be named -- read an apology from her client in which he expressed shame and remorse.\n\n\"I take full responsibility for the demeaning crimes that I perpetrated on dogs,\" he said.\n\n\"I deeply regret the pain and trauma that I caused to innocent animals and consequently to my family, friends and members of the community that I affected.\n\n\"I now acknowledge that I've been fighting a rare paraphilic disorder for much of my life and that shame and fear prevented me from seeking the proper help I needed.\n\n\"No amount of words can convey how sorry and ashamed I am, nor undo what I did.\"\n\nHe vowed to seek long term treatment and \"find a path towards redemption\".\n\n\"Please give my family the space they deserve to heal. They were not aware or involved in any way,\" he said.\n\nThe disgraced zoologist, whose sentence was backdated to April 22, will be eligible to apply for parole in six years.\n\nTo report animal cruelty, contact the RSPCA.\n\nGet the latest news from thewest.com.au in your inbox.\n\nSign up for our emails", "source": {"uri": "thewest.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "The West Australian"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoophilia", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Zoophilia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crocodile", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Crocodile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruelty_to_animals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cruelty to animals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torture", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Torture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulysses_S._Grant", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ulysses S.

I am unable to conceive of anything worse,\" Justice Grant said.\n\nBritton's crimes continued from 2014 until his arrest in April 2022 after one of the videos of his offending, which he had shared online, was anonymously provided to Northern Territory animal welfare authorities.\n\nBritton was required to be sentenced under the territory's animal protection laws at the time of his offending, which had a maximum of two years' jail for aggravated cruelty with intent to cause animal death.\n\nThe territory has since increased the maximum sentence to five years.\n\n\"Society views violence and cruelty to animals as an abhorrent crime towards a powerless and innocent victim. There is legitimate disgust and condemnation,\" Justice Grant said.\n\nHe warned the public gallery he would have to describe Britton's \"grotesque cruelty\".\n\n\"Your depravity falls outside any ordinary human conception,\" Justice Grant told Britton.\n\nPeople in the public gallery at times sobbed and gasped as the details of Britton's extensive and violent offending, resulting in the deaths of 39 dogs including nine puppies, were read out.\n\nBritton stood in the dock wearing a black suit with a grey shirt and did not visibly react to Justice Grant's sentencing remarks.\n\nJustice Grant said Britton's torture and killings were planned, and premeditated and would not have stopped unless arrested.\n\n\"The suffering of these animals was indescribable,\" Justice Grant said.\n\nAnimal advocates had earlier demonstrated outside court holding signs demanding Britton face the death penalty.\n\nBritton was also sentenced for possessing and transmitting \"the worst category\" of child sexual abuse material.\n\nJustice Grant said Britton had a lifelong deviant sexual attraction to animals and escalated to \"zoosadism\", involving him taking pleasure in harming animals, in the two years before his arrest.\n\nTwo psychiatrists found Britton had a paraphilic disorder but was aware his actions were wrong.\n\nBritton wrote a letter to the court taking responsibility for his actions and apologising for the demeaning pain and trauma he caused to the dogs.\n\n\"No amount of words can convey how sorry and ashamed I am, nor undo what I did,\" Britton wrote.\n\nAs well as torturing his own dogs, Britton sourced other canines off Gumtree Australia from unsuspecting owners in the Darwin region.\n\nThe agreed facts stated Britton extensively filmed his offending and shared some of the videos with others online while encouraging them to commit similar offences.\n\n\"Your sheer and unalloyed pleasure is sickeningly evident from the recorded material,\" Justice Grant said.\n\nBritton participated in hundreds of online discussions in which he described his arousal at producing \"snuff\" videos.\n\n\"I can't stop myself hurting dogs ...

Britton was arrested in April 2022 after a search of his rural Darwin property, which also uncovered child abuse material on his laptop.\n\nMuch of the detail of Britton's crimes are too graphic to publish, and so \"grotesque\" Chief Justice Michael Grant warned the courtroom they could cause \"nervous shock\".\n\nAs the facts of the case were read aloud, some members of the public rushed outside. Others watching from the gallery cried and mouthed insults at Britton. He at times hung his head and reached for tissues.\n\nCalling the offending \"devious\", Justice Grant said the \"unalloyed pleasure\" Britton took in torturing the animals was \"sickeningly evident\".\n\n\"[Your] depravity falls entirely outside any ordinary human conception,\" he said.\n\nIncluding time already served, Britton could be eligible for parole in September 2028. He is also banned from owning any mammals for the rest of his life.\n\nMr Britton's lawyer argued his offending was driven by a rare disorder causing intense, atypical sexual interests.\n\nIn court on Thursday, they read out a letter from Britton, who apologised for his \"demeaning crimes\".\n\n\"I deeply regret the pain and trauma that I caused to innocent animals and consequently to my family, friends and members of the community,\" it said.\n\nAdding that his family was not aware or involved in any way, he wrote: \"I will seek long term treatment and... I will find a path towards redemption.\"\n\nAbuse spans decades\n\nBorn in West Yorkshire, Britton grew up in the UK before moving to Australia more than 20 years ago to work with crocodiles.\n\nWith a PhD in zoology, he had built a global reputation for his expertise, even hosting Sir David Attenborough while the veteran broadcaster filmed part of the Life in Cold Blood docuseries on his property.\n\nLocals have told media he seemed like a quiet but passionate defender of animals.\n\nBut he was harbouring a \"sadistic sexual interest\" in them, court documents say. Exchanges with \"like-minded\" people in secret online chatrooms detail how Britton began molesting horses at the age of 13.\n\n\"I was sadistic as a child to animals, but I had repressed it. In the last few years I let it out again, and now I can't stop. I don't want to. :),\" he wrote in one message tendered to the court.\n\nFor at least the past decade, Britton had exploited his own pets and manipulated other dog owners into giving him theirs.\n\n\"My own dogs are family and I have limits,\" he explained in a Telegram chat entered into evidence.\n\n\"I only badly mistreat other dogs... I have no emotional bond to them, they are toys pure and simple. And [there are] plenty more where they came from.\"\n\nHe tortured at least 42 dogs, killing 39 of them, according to court documents seen by the BBC. The files only detail his crimes over the 18 months before his arrest, but still fill more than 90 pages.\n\nUsing online marketplace Gumtree Australia, Britton would find people who were often reluctantly giving their pets away due to travel or work commitments. He would build a \"rapport\" with them to negotiate taking custody of the animals and if they reached out for updates on their old pets, the court heard he would tell them \"false narratives\" and send them old photos.\n\nIn reality, he was abusing the animals in a shipping container on his property that had been fitted out with recording equipment - which he called his \"torture room\" - before sharing footage of his crimes online using aliases.\n\nBritton would also coach others on how to copy his behaviour and get rid of the evidence.\n\nAsked how to dispose of the dogs' remains, Britton - who shared his sprawling property on the outskirts of Darwin with eight crocodiles - said \"some I feed to other animals\".\n\nHe was only caught after uploading a clip in which he tortured at least eight dogs - all except one were puppies - which was passed on to NT police in an anonymous tip-off.\n\nBritton usually went to great lengths to avoid identifying himself or his location in his videos, but in this one a bright orange City of Darwin dog leash could be seen in the background.\n\nWithin weeks, in April 2022, police swooped on his property and arrested Britton, who has been remanded in custody ever since.\n\nThey seized recording devices, animal remains and a laptop on which they also located 15 files containing child abuse material.\n\nAnimal advocates say the case shows the need for stronger animal cruelty penalties.\n\nSpeaking outside court, many who had travelled from all over the country for the hearing expressed disappointment at the sentence, but said it offered some solace to the owners of the pets Britton abused.\n\nAddressing the zoologist directly, one activist told Britton he was \"right where you should be - locked up.\"\n\n\"Once respected and esteemed, you're now a disgrace to the scientific community,\" said Natalie Carey. \"No one will ever look at you with admiration again.\"", "source": {"uri": "myjoyonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MyJoyOnline.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathaniel_Lord_Britton", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nathaniel Lord Britton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crocodile", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Crocodile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Northern Territory"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Northern Territory"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulysses_S._Grant", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ulysses S.

"Vile zoologist jailed for sickening rape, killing of animals", "body": "WARNING: This story contains graphic details of animal cruelty and references child abuse.\n\nA pre-eminent crocodile specialist will spend the next decade behind bars after being sentenced over one of the most sickening bestiality and animal cruelty cases in Australian history.\n\nNorthern Territory Supreme Court Chief Justice Michael Grant today sentenced Adam Robert Corden Britton to 10 years and five months in prison after he pleaded guilty to more than 60 offences of sickening bestiality, animal cruelty and possessing child exploitation material.\n\nPrior to his arrest two years ago, UK-born Britton was a respected senior research associate at Charles Darwin University and ran crocodile research consultancy Big Gecko with his former wife.\n\nThe couple lived in McMinns Lagoon, about 30km south of Darwin, with their two Swiss-Sheppard dogs, Ursa and Bolt, and a number of pet saltwater crocodiles.\n\nCourt documents reveal that from about 2014, Britton began engaging in sexual activities with Ursa and Bolt.\n\nAnd between November 2020 and April 2022, Britton sourced 42 dogs of varying breeds and ages which he later \"tortured and sexually exploited for his own sadistic sexual pleasure\".\n\n\"His deliberate and planned conduct resulted in the intentional killing of at least 39 of those animals,\" the crown facts state.\n\nIn March 2022 his double life began to unravel after an online user spotted a bright orange Darwin council dog leash in the background of a video he had shared.\n\nThe video showed Britton sexually exploiting, torturing and killing one adult female dog and at least eight puppies.\n\nThe anonymous tip-off to authorities sparked Operation Haine -- an investigation by the NT Police and Australian Federal Police's Joint Anti-Child Exploitation Team -- which identified Britton as the perpetrator.\n\nIn April 2022 a search warrant was executed at his home on Darwin's outskirts.\n\nPolice seized 44 items including computers, mobile phones, cameras, external hard drives, tools, weapons, dog paraphernalia and sex toys.\n\nDetectives discovered severed dog limbs in a freezer, a decomposing puppy in a pond, and a severed dog head on a neighbouring property.\n\nPolice also found 15 child abuse material files on Britton's laptop, which he had sourced online, including a toddler being forced to engage in bestiality.\n\nBritton was arrested and has been in custody ever since.\n\nIn September, he pleaded guilty to 60 offences including bestiality, possessing child abuse material and other animal cruelty charges.\n\nDuring that court mention, senior Crown prosecutor Marty Aust told the court Britton had used websites such as Gumtree to source new dogs, promising their former owners he would give them a \"good home\" and then reassuring them that their dogs were \"settling in well\".\n\n\"Unbeknownst to the previous owners the dogs had already been sexually exploited, tortured and killed by the offender,\" Mr Aust said.\n\nAt the time Chief Justice Grant warned the gallery the facts of the offending detailed \"acts that could only be described as grotesque cruelty which are both confronting and distressing\".\n\n\"Which in my assessment have the potential to cause nervous shock or some other adverse psychological reaction to a person exposed to those details,\" he said.\n\nThe offences described in the 83-page Crown Facts, obtained by The Nightly, are too traumatising to publish.\n\nMost of the abuse took place at Britton's home where he filmed himself raping, torturing and killing dogs in a shipping container on his property.\n\nThe 53-year-old would edit the videos and black out identifying features that could be traced back to him, before sharing the videos via two Telegram accounts.\n\nUsing these applications the offender discussed his 'kill count', referred to dogs as 'f--- toys' and described the shipping container on his property as his 'torture room'.\n\n\"The offender utilised the accounts exclusively to engage with likeminded users about bestiality and animal cruelty,\" the crown facts state.\n\n\"Through the material he posted on Telegram, the offender promoted and incited violence against animals as well as the images depicting bestiality, acts of torture and the infliction of extreme violence and cruelty against animals, particularly dogs.\"\n\nInvestigators recovered hundreds of online messages in which Britton advised others on how to source animals to exploit.\n\n\"Most people want to know you're a good person and the dog is going to a good home, it'll have space to play, you'll take it for walks, it might live in the house etc. Telling them you want a new family member after your old dog died from cancer last year hardly ever fails,\" he advised one person.\n\nIn another message Britton mused on \"why I love to hurt dogs\".\n\n\"I wasn't sure at first, but now I live for it. I can't stop myself hurting dogs,\" he said.\n\n\"I always had it in me, I was sadistic as a child to animals, but I had repressed it. In the last few years I let it out again, and now I can't stop. I don't want to.\"\n\nThe depraved crocodile expert said he remembered \"being sadistic to small animals\" when he aged seven or eight, with his interest turning sexual at age 12.\n\n\"I started fence jumping when I was 13 or 14 and molesting horses,\" he said.\n\n\"I repressed it but it really started to come back out again in my fantasies in my 20s and 30s.\"\n\nBefore Justice Grant delivered his sentence on Thursday, Britton's barrister -- who does not want to be named -- read an apology from her client in which he expressed shame and remorse.\n\n\"I take full responsibility for the demeaning crimes that I perpetrated on dogs,\" he said.\n\n\"I deeply regret the pain and trauma that I caused to innocent animals and consequently to my family, friends and members of the community that I affected.\n\n\"I now acknowledge that I've been fighting a rare paraphilic disorder for much of my life and that shame and fear prevented me from seeking the proper help I needed.\n\n\"No amount of words can convey how sorry and ashamed I am, nor undo what I did.\"\n\nHe vowed to seek long term treatment and \"find a path towards redemption\".\n\n\"Please give my family the space they deserve to heal. They were not aware or involved in any way,\" he said.\n\nThe disgraced zoologist, whose sentence was backdated to April 22, will be eligible to apply for parole in six years.", "source": {"uri": "perthnow.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "Perth Now"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoophilia", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Zoophilia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crocodile", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Crocodile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruelty_to_animals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cruelty to animals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulysses_S._Grant", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ulysses S.

Swiss Shepherds Ursa and Bolt - in a secret 'torture room' constructed on his rural property in McMinns Lagoon near the city of Darwin.\n\nHe continued until his arrest in April 2022 after a video of his vile acts, which he had shared online, was provided to Australia's Northern Territory animal welfare authorities.\n\nAn anonymous internet user noticed a female dog in one of his horrific videos was wearing an orange City of Darwin leash with the slogan, 'great pets start with you'.\n\nThat tip-off enabled investigators to track down where the dog was adopted from - and by whom.\n\nThe agreed facts stated Britton extensively filmed his offending in his so-called 'torture room' and shared videos online under pseudonyms while encouraging others to commit similar offences and offering 'how to' advice.\n\n'Your sheer and unalloyed pleasure is sickeningly evident from the recorded material,' Justice Grant said.\n\nAs well as torturing his dogs that he had raised, Britton bought sought canines featured in Gumtree Australia 'free to good home' adverts from unsuspecting owners in the Darwin region.\n\nBritton was also sentenced for possessing and transmitting 'the worst category' of child sexual abuse material.\n\nThe British citizen was a prominent crocodile expert and a senior researcher at Charles Darwin University - a post which afforded him the opportunity to host the likes of world-famous broadcaster and biologist David Attenborough while he filmed the BBC's Life in Cold Blood docuseries.\n\nNone of his offending is alleged to have been against the reptiles.\n\nThe zoologist kept his twisted double life and depraved fantasies from his wife Erin for years.\n\nErin, a wildlife ranger who once met Prince Harry and helped him catch a crocodile, has reportedly changed her surname since learning of her husband's crimes.\n\nBritton not only tortured and sexually abused his own pets Ursa and Bolt (pictured together), who he created an Instagram page for, but also dogs from pet owners he had lured into his trap through the online marketplace platform Gumtree Australia\n\nIn 2016, Britton uploaded a photo of one of his dogs, Bolt, as a puppy (pictured)\n\nThe court heard Britton started abusing his dogs, Ursa and Bolt (pictured), in 2014\n\nAdam Britton (centre) with his wife Erin (left) and David Attenborough (right) during filming for a BBC documentary Cold Blood\n\nDuring Britton's trial, prosecutors told the court he maintained several accounts on the Telegram messaging app - one which he used to engage with 'like-minded people', and another which was used to disseminate images and recordings of the abuse.\n\n'Using these applications, the offender discussed his ''kill count'',' the prosecutor told the court. His account had 114 threads where he described how he acquired the pets and how he abused them.\n\nThe court learned how Britton once told a Telegram user of his violent compulsions: 'I had repressed it. In the last few years I let it out again, and now I can't stop. I don't want to.'\n\nRead More The leash that snared Brit dog rapist Adam Britton\n\nBritton sourced other dogs from Gumtree Australia from unsuspecting owners in the Darwin region.\n\nThe court previously heard he built rapport with the owners and negotiated taking custody of their pets, many of whom reluctantly gave their pets away due to travel or work commitments.\n\nHe would tell pet owners on Gumtree that his old dog had died of cancer and he wanted a 'new family member' in order to make them have pity on him and sell them their dog, the court heard.\n\nIf the pet owners reached out and asked Britton how their old dog was doing, he would spin a 'false narrative' to say they were healthy and even send them old photos - when in reality their pet was already dead.\n\nIn one scenario, Britton sent a message to the owners of a large brown dog named Wolfe to reassure them the animal was 'settling in well'. The prosecutor told the court that dog Wolfe had already been 'sexually exploited, tortured and killed'.\n\nFollowing his arrest in 2022, police seized 44 items including computers, mobile telephones, cameras, external hard drives, tools and weapons during a raid of his home. They also found 15 child abuse material files on his laptop.\n\nBut Britton's sentence was met with outrage by animal rights activists in Australia.\n\nEmma Hurst, who is an MP for the Animal Justice Party in New South Wales, slammed the sentence as 'pathetically weak'.\n\n'These were horrific acts of animal cruelty,' Ms Hurst said.\n\n'There is a well-researched link between violence towards animals and violence towards people.\n\n'This man is a danger to other animals and the community. I am relieved to hear his sentence includes time behind bars - that's where a man like this belongs - but it is not long enough.'\n\nBritish-born crocodile expert admitted sexually abusing puppies and torturing dozens of dogs at his animal shelter in Australia\n\nBritton's wife Erin, a wildlife ranger who once met Prince Harry and helped him catch a crocodile, has reportedly changed her surname since learning of her husband's crimes\n\nPrince Harry is seen catching a crocodile as he is aided by Britton's wife Erin\n\nBritton's sprawling rural property was put up for sale but protesters spray painted 'Dog Killer' on the walls\n\nBritton's barrister, who has asked not to be named because she has been subject to personal abuse and threats for representing him, had argued a lifetime ban on all animal ownership was an 'extreme measure'.\n\nShe argued Britton should be allowed to own or live with any creatures other than 'mammals' and the ban should not last a lifetime because of the 'reasonable prospects of rehabilitation'.\n\nBut she also read the court an apology that she claimed had been penned by her client.\n\n'I take full responsibility for the demeaning crimes that I perpetrated on dogs,' Britton said.\n\n'I deeply regret the pain and trauma that I caused to innocent animals and consequently to my family, friends and members of the community that I affected, I let you all down and I'm truly sorry.\n\n'I now acknowledge that I've been fighting a rare paraphilic disorder for much of my life and that shame and fear prevented me from seeking the proper help I needed.'\n\nBritton said 'no amount of words can convey how sorry and ashamed I am, nor undo what I did' but he was 'determined to prove I am better than this'.\n\n'I will seek long-term treatment and find a path towards redemption,' his letter read.\n\n'Please give my family the space they deserve to heal, they were not aware or involved in any way.'\n\nParaphilia is defined as having persistent and recurrent sexual interests, urges, fantasies, or behaviours of marked intensity involving objects, activities, or even situations that are atypical in nature.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathaniel_Lord_Britton", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nathaniel Lord Britton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulysses_S._Grant", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ulysses S.

He also admitted to four counts of accessing child abuse material.\n\nThe Northern Territory (NT) Supreme Court heard the 53-year-old filmed himself torturing the animals until almost all died, and then shared the videos online under pseudonyms.\n\nAccording to reports, the prosecutors told the court that Britton has had a 'sadistic sexual interest' in animals and in particular dogs since at least 2014. They said the man used to torture animals in his \"torture room\" until their death, record acts and post the material online.\n\nIn an unusual move, Chief Justice Michael Grant, alarmed by the horrifying and 'grotesque' nature of Britton's crimes, requested that both the public and security staff vacate the courtroom before the prosecutors presented the details of the case.\n\nWho is Adam Britton?\n\nBritton, who grew up in UK's West Yorkshire before he moved to Australia 20 years ago, is a leading zoologist who has worked with the BBC and National Geographic on productions.

The proceedings in this case have been adjourned until December for the sentencing phase.\n\nHow Britton Got Dozens of Dogs?\n\nBritton lured a trap through an online marketplace platform to get dogs from dog owners. He utilized the platform to specifically target pet owners in the Darwin region, many of whom were reluctantly seeking new homes for their pets due to work or travel obligations.\n\nWhen contacted by pet owners seeking updates on their former pets, Britton would construct a 'false narrative,' assuring them that the animals were in good health and even sending them outdated photos.\n\nAccording to the prosecution, Britton maintained a Telegram account through which he communicated with \"like-minded individuals.\"\n\nUnder various pseudonyms, Britton would post videos and images of himself sexually exploiting the dogs on online forums.", "source": {"uri": "news18.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News18"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

He also uploaded the videos online under pseudonyms.\n\nMembers sitting in the public gallery were seen sobbing and gasping as the details of Britton's violence and extensive offences were being read out. At least 39 dogs, including nine puppies, died as a result of the abuse by the Charles Darwin University academic.\n\nBritton both tortured his own dogs and managed to source other canines from unsuspecting owners from Gumtree Australia in the Darwin region.\n\nHe encouraged others online to commit similar offences and shared advice on carrying out bestiality, according to the agreed facts of the case read out in court.\n\nJustice Grant remarked: \"Your sheer and unalloyed pleasure is sickeningly evident from the recorded material.\"\n\nBritton has also been sentenced for possessing and transmitting \"the worst category\" of child sexual abuse material.\n\nBritton did not visibly react to the sentencing remarks by Justice Grant as he stood in the dock in a black suit and grey shirt.\n\nIn his sentencing, Justice Grant said Britton was banned from owning any mammal species of animal, or having them on his property, for the duration of his natural life.\n\nThe court recorded Britton's offences to have begun in 2014 until his arrest in April 2022. They first came to light when a video of his offences reached the Northern Territory animal welfare authorities anonymously.\n\nOutside the court where hearing was underway, animal right advocates labelled Britton as a \"zoosadist\" and said he deserved the death penalty. Capital punishment has been outlawed throughout Australia since 1985.\n\nBritton has also pleaded guilty to four counts of accessing and transmitting child abuse material.\n\n\"I was talking with someone else about why I love to hurt dogs,\" he wrote in a secret chat group. \"I wasn't sure at first, but now I live for it. I can't stop myself hurting dogs.\n\n\"I was sadistic as a child to animals, but I had repressed it. In the last few years I let it out again, and now I can't stop.

Justice Grant warned the courtroom they could cause \"nervous shock.\"\n\nAs the facts of the case were read aloud, some members of the public rushed outside. Others in the gallery wept and muttered insults at Britton. At times, he hung his head and reached for tissues.\n\nJustice Grant described the offences as \"devious\" and said that the \"unalloyed pleasure\" Britton derived from torturing the animals was \"sickeningly evident.\" He further stated that Britton's \"depravity falls entirely outside any ordinary human conception\".\n\nBritton's lawyer contended that his criminal behaviour stemmed from a rare disorder that led to intense and unusual sexual interests. During Thursday's court session, a letter from Britton was read aloud, in which he expressed remorse for his \"demeaning crimes.\"\n\n\"I deeply regret the pain and trauma I caused to innocent animals and, in turn, to my family, friends, and the community,\" the letter stated.\n\nHe further emphasised that his family was neither aware of nor involved in his actions. \"I will pursue long-term treatment and... strive to find a path toward redemption,\" reported the BBC.\n\nAustralia's national broadcaster, ABC, reported that Britton acquired 42 dogs online between 2020 and 2022, promising their owners a \"good home.\"\n\nInstead, Britton filmed himself torturing and killing the dogs in a shipping container on his Darwin property. The footage was shared under a pseudonym via Telegram.\n\nHe was finally caught after uploading a clip where he tortured at least eight dogs. Most of them were puppies. The clip was used to anonymously tip off the police.\n\nBritton typically took great care to conceal his identity and location in his videos.

Most of the dogs he acquired were horrifically abused and murdered within a few days of him gaining ownership.\n\nDuring sentencing, Chief Justice Michael Grant told Britton: 'Your depravity falls outside any ordinary human conception.'\n\nAnimal lovers flew to Darwin from all over Australia to watch the sentencing, but Britton did receive some support. His mother wrote a character reference for the court, as did two former colleagues.\n\nBritton also tendered a short, hand-written apology detailing his struggles with 'a rare paraphilic disorder' - intense sexual behaviours that involve inanimate objects, children, or non-consenting adults - for which he was too ashamed to seek help.\n\nAdam Britton was sentenced to 10 years and five months in jail with a non-parole period of six years, backdated to his April 2022 arrest\n\nAdam Britton wrote a grovelling apology for harming the animals, which was tendered to the court (pictured)\n\nThe apology read: 'I take full responsibility for the demeaning crimes I perpetrated on dogs. I deeply regret pain and trauma that I caused to innocent animals, and consequently to my family, friends and members of the community I affected.\n\n'I let you all down, and I'm truly sorry.\n\n'I now acknowledge that I've been fighting a rare paraphilic disorder for much of my life, and that shame and fear prevented me from seeking the proper help I needed.'\n\nBritton said he was determined to seek long-term treatment to prove he was better than his horrific crimes, and to 'find a path towards redemption'.\n\n'Please give my family the space they deserve to heal. They were not aware or involved in any way,' he added.\n\nPrior to his sentence being handed down, there was a brief adjournment.\n\nWhen court resumed, onlookers said Britton had intentionally moved his chair so that he was behind a computer screen so those sitting in the public gallery couldn't see him.\n\nMembers of the public leaned forward so he could not escape their hate-filled gazes.\n\nBritton (pictured left, with his wife Erin) once hosted Sir David Attenborough (right). There is no suggestion whatsoever that his wife knew about his offending\n\nPictured: Adam Britton, when he was a respected academic and zoologist\n\nWhen the judge started reading his sentence, Britton grabbed a tissue. Some members of the public scoffed, while others had to leave the court because they were too upset by Britton's crimes.\n\nBritton, who would post horrific footage of animal abuse on his Telegram channel under the pseudonym 'Cerberus', managed to keep his twisted double life secret from his wife Erin for years.\n\nHe would use the Telegram account to engage with 'like-minded people', and another which was used to disseminate images and recordings of the abuse.\n\nErin, a wildlife ranger and biologist who once met Prince Harry and helped him catch a crocodile, has since reportedly changed her name. There is no suggestion that Erin knew anything of her husband's crimes.\n\nBritton's arrest came just a month after he uploaded a video called '1B***h9pups' to an abuse website, in March 2022.\n\nThe court heard on Thursday that Britton bought the dog and her nine puppies for $150, for the sole purpose of torturing the animals to death at a site called Shano's Pit near his McMinns Lagoon home.\n\nHe wanted it to be the best known 'shock video' on the internet, but all it did was anger internet users who were disgusted with the obscene levels of violence and scoured the video looking for clues to unmask the perpetrator.\n\nPictured: A mock-up of a Telegram conversation Britton had with a user\n\nPictured: A stock image of a dog wearing an orange City of Darwin leash - like the one the internet sleuth spotted in Britton's abuse video\n\nRead More\n\nBREAKING NEWS\n\nDepraved dog rapist who sexually abused and killed dozens of animals is jailed for 10 years\n\nBritton was arrested in April 2022 after an anonymous internet user noticed a female dog in one of his online videos was wearing an orange City of Darwin leash with the slogan, 'great pets start with you'.\n\nThe clue enabled authorities to track who had adopted the dog.\n\nJustice Grant said it was 'manifestly clear' that Britton derived 'perverse pleasure and excitement from the suffering of these animals', as evident with his interactions with others in Telegram.\n\n'Your conduct on each of those occasions involved a degree of depravity and reprehensibility which falls entirely outside any ordinary human conception and comprehension,' the judge said.\n\nDespite the hand-written apology, the judge was not satisfied that Britton was genuinely remorseful, and accepted the Crown's view that Britton's prominent diagnosis was zoosadism (sexual pleasure derived from cruelty to animals).\n\n'You used weapons extensively in the course of your activity,' Justice Grant said.\n\n'As the Crown has submitted, the sheer and unalloyed pleasure that you derive from inflicting this torture is sickeningly evident.'\n\nIn 2022, new legislation was introduced in the NT increasing penalties for animal cruelty from a maximum of two years to five years, but Britton's offending predated the reforms.\n\nHe was also banned from owning a mammal for the rest of his natural life.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathaniel_Lord_Britton", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nathaniel Lord Britton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraphilia", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paraphilia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoology", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Zoology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pet", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crocodile", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Crocodile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parole", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Parole"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin,_Northern_Territory", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Darwin, Northern Territory"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Darwin, Northern Territory"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telegram_(messaging_service)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Telegram (messaging service)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_Northern_Territory", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the Northern Territory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoophilia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Zoophilia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Justice_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief Justice of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruelty_to_animals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cruelty to animals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_sexual_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Child sexual abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulysses_S._Grant", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ulysses S.

His account had 114 threads where he described how he acquired the pets and how he abused them.\n\nThe court learned how Britton once told a Telegram user of his violent compulsions: 'I had repressed it. In the last few years I let it out again, and now I can't stop. I don't want to.'\n\nBritton sourced other dogs from Gumtree Australia from unsuspecting owners in the Darwin region.\n\nThe court previously heard he built rapport with the owners and negotiated taking custody of their pets, many of whom reluctantly gave their pets away due to travel or work commitments.\n\nHe would tell pet owners on Gumtree that his old dog had died of cancer and he wanted a 'new family member' in order to make them have pity on him and sell them their dog, the court heard.\n\nIf the pet owners reached out and asked Britton how their old dog was doing, he would spin a 'false narrative' to say they were healthy and even send them old photos - when in reality their pet was already dead.\n\nIn one scenario, Britton sent a message to the owners of a large brown dog named Wolfe to reassure them the animal was 'settling in well'. The prosecutor told the court that dog Wolfe had already been 'sexually exploited, tortured and killed'.\n\nFollowing his arrest in 2022, police seized 44 items including computers, mobile telephones, cameras, external hard drives, tools and weapons during a raid of his home. They also found 15 child abuse material files on his laptop.\n\nBut Britton's sentence was met with outrage by animal rights activists in Australia.\n\nEmma Hurst, who is an MP for the Animal Justice Party in New South Wales, slammed the sentence as 'pathetically weak'.\n\n'These were horrific acts of animal cruelty,' Ms Hurst said.\n\n'There is a well-researched link between violence towards animals and violence towards people.\n\n'This man is a danger to other animals and the community. I am relieved to hear his sentence includes time behind bars - that's where a man like this belongs - but it is not long enough.'\n\nBritton's barrister, who has asked not to be named because she has been subject to personal abuse and threats for representing him, had argued a lifetime ban on all animal ownership was an 'extreme measure'.\n\nShe argued Britton should be allowed to own or live with any creatures other than 'mammals' and the ban should not last a lifetime because of the 'reasonable prospects of rehabilitation'.\n\nBut she also read the court an apology that she claimed had been penned by her client.\n\n'I take full responsibility for the demeaning crimes that I perpetrated on dogs,' Britton said.\n\n'I deeply regret the pain and trauma that I caused to innocent animals and consequently to my family, friends and members of the community that I affected, I let you all down and I'm truly sorry.\n\n'I now acknowledge that I've been fighting a rare paraphilic disorder for much of my life and that shame and fear prevented me from seeking the proper help I needed.'\n\nBritton said 'no amount of words can convey how sorry and ashamed I am, nor undo what I did' but he was 'determined to prove I am better than this'.\n\n'I will seek long-term treatment and find a path towards redemption,' his letter read.\n\n'Please give my family the space they deserve to heal, they were not aware or involved in any way.'\n\nParaphilia is defined as having persistent and recurrent sexual interests, urges, fantasies, or behaviours of marked intensity involving objects, activities, or even situations that are atypical in nature.", "source": {"uri": "internewscast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Internewscast Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathaniel_Lord_Britton", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nathaniel Lord Britton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulysses_S._Grant", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ulysses S.

He also admitted to four counts of accessing child abuse material.\n\nThe Northern Territory Supreme Court heard that Britton filmed himself torturing the animals, most of which died as a result, and shared the videos online using pseudonyms.\n\nHis crimes went undetected for years until investigators uncovered a clue in one of his videos.\n\nBritton was arrested in April 2022 following a search of his rural property near Darwin, which also led to the discovery of child abuse material on his laptop.\n\nThe details of Britton's offences were deemed so graphic that Chief Justice Michael Grant warned the courtroom they could cause \"nervous shock\".\n\nAs the facts were read aloud, some members of the public left the courtroom, while others wept and directed insults at the defendant.\n\nIn his ruling, Justice Grant condemned Britton's actions as \"devious\" and noted that the \"unalloyed pleasure\" he took in torturing the animals was \"sickeningly evident\".\n\n\"[Your] depravity falls entirely outside any ordinary human conception,\" the judge stated.\n\nBritton could be eligible for parole in September 2028, taking into account time already served. He has been banned from owning mammals for life.\n\nThe defence argued that Britton's crimes were driven by a rare disorder causing intense, atypical sexual interests. In court, a letter from Britton was read out, in which he apologised for his \"demeaning crimes\".\n\n\"I deeply regret the pain and trauma that I caused to innocent animals and consequently to my family, friends and members of the community,\" the letter said.\n\nBritton also emphasised that his family was not aware of or involved in his actions, adding, \"I will seek long term treatment and... I will find a path towards redemption.\"\n\nBritton, originally from West Yorkshire, spent his formative years in the UK before relocating to Australia over two decades ago to pursue his work with crocodiles.\n\nA highly qualified zoologist with a PhD, Britton had established himself as a globally recognised expert in his field.\n\nHis reputation was such that he even hosted the esteemed naturalist Sir David Attenborough at his property during the filming of part of the acclaimed Life in Cold Blood documentary series.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news",

The couple settled in the Northern Territory, where he became a respected academic at the Charles Darwin University.\n\nIn public, he was an expert on saltwater crocodiles and appeared on television with celebrities including Sir David and Bear Grylls.\n\nOnline, however, Britton was \"Monster\" and \"Cerberus\" - the provider of images so sickening they would later traumatise investigators and lead a judge to recommend clerks and security leave a courtroom to avoid seeing the \"unspeakable\" acts.\n\n\"I have no emotional bond to them, they are toys pure and simple,\" he told online followers under his alias, about his images of beaten dogs and puppies, \"and plenty more where they came from.\"\n\nPolice said Britton would wait for his wife to be away on field trips, before taking dogs and puppies into a \"torture room\" he set up in a shipping container next to their rural home near Darwin.\n\nThere, he would film himself raping and then beating the dogs to death. Most of the 42 animals he abused he had been given for free from online classifieds site Gumtree after promising their previous owners he would give them a \"good home\".\n\n\"Your modus operandi was one of devious and careful premeditation and planning, the individuals from whom you procured these dogs thought they were going to a good home and that they would be protected,\" the judge said on Thursday.\n\n\"You took videos of the grotesque harm you were inflicting on these animals, you revisited those videos for your own sexual gratification and you shared them for the gratification of other deviants.\n\n\"The fact that you staged each of these remorseless killings as a production further reinforces the meticulous level of your planning.\"\n\nTwo dogs he attacked - Swiss Shepherds Bolt and Ursa - were the pets he shared with his wife.\n\nIt's understood she was disgusted when the crimes were uncovered and has since moved towns, changing her name to avoid any association with the case while continuing to work to promote animal welfare.\n\n'Sheer delight you took in the torture of these animals'\n\nBritton often filmed his crimes and sent them to \"like-minded\" people online and through messaging service Telegram, the court heard. At other times, he would drive the animals to a secluded location and murder them \"for his own sadistic sexual pleasure\".\n\nPolice arrested Britton in 2022 after piecing together clues in a video sent to an animal welfare agency. A raid on his property uncovered severed dog limbs, a dog's head and a decomposing puppy. A laptop found at the home featured child abuse images.\n\nBritton was charged with a string of offences relating to bestiality, animal abuse and possession of child abuse material, for crimes dating between 2020 and 2022 - but police believe his offending started much earlier.\n\nOne of the messages from 'Monster' that formed part of the case, read: \"I started fence jumping when I was 13 or 14 and molesting horses.\"\n\nJustice Grant said he believed Britton was \"likely to commit a further offence in respect of an animal and that risk will continue to present unless you are subjected to effective psychotherapy and antilibidinal treatment\".\n\n\"I'm less ready to accept that you are genuinely remorseful, that is particularly so having regard to the sheer delight you took in the torture of these animals and the persistence of your conduct,\" he said.\n\n\"And what appears to be your continuing view that sexual interactions with animals short of sadism isn't harmful.\"\n\nMr Giliam of the RSPCA likened the NT's animal cruelty laws to \"a slap on the wrist with a wet bus ticket\" as he noted the maximum sentence for each offence was two years.\n\n\"Just about everybody knows his name now - the abhorrence and the disgust is just palpable,\" he told The Telegraph.\n\nOutside court, protesters holding placards lamented that Britton could be out of jail within four years after time already served since his arrest.\n\n\"You'll be dead before then,\" they yelled.", "source": {"uri": "telegraph.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Telegraph"}, "authors": [{"uri": "andrea_hamblin@telegraph.co.uk", "name": "Andrea Hamblin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathaniel_Lord_Britton", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nathaniel Lord Britton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoophilia", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Zoophilia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Attenborough", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "David Attenborough"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_pornography", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Child pornography"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Northern Territory"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Northern Territory"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Geographic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Geographic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacksaw", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hacksaw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screw", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Screw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulysses_S._Grant", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ulysses S.

Adam Britton, who previously submitted documentaries to the BBC and National Geographic, entered a guilty plea to 56 counts of animal cruelty and bestiality as well as four counts of obtaining and disseminating information about child abuse. He admitted to four counts of accessing child abuse material.\n\nThe 53-year-old filmed himself abusing the animals until nearly all of them died and he later posted the recordings online using fictitious names, according to the Northern Territory (NT) Supreme Court. Years passed while his abuse stayed unreported until one of his movies revealed a clue. His misdeeds were discovered owing to an anonymous tip to the authorities. An investigation of Britton's rural Darwin residence in April 2022 turned up evidence of child abuse on his laptop, leading to his arrest. Additionally, he is prohibited from owning animals on his land for the rest of his life. However, the restriction only applies while he remains in the region. Since his arrest, Britton has been held at the Darwin Correctional Center on remand.\n\nChief Justice Michael Grant cautioned the courtroom that many of the details of Britton's crimes are too explicit to disclose because they are very \"grotesque\" and could cause \"nervous shock.\" A few audience members hurried outside when the case details were read aloud. Others in the gallery sobbed and muttered derogatory remarks at Britton. Occasionally, he was spotted hanging his head and grabbing tissues. Judge Grant described the perpetrator as \"devious\" and stated that it was \"sickeningly evident\" that Britton had \"unalloyed pleasure\" in hurting the animals.\n\nHe declared, \"Your depravity falls entirely outside any ordinary human conception,\" and added, \"Although I'm loathe to do so, given the gross depravity and perversity of your actions, it is necessary for sentencing you to provide some generally representative detail and description of the offending conduct.\" Britton killed 39 dogs in a shipping container he called his \"torture room\" on his rural property on the outskirts of Darwin where he shot his inhumane acts and tortured around 42 canines. According to testimony given in court, Britton purchased the dogs online between 2020 and 2022. Reluctantly, owing to job or travel commitments, many owners handed over the pets, believing they had been adopted.\n\nChief Justice Michael Grant informed Britton that his actions \"involved a degree of depravity and reprehensibility which falls entirely outside any ordinary human conception and comprehension\" when he announced the sentence of 10 years and five months in Darwin's court. He highlighted, \"The sheer deviance and brutality of your conduct are not satisfactorily encompassed by the bare description that you killed each animal. You used weapons extensively in the course of your activity - including knives, wooden clubs, pliers, bolt cutters, hacksaws and axes.\"\n\n\"You took photographs of the dogs prior to torturing and killing them, and subsequently sent those photographs to the former owners as part of communicating false narratives that the dogs were thriving in their new environment,\" he mentioned. Britton shared footage of his killings on the free messaging app Telegram, where he went by the aliases \"Monster\" and \"Cerberus\" and talked about his abhorrent acts. According to Justice Grant, Britton encouraged violence through his conversations with other Telegram users, and it was \"manifestly clear\" that he got \"perverse pleasure and excitement from the suffering of these animals.\"\n\n\"I have no emotional bond to them, they are toys pure and simple,\" Britton told online followers under his alias, about his images of beaten dogs and puppies, \"and plenty more where they came from.\" According to the police, Britton used to put dogs and puppies in the \"torture room\" he had rigged up in a shipping container close to his rural Darwin house while his wife was gone on field excursions. He would record himself raping the dogs there and then thrash them to death. Having promised their prior owners he would give them a \"good home,\" he received the majority of the forty-two animals he mistreated for free through the online selling site Gumtree.\n\n\"Your modus operandi was one of devious and careful premeditation and planning, the individuals from whom you procured these dogs thought they were going to a good home and that they would be protected. You took videos of the grotesque harm you were inflicting on these animals, you revisited those videos for your own sexual gratification and you shared them for the gratification of other deviants. The fact that you staged each of these remorseless killings as a production further reinforces the meticulous level of your planning,\" the judge pointed out.\n\nHe and his wife owned two dogs, Swiss Shepherds named Bolt and Ursa, who he assaulted. 'Monster' sent a note that was included in the case which read, 'I started fence jumping when I was 13 or 14 and molesting horses.' Judge Grant stated that he feared Britton was \"likely to commit a further offence in respect of an animal and that risk will continue to present unless you are subjected to anti-libidinal treatment and effective psychotherapy.\"\n\n\"I'm less ready to accept that you are genuinely remorseful, that is particularly so having regard to the sheer delight you took in the torture of these animals and the persistence of your conduct. And what appears to be your continuing view that sexual interactions with animals short of sadism isn't harmful,\" the judge noted.\n\nHe left a message in an online chat forum that was produced in court which read, Britton \"was sadistic as a child to animals, but I had repressed it. In the last few years, I let it out again, and now I can't stop. I don't want to. :).\" A letter from him apologizing for his \"demeaning crimes\" was read aloud. \"I take full responsibility for the demeaning crimes that I perpetrated on dogs. I deeply regret the pain and trauma that I caused to innocent animals and consequently to my family, friends and members of the community that I affected. I now acknowledge that I've been fighting a rare paraphilic disorder for much of my life and that shame and fear prevented me from seeking the proper help I needed.\"\n\n\"No amount of words can convey how sorry and ashamed I am,\" he continued, vowing to pursue \"long-term treatment\" in order to find \"redemption.\" The letter requested, \"Please give my family the time and space they need to heal, they were not aware of or involved in any way.\" According to his Facebook page, Britton was born in West Yorkshire, studied zoology at the University of Leeds, and then pursued a PhD in biological science at the University of Bristol.

U.K. zoologist Adam Britton, now 53, previously pleaded guilty to 56 charges related to animal cruelty and bestiality after his initial arrest in 2022, and also copped to four counts of accessing child abuse materials.\n\nChief Justice Michael Grant, who presided over the sentencing, did not mince words when speaking about Britton's crimes, and warned those in the courtroom at the time that the facts of the case would likely cause shock and dismay. For the torture and sexual exploitation of more than 42 dogs on his property -- 39 of which were reportedly killed -- the Charles Darwin University alum will spend up to ten years and five months behind bars.\n\nAs well, Britton will have to wait until September 2028 before he's eligible for parole, with that six-year hold being backdated to his initial arrest in April 2022. At whatever point he does get out of prison, Britton has been banned from owning mammal or mammal-type animals (or keeping any on his property) for the rest of his life.\n\nSpeaking to Adam Britton's \"grotesque\" nature in his actions, Grant said (via The Guardian):\n\nAccording to the BBC, the Chief Justice's recitation of Adam Britton's long list of offenses was enough to cause some people present to vacate the courtroom in distress, while others were seen crying in their seats and mouthing insulting sentiments at the former TV personality.\n\nGrant viewed these crimes as being premedited and planned, and voiced the notion that they wouldn't have stopped had Britton not been caught and arrested. Calling Britton out for showing \"unalloyed pleasure\" in torturing animals, he said:\n\nSince 2000 or so, before his move from the UK to Australia, Adam Britton started appearing on television as a scientific advisor, initially speaking about dinosaurs before later showing off his expertise with crocodiles on episodes of shows such as Nova, Bear Grylls' Man vs. Wild, Nature and the ratings-topping news show 60 Minutes. He even provided crocodile sound effects for an episode of the animated kids show Go, Diego! Go! However, none of the evidence of his animal abuse has involved crocs or any reptilian creatures.\n\nBritton's offenses go back nearly a decade, though paperwork viewed by the BBC went back just 18 months, yet still contained more than 90 pages. Authorities found a shipping container on his property that was fitted with recording equipment, which he reportedly dubbed his \"torture room,\" where he would record himself abusing dogs, though not his own pets.\n\nInstead, Britton used aliases on the online marketplace Gumtree Australia to find people who had to get rid of their dogs for personal or professional reasons. It's said he would become friendly with the owners, and continued to communicate with them with updates after the fact, sending previously captured photos to make it appear as if the animals were still happy and healthy, despite already being killed in several cases.\n\nIn anonymous posts that have been attributed to him after the fact, Britton allegedly admitted to sexually abusing horses as a 13-year-old, saying he \"repressed\" his sadistic actions as a child for a certain period, but that he \"let it out again\" in the years prior to his arrest. In the same online forums, Britton reportedly coached others on how to dispose of animal carcasses, saying he fed the remains to the crocodiles and other animals on his property.\n\nThough he was careful to not feature any recognizable elements in his torture videos posted online, the video that led to his eventual arrest featured an orange City of Darwin dog leash in the background. The footage, which featured Britton torturing eight different dogs, was sent to Northern Territory police via anonymous tip, and after an investigation, he was identified and arrested.\n\nIn court, despite reportedly not showing very much emotion as the Chief Justice read off his list of transgressions, Adam Britton shared the following sentiment:\n\nBritton's legal team attempted to argue that his actions were caused by a rare disorder that causes atypical sexual urges.

He faces accusations of raping and torturing more than 40 dogs. Britton confessed to 56 charges related to bestiality and animal cruelty, as well as four counts of accessing child abuse material, according to a report by BBC.\n\nThe Northern Territory (NT) Supreme Court reportedly heard that the 53-year-old filmed himself torturing the animals, leading to their deaths, and then shared these videos online under various pseudonyms. Prosecutors informed the court that Britton has exhibited a 'sadistic sexual interest' in animals, particularly dogs, since at least 2014. They revealed that he used to torture animals in a \"torture room\" until they died, record the acts, and upload the footage online.\n\nBritton's abuse went unnoticed for years until a clue emerged from one of his videos. He was arrested in April 2022 following a search of his rural Darwin property, where child abuse material was also discovered on his laptop. The details of Britton's crimes are too graphic to be published, and Chief Justice Michael Grant cautioned the courtroom that they were so \"grotesque\" they could induce \"nervous shock\".\n\nBritton will have to wait until September 2028 before he can apply for parole, with the six-year period backdated to his initial arrest in April 2022.\n\nSingle Clue That Caught Britton\n\nThe key clue that exposed the horrific crimes of Britton was discovered by an internet investigator in an abuse video he had posted online. In one video, an anonymous user identified an adult female dog wearing an orange City of Darwin leash with the slogan, \"Great pets start with you\". This geographic detail led to his arrest, according to MailOnline.\n\nThe investigator reported the video to the NT Animal Welfare Branch via Gmail, which then passed the information to the police.

His sentence was backdated to his April 2022 arrest. At that time, police also found 15 files with child abuse material.\n\nThursday's sentencing comes after Britton pleaded guilty to 56 charges of bestiality and animal cruelty at the Supreme Court in the Northern Territory in September 2023.\n\nChief Justice Michael Grant excused court officers during his sentencing remarks due to the details of Britton's offenses, saying they might cause \"nervous shock or some other adverse psychological reactions.\"\n\n\"Although I'm loathe to do so, given the gross depravity and perversity of your actions,\" Grant said to Britton in the courtroom. \"it is necessary for the purpose of sentencing you to provide some generally representative detail and description of the offending conduct.\"\n\nThose crimes, as detailed in court, were described by Grant as \"grotesque\" and \"unspeakable.\" They included the torture and sexual exploitation of 42 dogs, and the deaths of 39 dogs in a shipping container he dubbed his \"torture room\" on his property. He reportedly filmed many of his crimes there.\n\nThe crimes cited took place in an 18-month span from 2020 and 2022, and specifically related to dogs Britton acquired through Australia's Gumtree online marketplace. Later evidence suggested this was not the entirety of his crimes.\n\nGrant further explained that Britton particularly targeted people who posted that they were reluctantly having to part with beloved pets due to work or travel obligations. He promised to give people's pets a \"good home.\"\n\n\"He often built a rapport with the dog owners in negotiating taking custody of their animals,\" said prosecutor Marty Aust in September, per Sky News. At that time, Britton was described in court as having a \"sadistic sexual interest\" in dogs.\n\nIn his sentencing, Justice Grant said, \"You took photographs of the dogs prior to torturing and killing them, and subsequently sent those photographs to the former owners as part of communicating false narratives that the dogs were thriving in their new environment.\"\n\nAt the same time, per ABC, Britton was sharing his kill count and uploading videos recorded of his murders under the psesudonyms 'Monster' and 'Cerberus' to the messenger service Telegram. Grant said it was clear Britton derived \"perverse pleasure and excitement from the suffering of these animals.\"\n\nIn one chatroom, per court documents seen by The BBC, Britton admitted, \"I was sadistic as a child to animals, but I had repressed it. In the last few years I let it out again, and now I can't stop. I don't want to. :)\" He admitted to molesting horses as young as 13 years old.\n\nHe purportedly abused his own pets, and acquired pets, over the last decade, writing in another chat, \"My own dogs are family and I have limits. I only badly mistreat other dogs... I have no emotional bond to them, they are toys pure and simple.\"\n\nBritton expressed remorse in a letter written while he was in prison, and read in court by his attorney. In it, he took \"full responsibility\" for his \"demeaning\" crimes and wrote, \"I deeply regret the pain and trauma that I caused innocent families and consequently to my family, friends and members of the community affected.\"\n\n\"I let you all down. I'm truly sorry,\" his letter continued. \"I now acknowledge that I've been fighting a rare paraphilic disorder for much of my life. And that shame and fear prevented me from seeking the proper help I needed.\"\n\nHe went on to ask his family be given space to \"heal,\" emphasizing, \"They were not aware or involved in any way.\" As for himself, Britton vowed to seek \"long-term treatment.\"\n\nJustice Grant, however, was not moved by the letter, nor did he believe Britton showed any genuine remorse, per ABC. He instead accepted the prosecution's perceived diagnosis of zoosadism.\n\nZoosadism is defined by the American Psychological Association as \"a paraphilia (abnormal sexual desire) in which sexual arousal and satisfaction are obtained from torturing a nonhuman animal. This may occur during direct sexual contact with the animal, or the person may masturbate later, using memories of the event as masturbatory fantasies.\"\n\n\"Your conduct on each of those occasions involved a degree of depravity and reprehensibility which falls entirely outside any ordinary human conception and comprehension,\" said Justice Grant in his sentencing statement. \"I also have no doubt that you would have continued with this conduct had you not been arrested by police.\"\n\nWith time already served, Britton could first be eligible for parole in April 2028.", "source": {"uri": "toofab.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Toofab"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathaniel_Lord_Britton", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nathaniel Lord Britton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulysses_S._Grant", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ulysses S.

The couple established a consultancy specialising in wild crocodiles.\n\nBritton gained international recognition as a crocodile expert and collaborated with prominent figures like David Attenborough. He contributed to various documentaries and educational programs for the BBC and National Geographic.\n\nHe was a research associate at Charles Darwin University in Darwin, Australia, and appeared on the Discovery Channel programme \"Animal Face-Off\", further cementing his reputation as a leading authority on crocodiles.\n\nHis career came to be overshadowed by his criminal activities after he confessed to a raft of charges involving the rape, torture, and killing of dogs, which he used to commit inside a shipping container dubbed the \"torture room\".\n\nThe Australian court was told that Britton used to source rescue dogs on the online classifieds website Gumtree Australia, offering to rehome them at his expansive property near Darwin.\n\nHe would reportedly film himself torturing the animals and post the videos on online platforms using pseudonyms \"Monster\" and \"Cerberus\". He would also allegedly access child abuse material on these platforms.\n\nHis disturbing actions led to the deaths of 39 dogs.\n\nHe has also pleaded guilty to four counts of accessing and transmitting child abuse material.\n\n\"I was talking with someone else about why I love to hurt dogs,\" he wrote in a secret chat group. \"I wasn't sure at first, but now I live for it. I can't stop myself hurting dogs.\"\n\n\"I was sadistic as a child to animals, but I had repressed it. In the last few years I let it out again, and now I can't stop. I don't want to.\"\n\nHe added a smiley emoji.\n\nAustralian authorities were alerted to Britton's activities by an anonymous person. They then launched \"Operation Haine\", which resulted in a search warrant for Britton's McMinns Lagoon home on Darwin's outskirts. In the course of their inquiry, law enforcement uncovered unsettling footage shot by Britton revealing his acts of animal cruelty.\n\nHe was arrested in April 2022.\n\nBritton's lawyer -- who has sought to remain anonymous due to the threats they have been receiving for representing Britton -- recently presented the court with a fresh report on the zoologist's \"paraphilia\". It's a psychological term to describe a condition characterised by intense sexual fantasies, urges, or behaviours involving atypical objects, situations, or individuals.\n\nAt a previous hearing, Britton's lawyer reportedly told the court about his \"paraphilia\" due to which the court was adjourned.\n\nBefore the hearing commenced, the Northern Territory Supreme Court judge Michael Grant asked his staff and animal rights activists to vacate the room due to the grotesque nature of the actions committed by Britton.\n\n\"This is a human being who has been afflicted by a condition since very early childhood,\" Britton's lawyer said. \"It is not his fault that he had that.\"\n\n\"This particular condition is exceptionally taboo in most societies and the court can, and I hope would, accept that that would have been a very difficult thing to grow up with and learn to manage into adulthood.\"\n\nThe lead prosecutor, Marty Aust, however, said Britton derived \"entrenched enjoyment\" from his perverse sexual interest in animals.\n\n\"There was significant planning to the extent that it was quite a production, with multiple cameras, tripods, various recording equipment, production values, editing,\" he told the court.\n\n\"If you watch that footage you will see the extreme pleasure and enjoyment that this man had in creating this and doing these acts. His sheer delight goes to the core of it ... it's difficult to read, it's difficult to hear but to see it, really is something other.\"\n\nMr Aust said that \"much like any other human being who has a particular sexual interest\" Britton was \"able to rationally determine whether to act on that interest\".\n\n\"He has done so and then, with the incitement and the encouragement of other like-minded persons, he has offended in a way that's almost beyond description in terms of its significant depravity,\" he said.\n\nMr Aust said that even if Britton's condition were treatable, \"there remains a constant risk of its recurrence\".\n\nAt a hearing early this year, judge Grant had doubted whether any psychiatric evidence could diminish Britton's moral responsibility for his actions.\n\n\"A serial killer can't say, for example, 'My moral culpability is reduced because I suffer from psychopathy',\" he said in February. \"I just can't see where the evidence is going here.\"\n\nProtesting outside the courthouse recently, animal rights activists displayed signs demanding justice, including calls for the death penalty and \"justice for the innocent victims of Adam Britton\".\n\n\"He's got to be punished so people don't think that animals are something that can be exploited and abused,\" one protester said.\n\nThey realised the death penalty \"isn't going to happen\", the protester told the ABC, \"but incarcerated forever would be my personal choice\".", "source": {"uri": "independent.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "Irish Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The couple settled in the Northern Territory, where he became a respected academic at the Charles Darwin University.\n\nIn public, he was an expert on saltwater crocodiles and appeared on television with celebrities including Sir David and Bear Grylls.\n\nOnline, however, Britton was \"Monster\" and \"Cerberus\" - the provider of images so sickening they would later traumatise investigators and lead a judge to recommend clerks and security leave a courtroom to avoid seeing the \"unspeakable\" acts.\n\n\"I have no emotional bond to them, they are toys pure and simple,\" he told online followers under his alias, about his images of beaten dogs and puppies, \"and plenty more where they came from.\"\n\nPolice said Britton would wait for his wife to be away on field trips, before taking dogs and puppies into a \"torture room\" he set up in a shipping container next to their rural home near Darwin.\n\nThere, he would film himself raping and then beating the dogs to death. Most of the 42 animals he abused he had been given for free from online classifieds site Gumtree after promising their previous owners he would give them a \"good home\".\n\n\"Your modus operandi was one of devious and careful premeditation and planning, the individuals from whom you procured these dogs thought they were going to a good home and that they would be protected,\" the judge said on Thursday.\n\n\"You took videos of the grotesque harm you were inflicting on these animals, you revisited those videos for your own sexual gratification and you shared them for the gratification of other deviants.\n\n\"The fact that you staged each of these remorseless killings as a production further reinforces the meticulous level of your planning.\"\n\nTwo dogs he attacked - Swiss Shepherds Bolt and Ursa - were the pets he shared with his wife.\n\nIt's understood she was disgusted when the crimes were uncovered and has since moved towns, changing her name to avoid any association with the case while continuing to work to promote animal welfare.\n\n'Sheer delight you took in the torture of these animals'\n\nBritton often filmed his crimes and sent them to \"like-minded\" people online and through messaging service Telegram, the court heard. At other times, he would drive the animals to a secluded location and murder them \"for his own sadistic sexual pleasure\".\n\nPolice arrested Britton in 2022 after piecing together clues in a video sent to an animal welfare agency. A raid on his property uncovered severed dog limbs, a dog's head and a decomposing puppy. A laptop found at the home featured child abuse images.\n\nBritton was charged with a string of offences relating to bestiality, animal abuse and possession of child abuse material, for crimes dating between 2020 and 2022 - but police believe his offending started much earlier.\n\nOne of the messages from 'Monster' that formed part of the case, read: \"I started fence jumping when I was 13 or 14 and molesting horses.\"\n\nJustice Grant said he believed Britton was \"likely to commit a further offence in respect of an animal and that risk will continue to present unless you are subjected to effective psychotherapy and antilibidinal treatment\".\n\n\"I'm less ready to accept that you are genuinely remorseful, that is particularly so having regard to the sheer delight you took in the torture of these animals and the persistence of your conduct,\" he said.\n\n\"And what appears to be your continuing view that sexual interactions with animals short of sadism isn't harmful.\"\n\nMr Giliam of the RSPCA likened the NT's animal cruelty laws to \"a slap on the wrist with a wet bus ticket\" as he noted the maximum sentence for each offence was two years.\n\n\"Just about everybody knows his name now - the abhorrence and the disgust is just palpable,\" he told The Telegraph.\n\nOutside court, protesters holding placards lamented that Britton could be out of jail within four years after time already served since his arrest.\n\n\"You'll be dead before then,\" they yelled.", "source": {"uri": "aol.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathaniel_Lord_Britton", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nathaniel Lord Britton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Attenborough", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "David Attenborough"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crocodile", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Crocodile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Northern Territory"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Northern Territory"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Geographic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Geographic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacksaw", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hacksaw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screw", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Screw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulysses_S._Grant", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ulysses S.

There is a well-researched link between violence towards animals and violence towards people,\" Ms Hurst said in a statement.\n\n\"This man is a danger to other animals and the community. I am relieved to hear his sentence includes time behind bars ... but it is not long enough.\"\n\nMs Hurst said Australia's animal sexual abuse laws were \"entirely out of touch\" and thatfilm Britton's \"pathetic sentence\" did not \"reflect the seriousness of the crime\".\n\nThe British-born Charles Darwin University zoologist began his campaign of terror in 2014 when he abused two dogs he owned with his wife at their Darwin home.\n\nAgreed facts tendered to court last year reveal Britton went on to use classifieds site Gumtree to source dogs from owners, many of whom were reluctant to sell.\n\nAfter purchasing the animals, Britton would send pictures of them to the past owners before sexually abusing, torturing and killing 39 of the dogs.\n\nThe vile acts took place within a shipping container on Britton's home as well as at \"secluded\" locations throughout Darwin's outer suburbs.\n\nMuch of the abuse was filmed by Britton on mobile phones and on cameras placed on tripods, with the video later edited to \"black out\" identifying features.\n\nFrom 2020 until his arrest in 2022, Britton used the encrypted social media service Telegram to connect with \"like-minded\" animal abusers.\n\nA second account, known as Cerberus, was used to upload and disseminate videos made by Britton in which he discussed his \"kill count\".\n\nThe videos were saved onto Britton's devices under names relating to the location, breed or name of the animal, including \"Mastiff1\", \"Pit1\" and \"NewBlue1\".\n\nAccording to the facts, Britton would refer to the cruelty as \"ZooSadism\" and posted to Telegram groups such as \"New Wicked Kennel\", which had 15 users.\n\nIn an online chat, Britton referred to his \"torture room\" and what implements he would use, including a bread knife, before adding that: \"I can't stop myself hurting dogs.\n\n\"I am going to get another dog to kill tomorrow. I plan to hurt it, a lot. I am ridiculously excited about it,\" he said.\n\nBritton's online activity first raised the attention of police following a report by the Northern Territory (NT) Animal Welfare Branch in 2022.\n\nThe agency had reported a video made by Britton and posted to a \"gore website\" that depicted him sexually abusing, torturing and killing one dog and eight puppies.\n\nThe female dog in the video was wearing a Darwin City Council \"Great pets start with you\" collar, prompting an investigation by NT Police.\n\nIn April 2022, NT Police and AFP officers raided Britton's home and seized 44 items, including computers, cameras, hard drives, weapons and sex toys.\n\nPolice also located severed dog limbs in a freezer, a decomposing puppy in a filtration pond, and a severed dog head in a neighbouring property in the search.\n\nFollowing his arrest and after seeking legal advice, Britton provided his Telegram password to police but declined to participate in an electronic interview.",

The judge in the case called him \"devious\" and a court order seen by Newsweek said the zoologist was sentenced to a total of 10 years and five months.\n\nThe 52-year-old, who was well-regarded in the zoological community, had collaborated with esteemed figures like Sir David Attenborough on wildlife projects. His public persona as a dedicated researcher was starkly contrasted by his private activities.\n\nBritton's crimes were uncovered through an anonymous tip off to authorities in 2022. A search of his Darwin property led to the discovery of gruesome evidence, including severed dog limbs and a decomposing puppy.\n\nInvestigations revealed that Britton had been sourcing dogs from online marketplaces like Gumtree, telling former owners he would provide them with good homes. Instead, he subjected the animals to unimaginable cruelty.\n\nCourt documents detailed how Britton tortured and sexually exploited at least 42 dogs between November 2020 and April 2022, filming the acts and sharing the videos online under pseudonyms, reports said.\n\nChief Justice Michael Grant, who sentenced Britton, described his actions as \"grotesque cruelty\" that fell \"outside any ordinary human conception.\" The details of the crimes were considered so distressing that even courtroom security personnel were excused during their reading, ABC News said.\n\n\"[The facts] in my assessment have the potential to cause nervous shock or some other adverse psychological reaction to a person exposed to those details,\" Grant said, according the report.\n\nIt was disclosed that Britton communicated with like-minded individuals in online chatrooms, detailing his methods and encouraging others to commit similar acts of cruelty. In one message, Britton explained his lack of an emotional bond with the dogs he abused, referring to them as \"toys\" and expressing a desire to hurt them.\n\nLifetime Ban\n\nIncluding time already served, Britton may be eligible for parole in 2028. His sentence includes a lifetime ban on owning mammals, court documents seen by Newsweek showed.\n\nBorn in West Yorkshire, England, Britton moved to Australia over two decades ago, where he established himself as an expert on crocodiles.\n\nHis reputable career included working with the BBC and National Geographic. However, his court appearances revealed a lifelong pattern of sadistic behavior towards animals, beginning with molesting horses at the age of 13.\n\nA statement from Britton, provided to Newsweek by the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory read: \"I take full responsibility for the demeaning crimes that I perpetrated on dogs.\n\n\"I deeply regret the pain and trauma that I caused to innocent animals, and consequently to my family, friends, and members of the community I affected. I let you all down, and I'm truly sorry.\n\n\"I acknowledge that I've been fighting a rare paraphilic disorder for much of my life and that shame and fear prevented me from seeking the proper help I needed.\n\n\"No amount of words can convey how sorry and ashamed I am, nor undo what I did. I will seek long-term treatment and find a path towards redemption.\n\n\"Please give my family the space they deserve to heal. They were not aware or involved in any way.\"", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joe_edwards@newsweek.com", "name": "Joe Edwards", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crocodile", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Crocodile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoology", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Zoology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torture", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Torture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_Northern_Territory", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the Northern Territory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulysses_S._Grant", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ulysses S.

He was given a sentence of more than 10 years in jail. In the zoological and academic circles, where Britton was once well-respected for his work with National Geographic and the BBC, his case has caused a stir. Behind the scenes, meanwhile, Britton was living a murky life characterized by terrible depravity and violence.\n\n1970 saw the birth of Adam Britton in the United Kingdom. Britton's love of nature began at a young age, since she was raised by animal enthusiasts. He studied zoology and graduated from the University of Leeds with a bachelor's degree. When Britton started his doctoral studies at the University of Sydney in the late 1990s, his academic career really took off. His studies centered on crocodile behavior and ecology, and he soon established himself as a preeminent authority in the subject.\n\nIn the zoological world, Britton became well-known and respected over the course of the next 20 years. He collaborated with National Geographic and the BBC on a number of well-known projects, such as the documentary series \"Crocodile Files.\" Britton was in high demand as a pundit and broadcaster because of his skill and captivating on-screen persona. He started giving frequent talks at international conferences and received invitations to exhibit his work at esteemed establishments all over the globe.\n\nNevertheless, Britton was living a double life behind closed doors. His fascination with animal maltreatment and bestiality had become perverted, and he was now using his position and knowledge to trick others into falling into his trap. Britton bought 42 dogs online between 2020 and 2022, promising their owners he would give them a \"good home.\" On the other hand, prior to his arrest, Britton murdered 39 dogs and tortured 42 more, according to court records.\n\nBritton committed deeds of heinous brutality. On his Darwin property, he recorded himself raping and murdering the dogs inside a shipping container. He then shared the video on Telegram. Michael Grant, the Chief Justice of the Northern Territory Supreme Court, called Britton's acts \"grotesque\" and \"unspeakable.\"\n\nAfter years of Britton's crimes being unreported, Australian police ultimately took him into custody in 2022. Following a thorough investigation that exposed the entire scope of his depravity, Britton was charged on 63 charges, 56 of which were animal cruelty and bestiality-related, along with four counts of obtaining information pertaining to child abuse.\n\nBritton entered a startling plea of guilty to every allegation. Britton was sentenced to more than 10 years in jail by the Northern Territory Supreme Court; he will be eligible for parole in April 2028. It is also forbidden for him to possess any animals for the rest of his life.\n\nThe story of Adam Britton is a sobering reminder that even well-respected people may have terrible secrets. His spiral into depravity serves as a warning about the perils of unbridled authority and the need of being alert when seeing animal maltreatment. One thing is certain as the zoological and academic worlds accept Britton's crimes: his name will always be connected to shame and tragedy.", "source": {"uri": "wicnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WIC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathaniel_Lord_Britton", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nathaniel Lord Britton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoology", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Zoology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crocodile", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Crocodile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Geographic", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Geographic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoophilia", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Zoophilia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Sydney", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of Sydney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Philosophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Doctor of Philosophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruelty_to_animals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cruelty to animals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Child abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Leeds", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of Leeds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor's_degree", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bachelor's degree"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behind_closed_doors_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Behind closed doors (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pundit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pundit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Documentary film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ecology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_Northern_Territory", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the Northern Territory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shipping_container", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shipping container"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulysses_S._Grant", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ulysses S.

They were married for at least 15 years, but reports say Erin had no knowledge of his crimes\n\nErin (left) and Adam Britton (right) were co-founders of consultancy company Big Gecko, which sold footage of crocodiles to TV and film directors\n\nBritton's wife Erin, a wildlife ranger who once met Prince Harry and helped him catch a crocodile, has reportedly changed her surname since learning of her husband's crimes\n\nPrince Harry is seen catching a crocodile as he is aided by Britton's wife Erin\n\nLocals told media the pair seemed like quiet but passionate defenders of animals.\n\nBut Britton was hiding his 'sadistic sexual interest' in them from everyone including his own wife, court documents say.\n\nIt is reported that Erin was unaware of her husband's crime and has since dropped her last name.\n\nWhat are Britton's crimes?\n\nIn 2014, Britton began sexually abusing his own pet Swiss Shepherds - Ursa and Bolt.\n\nHe constructed a secret 'torture room' using a shipping container on his rural property in McMinns Lagoon near Darwin.\n\nBritton also scoured the internet for dogs he could abuse and kill at his home.\n\nHe often found canines using online marketplace Gumtree Australia where unsuspecting owners with travel or work commitments gave their pets away using 'free to good home' adverts.\n\nThe zoologist built a rapport with the owners he took the pets from, sending them updates filled with 'false narratives' and old photos.\n\nThe married zoologist sexually abused his own Swiss Shepherd dogs, Ursa and Bolt for almost a decade\n\nBritton not only tortured and sexually abused his own pets Ursa and Bolt (pictured together), who he created an Instagram page for, but also dogs from pet owners he had lured into his trap through the online marketplace platform Gumtree Australia\n\nIn 2016, Britton uploaded a photo of one of his dogs, Bolt, as a puppy (pictured)\n\nOne of Adam Britton's dogs pictured on his property outside Darwin\n\n'My own dogs are family and I have limits,' he explained in a Telegram chat entered into evidence.\n\n'I only badly mistreat other dogs... I have no emotional bond to them, they are toys pure and simple. And [there are] plenty more where they came from.'\n\nBritton extensively filmed his violent offending in the so-called 'torture room' which was fitted with recording equipment.\n\nRead MoreBREAKING NEWS Former BBC zoologist Adam Britton, who filmed himself raping dogs, is jailed for ten years\n\nHe shared videos online under pseudonyms and handed out 'how to' advice in an attempt to encourage others to commit similar offences and get rid of the evidence.\n\nWith a sprawling property on the outskirts of Darwin, Britton said he disposed of the dogs' remains by feeding their bodies to animals - including the eight crocodiles on his land.\n\nThe horrific animal abuse continued until Britton's arrest in April 2022.\n\nHe was only caught when a video of his vile acts, which he had shared online, was provided to Australia's Northern Territory animal welfare authorities.\n\nThe clip showed the torture of eight dogs - all except one were puppies.\n\nBut an anonymous internet user noticed the female dog in the video was wearing an orange City of Darwin leash with the slogan, 'great pets start with you'.\n\nThat tip-off enabled investigators to track down where the dog was adopted from - and by whom.\n\nBritton's sprawling rural property was put up for sale but protesters spray painted 'Dog Killer' on the walls\n\nBritton filmed his offending in his so-called 'torture room' (pictured) and shared videos online under pseudonyms\n\nWithin weeks, officers stormed Britton's property and arrested him. He has been remanded in custody since.\n\nPolice officers seized recording devices, animal remains and a laptop on which they located 15 files containing child abuse material.\n\nToday Britton was sentenced to ten years in jail and five months with a non-parole period of six years, backdated to his April 2022 arrest.\n\nHe stood in the dock wearing a black suit with grey shirt and did not visibly react to Justice Grant's sentencing remarks.\n\nThe once-respected academic was also banned from owning or having mammal-type animals on his property for the rest of his life.\n\nBritton's sentence was met with outrage by animal advocates.\n\nEmma Hurst, an MP for the Animal Justice Party in NSW, slammed the sentence as 'pathetically weak'.\n\nAnimal advocates demonstrate ahead of Britton's sentencing at the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory in Darwin\n\n'These were horrific acts of animal cruelty,' Ms Hurst said.\n\n'There is a well-researched link between violence towards animals and violence towards people.\n\n'This man is a danger to other animals and the community. I am relieved to hear his sentence includes time behind bars - that's where a man like this belongs - but it is not long enough.'", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathaniel_Lord_Britton", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nathaniel Lord Britton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Attenborough", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "David Attenborough"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoology", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Zoology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crocodile", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Crocodile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_slavery", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sexual slavery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torture", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Torture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Yorkshire", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "West Yorkshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "West Yorkshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry,_Duke_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_in_Cold_Blood", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Life in Cold Blood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Geographic", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Geographic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_documentary", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Television documentary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Darwin_University", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Charles Darwin University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_sexual_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Child sexual abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_Northern_Territory", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the Northern Territory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulysses_S._Grant", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ulysses S.

Adam Britton, a zoologist based in Darwin, Australia, pleaded guilty to 56 charges of bestiality and animal cruelty at the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory (NT) in September last year. He also pleaded guilty to four counts of accessing and transmitting child abuse material.\n\nBritton, 52, whose sentencing suffered a series of delays, was on Thursday also banned for life from purchasing animals and having them on his property, Australian media reports. His offending involved the torture and exploitation of 42 dogs, and the deaths of 39, in a shipping container on his property - which he used to film many of his crimes. Britton will not be eligible for parole for six years, according to ABC.\n\nChief Justice Michael Grant described Britton's \"grotesque\" and \"unspeakable\" crimes against animals as he sentenced him. The judge excused court officers during his sentencing remarks, as he warned the gallery that details of the offences could cause a \"nervous shock or some other adverse psychological reactions\". He said: \"Although I'm loathe to do so, given the gross depravity and perversity of your actions, it is necessary for the purpose of sentencing you to provide some generally representative detail and description of the offending conduct.\"\n\nThe court previously heard Britton had a \"sadistic sexual interest\" in animals, and in particular dogs.

The couple settled in the Northern Territory, where he became a respected academic at the Charles Darwin University.\n\nIn public, he was an expert on saltwater crocodiles and appeared on television with celebrities including Sir David and Bear Grylls.\n\nOnline, however, Britton was \"Monster\" and \"Cerberus\" - the provider of images so sickening they would later traumatise investigators and lead a judge to recommend clerks and security leave a courtroom to avoid seeing the \"unspeakable\" acts.\n\n\"I have no emotional bond to them, they are toys pure and simple,\" he told online followers under his alias, about his images of beaten dogs and puppies, \"and plenty more where they came from.\"\n\nPolice said Britton would wait for his wife to be away on field trips, before taking dogs and puppies into a \"torture room\" he set up in a shipping container next to their rural home near Darwin.\n\nThere, he would film himself raping and then beating the dogs to death. Most of the 42 animals he abused he had been given for free from online classifieds site Gumtree after promising their previous owners he would give them a \"good home\".\n\n\"Your modus operandi was one of devious and careful premeditation and planning, the individuals from whom you procured these dogs thought they were going to a good home and that they would be protected,\" the judge said on Thursday.\n\n\"You took videos of the grotesque harm you were inflicting on these animals, you revisited those videos for your own sexual gratification and you shared them for the gratification of other deviants.\n\n\"The fact that you staged each of these remorseless killings as a production further reinforces the meticulous level of your planning.\"\n\nTwo dogs he attacked - Swiss Shepherds Bolt and Ursa - were the pets he shared with his wife.\n\nIt's understood she was disgusted when the crimes were uncovered and has since moved towns, changing her name to avoid any association with the case while continuing to work to promote animal welfare.\n\n'Sheer delight you took in the torture of these animals'\n\nBritton often filmed his crimes and sent them to \"like-minded\" people online and through messaging service Telegram, the court heard. At other times, he would drive the animals to a secluded location and murder them \"for his own sadistic sexual pleasure\".\n\nPolice arrested Britton in 2022 after piecing together clues in a video sent to an animal welfare agency. A raid on his property uncovered severed dog limbs, a dog's head and a decomposing puppy. A laptop found at the home featured child abuse images.\n\nBritton was charged with a string of offences relating to bestiality, animal abuse and possession of child abuse material, for crimes dating between 2020 and 2022 - but police believe his offending started much earlier.\n\nOne of the messages from 'Monster' that formed part of the case, read: \"I started fence jumping when I was 13 or 14 and molesting horses.\"\n\nJustice Grant said he believed Britton was \"likely to commit a further offence in respect of an animal and that risk will continue to present unless you are subjected to effective psychotherapy and antilibidinal treatment\".\n\n\"I'm less ready to accept that you are genuinely remorseful, that is particularly so having regard to the sheer delight you took in the torture of these animals and the persistence of your conduct,\" he said.\n\n\"And what appears to be your continuing view that sexual interactions with animals short of sadism isn't harmful.\"\n\nMr Giliam of the RSPCA likened the NT's animal cruelty laws to \"a slap on the wrist with a wet bus ticket\" as he noted the maximum sentence for each offence was two years.\n\n\"Just about everybody knows his name now - the abhorrence and the disgust is just palpable,\" he told The Telegraph.\n\nOutside court, protesters holding placards lamented that Britton could be out of jail within four years after time already served since his arrest.\n\n\"You'll be dead before then,\" they yelled.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [{"uri": "andrea_hamblin@yahoo.com", "name": "Andrea Hamblin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathaniel_Lord_Britton", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nathaniel Lord Britton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Attenborough", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "David Attenborough"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crocodile", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Crocodile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Northern Territory"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Northern Territory"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Geographic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Geographic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacksaw", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hacksaw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_and_territories_of_Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "States and territories of Australia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screw", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Screw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulysses_S._Grant", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ulysses S.

He also pleaded guilty to four counts of accessing child abuse material. He was jailed for 10 years and five months in Australia on Thursday.\n\nThe Northern Territory (NT) Supreme Court was told that the 53 year old recorded himself torturing animals until they nearly all perished, subsequently sharing the footage online using pseudonyms. His heinous acts remained undetected for an extended period until a clue emerged in one of his videos.\n\nREAD MORE Santander customer left frustrated as ATM error leads to lost cash\n\nBritton, who attended Queen Elizabeth Grammar School in Wakefield, was apprehended in April 2022 following a search at his rural Darwin home, where authorities also discovered child abuse material on his laptop. The explicit nature of Britton's offences is such that much of it is too graphic to be reported, and the judge occasionally advised people to exit the courtroom due to its \"grotesque\" content.\n\n\"Your depravity falls outside any ordinary human conception,\" Chief Justice Michael Grant said to Britton, as reported by the Australian Associated Press. Factoring in time already served, Britton may be eligible for parole in April 2028 and has been prohibited from owning any animals for life.\n\nBritton's lawyer contended that his client's criminal behaviour was influenced by a rare disorder that incites intense, abnormal sexual interests. Originally from West Yorkshire, Britton spent his early years in the UK before relocating to Australia over two decades ago to specialise in crocodile research.\n\nWith a PhD in zoology, he had established a global reputation for his expertise, even welcoming Sir David to film part of the 'Life in Cold Blood' docuseries at his property, the BBC reports.\n\nLocal sources described him as a reserved yet fervent advocate for animal welfare. However, court filings revealed his \"sadistic sexual interest\" in animals. Secretive communications with individuals who shared his inclinations depicted how Britton began abusing horses when he was just 13 years old.\n\n\"I was sadistic as a child to animals, but I had repressed it. In the last few years I let it out again, and now I can't stop. I don't want to. :),\" was one of the statements presented to the judiciary. Over the years, Britton not only misused his pets but also deceived other dog owners into surrendering their animals to him. \"My own dogs are family and I have limits,\" he detailed during a conversation on Telegram that was submitted as evidence.\n\n\"I only badly mistreat other dogs... I have no emotional bond to them, they are toys pure and simple. And [there are] plenty more where they came from.\" He was responsible for the torture and death of at least 42 dogs, having killed 39, as per legal documentation. These records show a period of 18 months leading up to his arrest, yet span over 90 pages.\n\nGet all the latest and breaking West Yorkshire news straight to your inbox by signing up to our newsletter

also discuss his acts and upload videos on Telegram.\n\nA suppression order that had concealed his identity since his arrest was later lifted, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation reported.\n\nIn a letter read out on behalf of the 52-year-old, his lawyer said he took \"full responsibility for the demeaning crimes\" he inflicted on the dogs.\n\n\"I deeply regret the pain and trauma that I caused

He would find animals on the website Gumtree Australia, where many families were often searching for new homes for their pets if they had to move.\n\nBritton would then abuse the animals in a specially designed shipping container fitted with recording equipment on his property.

The 53-year-old Britton, who once collaborated with Sir David Attenborough, was found guilty of 56 charges related to bestiality and animal cruelty, as well as four counts of accessing child abuse material. The court revealed that Britton filmed himself torturing and killing at least 42 dogs, with his abuses spanning several decades.\n\nIn April 2022, Australian authorities received an anonymous tip-off about disturbing videos of animal abuse posted online, which led to a significant investigation. The footage, showing a man torturing multiple dogs, was traced back to Adam Britton, a renowned zoologist. A search of Britton's rural property in Darwin uncovered a shipping container converted into a \"torture room,\" where he had abused at least 42 dogs, killing 39 of them, as reported by the BBC. The police also seized recording equipment, animal remains, and a laptop containing child abuse material. Adam Britton Faces 249-Year Jail For Raping, Killing Over 40 Dogs, Claims He's Suffering From Paraphilia; Know All About the Abnormal Sexual Behaviour.\n\nBritton had used online marketplaces to acquire dogs and manipulated their previous owners with false narratives to cover his crimes. During the court hearing on July 14, Britton's defence argued that his crimes were driven by \"paraphilia,\" a psychological condition characterised by intense and atypical sexual interests. Paraphilia involves recurrent, intense sexual fantasies or behaviours involving unusual objects or situations, which can cause significant distress or impairment. Bestiality Horror in Australia: BBC Contributor and British Wildlife Expert Adam Britton Admits Torturing, Raping and Killing 39 Dogs.\n\nBritton's defence suggested this disorder influenced his criminal behaviour, although this claim was met with scepticism given the severity of his actions. The Northern Territory Supreme Court sentenced Britton to 10 years and five months in prison, taking into account the severity and grotesque nature of his crimes. Chief Justice Michael Grant described Britton's actions as \"depraved\" and \"sickening,\" emphasising the profound impact on the community and the need for justice.

Members of the public gallery sobbed and gasped as the details of Britton's extensive and violent offending, resulting in the deaths of 39 dogs, including nine puppies, were read out.\n\nBritton stood in the dock wearing a black suit and grey shirt and did not visibly react to Justice Grant's sentencing remarks.\n\nDr Britton began offending in 2014, sexually abusing his own pet dogs - Swiss Shepherds Ursa and Bolt - in a secret \"torture room' constructed on his rural property in McMinns Lagoon near the city of Darwin.\n\nAfter purchasing the animals, Britton would send pictures of them to the past owners before sexually abusing, torturing and killing 39 of the dogs.\n\nHe continued until his arrest in April 2022 after a video of his vile acts, which he had shared online, was provided to Australia's Northern Territory animal welfare authorities.\n\nBritton has confessed to an interest in \"zoo-sadism\" and, in numerous online messages presented to the Northern Territory Supreme Court, he guided other people on how to perpetrate similar acts of abuse.\n\nWhen he appeared for sentencing submissions recently, the court was told about the psychiatric condition called paraphilia that afflicted him. Britton's sentence was, however, slammed as \"pathetically weak\" by Animal Justice Party's Emma Hurst.\n\n\"These were horrific acts of animal cruelty. There is a well-researched link between violence towards animals and violence towards people,\" Ms Hurst said in a statement. This man is a danger to other animals and the community. I am relieved to hear his sentence includes time behind bars ... but it is not long enough.\"\n\nThe Brit was a prominent crocodile expert and a senior researcher at Charles Darwin University. His post allowed him to host world-famous broadcaster and biologist Sir David while he filmed the BBC's Life in Cold Blood docuseries.\n\nNone of his offending is alleged to have been against the reptiles. The zoologist kept his twisted double life and depraved fantasies from his wife Erin for years.\n\nErin, a wildlife ranger who once met Prince Harry and helped him catch a crocodile, has reportedly changed her surname since learning of her husband's crimes.", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "christopher_bucktin@mirror.co.uk", "name":

He pleaded guilty to 56 charges of bestiality and animal cruelty at the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory in September, 2023, but disturbing new details of his heinous acts were shared in court at the time of his sentencing. Gruesome details were shared about what Judge Grant called \"grotesque\" and \"unspeakable\" crimes against animals, including the torture and exploitation of 42 dogs, and the deaths of 39 dogs in a shipping container on his property, where he also filmed many of his crimes, according to Sky News.\n\nJudge Grant excused court officers during his sentencing remarks, and warned those in attendance the details he was about to share could cause a \"nervous shock or some other adverse psychological reactions,\" according to Sky News.\n\n\"Although I'm loathe to do so, given the gross depravity and perversity of your actions, it is necessary for the purpose of sentencing you to provide some generally representative detail and description of the offending conduct,\" Judge Grant said.\n\nThe judge went on to explain that Britton tortured his own dogs, as well as dogs belonging to unsuspecting owners in the Darwin, Australia region. He took carriage of the animals when owners had to depart for work or travel, and then filmed himself raping and killing them in the shipping container that he called his \"torture room.\"\n\n\"Your conduct on each of those occasions involved a degree of depravity and reprehensibility which falls entirely outside any ordinary human conception and comprehension,\" Judge Grant said, according to ABC News Australia. \"You took photographs of the dogs prior to torturing and killing them and subsequently sent those photographs to the former owners as part of communicating false narratives that the dogs were thriving in their new environment.\"\n\nJudge Grant said Britton shared his kill count and uploaded videos of the murders to Telegram, under the pseudonyms \"Monster\" and \"Cerberus,\" according to ABC News Australia.\n\nThe judge said it was \"manifestly clear\" Britton derived \"perverse pleasure and excitement from the suffering of these animals.\"\n\nBritton issued an apology and also pleaded guilty to four counts of accessing and transmitting child abuse material, according to Sky News. Judge Grant was not convinced by Britton's remorse.\n\n\"You used weapons extensively in the course of your activity,\" he said. \"As the Crown has submitted, the sheer and unalloyed pleasure that you derive from inflicting this torture is sickeningly evident.\" (RELATED: People Are So Fed Up With Seagulls At The Beach, But They're Taking It Way Too Far)\n\n\"I also have no doubt that you would have continued with this conduct had you not been arrested by police,\" he said, according to ABC News Australia.", "source": {"uri": "dailycaller.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Caller"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulysses_S._Grant", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ulysses S.

He has been sentenced to over 10 years in prison by an Australian court after admitting to a shocking 56 charges involving the torture and sexual abuse of animals.\n\nThe Darwin Supreme Court judge, while sentencing the crocodile specialist who once helped Prince Harry catch a croc, expressed horror at Britton's \"inconceivable depravity\". The 53 year old was arrested in April 2022 and is now prohibited from owning or having any mammal-type animals for life.\n\nDuring the sentencing, the judge forewarned those present in the courtroom of the disturbing nature of Britton's crimes, which included \"grotesque cruelty toward animals.\" As the gruesome details were disclosed, including the deaths of 39 dogs, emotional reactions rippled through the public gallery.\n\nBritton, who completed his PhD at Bristol University before moving to Australia, began his heinous acts in 2014. His own pets, Swiss Shepherds named Ursa and Bolt, were among the victims, abused in a hidden room on his property in McMinns Lagoon, near Darwin, reports the Mirror.\n\nBritton, who had been purchasing more animals, would send pictures of them to their previous owners before committing horrific acts of sexual abuse, torture, and killing 39 dogs. His spree continued until he was caught following the circulation of a video showcasing his vile behaviour, which he had shared online, leading to his arrest by Australia's Northern Territory animal welfare authorities.\n\nHe had been running two Telegram accounts under the names 'Monster' and 'Cerberus' from 2020 to 2022, where he posted sickening videos of his actions. In one such video, an eagle-eyed internet user spotted that the adult female dog was wearing an orange City of Darwin leash with the slogan: \"Great pets start with you.\"\n\nThis clue ultimately led to Britton's capture, as reported by MailOnline. The observant individual sent the video to the NT Animal Welfare Branch via Gmail, who then alerted the police. Just a month after Britton uploaded the video, authorities raided his home.\n\nDuring the raid, they discovered a container in his garden crammed with computers, cameras, external hard drives, and sex toys. Prosecutors described this hideout as a place used to \"torture, sexually exploit and kill dogs.\"\n\nBritton referred to the container as his \"torture room\" and distributed the recordings of his appalling crimes from there using aliases. In an alarming turn of events, it's been revealed that Britton openly acknowledged a disturbing interest in \"zoo sadism\". Shocking messages disclosed in the Northern Territory Supreme Court showed him instructing others on committing similar abusive acts.\n\nDespite his condition known as paraphilia, Britton's lenient sentence has been met with outrage, particularly from Emma Hurst of the Animal Justice Party, who blasted it as \"pathetically weak\".\n\nOnce noted for his reputable standing as a crocodile specialist and senior researcher at Charles Darwin University, Britton managed to conceal his sinister secrets while working alongside Sir David Attenborough during the filming of the renowned BBC series 'Life in Cold Blood'. Impressively, none of his offences involved the reptiles he was known for.\n\nMeanwhile, his wife Erinwell-respected in her own right as a wildlife ranger who even assisted Prince Harry in a crocodile captureis believed to have deserted their marriage following Britton's arrest. Humpty Doo's hotel employee Amy Moore expressed her sympathies towards Erin amidst these distressing revelations.\n\nMs Moore shared her belief that Erin was clueless about her husbands heinous double life, telling the Mail, \"The word around these parts is that when Erin learned what her husband had got up to she fled - just packed up and left. She's gone far away, going on a safari somewhere, but how she's ever going to get over this can't be imagined.\"\n\nA handyman who worked at the couple's lavish home commented to MailOnline, \"Will she be back? That's very doubtful. She's ended the marriage and gone, although given the shocking behaviour of her husband she will be living in fear of being recognised wherever she ends up living.\"", "source": {"uri": "ok.co.uk",

At sentencing, a Darwin Supreme Court judge condemned the Yorkshire-born crocodile expert, describing his \"inconceivable depravity\".\n\nThe 53-year-old, who was arrested in April 2022, has also been banned from owning or keeping mammal-type animals for the rest of his life. Before delivering the sentence, the judge warned the public gallery that he would have to describe details of Britton's offences including \"grotesque cruelty toward animals.\"\n\nHe told the British-born academic: \"Your depravity falls outside any ordinary human conception\". Members of the public gallery sobbed and gasped as the details of Britton's extensive and violent offending, resulting in the deaths of 39 dogs, including nine puppies, were read out.\n\nThe academic, who earned a PhD in zoology from Bristol University before relocating to Australia, began offending in 2014. He sexually abused his own pet dogs - Swiss Shepherds Ursa and Bolt - in a secret room constructed on his rural property in McMinns Lagoon near the city of Darwin.\n\nAfter purchasing more animals, Britton would send pictures of them to the past owners before sexually abusing, torturing and killing 39 of the dogs. He continued until his arrest after a video of his vile acts, which he had shared online, was provided to Australia's Northern Territory animal welfare authorities.\n\nThe Brit had operated two Telegram accounts called 'Monster' and 'Cerberus' between 2020 and 2022, where he uploaded depraved videos of the acts. In one video an anonymous internet user noticed the adult female dog was wearing an orange City of Darwin leash with the slogan: \"Great pets start with you.\"\n\nThis lead is what eventually led to his arrest, the MailOnline reports. The sleuth referred the footage to the NT Animal Welfare Branch via Gmail, which then referred the matter to police. A month after Britton posted the video online, his house was raided.\n\nThey found a container in his garden rammed with computers, cameras, external hard drives and sex toys. Prosecutors said the lair was used to \"torture, sexually exploit and kill dogs.\" He called the container his \"torture room\" and then shared the footage of his crimes in the container under pseudonyms.\n\nBritton has confessed to an interest in \"zoo sadism\" and, in numerous online messages presented to the Northern Territory Supreme Court, he guided other people on how to perpetrate similar acts of abuse. When he appeared for sentencing submissions recently, the court was told about the psychiatric condition called paraphilia that afflicted him.\n\nThe animal abuser's sentence was, however, slammed as \"pathetically weak\" by Animal Justice Party's Emma Hurst. The Brit was a prominent crocodile expert and a senior researcher at Charles Darwin University.\n\nHis post allowed him to host world-famous broadcaster and biologist Sir David while he filmed the BBC's Life in Cold Blood docuseries. None of his offending is alleged to have been against the reptiles.\n\nThe zoologist kept his twisted double life and depraved fantasies from his wife Erin for years. Erin, a wildlife ranger who once met Prince Harry and helped him catch a crocodile, has reportedly changed her surname since learning of her husband's crimes.\n\nReports suggest she fled her marriage upon his arrest. Amy Moore, a hotel worker in the small town of Humpty Doo, just a few miles from the Britton couple's property, said she felt sorry for Erin.\n\nMs Moore believed Erin had no idea of her husband's sadistic secret life. She told the Mail: \"The word around these parts is that when Erin learned what her husband had got up to she fled - just packed up and left.

Adam Britton's 'grotesque cruelty toward animals' resulted in the deaths of 39 dogs, including nine puppies.\n\nThe Yorkshire-born crocodile expert admitted 56 offences related to the torture and sexual exploitation of more than 42 animals. He has now been jailed for more than 10 years in Australia, where he moved after gaining his PhD from Bristol University.\n\nThe academic began offending in 2014 and sexually abused his own pet Swiss Shepherd dogs, named Ursa and Bolt, in a secret room constructed on his rural property in McMinns Lagoon, near Darwin. He went on to purchase more animals, and would send pictures of them to their previous owners before sexually abusing, torturing and killing them.\n\nREAD MORE: Blue Light Card website 'crashes' as teachers realise they're eligible for discounts\n\nThe Mirror reports that Britton shared a video of his vile acts online via Telegram between 2020 and 2022, which resulted in his arrest when the footage came to the attention of Australia's Northern Territory animal welfare authorities. His house was raided a month later, the MailOnline reports.\n\nA container in his garden - which Britton referred to as the 'torture room' was full of computers, cameras, external hard drives and sex toys. Prosecutors said the lair was used to \"torture, sexually exploit and kill dogs.\"\n\nBritton, who once worked alongside Sir David Attenborough for the BBC's Life in Cold Blood docuseries, was afflicted with a psychiatric condition called paraphilia - which involves intense and persistent sexual interests, urges, fantasies, or behaviors that are atypical or deviant - a court heard. However none of his offending was alleged to have been against the reptiles.\n\nDuring a sentencing hearing at Darwin Supreme Court, the 53-year-old - who was arrested in April 2022 - was jailed for 10 years, five months, and banned from owning or keeping mammal-type animals for life.

I don't want to.\"\n\nAdam sourced many of his victims from unsuspecting pet owners in the Darwin region, often using online platforms like Gumtree.\n\nThese owners, unaware of his dark intentions, believed they were rehoming their pets to a safe environment.\n\nIn April 2022 he was arrested after one clip was sent to the NT Animal Welfare Branch and passed on to NT police.\n\nABC News reported that during the investigation police seized 44 items from his property, including computers, mobile phones, cameras, external hard drives, tools, weapons, dog paraphernalia and sex toys.\n\nPolice even found files of child abuse material on one of his computers.\n\nHe was charged in 2022, but due to the severity of the accusations and the potential for public outrage, his identity was initially suppressed by the courts to avoid prejudicing a jury.\n\nOn September 26, 2023 the order was lifted after Adam pleaded guilty to 37 counts of animal cruelty, ten counts of raping or attempting to rape a dog and four counts of possesing or transmitting child abuse material.\n\nChief Justice Michael Grant said to him at Darwin Supreme Court: \"Your depravity falls outside any ordinary human conception.\n\n\"Your sheer and unalloyed pleasure is sickeningly evident from the recorded material.\"\n\nAlong with the prison sentence, Adam was permanently banned from owning any animals for the rest of his life.", "source": {"uri": "internewscast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Internewscast Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crocodile", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Crocodile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoology", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Zoology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torture", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Torture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Bristol", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of Bristol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Philosophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Doctor of Philosophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruelty_to_animals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cruelty to animals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Yorkshire", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "West Yorkshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "West Yorkshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Geographic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Geographic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_documentary", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Television documentary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saltwater_crocodile", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Saltwater crocodile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoophilia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Zoophilia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Attenborough", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "David Attenborough"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horror_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Horror film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_pornography", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Child pornography"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudonym", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pseudonym"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Documentary film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_sexual_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Child sexual abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_networking_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social networking service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulysses_S._Grant", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ulysses S.

Cosmos, published by the state-backed national science agency, used Open AI's GPT-4 to produce six articles that were published last month. Although the use of AI was disclosed, the Science Journalists' Association of Australia said its use had caused serious concerns. Association president Jackson Ryan told reporters that in the article \"What happens to our bodies after death?\" descriptions of scientific processes were incorrect or vastly simplified. These inaccuracies would damage people's trust in and perception of the publication, he said. A spokesperson for the national science agency said the AI content had been fact-checked by a \"trained science communicator and edited by the Cosmos publishing team.\"\n\nA crocodile expert was sentenced yesterday to more than 10 years in jail for sexually abusing and killing dozens of dogs, and a string of other crimes. Adam Britton, 53, had pleaded guilty to 63 charges relating to bestiality, animal cruelty and possessing child abuse material. In sentencing Britton, Northern Territory Supreme Court Chief Justice Michael Grant described the acts as \"unspeakable\" and \"grotesque.\" Broadcster ABC reported that Britton acquired 42 dogs online from 2020 to 2022, promising their owners he would give them a \"good home.\" Instead, Britton filmed himself raping and killing dogs in a shipping container on his property in Darwin, ABC reported. The footage was shared via Telegram. Police arrested Britton in 2022. Britton was a crocodile expert in Australia and worked on several productions with the BBC and National Geographic. He would be eligible for parole in April 2028 and is banned from owning mammals for the rest of his life.\n\nOrganizers of three Taylor Swift concerts in Vienna this week on Wednesday called them off after officials announced arrests over an apparent plot to launch an attack on an event in the Vienna area such as the concerts. Swift was scheduled to play at the Ernst Happel Stadium yesterday, today and tomorrow as part of her Eras Tour. Event organizer Barracuda Music said in a post on its Instagram channel that \"we have no choice but to cancel the three scheduled shows for everyone's safety.\" It cited government officials' \"confirmation\" of a planned attack at the stadium.\n\nBorder police on Wednesday arrested 15 people connected to a criminal organization that helped smuggle Chinese across the Darien jungle via a \"VIP route\" with fewer challenges to traverse. The arrests were made in the town of Santa Fe. More than 500,000 people traversed the so-called Darien Gap last year, where migrants face dangers such as rapid rivers, wild animals and criminal gangs. However, the \"VIP route\" used all-terrain vehicles and even horses to speed up the sometimes week-long journey for those who could afford it. Chinese were the primary migrants to pay to use the \"VIP route,\" local prosecutor Emeldo Marquez said. He attributed this to their generally higher purchasing power compared with other migrant groups.", "source": {"uri": "taipeitimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Taipei Times"}, "authors": [],

His crimes were committed between 2020 and 2022.\n\nThe investigation revealed that Britton acquired 42 dogs online by promising their owners a \"good home.\" Instead, he subjected these animals to brutal torture and filmed the abuse in a shipping container on his property. Tragically, at least 39 of the dogs succumbed to the mistreatment.\n\nThe court's sentencing reflects the severity of Britton's actions and the impact on both the animal community and the broader public, highlighting the need for stringent legal measures against such acts of cruelty.\n\nIn addition to his lengthy prison sentence, Britton's case has sparked widespread outrage and calls for stronger legal protections for animals. The investigation into Britton's activities began after authorities received disturbing reports and evidence of his crimes. His use of online platforms to acquire dogs under false pretenses added a layer of deception to his already grievous offenses.\n\nBritton's work as a crocodile expert, which included prominent features on BBC and National Geographic, had earned him a reputation in the field of zoology. However, his professional achievements stand in stark contrast to the horrors he inflicted on these animals. The case has raised serious questions about background checks and the monitoring of individuals in positions of trust within the scientific community.\n\nThe sentencing not only reflects the gravity of Britton's actions but also underscores a broader societal issue regarding the treatment of animals. Advocates for animal rights have expressed relief that justice has been served but also emphasize the need for continued vigilance and reform to prevent similar cases in the future.\n\nAs part of his sentence, Britton will be required to register as a sex offender, and his case will likely serve as a cautionary tale for others who might exploit their professional standing for criminal purposes. The Australian court's decision marks a significant moment in the ongoing fight against animal cruelty, reinforcing the message that such actions will not be tolerated.\n\nThe public and animal rights organizations are calling for increased awareness and legislative changes to ensure that those who commit such egregious acts are held accountable. This case serves as a reminder of the importance of safeguarding animals from abuse and ensuring that justice is served for those who suffer in silence.", "source": {"uri": "deccanchronicle.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Deccan Chronicle"}, "authors": [{"uri": "pallavi_raja_shekhar@deccanchronicle.com", "name": "Pallavi Raja Shekhar", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Geographic", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Geographic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoology", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Zoology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shipping_container", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shipping container"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoophilia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Zoophilia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruelty_to_animals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cruelty to animals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torture", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Torture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deception", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Deception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crocodile", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Crocodile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_offender_registries_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sex offender registries in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Relief"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gravity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Background_check", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Background check"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Australian", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Australian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Animal rights"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Animal_Welfare", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Animal Welfare", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Organizations/Animal_Welfare", "label": "dmoz/Society/Organizations/Animal Welfare", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Issues", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.deccanchronicle.com/h-upload/2024/08/09/1829824-whatsappimage2024-08-09at40520pm.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9800268", "eventUri": "eng-9800268", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3490196078431372, "wgt": 140, "relevance": 1}

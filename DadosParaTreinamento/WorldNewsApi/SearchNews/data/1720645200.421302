Two of the Government parties, Fianna Fail and Fine Gael, have polled well based on rough tallies of ballots in Ireland\u2019s local and European Parliament elections. New parties were formed in the run-up to the elections that called for a clampdown on immigration, as did some independent candidates. Finance Minister Michael McGrath said that despite immigration being raised by voters during election campaigning, there was \u201cno massive breakthrough for the far right\u201d based on tallies on Saturday evening. \u201cThat can only be a good thing,\u201d the Fianna Fail TD said at Cork City Hall. \u201cWhile migration did come up on a lot of doors \u2013 and many people do have genuine concerns, legitimate concerns which we are seeking to address \u2013 the far right do not represent the Irish people. I think that is clear from the tallies that we have seen so far. \u201cI\u2019m not surprised by that because the Irish people are very decent and very open minded, and recognise the value of diversity. \u201cThey do want to have an immigration system that is fair, but is also rules-based, and they want to see those rules implemented and enforced consistently and fairly. That\u2019s a message I got at the doors quite a lot. \u201cThere\u2019s no breakthrough here, there\u2019s no tide of support for the far right in these elections from what I can see so far, and that pleases me, I have to say.\u201d", "summary": "The Irish people are \u2018decent\u2019 and \u2018recognise the value of diversity\u2019, the finance minister said.", "url": "https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/european-parliament-government-fianna-fail-fine-gael-b1163091.html", "image": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2024/06/08/18/46732b71c9227a9b33c1d845d054d472Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNzE3OTUzMTEw-2.76454432.jpg?width=1200", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 17:26:51", "author": "By Grinne N.

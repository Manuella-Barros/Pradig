Can\u2019t a girl have a nervous breakdown/trial separation/midlife crisis/death/divorce in peace around here?! ??,\" Trista began, sharing a photograph of herself, her husband and their two kids \u2014 son Maxwell, 16, and daughter Blakesley, 14 \u2014 during a tropical vacation. \"In all seriousness, for those concerned, I\u2019m safe and sound, happy and healthy, in love and grateful. ?,\" she continued. \"For those who\u2019d rather focus on being critical and searching way too hard for darkness, good luck with that. ?.\" Never miss a story \u2014 sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories. According to Trista, \"an opportunity for perspective and personal growth presented itself and with the unconditional support of my family and friends, I chose myself and betterment, knowing that my stay-at-home-mom job and my kids end-of-the-school-year needs were in the best, most capable hands.\" Noting that Ryan, 49, who she called her \"stoic husband\" typically \"chooses privacy over posting,\" Trista said he \"decided to share his love for me in messages that would find me in my travels,\" referring to his social media posts that caused concern among fans. \"We look at Instagram like a digital diary. Most of the time, the world doesn\u2019t pay too much attention. This time, he couldn\u2019t say anything right and just about every news outlet picked up his 'cryptic/confusing/attention-seeking/dramatic' pictures and captions,\" she explained. Added Trista, \"To me, they gave me exactly what my Words of Affirmation love language needed to get me through some serious self doubt and fear\u2026and that\u2019s all that matters.\" Trista then wrote that her husband \u2014 whom she wed in 2003 \u2014 \"doesn\u2019t owe anyone any explanation or require permission to post what he wants to post and share what he wants to share. ?.\" \"If you want to know the rest of the story, I will share in due time,\" she continued. \"For now, it\u2019s back to our regularly scheduled programming - from a beach in Mexico! ?? ?\ufe0f?.\" \"After all, nervous breakdowns and separations require much needed rest and relaxation! ?,\" Trista concluded. The reality star also shared a series of Instagram Stories posts, including one of her husband lounging on the beach \"in his relaxation era,\" as well as one of each of her kids enjoying their getaway. Ryan initially caused concern when he posted a series of photos on Instagram for Mother's Day on May 12. In the posts, he revealed that Trista was spending the day away from him and their children. Days later, he shared an update post, writing, \"Trista is fine. We are fine. We\u2019re great.\" The former firefighter added, \"Trista is at a place in life where she is searching a bit. An opportunity presented itself that may help her on that quest. With her family\u2019s support, she has taken it. Part of that process means that she is temporarily inaccessible to us.\" In one more post shared that same day, Ryan said, \"I really wish I could talk to you. Ask you how you\u2019re doing? How was your day. I\u2019d really like to hear your voice \u2014 just for a minute. So many times I\u2019ve called without much to say, not realizing how lucky I was or how much I\u2019d miss the opportunity if it were gone.\"", "summary": "&#34;For those who\u2019d rather focus on being critical and searching way too hard for darkness, good luck with that,&#34; &#39;The Bachelorette&#39; alum said", "url": "https://people.com/trista-sutter-breaks-her-silence-after-husband-ryan-cryptic-posts-8654099", "image": "https://people.com/thmb/_IWMEbcGACNayUy90CxO-zQSZp0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(728x316:730x318)/ryan-sutter-trista-sutter-the-golden-wedding-052324-1-393320f19caa43b2b84c4719e176c4ed.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 13:00:59", "author": "Nicholas Rice", "authors": ["Nicholas Rice"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.31}

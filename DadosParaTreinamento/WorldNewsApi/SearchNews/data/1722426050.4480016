Bronny James ended up going to the Los Angeles Lakers, but his father\u2019s team wasn\u2019t the only one with interest. \u201cThere were four teams outside of the Lakers that had legitimate interest in taking Bronny,\u201d Chris Broussard said on \u201cFirst Things First.\u201d \u201cThe Clippers, the Timberwolves \u2013 which was not as bad of a situation for him, I know they drafted a young point guard too before him \u2013 the Suns, but they wanted it because of LeBron and the Raptors.\u201d The Raptors, Timberwolves and Clippers all had the opportunity to draft Bronny as they were ahead of the Lakers at 31, 37 and 46, respectively. However, Bronny fell to LeBron and the Lakers at pick No. 55; the Suns were on deck. The controversy arose prior to the draft when ESPN analyst Bob Myers revealed that the James camp admonished others to avoid drafting the former USC player. \u201cRich Paul is calling teams [and saying], \u2018Don\u2019t take Bronny James,'\u201d Myers said. \u201cHe\u2019s telling them, \u2018Do not take him. If you take him, he\u2019s going to Australia.\u2019 So he has a plan and he has a place.\u201d Broussard later provided his sixth sense regarding the situation. \u201cI don\u2019t have a problem with this. This is what agents do,\u201d he said. Broussard drew parallels to Ron Holland II, who had no contact with the Pistons throughout the pre-draft process other than a meeting at the NBA Combine \u2013 and he was selected 5th overall by them. He also reminded viewers about Alex Sarr, who went second to Washington. \u201cA lot of people thought he would go first,\u201d Broussard said. \u201cFor the longest, he was the number one guy in the mock drafts \u2013 he refused to work out for Atlanta.\u201d Despite the other team\u2019s interest in Bronny, Broussard is adamant that Paul did his job well. \u201cTo act like Rich Paul was doing something crazy, something ridiculous\u2026 no,\u201d Broussard said. \u201cThis is what a lot of agents do. He was trying to get his client in the best situation he could.\u201d Paul knew what he had to do and executed well. \u201cHe flexed his muscle,\u201d Broussard said.", "summary": "Bronny James ended up going to the Los Angeles Lakers, but his father's team wasn't the only one with interest.", "url": "https://nypost.com/2024/06/28/sports/nba-insider-reveals-four-teams-who-had-legitimate-interest-in-drafting-bronny-james/", "image": "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/newspress-collage-7xhpj22f1-1719620334182.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1719605963&w=1200", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 02:47:32", "author": "Sean Savage", "authors": ["Sean Savage"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.523}

The 25-year-old former Love Island star found herself at the centre of backlash about her appearance after an image of her face looking notably different went viral in 2019. The TV personality and businesswoman called for an end to the normalisation of cosmetic injectables at the time, vowing to never use them again, and admitting she had first received lip fillers at the age of 17. In an Instagram story shared to her 7.8 million followers on Saturday (9 June), the TV personality shared that she had now been filler-free for almost five years. \u201cThe other day I was actually having a moment of reflection on my filler journey and I realise I haven\u2019t had filler now in coming up to five years, well over four years,\u201d she said. Footage of Hague\u2019s face circulated on social media, as the YouTuber explained at the time that the injectables hadn\u2019t had time to \u201csettle\u201d leading to their enhanced appearance. \u201cI haven\u2019t had any filler put into my face which if you remember my filler debacle, my filler scandal it\u2019s quite, not an achievement but it\u2019s quite a journey to reflect on really,\u201d she continued. \u201cIt\u2019s been so long.\u201d Advocating instead for better skincare, she added that \u201cI truly feel like it\u2019s down to products like these that have helped me on this journey and steered me away from injectables.\u201d Speaking on The Diary Of A CEO with Steven Bartlett podcast in 2021, Hague said of the procedures: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say I got addicted to it, but by the age of 21, I didn\u2019t look like the same person. \u201cI literally looked like a different person. When I look back at pictures now, I\u2019m terrified of myself. I\u2019m like, \u2018Who was that girl?\u2019 I don\u2019t know what happened.\u201d Hague continued: \u201cBut there was this one pivotal moment where I\u2019d gone and got loads of filler and I posted a YouTube video and I hadn\u2019t let the filler settle and it was really swollen and a screenshot from that video, it trended on Twitter for weeks.\u201d The fashion influencer went on to explain how, after seeing the comments online, she decided to have the fillers dissolved. \u201cIt was horrendous. It was utterly horrendous,\u201d she said. \u201cMy face was literally like, it was just awful. That was the moment for me as well where I was like, I think things need to change. \u201cI thought, one day I\u2019m going to get my lips dissolved. It was a process. I went and got my lips dissolved and I posted about it on YouTube and I didn\u2019t expect the response that I got. It was huge.\u201d", "summary": "<p>Star reflected on her journey since \u2018filler scandal\u2019 </p>", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/molly-mae-hague-filler-b2559420.html", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/06/09/13/newFile.jpg?width=1200", "video": "https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/somJcWLp-4VHSaSK0.mp4", "publish_date": "2024-06-09 13:22:31", "author": "Maira Butt", "authors": ["Maira Butt"], "language": "en", "catgory": "entertainment", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.693}

Coach K won the NCAA Tournament five times during his 42-year tenure at Duke and Scheyer has led Duke to back-to-back 27-9 seasons. However, he's losing his top four scorers from an Elite Eight team a season ago and will expect immediate returns from what many believe to be one of the best Duke basketball recruiting classes in recent memory. Anchored by No. 1 overall prospect Cooper Flagg, Duke has the No. 1 recruiting class in 2024 with four five-star prospects and two four-stars already signed.\n\nScheyer also welcomed in commits from the college basketball transfer portal and continues to work the recruiting trail to round out his Duke basketball roster after nine departures from last year's team.

The Blue Devils will lose Kyle Filipowski and Jared McCain, while Jeremy Roach and Mark Mitchell entered the transfer portal. Those were Duke's four leading scorers and Roach will play at Baylor next season, while Mitchell committed to Missouri.\n\nThere were five other scholarship players for the Blue Devils who entered the transfer portal, but none of them averaged more than 9.2 minutes per game for Scheyer's squad in 2023-24. Sean Stewart has already committed to Ohio State, while TJ Power is heading to Virginia. Jaden Schutt, Jaylen Blakes and Christian Reeves remain uncommitted and are weighing their options now that the transfer portal has closed. Join The Devil's Den to see the latest on all of Duke's roster changes.\n\nDuke basketball news, roster\n\nScheyer's 2024 Duke basketball recruiting recruiting class is among the best at any program in recent college basketball history, rivaling some of John Calipari's one-and-done hauls at Kentucky. There are four five-star and two four-star recruits in the class, and all rank among the top 51 players in the nation, per 247Sports. Small forward Cooper Flagg and center Khaman Maluach are the cornerstones of the class. They rank No. 1 and No. 3, respectively, nationally and both are considered likely lottery picks in the 2025 NBA Draft.\n\nDuke returns experience in the backcourt in guards Tyrese Proctor and Caleb Foster, so Flagg and Maluach should complement the existing roster well. To balance all the young talent coming in, Scheyer landed Purdue graduate transfer Mason Gillis and rising junior Maliq Brown from Syracuse. The Blue Devils remain active in recruiting the portal with three scholarships still open.

Now, the Blue Devils are aiming for the Final Four, and will hope having the nation's No. 1 recruiting class, per 247Sports, is the key to doing that. Bringing in talent also meant a mass exodus from the 2023 Duke basketball roster, however, as 10 players left due to graduation, early entry into the NBA Draft, or transfer. The college basketball transfer portal is closed but players in it are still making decisions, so the Blue Devils are putting the finishing touches on their 2024-25 Duke basketball team.\n\nWill the 2024 Duke basketball roster be the one that helps Sheyer take the next step, or will the lack of experience lead to a disappointment?

They were Duke's four leading scorers and accounted for nearly 50 combined points per game. Filipowski's exit was largely expected throughout the season, though McCain was a breakout star who reached one-and-done status. Roach, a two-time team captain, explored entry into the NBA Draft before ultimately landing at Baylor via the portal. Mitchell is joining Missouri as a transfer.\n\nThe bottom half of Duke's roster will also see a big shake up. Reserves Sean Stewart, T.J. Power, Jaden Schutt, Jaylen Blakes and Christian Reeves all departed via the portal.

The six-man class features five of the top 18 players in the nation, according to 247Sports rankings. Small forward Cooper Flagg is the centerpiece. The 6-foot-9 small forward is the consensus top player in the 2024 recruiting cycle and is considered the early favorite to be the No. 1 overall pick in the 2025 NBA Draft.\n\nDuke has also landed two players from the transfer portal thus far. Mason Gillis comes over from Purdue as a graduate transfer after averaging 6.5 points per game in 2023-24.

And he'll face Duke at least once as a sophomore in Charlottesville, as the ACC regular season schedule (no dates announced yet) includes a Virginia home game against the Blue Devils.\n\nThe former top-20 recruit in the class of 2023 averaged 2.1 points, 0.7 rebounds, and 0.2 assists in limited minutes as a Blue Devil, while shooting just shy of 36 percent from three.

He was ranked as the No. 5 player from the state of North Carolina in his class by ESPN and signed with Duke as part of the 2022 class.\n\nAn injury limited Reeves to just three games with the Blue Devils last season and he would end up redshirting. As a freshman, he appeared in 13 games, averaging 3.2 minutes per contest.\n\nReeves is now the latest transfer portal addition for the Tigers ahead of the 2024-25 season, joining former Boston College guard Jaeden Zackery and former Cincinnati forward Viktor Lakhin.", "source": {"uri": "theclemsoninsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Clemson Insider"}, "authors": [{"uri": "gavin_oliver@theclemsoninsider.com", "name": "Gavin Oliver", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clemson_Tigers_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Clemson Tigers football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_Blue_Devils_men's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Duke Blue Devils men's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_transfer_portal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NCAA transfer portal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Brownell", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brad Brownell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_Blue_Devils", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Duke Blue Devils"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanderbilt_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vanderbilt University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oak_Hill_Academy_(Mouth_of_Wilson,_Virginia)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oak Hill Academy (Mouth of Wilson, Virginia)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guard_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Guard (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redshirt_(college_sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Redshirt (college sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_College", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boston College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freshman", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Freshman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Lacrosse", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Lacrosse", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Recruiting", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Recruiting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://theclemsoninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/81/2024/03/Brad-Brownell-2.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554981", "eventUri": "eng-9554981", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 150, "relevance": 1}

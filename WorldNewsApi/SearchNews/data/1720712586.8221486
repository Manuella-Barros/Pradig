His late father, Paddy, was at the forefront of his mind. \u201cIt means a lot because my dad brought me into politics. He passed away around eight months ago, so it means a lot. It means more than words,\u201d said Cllr Ward. How did it feel when he heard his name called out? \u201cLook, all the hard work pays off. That's the main thing. We need to rally for Fianna F\u00e1il, and especially to help out Minister Niall Collins because he does a lot of work on the ground.

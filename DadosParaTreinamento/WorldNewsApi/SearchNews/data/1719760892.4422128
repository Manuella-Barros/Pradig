Julie Etchingham will moderate Sunak v Starmer: The ITV Debate next month in the build-up to the general election on July 4. With the Conservative Party trailing Labour in the polls, the prime minister is reportedly keen to use the platform to claw back support. So when is the first debate, how can you watch it, and will there be further such events before the election? Here\u2019s what you need to know. Sunak v Starmer: The ITV Debate will be broadcast on ITV1, ITVX, and STV and STV on Tuesday, June 4 between 9pm and 10pm, the broadcaster has confirmed. It will take place live in front of a studio audience. Ms Etchingham previously moderated general election debates in 2015, 2017 and 2019. ITV also plans to broadcast a \u201cmulti-party debate\u201d and an interview show with other party leaders. It said it would announce details \u201cin due course\u201d. The BBC, Sky News, and Channel 4 are also thought to be interested in screening debates but have not yet announced any. Net Zero Secretary Claire Coutinho urged both sides to \u201ccommit to weekly debates\u201d. Labour sources indicated Sir Keir would be willing to participate in debates on the channels with the largest audiences \u2014 BBC and ITV. But they said they would not agree to \u201ctearing up\u201d the format established in previous elections \u201cjust to suit this week\u2019s whims of the Tory Party\u201d. \u201cSo I think debates are always a part of an election campaign and no doubt will be a big part of what\u2019s going to happen over the next five or six weeks,\u201d Sir Keir told Times Radio. I\u2019ll debate with voters any day of the week.\u201d Television debates are a relatively new concept to the election run-up in the UK. Labour\u2019s Prime Minister Gordon Brown, Tory leader David Cameron, and Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg participated in the first one in 2010. Labour leader Harold Wilson and Conservative Prime Minister Sir Alec Douglas-Home were approached in 1964, but the debate didn't materialise. Conservative Prime Minister John Major and Labour leader Neil Kinnock agreed in principle to a debate in 1992, but this was called off. Between 1997 and 2005, Tony Blair and successive opponents (John Major, William Hague, and Michael Howard) did not engage in televised debates. The 2015 general election involved a more complex arrangement of debates. David Cameron (Conservatives), Ed Miliband (Labour), Nick Clegg (Liberal Democrats), Nigel Farage (UKIP), Nicola Sturgeon (SNP), Natalie Bennett (Green Party), and Leanne Wood (Plaid Cymru) took part. ITV hosted a seven-way debate; the BBC broadcast a five-way debate featuring parties without the two main leaders (Cameron and Miliband); and a \"challengers' debate\" featuring opposition leaders was also held. In 2017, Prime Minister Theresa May chose not to participate directly in the main debates. Leaders of other parties, including Jeremy Corbyn (Labour), Tim Farron (Liberal Democrats), and leaders from smaller parties, participated. There was a mixture of debates and Q&A sessions with leaders appearing separately. Mrs May\u2019s absence was contentious, with some arguing it affected her campaign negatively. The 2019 general election returned to more traditional head-to-head debates: Prime Minister Boris Johnson (Conservatives) and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn participated in an hour-long debate on ITV. The BBC also hosted a head-to-head debate between the pair and a separate one involving leaders from smaller parties. Andrew Neil also interviewed Mr Corbyn on the BBC, with the Labour leader appearing on a Channel 4 panel discussion on climate change.

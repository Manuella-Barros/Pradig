Nine people were injured, most of them slightly, but there were no reports of serious damage.\n\nThe Japan Meteorological Agency said the quake registered magnitude 7.1 and was centered in waters off the eastern coast of Japan's southern main island of Kyushu at a depth of about 30 kilometers (18.6 miles).\n\nThe quake most strongly shook Nichinan city and nearby areas in Miyazaki prefecture on Kyushu island.\n\nThe agency said tsunami waves of up to 50 centimeters (1.6 feet) were detected along parts of Kyushu's southern coast and the nearby island of Shikoku about a half hour after the quake struck. The tsunami advisory was lifted from most coastlines except those along the Miyazaki prefecture.\n\nSeismologists at the agency held an emergency meeting to analyze whether the quake had affected the nearby Nankai Trough, the source of past devastating earthquakes. They later issued an assessment that the potential for a future quake in the area from Kyushu to central Japan is higher than previously predicted. The agency said it will continue to closely watch movements of plates near the Nankai Trough.\n\nThat does not mean there's an imminent danger of a big quake in the near future, but they urged residents on the coasts along the trough -- which spans about 500 kilometers (310 miles) -- to review their quake preparedness, University of Tokyo seismologist Naoshi Hirata, a member of an expert panel, told a joint news conference with JMA officials.\n\nThere is a 70-80% chance of a magnitude 8 or 9 quake stemming from the Nankai Trough within the next 30 years, Hirara said, adding that Thursday's quake raises that probability even while the timing or exact location cannot be predicted.\n\nThe Fire and Disaster Management Agency said nine people were injured, most of them slightly when falling down or hit by objects in Thursday's quake in Miyazaki and neighboring Kagoshima.\n\nChief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi said officials were assessing possible injuries or serious damage, though none were immediately reported. He urged residents of the affected region to stay away from the coastline.\n\nJMA Seismology Department official Shigeki Aoki warned that strong aftershocks could occur for about a week.\n\nJapan's NHK public television said windows were broken at the Miyazaki airport near the epicenter. The airport's runway was temporarily closed for safety checks.\n\nNHK showed dozens of people gathering at a designated hilltop evacuation area.\n\nIn Osaki in neighboring Kagoshima prefecture, concrete walls collapsed and a wooden house was damaged, but no injuries were reported.\n\nThe Nuclear Regulation Authority said all 12 nuclear reactors, including three that are currently operating, on Kyushu and Shikoku remained safe.\n\nEarthquakes in areas with nuclear power plants have been a major concern since a massive earthquake and tsunami in March 2011 triggered the Fukushima nuclear disaster.\n\nJapan sits on the Pacific \"Ring of Fire,\" a line of seismic faults encircling the Pacific Ocean, and is one of the world's most earthquake-prone countries.\n\nAn earthquake on Jan. 1 in

hit some places, including the port of Miyazaki, more than an hour after the quake, it said.\n\nThe Pacific Tsunami Warning Center issued a warning that said hazardous tsunami waves were possible within 300 kilometres (185 miles) of the epicentre.\n\nNo abnormalities were reported at atomic power plants in the area, according to the nuclear regulation authority.\n\nGovernment spokesman Yoshimasa Hayashi said \"damage to people and property\" was still being assessed.\n\n\"In view of this situation, the prime minister instructed (officials) to provide the public with timely and

wall that had collapsed in a car park.\n\nTask force\n\nThe Japanese government set up a special task force in response to the quakes, according to a statement.\n\nSitting on top of four major tectonic plates along the western edge of the Pacific \"Ring of Fire\", Japan is one of the world's most tectonically active countries.\n\nThe archipelago, home to around 125 million people, experiences around 1,500 jolts every year and accounts for around 18 percent of the world's earthquakes.\n\nThe vast majority are mild, although the damage they cause varies according to their location and the depth below the Earth's surface at which they strike.\n\nStill, even large quakes usually cause little damage thanks to special construction techniques and strict building regulations in the world's number four economy.\n\nAt least 318 people were killed when an earthquake hit the Noto peninsula on the Sea of Japan side of the main island of Honshu on New Year's Day.\n\nThe January 1 quake and its aftershocks toppled buildings, caused fires and knocked out infrastructure.\n\nJapan also routinely holds emergency drills to prepare for a major quake.\n\nIt is haunted by the memory of a colossal 9.0-magnitude undersea quake off northeastern Japan in March 2011, which triggered a tsunami that left around 18,500 people dead or missing.\n\nIt sent three reactors into meltdown at the Fukushima nuclear plant, causing Japan's worst post-war disaster and the most serious nuclear accident since Chernobyl.\n\nIn March 2022, a 7.4-magnitude quake off the coast of Fukushima shook large areas of eastern Japan, killing three people.\n\nThe capital Tokyo was devastated by a huge earthquake a century ago in 1923.TOKYO: A powerful earthquake struck off Japan's southern coast on Thursday, triggering a tsunami advisory.\n\nThe Japan Meteorological Agency said the quake registered magnitude 7.1 and was centered off the eastern coast of Japan's southern main island of Kyushu at a depth of about 30 kilometers (18.6 miles).\n\nIt issued a tsunami advisory, predicting waves of up to 1 meter (3.3 feet) along the southern coast of Kyushu and nearby island of Shikoku.\n\nOperators of nuclear plants on Kyushu and Shikoku said they were checking to see if there was any damage to them.\n\nJapan's NHK public television said there were reports of broken windows at the Miyazaki airport near the epicenter.\n\nJapan sits on the Pacific \"Ring of Fire,\" the line of seismic faults encircling the Pacific Ocean, and is one of the world's most earthquake-prone countries.\n\nAn

Nine people were injured, most of them slightly, but there were no reports of serious damage.\n\nThe Japan Meteorological Agency said the quake registered magnitude 7.1 and was centered in waters off the eastern coast of Japan's southern main island of Kyushu at a depth of about 30 kilometers (18.6 miles).\n\nThe quake most strongly shook Nichinan city and nearby areas in Miyazaki prefecture on Kyushu island.\n\nThe agency said tsunami waves of up to 50 centimeters (1.6 feet) were detected along parts of Kyushu's southern coast and the nearby island of Shikoku about a half hour after the quake struck. The tsunami advisory was lifted from most coastlines except those along the Miyazaki prefecture.\n\nSeismologists at the agency held an emergency meeting to analyze whether the quake had affected the nearby Nankai Trough, the source of past devastating earthquakes. They later issued an assessment that the potential for a future quake in the area from Kyushu to central Japan is higher than previously predicted. The agency said it will continue to closely watch movements of plates near the Nankai Trough.\n\nThat does not mean there's an imminent danger of a big quake in the near future, but they urged residents on the coasts along the trough -- which spans about 500 kilometers (310 miles) -- to review their quake preparedness, University of Tokyo seismologist Naoshi Hirata, a member of an expert panel, told a joint news conference with JMA officials.\n\nThere is a 70-80% chance of a magnitude 8 or 9 quake stemming from the Nankai Trough within the next 30 years, Hirara said, adding that Thursday's quake raises that probability even while the timing or exact location cannot be predicted.\n\nThe Fire and Disaster Management Agency said nine people were injured, most of them slightly when falling down or hit by objects in Thursday's quake in Miyazaki and neighboring Kagoshima.\n\nChief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi said officials were assessing possible injuries or serious damage, though none were immediately reported. He urged residents of the affected region to stay away from the coastline.\n\nJMA Seismology Department official Shigeki Aoki warned that strong aftershocks could occur for about a week.\n\nJapan's NHK public television said windows were broken at the Miyazaki airport near the epicenter. The airport's runway was temporarily closed for safety checks.\n\nNHK showed dozens of people gathering at a designated hilltop evacuation area.\n\nIn Osaki in neighboring Kagoshima prefecture, concrete walls collapsed and a wooden house was damaged, but no injuries were reported.\n\nThe Nuclear Regulation Authority said all 12 nuclear reactors, including three that are currently operating, on Kyushu and Shikoku remained safe.\n\nEarthquakes in areas with nuclear power plants have been a major concern since a massive earthquake and tsunami in March 2011 triggered the Fukushima nuclear disaster.\n\nJapan sits on the Pacific \"Ring of Fire,\" a line of seismic faults encircling the Pacific Ocean, and is one of the world's most earthquake-prone countries.\n\nAn earthquake on Jan. 1 in

Three people were injured but there were no reports of serious damage.\n\nThe Japan Meteorological Agency said the quake registered magnitude 7.1 and was centered in waters off the eastern coast of Japan's southern main island of Kyushu at a depth of about 30 kilometers (18.6 miles).\n\nThe quake most strongly shook Nichinan city and nearby areas in Miyazaki prefecture on Kyushu island.\n\nThe agency said tsunami waves of up to 50 centimeters (1.6 feet) were detected along parts of Kyushu's southern coast and the nearby island of Shikoku about a half hour after the quake struck. The tsunami advisory was lifted from most coastlines except those along the Miyazaki prefecture.\n\nSeismologists at the agency held an emergency meeting to analyze whether the quake had affected the nearby Nankai Trough, the source of past devastating earthquakes. They later issued an assessment that the potential for a future quake in the area from Kyushu to central Japan is higher than previously predicted. The agency said it will continue to closely watch movements of plates near the Nankai Trough.\n\nThat does not mean there's an imminent danger of a big quake in the near future, but they urged residents on the coasts along the trough -- which spans about 500 kilometers (310 miles) -- to review their quake preparedness, University of Tokyo seismologist Naoshi Hirata, a member of an expert panel, told a joint news conference with JMA officials.\n\nThere is a 70-80% chance of a magnitude 8 or 9 quake stemming from the Nankai Trough within the next 30 years, Hirara said, adding that Thursday's quake raises that probability even while the timing or exact location cannot be predicted.\n\nThe Fire and Disaster Management Agency said three people were injured in Thursday's quake. Two of them fell down when the quake struck and another was hit by a falling object.\n\nChief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi said officials were assessing possible injuries or serious damage, though none were immediately reported. He urged residents of the affected region to stay away from the coastline.\n\nJMA Seismology Department official Shigeki Aoki warned that strong aftershocks could occur for about a week.\n\nJapan's NHK public television said windows were broken at the Miyazaki airport near the epicenter. The airport's runway was temporarily closed for safety checks.\n\nNHK showed dozens of people gathering at a designated hilltop evacuation area.\n\nIn Osaki in neighboring Kagoshima prefecture, concrete walls collapsed and a wooden house was damaged, but no injuries were reported.\n\nThe Nuclear Regulation Authority said all 12 nuclear reactors, including three that are currently operating, on Kyushu and Shikoku remained safe.\n\nEarthquakes in areas with nuclear power plants have been a major concern since a massive earthquake and tsunami in March 2011 triggered the Fukushima nuclear disaster.\n\nJapan sits on the Pacific \"Ring of Fire,\" a line of seismic faults encircling the Pacific Ocean, and is one of the world's most earthquake-prone countries.\n\nAn earthquake on Jan. 1 in Japan's north-central region of Noto left more than 240 people dead.", "source": {"uri": "thenationalherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The National Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri":

It issued tsunami warnings, but lifted them for most areas three hours later and for all remaining coasts five and a half hours later.\n\nThe agency's seismologists held an emergency meeting to analyze whether the quake had affected the nearby Nankai region, the source of previous devastating quakes. They later issued an assessment that the possibility of a future quake in the area stretching from Kyushu to central Japan was higher than previously thought. The agency said it would continue to closely monitor plate movements near the Nankai region.\n\nThat doesn't mean there's an imminent risk of a major quake in the near future, but they are urging coastal residents along the basin -- which stretches about 500 kilometers (310 miles) -- to review their quake preparations, University of Tokyo seismologist Naoshi Hirata, a member of the expert panel, said at a joint news conference with Japan Meteorological Agency officials.\n\nHirata said there is a 70% to 80% chance of a magnitude 8 or 9 earthquake occurring in the Nankai Trough in the next 30 years, adding that Thursday's quake raises that possibility even though the exact timing and location of the quake cannot be predicted. He urged residents to maintain high levels of caution for a week at a time.\n\nPrime Minister Fumio Kishida told reporters that the government's crisis management team would step up its disaster preparations, and urged residents to pay attention to information issued by authorities in the event of another major disaster and never spread misleading information.\n\nNine people were injured, most of them minor injuries when they fell or were hit by objects, in Thursday's quake in Miyazaki and neighboring Kagoshima, the Fire and Disaster Management Agency said.\n\nChief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi said officials were assessing the possibility of casualties or major damage, though no injuries were immediately reported. He urged residents in the affected area to stay away from the coast.\n\nShigeki Aoki, an official at the Japan Meteorological Agency's earthquake management, warned of the possibility of strong aftershocks lasting for about a week.\n\nWindows were shattered at Miyazaki Airport, near the epicenter of the quake, NHK said. The airport runway was temporarily closed for safety checks.\n\nKyushu's Shinkansen bullet trains have resumed normal operations after temporary safety checks, but a number of local train lines in quake-hit areas are scheduled to be suspended until Friday, according to Kyushu Railway Co.\n\nFootage broadcast by Japanese broadcaster NHK showed dozens of people gathering in a designated evacuation zone on a hilltop.\n\nIn Osaki city in neighboring Kagoshima Prefecture, concrete walls collapsed and a wooden house was damaged, but no injuries were reported.\n\nThe Nuclear Regulatory Authority said all 12 nuclear reactors, including three currently operating, in Kyushu and Shikoku remain safe.\n\nEarthquakes in areas where nuclear power plants are located have become a major concern since the devastating earthquake and tsunami in March 2011 led to the Fukushima nuclear disaster.\n\nJapan lies on the Pacific \"Ring of Fire,\" a line of seismic faults that circle the Pacific Ocean, and is one of the world's most earthquake-prone countries.\n\nAn earthquake that struck the Noto region in north-central Japan on January 1 killed more than 240 people.\n\nWhat Are The

Please do not enter the sea or approach the coast until the warning is lifted,\" the Japan Meteorological Agency said on X.\n\nThere were no immediate reports of any damage.\n\nThe USGS said that the first quake hit at 4:42 pm (0742 GMT) at a depth of 33 kilometres, about 29 kilometres southeast of Miyazaki on Kyushu.\n\nThe second struck less than a minute later at a depth of 26 metres and was 20 kilometres northeast of Miyazaki.\n\nThe Japanese government set up a special task force in response to the quakes, according to a statement.\n\nSitting on top of four major tectonic plates along the western edge of the Pacific known as the \"Ring of Fire\", Japan is one of the world's most tectonically active countries.\n\nThe archipelago, home to around 125 million people, experiences around 1,500 jolts every year and accounts for around 18 per cent of the world's earthquakes.\n\nThe vast majority are mild, although the damage they cause varies according to their location and the depth below the Earth's surface at which they strike.\n\nStill, even large quakes usually cause little damage thanks to special construction techniques and strict building regulations in the world's number four economy.\n\nOn New Year's Day, at least 260 people died after a massive earthquake hit the peninsula, including 30 \"quake-linked\" deaths as well as those killed directly in the disaster.\n\nThe January 1 quake and its aftershocks toppled buildings, caused fires and knocked out infrastructure at a time when families were celebrating the new year.\n\nJapan has strict construction regulations intended to ensure buildings can withstand strong earthquakes, and routinely holds emergency drills to prepare for a major jolt.\n\nBut the country is haunted by the memory of a massive 9.0-magnitude undersea quake off northeastern Japan in March 2011, which triggered a tsunami that left around 18,500 people dead or missing.\n\nThe 2011 tsunami also sent three reactors into meltdown at the Fukushima nuclear plant, causing Japan's worst post-war disaster and the most serious nuclear accident since Chernobyl.\n\nIn March 2022, a 7.4-magnitude quake off the coast of Fukushima shook large areas of eastern Japan, killing three people.\n\nThe capital Tokyo was devastated by a huge earthquake a century ago in 1923.", "source": {"uri": "aol.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo

Tsunami advisories were issued, but lifted for most areas three hours later, and for all remaining coastlines five and a half hours later.\n\nSeismologists at the agency held an emergency meeting to analyze whether the quake had affected the nearby Nankai Trough, the source of past devastating earthquakes. They later issued an assessment that the potential for a future quake in the area from Kyushu to central Japan is higher than previously predicted. The agency said it will continue to closely watch movements of plates near the Nankai Trough.\n\nThat does not mean there's an imminent danger of a big quake in the near future, but they urged residents on the coasts along the trough -- which spans about 500 kilometers (310 miles) -- to review their quake preparedness, University of Tokyo seismologist Naoshi Hirata, a member of an expert panel, told a joint news conference with JMA officials.\n\nThere is a 70-80% chance of a magnitude 8 or 9 quake stemming from the Nankai Trough within the next 30 years, Hirata said, adding that Thursday's quake raises that probability even while the timing or exact location cannot be predicted. He urged residents to keep their caution levels high for a week for the time being.\n\nPrime Minister Fumio Kishida told reporters that the government crisis management team was to step up disaster preparedness, and called on residents to pay close attention to information from the authorities in case of another big one and never to spread disinformation.\n\nThe Fire and Disaster Management Agency said nine people were injured, most of them slightly when falling down or hit by objects in Thursday's quake in Miyazaki and neighboring Kagoshima.\n\nChief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi said officials were assessing possible injuries or serious damage, though none were immediately reported. He urged residents of the affected region to stay away from the coastline.\n\nJMA Seismology Department official Shigeki Aoki warned that strong aftershocks could occur for about a week.\n\nJapan's NHK public television said windows were broken at the Miyazaki airport near the epicenter. The airport's runway was temporarily closed for safety checks.\n\nKyushu \"shinkansen\" super-express trains returned to normal operations after temporary safety checks, but a number of local train lines in the quake-hit areas were to be suspended through Friday, according to Kyushu Railway Co.\n\nNHK showed dozens of people gathering at a designated hilltop evacuation area.\n\nIn Osaki in neighboring Kagoshima prefecture, concrete walls collapsed and a wooden house was damaged, but no injuries were reported.\n\nThe Nuclear Regulation Authority said all 12 nuclear reactors, including three that are currently operating, on Kyushu and Shikoku remained safe.\n\nEarthquakes in areas with nuclear power plants have been a major concern since a massive earthquake and tsunami in March 2011 triggered the Fukushima nuclear disaster.\n\nJapan sits on the Pacific \"Ring of Fire,\" a line of seismic faults encircling the Pacific Ocean, and is one of the world's most earthquake-prone countries.\n\nAn earthquake on Jan. 1 in Japan's north-central region of Noto left more than 240 people dead.", "source": {"uri": "hosted.ap.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Associated Press"},

The USGS had initially reported two strong quakes, with magnitudes of 6.9 and 7.1, but later said there had only been one tremor.\n\nThe Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) also said there was one quake with a magnitude of 7.1.\n\nBroadcaster NHK showed footage of traffic lights shaking violently in Miyazaki on Kyushu's southeast coast.\n\n\"The surface of the sea is wavering. I felt an intense jolt when the quake happened, which lasted for between 30 seconds and a minute,\" one local official told NHK. The broadcaster also reported that three people were hurt in Miyazaki but gave no indication of the extent of their injuries.\n\nTsunamis of up to one metre were initially expected to arrive or had arrived in some coastal areas in Kyushu and Shikoku islands, the JMA said. The agency also said a small tsunami was possible in Chiba, about 850 kilometres (530 miles) from the epicentre.\n\n\"Tsunamis will strike repeatedly. Please do not enter the sea or approach the coast until the warning is lifted,\" the JMA said on social media platform X.\n\nHowever, tsunamis of only 50 cm, 20 cm, and 10 cm were confirmed to have hit some places, including the port of Miyazaki, more than an hour after the quake, it said.\n\nThe Pacific Tsunami Warning Center issued a warning that said hazardous tsunami waves were possible within 300 kilometres (185 miles) of the epicentre.\n\nNo abnormalities were reported at atomic power plants in the area, according to the nuclear regulation authority.\n\nGovernment spokesman Yoshimasa Hayashi said \"damage to people and property\" was still being assessed.\n\n\"In view of this situation, the prime minister instructed (officials) to provide the public with timely and accurate information on tsunamis and evacuations,\" he said.\n\nUnverified footage shared on social media showed only minor damage, including dishes and books that had fallen off shelves and a small wall that had collapsed in a car park.\n\nTask force\n\nThe Japanese government set up a special task force in response to the quakes, according to a statement.\n\nSitting on top of four major tectonic plates along the western edge of the Pacific \"Ring of Fire\", Japan is one of the world's most tectonically active countries. The archipelago, home to around 125 million people, experiences around 1,500 jolts every year and accounts for around 18 percent of the world's earthquakes.\n\nThe vast majority are mild, although the damage they cause varies according to their location and the depth below the Earth's surface at which they strike. Still, even large quakes usually cause little damage thanks to special construction techniques and strict building regulations in the world's number four economy.\n\nAt least 318 people were killed when an earthquake hit the Noto peninsula on the Sea of Japan side of the main island of Honshu on New Year's Day.\n\nThe January 1 quake and its aftershocks toppled buildings, caused fires, and knocked out infrastructure. Japan also routinely holds emergency drills to prepare for a major earthquake.\n\nIt is haunted by the memory of a colossal 9.0-magnitude undersea quake off northeastern Japan in March 2011, which triggered a tsunami that left around 18,500 people dead or missing.\n\nIt sent three reactors into meltdown at the Fukushima nuclear plant, causing Japan's worst post-war disaster and the most serious nuclear accident since Chernobyl.\n\nIn March 2022, a 7.4-magnitude quake off the coast of Fukushima shook large areas of eastern Japan, killing three people.\n\nThe capital, Tokyo, was devastated by a huge earthquake a century ago, in 1923.", "source": {"uri": "timesofindia.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Times of India"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The quake hit at a depth of 30 kilometers (18.6 miles), the agency said.\n\nChief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi said at a news conference that there have been no reports of abnormalities at nuclear power plants after the quake and that the government is assessing for casualties and damage. Japan Rail suspended bullet train services as a precaution, state broadcaster NHK reported.\n\nWhile Japan is familiar with earthquakes - the country sits on the Pacific Ring of Fire - large tremors on the coast cause particular alarm because of their propensity to cause tsunamis. Japan experiences about 1,500 earthquakes annually that can be felt by people, with some kind of seismic activity recorded once every five minutes.\n\nThe JMA also said that it is investigating whether the quake has links to the submarine Nankai Trough, a known hotbed of geological tension. Earthquakes typically occur there every 100-150 years, the last around 70 years ago, according to Japanese media.\n\nMemories of the magnitude-9 earthquake that struck the Tohoku region on the east coast in 2011, causing a devastating tsunami that claimed almost 20,000 lives, remain raw in Japan.

within 300 kilometers of the epicentre.\n\nNo abnormalities were reported at atomic power plants in the area, according to the nuclear regulation authority.\n\nGovernment spokesman Yoshimasa Hayashi said \"damage to people and property\" was still being assessed.\n\n\"In view of this situation, the prime minister instructed (officials) to provide the public with timely and accurate information on tsunamis and evacuations,\" he said.\n\nUnverified footage shared on social media showed only minor damage, including dishes and books that had fallen off shelves and a small wall that had collapsed in a car park.\n\nTask force\n\nThe Japanese government set up a special task force in response to the quakes, according to a statement.\n\nSitting on top of four major tectonic plates along the western edge of the Pacific \"Ring of Fire\", Japan is one of the world's most tectonically active countries.\n\nThe archipelago, home to around 125 million people, experiences around 1,500 jolts every year and accounts for around 18 percent of the world's earthquakes.\n\nThe vast majority are mild, although the damage they cause varies according to their location and the depth below the Earth's surface at which they strike.\n\nStill, even large quakes usually cause little damage thanks to special construction techniques and strict building regulations in the world's number four economy.\n\nAt least 318 people were killed when an earthquake hit the Noto peninsula on the Sea of Japan side of the main island of Honshu on New Year's Day.\n\nThe January 1 quake and its aftershocks toppled buildings, caused fires and knocked out infrastructure.\n\nJapan also routinely holds emergency drills to prepare for a major quake.\n\nIt is haunted by the memory of a colossal 9.0-magnitude undersea quake off northeastern Japan in March 2011, which triggered a tsunami that left around 18,500 people dead or missing.\n\nIt sent three reactors into meltdown at the Fukushima nuclear plant, causing Japan's worst post-war disaster and the most serious nuclear accident since Chernobyl.\n\nIn March 2022, a 7.4-magnitude quake off the coast of Fukushima shook large areas of eastern Japan, killing three people.\n\nThe capital Tokyo was devastated by a huge earthquake a century ago in 1923.", "source": {"uri": "english.sina.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "sina1.com"},

The Japan Meteorological Agency reported that the quake had a magnitude of 7.1 and was centred in waters off the eastern coast of Kyushu, Japan's southern main island, at a depth of approximately 18.6 miles (30km).\n\nNichinan city and surrounding areas in Miyazaki prefecture on Kyushu island felt the quake most intensely. Tsunami waves of up to 1.6ft (50cm) were detected along parts of Kyushu's southern coast and the nearby island of Shikoku about half an hour after the quake occurred, according to the agency.\n\nRead more: Woman accused of sparking false rumours in Southport stabbing case speaks out Keep up to date with all the latest breaking news and top stories from the North East with our free newsletter\n\nSeismologists convened an emergency meeting to determine whether the quake had impacted the nearby Nankai Trough, which has been the source of past devastating earthquakes. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi stated that officials were evaluating potential injuries or serious damage, although none were immediately reported. He urged residents in the affected area to stay away from the coastline.\n\nJapan's NHK public television reported broken windows at Miyazaki airport near the epicentre, leading to a temporary closure of the airport's runway for safety checks. NHK showed footage of dozens of people gathering at a designated hilltop evacuation area.

They later issued an assessment that the potential for a future quake in the area from Kyushu to central Japan is higher than previously predicted. The agency said it will continue to closely watch movements of plates near the Nankai Trough.\n\nThat does not mean there's an imminent danger of a big quake in the near future, but they urged residents on the coasts along the trough -- which spans about 500 kilometres (310 miles) -- to review their quake preparedness, University of Tokyo seismologist Naoshi Hirata, a member of an expert panel, told a joint news conference with JMA officials.\n\nThere is a 70-80% chance of a magnitude 8 or 9 quake stemming from the Nankai Trough within the next 30 years, Hirara said, adding that Thursday's quake raises that probability even while the timing or exact location cannot be predicted.\n\nThe Fire and Disaster Management Agency said three people were injured in Thursday's quake. Two of them fell down when the quake struck and another was hit by a falling object.\n\nChief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi said officials were assessing possible injuries or serious damage, though none were immediately reported.

The US Geological Survey said the first quake had a magnitude of 6.9, followed by a second quake with a magnitude of 7.1. The seismic activity prompted the Japan Meteorological Agency to issue a tsunami warning. According to the Japan Meteorological Agency, the first quake registered an initial magnitude of 7.1 immediately, followed by a second quake less than a minute later. The first quake struck off the east coast of Japan's main southern island of Kyushu at a depth of about 30 kilometers. The second quake, which struck 20 kilometers northeast of Miyazaki, struck at a depth of 26 meters. The tsunami waves generated by the quake were estimated to be about one meter high. In response to the twin quakes, the Japanese government issued a warning of possible tsunami waves of up to one meter high along the southern coast of Kyushu and the nearby island of Shikoku. Meanwhile, the Japanese government has also set up a special task force for rescue operations. \"The tsunami will strike repeatedly. Please do not enter the sea or approach the coast until the warning is lifted,\" the Japan Meteorological Agency said on its website. Operators of nuclear plants in Kyushu and Shikoku are currently assessing their facilities for possible damage from the quakes. According to public broadcaster NHK, windows were reported to have been shattered at Miyazaki Airport, which is near the epicenter of the quake. Part of the Pacific \"Ring of Fire,\" Japan is one of the world's most earthquake-prone regions. A 9.0-magnitude quake and subsequent tsunami in March 2011 devastated large areas along Japan's northeastern coast, killing nearly 20,000 people and triggering nuclear meltdowns at Fukushima Daiichi. On Jan. 1, a 7.6-magnitude quake struck the north-central region of Noto, killing 241 people.\n\nWhat Are The Main Benefits Of Comparing Car Insurance Quotes Online", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan_Meteorological_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Japan Meteorological Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moment_magnitude_scale", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Moment magnitude scale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthquake", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Earthquake"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsunami", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tsunami"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyushu", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kyushu"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsunami_warning_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tsunami warning system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Government of Japan"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miyazaki_Prefecture", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miyazaki Prefecture"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miyazaki Prefecture"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shikoku", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shikoku"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miyazaki_Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miyazaki Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_of_Fire", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ring of Fire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fukushima_Daiichi_Nuclear_Power_Plant", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NHK", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NHK"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epicenter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Epicenter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_meltdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear meltdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pacific Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_power_plant", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear power plant"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Natural_Disasters_and_Hazards", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Natural Disasters and Hazards", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Militaria", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Militaria", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Japanese", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Japanese", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Environment", "label": "news/Environment", "wgt": 58}], "image": "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112369470,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-586776,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9800494", "eventUri": "eng-9800494", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-01-01", "textStart": 1787, "textEnd": 1793}, {"amb": false, "date": "2011-03-", "textStart": 1632, "textEnd": 1642}], "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

Please do not enter the sea or approach the coast until the warning is lifted,\" the Japan Meteorological Agency said on X.\n\nThere were no immediate reports of any damage.\n\nThe USGS said that the first quake hit at 4:42 pm (0742 GMT) at a depth of 33 kilometres, about 29 kilometres southeast of Miyazaki on Kyushu.\n\nThe second struck less than a minute later at a depth of 26 metres and was 20 kilometres northeast of Miyazaki.\n\nThe Japanese government set up a special task force in response to the quakes, according to a statement.\n\nSitting on top of four major tectonic plates along the western edge of the Pacific \"Ring of Fire\", Japan is one of the world's most tectonically active countries.\n\nThe archipelago, home to around 125 million people, experiences around 1,500 jolts every year and accounts for around 18 percent of the world's earthquakes.\n\nThe vast majority are mild, although the damage they cause varies according to their location and the depth below the Earth's surface at which they strike.\n\nStill, even large quakes usually cause little damage thanks to special construction techniques and strict building regulations in the world's number four economy.\n\nOn New Year's Day, at least 260 people died after a massive earthquake hit the peninsula, including 30 \"quake-linked\" deaths as well as those killed directly in the disaster.\n\nThe January 1 quake and its aftershocks toppled buildings, caused fires and knocked out infrastructure at a time when families were celebrating the new year.\n\nJapan has strict construction regulations intended to ensure buildings can withstand strong earthquakes, and routinely holds emergency drills to prepare for a major jolt.\n\nBut the country is haunted by the memory of a massive 9.0-magnitude undersea quake off northeastern Japan in March 2011, which triggered a tsunami that left around 18,500 people dead or missing.\n\nThe 2011 tsunami also sent three reactors into meltdown at the Fukushima nuclear plant, causing Japan's worst post-war disaster and the most serious nuclear accident since Chernobyl.\n\nIn March 2022, a 7.4-magnitude quake off the coast of Fukushima shook large areas of eastern Japan, killing three people.\n\nThe capital Tokyo was devastated by a huge earthquake a century ago in 1923.", "source": {"uri": "tribune.com.pk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

Please do not enter the sea or approach the coast until the warning is lifted,\" the JMA said on social media platform X.\n\nHowever, tsunamis of only 50 cm, 20 cm, and 10 cm were confirmed to have hit some places, including the port of Miyazaki, more than an hour after the quake, it said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Pacific Tsunami Warning Center issued a warning that said hazardous tsunami waves were possible within 300 kilometers (185 miles) of the epicenter.\n\nNo abnormalities were reported at atomic power plants in the area, according to the nuclear regulation authority.\n\nGovernment spokesman Yoshimasa Hayashi said \"damage to people and property\" was still being assessed.\n\n\"In view of this situation, the prime minister instructed (officials) to provide the public with timely and accurate information on tsunamis and evacuations,\" he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnverified footage shared on social media showed only minor damage, including dishes and books that had fallen off shelves and a small wall that had collapsed in a car park.\n\nTask force\n\nThe Japanese government set up a special task force in response to the quakes, according to a statement.\n\nSitting on top of four major tectonic plates along the western edge of the Pacific \"Ring of Fire,\" Japan is one of the world's most tectonically active countries.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe archipelago, home to around 125 million people, experiences around 1,500 jolts every year and accounts for around 18 percent of the world's earthquakes.\n\nThe vast majority are mild, although the damage they cause varies according to their location and the depth below the Earth's surface at which they strike.\n\nStill, even large quakes usually cause little damage thanks to special construction techniques and strict building regulations in the world's number four economy.\n\nAt least 318 people were killed when an earthquake hit the Noto peninsula on the Sea of Japan side of the main island of Honshu on New Year's Day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe January 1 quake and its aftershocks toppled buildings, caused fires and knocked out infrastructure.\n\nJapan also routinely holds emergency drills to prepare for a major quake.\n\nIt is haunted by the memory of a colossal 9.0-magnitude undersea quake off northeastern Japan in March 2011, which triggered a tsunami that left around 18,500 people dead or missing.\n\nIt sent three reactors into meltdown at the Fukushima nuclear plant, causing Japan's worst post-war disaster and the most serious nuclear accident since Chernobyl.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn March 2022, a 7.4-magnitude quake off the coast of Fukushima shook large areas of eastern Japan, killing three people.\n\nThe capital Tokyo was devastated by a huge earthquake a century ago in 1923.",

Tidal waves of up to one metre have arrived or will arrive and are 'expected to strike repeatedly', Japan's Meteorological Agency warned as Japan braced for impact.\n\nA violent quake was initially detected off the southeast of Japan, registering at 7.1 magnitude and causing authorities to halt trains and urge people to seek higher ground. Minutes later, another 7.1 magnitude tremor struck the island again and buffeted the nearby island of Shikoku, according to the United States Geological Survey.\n\nTsunami advisories were sent out over several regions in the southwestern islands of Kyushu and Shikoku, as Japan prepared its rapid response forces. ''First time in my life I've felt shaking like this,' one resident of Kyushu said as homes and power lines began to shake. 'Normally I barely feel it when I'm outside or in a car, but it shook to the point that even when I'm standing, there was a fluttering feeling.'\n\nThe quake most strongly shook Nichinan city and nearby areas in Miyazaki prefecture on Kyushu island. Footage from Japan showed light fixtures and wall decorations swinging as the earthquakes hit today. Japan's meteorological society predicted waves of up to 1 meter (3.3 feet) along the southern coast of Kyushu and Shikoku. NHK reported that there were no abnormalities detected at Japan's Sendai nuclear power plant in Kagoshima, harking back to the devastating Fukushima nuclear accident in 2011 as power supplies were knocked offline by an earthquake.\n\nThe Nuclear Regulation Authority said all 12 nuclear reactors, including three which are currently operating, on Kyushu and Shikoku remained safe. The Japanese government has set up a special task force in response to the quakes, the USGS reported. Seismologists were also holding an emergency meeting to analyse whether the quake had affected the nearby Nankai Trough, the source of past devastating earthquakes.\n\nChief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi (pictured) said officials were assessing possible injuries or serious damage, though none were immediately reported. He urged residents of the affected region to stay away from the coastline.\n\nPrime Minister Fumio Kishida (picture) wrote on Twitter/X that he had issued instructions in response, and that authorities were collecting information on damage. 'Please continue to be on the lookout for strong shaking and take action to protect your lives,' he wrote.\n\nSitting on top of four major tectonic plates along the western edge of the Pacific 'Ring of Fire', Japan is one of the world's most tectonically active countries. The archipelago, home to around 125 million people, experiences around 1,500 jolts every year and accounts for around 18 percent of the world's earthquakes.\n\nThe vast majority are mild, although the damage they cause varies according to their location and the depth below the Earth's surface at which they strike. Still, even large quakes usually cause little damage thanks to special construction techniques and strict building regulations in the world's number four economy.\n\nOn New Year's Day, at least 260 people died after a massive earthquake hit the peninsula, including 30 'quake-linked' deaths as well as those killed directly in the disaster. The January 1 quake and its aftershocks toppled buildings, caused fires and knocked out infrastructure at a time when families were celebrating the new year.\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

The quake, which occurred at 4:42 PM local time, was centered near Miyazaki on Japan's southern island of Kyushu, according to the United States Geological Survey (USGS). The Japan Meteorological Agency initially registered the tremor with a preliminary magnitude of 6.9.\n\nIn the aftermath of the quake, dramatic videos have surfaced, capturing the intense tremors and its impact on the region. The footage shows people scrambling for cover and objects falling as the tremors shook the area. These videos provide a stark visual representation of the earthquake's power and the immediate aftermath of the seismic activity.\n\nFollowing the earthquake, a tsunami advisory was issued for the coastal areas of Miyazaki, Kochi, Oita, Kagoshima, and Ehime prefectures. The advisory predicts waves of up to 1 meter (3.3 feet) along the southern coast of Kyushu and the nearby island of Shikoku. Residents in the affected areas have been urged to stay away from seashores and avoid attempting to observe the situation due to potential dangers.\n\nJapan, known for its seismic activity, has stringent building regulations designed to withstand powerful earthquakes. With a population of about 125 million, the country experiences around 1,500 earthquakes each year, most of which are minor. However, the impact of each quake can vary based on location and depth.\n\nThe latest earthquake follows a tragic incident on New Year's Day when a massive quake resulted in at least 260 deaths. The January 1 earthquake and its aftershocks caused significant damage, including building collapses and infrastructure failures during New Year celebrations.\n\nJapan's most devastating earthquake on record occurred on March 11, 2011, with a magnitude of 9.0. This undersea quake triggered a tsunami that resulted in approximately 18,500 deaths or missing persons and caused a nuclear disaster at the Fukushima plant. The total cost of the 2011 disaster was estimated at 16.9 trillion yen ($112 billion), not including the ongoing decommissioning of the Fukushima facility, which is expected to take decades.", "source": {"uri": "newsable.asianetnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Asianet News Network Pvt Ltd"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthquake", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Earthquake"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsunami", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tsunami"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richter_magnitude_scale", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Richter magnitude scale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyushu", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kyushu"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miyazaki_Prefecture", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Miyazaki Prefecture"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miyazaki Prefecture"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan_Meteorological_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Japan Meteorological Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Geological_Survey", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Geological Survey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ehime_Prefecture", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ehime Prefecture"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ehime Prefecture"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prefectures_of_Japan", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prefectures of Japan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kagoshima", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kagoshima"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kagoshima"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u014cita_Prefecture", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "\u014cita Prefecture"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "\u014cita Prefecture"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shikoku", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shikoku"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kochi", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kochi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kochi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fukushima_nuclear_disaster", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fukushima nuclear disaster"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fukushima_Daiichi_Nuclear_Power_Plant", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Year's_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Year's Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aftershock", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aftershock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_yen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Japanese yen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fukushima_Prefecture", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fukushima Prefecture"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Fukushima Prefecture"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Travelogues", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Travelogues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Natural_Disasters_and_Hazards", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Natural Disasters and Hazards", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Future/Catastrophes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Future/Catastrophes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 69}], "image": "https://static-gi.asianetnews.com/images/01j4rjg3d2kabm6qytn9qyxvyh/whatsapp-image-2024-08-08-at-14-08-24.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9800494", "eventUri": "eng-9800494", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-01-01", "textStart": 1625, "textEnd": 1634}, {"amb": false, "date": "2011-03-11", "textStart": 1839, "textEnd": 1853}], "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

One home in Kagoshima is said to have collapsed, but no injuries were reported. Regional nuclear plants are still reporting no abnormalities.\n\nMiyazaki Airport experienced delays, and while bullet train services have resumed for the region, local services may still be disrupted.\n\nThe people of southwestern Japan seem to have avoided major damage, though the shaking would have been terrifying.\n\nMORE: At least 8 dead after powerful earthquake strikes Japan, triggering tsunami warning\n\nThe epicenter was located in the Hyuganada Sea, just off the eastern coast of Japan's southern main island of Kyushu, and was measured at a depth of about 30 kilometers (18.6 miles). The Japan Meteorological Agency initially issued a tsunami advisory, predicting waves of up to 1 meter (3.3 feet) along the southern coast of Kyushu and nearby island of Shikoku.\n\nPeople have been urged to stay away from the coast or river and have been warned that other quakes -- even on the same magnitude --may occur.\n\nVideo filmed by Ryosuke Take, an employee at a local radio station in Kirishima on Japan's island of Kyushu, shows objects in the office vigorously shaking.\n\n\"The shaking was very strong,\" Ryosuke told ABC News. Listeners also reported that \"in private homes, dishes fell from kitchens, and nearby hotels have reported that their elevators and kitchens are unusable.\"\n\nOne area in Kochi prefecture is ordering residents to evacuate but drastic sea level changes have not been reported.\n\nThe quake registered a lower 6 in the hardest-hit areas -- very high on the Japanese shake scale, which goes from 0 to 7. It would've been strong enough to knock over furniture, damage some concrete buildings and even topple some wooden ones.\n\nHowever, there are currently no reports of any major damage and shaking was not felt in the capital city of Tokyo. Additionally, there have been no change or irregularities reported with regional nuclear plants so far.\n\nABC News' Anthony Trotter and Morgan Winsor contributed to this report.\n\n7.1 magnitude earthquake strikes coast of Japan originally appeared on abcnews.go.com", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jon_haworth@aol.com", "name": "Jon Haworth", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moment_magnitude_scale", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Moment magnitude scale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthquake", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Earthquake"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyushu", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyushu"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan_Meteorological_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Japan Meteorological Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epicenter", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Epicenter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miyazaki_Prefecture", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Miyazaki Prefecture"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miyazaki Prefecture"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsunami", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tsunami"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kagoshima_Prefecture", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kagoshima Prefecture"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kagoshima Prefecture"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miyazaki_Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miyazaki Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsunami_warning_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tsunami warning system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinkansen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shinkansen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_power_plant", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear power plant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shikoku", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shikoku"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_level", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sea level"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_broadcasting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Radio broadcasting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concrete", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Concrete"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevator", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elevator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ABC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirishima,_Kagoshima", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kirishima, Kagoshima"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kirishima, Kagoshima"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K\u014dchi_Prefecture", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "K\u014dchi Prefecture"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "K\u014dchi Prefecture"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Travelogues", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Travelogues", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial_Disputes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial Disputes", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Natural_Disasters_and_Hazards", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Natural Disasters and Hazards", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Major_Companies/Company_Information", "label": "dmoz/Business/Major Companies/Company Information", "wgt": 10}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/_hOc4X89dnuO6cJD_ePZjw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/us.abcnews.gma.com/a15fe69fdc65bb30c2ad37dc3dc1b76f", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9800494", "eventUri": "eng-9800494", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

Yoshimasa Hayashi said \"damage to people and property\" was still being assessed.\n\n\"In view of this situation, the prime minister instructed (officials) to provide the public with timely and accurate information on tsunamis and evacuations,\" he said.\n\nUnverified footage shared on social media showed only minor damage, including dishes and books that had fallen off shelves and a small wall that had collapsed in a car park.\n\nThe Japanese government set up a special task force in response to the quakes, according to a statement.\n\nSitting on top of four major tectonic plates along the western edge of the Pacific \"Ring of Fire\", Japan is one of the world's most tectonically active countries.\n\nThe archipelago, home to around 125 million people, experiences around 1,500 jolts every year and accounts for around 18 percent of the world's earthquakes.\n\nThe vast majority are mild, although the damage they cause varies according to their location and the depth below the Earth's surface at which they strike.\n\nStill, even large quakes usually cause little damage thanks to special construction techniques and strict building regulations in the world's number four economy.\n\nAt least 318 people were killed when an earthquake hit the Noto peninsula on the Sea of Japan side of the main island of Honshu on New Year's Day.\n\nThe January 1 quake and its aftershocks toppled buildings, caused fires and knocked out infrastructure.\n\nJapan also routinely holds emergency drills to prepare for a major quake.\n\nIt is haunted by the memory of a colossal 9.0-magnitude undersea quake off northeastern Japan in March 2011, which triggered a tsunami that left around 18,500 people dead or missing.\n\nIt sent three reactors into meltdown at the Fukushima nuclear plant, causing Japan's worst post-war disaster and the most serious nuclear accident since Chernobyl.\n\nIn March 2022, a 7.4-magnitude quake off the coast of Fukushima shook large areas of eastern Japan, killing three people.\n\nThe capital Tokyo was devastated by a huge earthquake a century ago in 1923.", "source": {"uri": "terradaily.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Terra Daily"},

first quake hit at 4:42 pm (0742 GMT) at a depth of 33 kilometres, about 29 kilometres southeast of Miyazaki on Kyushu.\n\nThe second struck less than a minute later at a depth of 26 metres and was 20 kilometres northeast of Miyazaki.\n\nThe Japanese government set up a special task force in response to the quakes, according to a statement.\n\nSitting on top of four major tectonic plates along the western edge of the Pacific \"Ring of Fire\", Japan is one of the world's most tectonically active countries.\n\nThe archipelago, home to around 125 million people, experiences around 1,500 jolts every year and accounts for around 18 percent of the world's earthquakes.\n\nThe vast majority are mild, although the damage they cause varies according to their location and the depth below the Earth's surface at which they strike.\n\nStill, even large quakes usually cause little damage thanks to special construction techniques and strict building regulations in the world's number four economy.\n\nOn New Year's Day, at least 260 people died after a massive earthquake hit the peninsula, including 30 \"quake-linked\" deaths as well as those killed directly in the disaster.\n\nThe January 1 quake and its aftershocks toppled buildings, caused fires and knocked out infrastructure at a time when families were celebrating the new year.\n\nJapan has strict construction regulations intended to ensure buildings can withstand strong earthquakes, and routinely holds emergency drills to prepare for a major jolt.\n\nBut the country is haunted by the memory of a massive 9.0-magnitude undersea quake off northeastern Japan in March 2011, which triggered a tsunami that left around 18,500 people dead or missing.\n\nThe 2011 tsunami also sent three reactors into meltdown at the Fukushima nuclear plant, causing Japan's worst post-war disaster and the most serious nuclear accident since Chernobyl.\n\nIn March 2022, a 7.4-magnitude quake off the coast of Fukushima shook large areas of eastern Japan, killing three people.\n\nThe capital Tokyo was devastated by a huge earthquake a century ago in 1923.", "source": {"uri": "terradaily.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Terra

According to the United States Geological Survey (USGS), the initial quake struck at 4:42 pm local time (0742 GMT), approximately 29 kilometers southeast of Miyazaki on Kyushu, at a depth of 33 kilometers. Less than a minute later, a second quake hit 20 kilometers northeast of Miyazaki at a depth of 26 kilometers.\n\nIn the aftermath, the Japan Meteorological Agency issued warnings for tsunamis reaching up to one meter, affecting coastal areas in Kyushu and Shikoku islands. The agency cautioned residents against approaching the coast and advised them to stay out of the sea until the alert is lifted.\n\nAs of now, there have been no reports of significant damage from these quakes.

The country's rigorous construction standards and preparedness drills generally help minimize damage from such events.\n\nHowever, Japan's seismic history includes notable disasters. On New Year's Day this year, a massive earthquake led to at least 260 deaths, with additional fatalities linked to the quake. The destruction from this quake included toppled buildings, fires, and infrastructure damage, coinciding with the New Year celebrations.\n\nThe memory of Japan's worst post-war disaster, the March 2011 magnitude-9.0 earthquake and subsequent tsunami, continues to loom large. This catastrophe resulted in approximately 18,500 deaths or missing persons and caused the Fukushima nuclear plant meltdown. More recently, a 7.4-magnitude quake off Fukushima's coast in March 2022 resulted in three deaths and reminded the nation of its vulnerability to such natural disasters.\n\nJapan's capital, Tokyo, also remembers the devastation of the 1923 Great Kanto Earthquake, which marked a significant event in its seismic history.

The archipelago, home to around 125 million people, experiences around 1,500 jolts every year and accounts for around 18 per cent of the world's earthquakes.\n\nThe vast majority are mild, although the damage they cause varies according to their location and the depth below the Earth's surface at which they strike.\n\nStill, even large quakes usually cause little damage thanks to special construction techniques and strict building regulations in the world's number four economy.\n\nOn New Year's Day, at least 260 people died after a massive earthquake hit the peninsula, including 30 \"quake-linked\" deaths as well as those killed directly in the disaster.\n\nThe January 1 quake and its aftershocks toppled buildings, caused fires, and knocked out infrastructure at a time when families were celebrating the new year.\n\nJapan has strict construction regulations intended to ensure buildings can withstand strong earthquakes and routinely holds emergency drills to prepare for a major jolt.\n\nBut the country is haunted by the memory of a massive 9.0-magnitude undersea quake off northeastern Japan in March 2011, which triggered a tsunami that left around 18,500 people dead or missing.\n\nThe 2011 tsunami also sent three reactors into meltdown at the Fukushima nuclear plant, causing Japan's worst post-war disaster and the most serious nuclear accident since Chernobyl.\n\nIn March 2022, a 7.4-magnitude quake off the coast of Fukushima shook large areas of eastern Japan, killing three people.\n\nThe capital Tokyo was devastated by a huge earthquake a century ago in 1923.",

As of last year, researchers said there was a 60 percent chance that an earthquake of magnitude 8 to 9 -- even more devastating than the one in 2011 that laid waste to the country's northeast coast and knocked out cooling systems at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant -- would occur in the trough area over the next 20 years.\n\nAfter the 7.1-magnitude quake on Thursday, Japan's meteorological agency convened a group of experts to evaluate whether it could be related to the long-anticipated bigger disaster, called a \"Nankai Trough megathrust earthquake.\"\n\nExperts warn that an earthquake between two tectonic plates that converge along the Nankai megathrust fault, which runs from Kyushu north through Tokyo, could cause devastation. It could extensively damage cities throughout Japan, potentially cause a tsunami and lead to hundreds of thousands of deaths.\n\n\"The possibility of a large-scale earthquake occurring in the area of the Nankai Trough is relatively higher than usual,\" the meteorological agency said in a statement late Thursday.\n\nThe risk that an earthquake of magnitude of 8 or higher would occur after one with a magnitude of 7 is particularly elevated for about a week after the initial temblor, the agency said.\n\nJapan's meteorological agency issued a \"caution\" level of warning on Thursday. The next step up would be an \"alert,\" which would advise residents to evacuate from areas deemed a tsunami risk. The agency said it was the first time Japan had issued a \"caution.\"\n\nPrime Minister Fumio Kishida urged people to ensure that they were ready at all times in case an earthquake occurred and they had to evacuate. He told reporters that the government was on high alert.\n\nEarlier on Thursday, a tsunami advisory was issued for coastal regions on the southern Japanese islands of Kyushu and Shikoku after the 7.1-magnitude quake. As of late Thursday evening, the maximum height of waves recorded reached about a foot and a half off the coast of Miyazaki Prefecture on Kyushu.\n\nA handful of injuries but no deaths were reported related to the earthquake. Footage showed images of strong shaking in buildings in Miyazaki Prefecture, but damage in the area appeared to be minimal.

The quake hit at a depth of 30 kilometers (18.6 miles), the agency said.\n\nChief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi said at a news conference that there have been no reports of abnormalities at nuclear power plants after the quake and that the government is assessing for casualties and damage. Japan Rail suspended bullet train services as a precaution, state broadcaster NHK reported. No casualties or major damage were immediately reported after the quake.\n\nThe JMA also issued its first public warning for a \"Nankai Trough megaquake\" after an investigation into the Thursday quake's links to the submarine trough. The agency said the chance of a major earthquake there that could trigger powerful tsunamis is \"relatively higher than usual for the next week.\"\n\nEarthquakes typically occur in the Nankai Trough every 100-150 years, according to the JMA. The most recent was in December 1946, when a quake of around magnitude-8.1 killed more than 1,300 people. The U.S. Geological Survey called it \"one of the world's deadliest earthquakes,\" with more than 36,000 houses destroyed or severely damaged and another 2,100 homes washed away by a tsunami that reached heights of 5 to 6 meters (16 to 20 feet).\n\nIn January, Japan's Earthquake Research Committee predicted a 70 to 80 percent chance of an earthquake between magnitude-8.0 and -9.0 striking near the Nankai Trough within the next three decades.\n\nWhile Japan is familiar with earthquakes - the country sits on the Pacific Ring of Fire - large tremors on the coast cause particular alarm because of their propensity to cause tsunamis. Japan experiences about 1,500 earthquakes annually that can be felt by people, with some kind of seismic activity recorded once every five minutes.\n\nMemories of the magnitude-9 earthquake that struck the Tohoku region on the east coast in 2011, causing a devastating tsunami that claimed almost 20,000 lives, remain raw in Japan. The quake and tsunami also caused the meltdown of three reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant.", "source": {"uri": "adn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Anchorage Daily News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan_Meteorological_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Japan Meteorological Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthquake", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Earthquake"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsunami", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tsunami"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoshimasa_Hayashi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yoshimasa Hayashi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nankai_Trough", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nankai Trough"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsunami_warning_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tsunami warning system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Cabinet_Secretary", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief Cabinet Secretary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyushu", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kyushu"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miyazaki_Prefecture", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miyazaki Prefecture"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miyazaki Prefecture"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinkansen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shinkansen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NHK", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NHK"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richter_magnitude_scale", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Richter magnitude scale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_power_plant", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear power plant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fukushima_nuclear_disaster", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fukushima nuclear disaster"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_of_Fire", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ring of Fire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T\u014dhoku_region", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "T\u014dhoku region"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_meltdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear meltdown"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Natural_Disasters_and_Hazards", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Natural Disasters and Hazards", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Future/Catastrophes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Future/Catastrophes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Nuclear_Pharmacy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Nuclear Pharmacy", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.adn.com/resizer//4SgCERbTy3TZOwLi7l-EdMaEq_U=/1200x630/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/adn/RH6RROLAYZF2LOMQY62QEFZ2CM.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9800494", "eventUri": "eng-9800494", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

Japan's public television NHK said there were reports of broken windows at Mizayaki Airport near the epicenter of the earthquake.\n\nThe Prime Minister's Office of Japan has issued an advisory regarding the earthquake. Officials have been instructed to give correct information to the people about the earthquake and tsunami.\n\nAlong with this, orders have also been given to take stock of the damage caused by the earthquake. Let us tell you that earlier on January 1, more than 240 people were killed in an earthquake in Noto, the northern central region of Japan.\n\nAfter the earthquake, the Japanese government immediately started rescue and relief operations. Army and police personnel have been sent to the spot. No major damage has been reported so far, but officials have appealed to be vigilant.\n\nJapan is a country that has been constantly battling natural disasters.

"Tsunamis of up to 1m were initially expected to arrive or had arrived in some coastal areas in Kyushu and Shikoku islands, broadcaster NHK reported.\n\nSitting on top of four major tectonic plates along the western edge of the Pacific \"Ring of Fire\", Japan is one of the world's most tectonically active countries.\n\nThe archipelago, home to around 125 million people, experiences around 1,500 jolts every year and accounts for around 18 per cent of the world's earthquakes.\n\nThe vast majority are mild, although the damage they cause varies according to their location and the depth below the Earth's surface at which they strike.\n\nStill, even large quakes usually cause little damage thanks to special construction techniques and strict building regulations in the world's number four economy.\n\nOn New Year's Day, at least 318 people died after an earthquake hit the Noto peninsula on the Sea of Japan side of the main island of Honshu.\n\nThe Jan 1 quake and its aftershocks toppled buildings, caused fires and knocked out infrastructure at a time when families were celebrating the new year.\n\nJapan has strict construction regulations intended to ensure buildings can withstand strong earthquakes, and routinely holds emergency drills to prepare for a major jolt.\n\nBut the country is haunted by the memory of a colossal 9.0-magnitude undersea quake off northeastern Japan in March 2011 which triggered a tsunami that left around 18,500 people dead or missing.\n\nThe 2011 tsunami also sent three reactors into meltdown at the Fukushima nuclear plant, causing Japan's worst post-war disaster and the most serious nuclear accident since Chernobyl.\n\nIn March 2022, a 7.4-magnitude quake off the coast of Fukushima shook large areas of eastern Japan, killing three people.\n\nThe capital Tokyo was devastated by a huge earthquake a century ago in 1923.", "source": {"uri": "channelnewsasia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNA"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

The potential travel advisory and tsunami risks highlight the need for caution and preparedness. Ensure your safety by staying informed and planning your travel accordingly.A travel advisory can be issued following a tsunami warning after powerful twin earthquakes struck Japan on Thursday, August 8. The United States Geological Survey (USGC) reported that a 6.9 magnitude quake was followed by a 7.1 magnitude tremor, causing significant concern for coastal regions.\n\nThe earthquakes can trigger tsunami advisories for several areas in the southwestern Japanese islands of Kyushu and Shikoku. According to public broadcaster, waves up to one meter may impact coastal areas, urging travelers to be cautious. The Japan Meteorological Agency has strongly advised the public not to enter the sea or approach the coast until the warning is lifted.\n\nThe first earthquake struck at a depth of 33 kilometers at approximately 4:42 pm local time (0742 GMT), followed by a second nearby tremor at a depth of 25 kilometers. Authorities have warned that tsunamis may strike repeatedly, making it crucial for residents and travelers to remain vigilant.\n\nAlthough there were no immediate reports of major damage, authorities are on high alert and closely monitoring the situation. Early reports indicated that 20-centimeter high waves had already been observed in the Miyazaki prefecture. In response, the Japanese government has constituted a special task force to address the aftermath of the quakes.\n\nJapan, situated on four major tectonic plates -- the Pacific plate, the North American plate, the Philippine plate, and the Eurasian plate -- is particularly prone to earthquakes. The interaction of these tectonic plates makes the region highly complex and earthquake-prone. With a population of around 125 million, Japan experiences approximately 1,500 jolts annually, accounting for about 18 percent of the world's earthquakes.\n\nGiven the current situation, travelers planning to visit Japan are advised to stay updated on the latest developments. The tsunami warning and potential travel disruptions necessitate checking with local authorities and travel agencies before finalizing any plans. Safety measures and emergency protocols should be prioritized to ensure personal safety.\n\nTravelers already in Japan should adhere to the following safety guidelines:\n\nThe recent twin earthquakes serve as a reminder of the importance of earthquake and tsunami preparedness in regions like Japan. Travelers should remain cautious and take necessary precautions to ensure their safety during their visit.\n\nAs the situation develops, it is crucial to stay informed and make well-considered decisions regarding travel plans. The safety and well-being of travelers and residents alike depend on adherence to advisories and proactive measures in the face of natural disasters.

Residents in these areas have been urged to stay alert and move to higher ground if necessary.\n\nMost influential cities in the worldFacebookTwitterPintrest\n\nA tsunami advisory has been issued for several coastal regions, including Miyazaki, Oita, Kagoshima, Kochi, and Ehime prefectures. Authorities are urging residents and visitors in these areas to get out of the water and evacuate coastal regions immediately.\n\nAs per reports, in response to the seismic event, the Japanese government quickly established a special task force to monitor the situation and coordinate emergency responses. Although there were no immediate reports of major damage, authorities remain vigilant as they assess the impact of the earthquake and the potential for further aftershocks. As of now, the situation remains under close observation. The government and meteorological agencies are continuously updating the public with safety information and warnings.

The country experiences around 1,500 earthquakes each year, with the majority being mild. However, the damage caused by these tremors varies depending on their location and depth.\n\nThe Pacific Ring of Fire is home to multiple tectonic plates, including the Pacific Plate, Eurasian Plate, and Indo-Australian Plate. These plates continuously mesh and collide, making Japan particularly vulnerable to seismic events. The country's strict building codes and disaster preparedness measures have been designed to minimise the impact of such natural disasters.\n\nAs of now, the nation braces itself for potential aftershocks and continues to monitor the tsunami's impact.\n\nAlso read: Sweden's sunken treasure: 19-th century champagne found, but authorities won't let anyone sip\n\nFacebookTwitterLinkedinEmail",

The United States Geological Survey (USGS) reported that a 6.9-magnitude quake hit first, followed shortly by a 7.1-magnitude tremor, prompting immediate tsunami warnings for coastal areas.\n\nNHK, Japan's national broadcaster, reported that tsunamis up to one meter either had hit or were expected to hit parts of the Kyushu and Shikoku islands. Fortunately, authorities have reported no immediate damage following these seismic events.\n\nThe USGS detailed that the initial earthquake occurred at 4:42 PM local time (0742 GMT) at a depth of 33 kilometers, approximately 29 kilometers southeast of Miyazaki on Kyushu. Less than a minute later, the subsequent quake struck at a depth of 26 kilometers, located 20 kilometers northeast of Miyazaki.\n\nIn response to the earthquakes, the Japanese government quickly established a special task force to monitor and manage the situation. This rapid action underscores Japan's preparedness for such natural disasters, given its geographic location and seismic activity.\n\nJapan Airlines (JAL) and All Nippon Airways (ANA) confirmed that the earthquakes have not affected their flight operations. Both carriers assured passengers that all flights are operating as scheduled, and there have been no disruptions to services.\n\nSituated on the convergent boundaries of four major tectonic plates, Japan is part of the Pacific \"Ring of Fire,\" making it one of the most seismically active regions on the planet. With a population of about 125 million, the country experiences around 1,500 significant earthquakes annually, accounting for roughly 18 percent of the world's total seismic activity.\n\nWhile most of these earthquakes are relatively mild, their impact can vary greatly depending on their depth and proximity to populated areas.

The initial tremor registered a magnitude of 6.9, swiftly followed by a more potent 7.1-magnitude quake, as reported by the United States Geological Survey (USGS). These quakes occurred at depths of 33 kilometers and 25 kilometers, respectively, indicating their potential to cause considerable disruption.\n\nThe epicenter was located in the Hyuganada Sea, near the city of Miyazaki on Kyushu island. In response, the Japanese government promptly established a special task force to address the situation. Tsunami warnings were issued for coastal regions, predicting waves up to one meter. Although these advisories were later lifted for most areas, residents were urged to remain cautious, avoiding coastal and river areas due to the risk of further seismic activity.\n\nRead More: 92 News Shuts Down in UK After Defamation Case by Maryam Nawaz\n\nDespite the intensity of the tremors, reports indicated minimal casualties and damage. A few individuals sustained non-life-threatening injuries, and one house in Kagoshima collapsed without causing harm. Miyazaki Airport experienced delays, and bullet train services were temporarily halted, although they quickly resumed, showcasing Japan's robust infrastructure and disaster response capabilities.\n\nJapan's location atop four major tectonic plates makes it one of the most seismically active countries globally. Annually, the archipelago experiences approximately 1,500 earthquakes, accounting for 18% of the world's seismic activity. This geologic reality has necessitated stringent building regulations and advanced construction techniques, ensuring that even significant quakes cause minimal damage.\n\nThe nation's preparedness was evident as the quakes struck. With past experiences, including the devastating 1995 Kobe earthquake and the 2011 Tohoku disaster, Japan has continually refined its emergency response strategies. The swift establishment of a government task force and the timely issuance of tsunami warnings exemplify the effectiveness of these measures. Moreover, the populace's familiarity with earthquake protocols, such as evacuation procedures and emergency drills, significantly mitigates potential harm.\n\nIn the wake of these recent quakes, the Meteorological Agency issued a unique alert concerning the Nankai Trough, highlighting an increased likelihood of seismic activity in this notorious region. This proactive approach underscores Japan's commitment to leveraging scientific insights to safeguard its citizens.\n\nThe people of southwestern Japan, particularly those in Kyushu and Shikoku, demonstrated remarkable resilience in the face of Thursday's earthquakes. Video footage from local residents, such as radio station employee Ryosuke Take in Kirishima, captured the intense shaking that caused household items to tumble and disrupted services in nearby hotels. Yet, thanks to Japan's rigorous building standards, there were no reports of significant structural damage or casualties in these regions.\n\nIn Kochi prefecture, residents were ordered to evacuate as a precaution, although drastic sea level changes were not observed. This measured response illustrates the community's readiness to act swiftly and the authorities' diligence in ensuring public safety.\n\nInfrastructure, particularly regional nuclear plants, reported no abnormalities, reinforcing the robustness of Japan's safety measures. While Miyazaki Airport and local transport services experienced temporary disruptions, the rapid resumption of operations highlighted the efficiency of emergency response teams.\n\nDespite the formidable magnitude of the earthquakes, Japan's comprehensive preparedness and resilient infrastructure prevented a potentially catastrophic outcome. The country's ability to withstand such natural disasters with minimal impact continues to be a testament to its advanced planning and resilient spirit.", "source": {"uri": "globalvillagespace.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Global Village Space"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthquake", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Earthquake"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsunami_warning_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tsunami warning system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Geological_Survey", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Geological Survey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epicenter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Epicenter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Government of Japan"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richter_magnitude_scale", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Richter magnitude scale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyushu", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kyushu"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miyazaki_Prefecture", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miyazaki Prefecture"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miyazaki Prefecture"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miyazaki_Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miyazaki Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Hanshin_earthquake", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Great Hanshin earthquake"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T\u014dhoku_region", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "T\u014dhoku region"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disaster_response", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Disaster response"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinkansen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shinkansen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Building_code", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Building code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_tectonics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Plate tectonics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archipelago", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Archipelago"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kagoshima", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kagoshima"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kagoshima"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_level_rise", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sea level rise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nankai_Trough", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nankai Trough"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_disaster", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Natural disaster"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_power_plant", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear power plant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirishima,_Kagoshima", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kirishima, Kagoshima"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kirishima, Kagoshima"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K\u014dchi_Prefecture", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "K\u014dchi Prefecture"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "K\u014dchi Prefecture"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shikoku", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shikoku"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Natural_Disasters_and_Hazards", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Natural Disasters and Hazards", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Disaster_Relief_and_Recovery", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Disaster Relief and Recovery", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Future/Catastrophes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Future/Catastrophes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Environment", "label": "news/Environment", "wgt": 72}], "image": "https://www.globalvillagespace.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/earthquake.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9800494", "eventUri": "eng-9800494", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "wgt": 127, "relevance": 1}

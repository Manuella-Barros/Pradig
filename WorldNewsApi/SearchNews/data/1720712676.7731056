{"id": 232085780, "title": "Biggest Adjustments Mavs, Celtics Must Make In NBA Finals", "text": "Luka Don\u010di\u0107 took 26 shots in Game 1, which was tied for his playoff high (somehow, he's now gotten 26 exactly six times). He also had his highest usage percentage of the postseason on Thursday. And yet, it still felt like Dallas could've leaned even harder on him. Luka only got five free-throw attempts and seven assist opportunities in Game 1. His averages for the postseason in those two columns are 7.2 and 14.6. But the Mavs need more creative ways to get Don\u010di\u0107 back to his normal levels. He's one of the best isolation and pick-and-roll creators and scorers the NBA has ever seen. He'll get solid numbers with a steady diet of those play types against just about anyone. So, this isn't a plea for Dallas to throw that out entirely. Heliocentrism will always be a part of Luka's game, but it wouldn't hurt to get his creation going from some different starting points. An occasional post-up might not hurt. Boston might live with his one-on-one opportunities there, but Luka is among the league's biggest and strongest guards and one of its best finishers, regardless of position. A couple buckets inside could cause some defensive collapses, which would give his teammates a little more room on kicks to the outside. The more realistic path to less conventional creation might be simply putting the ball in Kyrie Irving's hands (again, occasionally). Let him break down the first line of defense, get to the paint, force help and kick out to Luka. From there, Don\u010di\u0107 could have opportunities to attack closeouts or rotating defenders. If all that gets him is an extra half step on those possessions, it'd be worth it. Luka and the Mavs made it too easy for Jaylen Brown to just defend him straight up (he spent a team-high 33-plus possessions guarding Don\u010di\u0107). They need to get the ball and players moving more. Make the Celtics defense move and rotate side to side. And force at least a few switches or scrambles that Luka can go after.", "summary": "Biggest Adjustments Mavs, Celtics Must Make In NBA Finals", "url": "https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10124018-biggest-adjustments-mavs-celtics-must-make-in-nba-finals", "image": "https://media.bleacherreport.com/image/upload/x_460,y_116,w_1339,h_893,c_crop/v1717815012/gga0wts4q2x6y9one8jh.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 16:23:44", "author": "Andy Bailey", "authors": ["Andy Bailey"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.02}

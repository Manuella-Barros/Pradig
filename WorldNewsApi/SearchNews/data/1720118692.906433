{"id": 227494526, "title": "Greece HC: Giannis to Play in Olympic Qualifiers; Injured Star Missed Bucks' Playoffs", "text": "Milwaukee Bucks superstar Giannis Antetokounmpo will represent Greece in the 2024 Summer Olympics qualifiers. National team coach Spanoulis said Saturday, per BasketNews, that Antetokounmpo is expected to suit up for the FIBA Men's Olympic Qualifying Tournament. Greece is drawn against Egypt and the Dominican Republic in its group and will be in action July 3 and 4. Antetokounmpo, 29, has won two NBA MVP awards and made five All-NBA First Teams during his assured Hall of Fame career. He's also made eight All-Star Games and won the NBA Finals MVP after leading the Bucks to the 2020-21 championship. Last season, Antetokounmpo averaged 30.4 points, 11.5 rebounds and 6.5 assists per game. Unfortunately, the Bucks' season did not go as planned, with the preseason NBA championship hopefuls. slogging through a 49-win season before falling to the Indiana Pacers in the first round. Antetokounmpo missed that entire series with a left calf strain previously suffered during his team's 104-91 win over the Boston Celtics on April 9. He told reporters at his exit interview with reporters that he \"wasn't even close\" to returning. \"I did all the tests, these like protocols you have to follow and have to check the boxes...I wasn't even close,\" Antetokounmpo said. That naturally raised questions about his status for the Summer Games. Even if he was on track to be healthy in time for the qualifiers, he could've chosen to rest up and focus on the 2024-25 NBA season. Instead, it appears Antetokounmpo is relishing the opportunity to punch Greece's ticket to the Olympics and perhaps earn its first medal.", "summary": "Milwaukee Bucks superstar Giannis Antetokounmpo will represent Greece in the 2024 Summer Olympics qualifiers.

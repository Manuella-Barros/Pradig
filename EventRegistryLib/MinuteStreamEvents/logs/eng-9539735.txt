One year later, the Knicks have again advanced to the second round, and sure enough, waiting for them there is another of their 1990s rivals. This time, it's the Indiana Pacers.\n\nThe Knicks and the Pacers played six times in the playoffs between 1993 and 2000. They split those legendary series three apiece. The Knicks overcame the Pacers to become the first No. 8 seed ever to reach the NBA Finals in 1999 thanks to Larry Johnson's infamous Game 3 four-point play. Four years earlier, the Pacers stunned the Knicks in Game 1 of their 1995 series behind eight Reggie Miller points in a critical nine-second stretch at the end of the battle. The two rivals met up again in 2012, and now, they're gearing up for series No. 8.\n\nThe names are different this time around. Instead of Miller and Patrick Ewing, it's Jalen Brunson and Tyrese Haliburton. The stakes, however, are just as high. The winner will advance to the Eastern Conference Finals, and their series begins on Monday. Here's everything you need to know as the Knicks and Pacers renew their rivalry.\n\nKnicks vs. Pacers schedule, scores\n\nAll times Eastern | * If necessary\n\nGame 1: Monday, May 6 -- Pacers at Knicks, 7:30 p.m., TNTGame 2: Wednesday, May 8 -- Pacers at Knicks, 8:00 p.m., TNTGame 3: Friday, May 10 -- Knicks at Pacers, 7:00 p.m., ESPN/fuboGame 4: Sunday, May 12 -- Knicks at Pacers, 3:30 p.m., ABC/fuboGame 5*: Tuesday, May 14 -- Pacers at KnicksGame 6*: Friday, May 17 -- Knicks at PacersGame 7*: Sunday, May 19 -- Pacers at KnicksKnicks vs. Pacers, Game 1Where to watch\n\nTime: 7:30 p.m. ET | Date: Monday, May 6\n\nLocation: Madison Square Garden -- New York City\n\nTV channel: TNT | Streaming: Watch TNT, Max\n\nStorylines\n\nJust how high can Jalen Brunson fly? In 17 playoff games as a Knick, he's averaging over 30.5 points per game. Only two players in NBA history have averaged more than that for their playoff careers: former teammate Luka Doncic and Michael Jordan. Brunson couldn't have asked for a better matchup on paper. Indiana's No. 24-ranked defense has no guard stoppers and strategically allows penetration to prevent opponents from taking 3's. Brunson will have a far easier time navigating inside of the arc than he did against Philadelphia, and after what he just did to the 76ers, that prospect should terrify Indiana.\n\nTyrese Haliburton was so good early in the season that he not only garnered MVP buzz, but even managed to beat out Brunson for a Team USA roster spot. Well, the second half of his season was a struggle due to a hamstring injury, and he averaged a relatively uninspiring 16 points on 44/30/86 shooting splits in the first round against the Bucks. Brunson is going to attack Haliburton, both out of spite over the Team USA decision and because it's a strategically sound decision. Haliburton has to be able to attack him back if the Pacers are going to compete in this series. Will the Pacers have the superstar version of him, or merely the decent one that played against Milwaukee?\n\nPrediction\n\nOpening series odds: Knicks -265, Pacers +210\n\nThe last time these Pacers played on the road, they got punched in the mouth by a more experienced Bucks team that was playing without Damian Lillard and Giannis Antetokounmpo. They were visibly shaken by an incredible Milwaukee crowd, and in total, they went 1-2 on the road in that series. Well, now they're about to face a healthier Knicks team with a far louder crowd. If the Pacers couldn't win on the road against the undermanned Bucks, it's hard to imagine them handling Madison Square Garden in Game 1.

I like the Pacers being able to keep this first game close and am picking them to cover +6 points on DraftKings (-110).\n\nAfter the Knicks won their first round games by an average of 4.5 points, I don't see any blowout wins coming from New York. The Pacers' first round wins came by an average of 13.8 points, but neither of their losses were close (15 and 23 points).\n\nSeeing Jalen Brunson and Tyrese Haliburton duel will be a treat. Brunson had a legendary first round series with an average of 35.5 points and nine assists. Halburton averaged just 16 points but 9.3 assists per game. Both players struggled shooting from the field.\n\nDefense is the area separating these teams most. The Knicks allowed the fourth least points per game this year while the Pacers allowed the fourth most. New York surrendered 108.2 points per game in round one while Indiana allowed 110.2.\n\nMy biggest question for the Knicks is whether Josh Hart, OG Anunoby, and Donte DiVincenzo can keep up their scoring. Hart was sensational throughout round one in multiple ways, while Anunoby and DiVincenzo had brilliant moments as well.\n\nHaliburton being Indiana's third leading scorer in round one gives me some confidence in the Pacers. Pascal Siakam and Myles Turner don't need to average more points than Halburton, but them playing well while Haliburton bounces back hypothetically would help a lot.\n\nIsaiah Hartenstein and Mitchell Robinson were outstanding for the Knicks in round one on the offensive glass. Siakam and Turner will pose a tough challenge, but second chance points could very well be the decider in Game 1 and the series as a whole.\n\n\" READ MORE: Celtics are worth the bet as the chalk to win the Eastern Conference in the 2024 NBA playoffs\n\nThe Knicks averaged 14.5 offensive rebounds in round one while the Pacers averaged 10.3. I think Indiana keeping pace with New York in that department and hanging tighter in the rebounding battle could play a big role in keeping this game close.\n\nI think the Pacers liking a faster pace will also throw New York off guard. The Knicks play at the slowest pace in the league while the Pacers play at the second fastest. The 76ers played slower than the Bucks, so Indiana won't have to adjust like New York will.\n\nWhile Brunson will most likely play outstanding, I'm interested to see how fresh he and the Knicks are.

But while the matchup may be old school, Jalen Brunson and the Knicks are bracing for an opponent who plays a new-age style.\n\nTyrese Haliburton runs the NBA's highest-scoring offense, with Indiana putting numbers on the scoreboard that make the ones in the past Knicks-Pacers contests look like a different sport, not just a different century.\n\n\"I guess whenever you have the original teams from back then, there's always going to be some type of history,\" Brunson said. \"But you have two good teams who play very, I don't want to say different, but like, they play their own style of basketball. And so it's going to be a grind of who's going to go out there, who's going to want it more who's going to try to go get it.\"\n\nBrunson led the No. 2-seeded Knicks past Philadelphia in the first round, sending the Knicks into the East semifinals in consecutive seasons for the first time since making nine straight trips between 1992 and 2000.\n\nHe scored 40 or more points in the final three games, just the seventh player in NBA history with three straight 40-point games in the playoffs. The league's No. 4 scorer in the regular season tops all players in the postseason with 35.5 per game.\n\nIndiana's big numbers come as a team. The Pacers led the league with 123.3 points per game, sixth highest in league history, and also were tops in field goal percentage and assists. They reached 140 points 11 times, an NBA record.\n\nThe sixth-seeded Pacers haven't slowed down too much in the playoffs. They averaged 113 while knocking off No. 3 Milwaukee and reached at least 120 in all four victories during the six-game series.\n\nThe Knicks and Pacers met three straight times from 1993-95 -- exchanging Game 7 victories in the latter two -- then again from 1998-2000, with the last two of those in the Eastern Conference finals. Indiana won the most recent meeting, ousting the No. 2-seeded Knicks in the 2013 East semifinals.\n\nNeither team ever reached 120 points in any of the 41 games.\n\n\"It's just a very intense matchup, that's really the simple truth about it,\" Pacers coach Rick Carlisle said. \"There's a lot of stuff with Reggie Miller for five or six years and I know in 2013 there was another matchup. We're going to have to be very resilient and we're going to have to be very together.\"\n\nTHIS SEASON\n\nIndiana went 2-1 against New York and was right at its season average with 123.3 points per game, including 140 in a Dec. 30 victory when the Knicks were short-handed after a trade. Brunson averaged 35.7 points.\n\nBRUNSON VS. HALIBURTON\n\nThe point guards were U.S. teammates last summer playing in the Basketball World Cup, then went on to have their best NBA seasons. Both were All-Stars, with Haliburton the Eastern Conference starter in his home arena en route to leading the league with 10.9 assists per game.\n\nEX-RAPTOR VS. EX-RAPTOR\n\nPascal Siakam and OG Anunoby were starters in Toronto to begin the season before the forwards were traded, with Anunoby going to the Knicks in December and Siakam to Indiana in January. The Knicks are 24-5 with Anunoby in the lineup and may need him now to defend his former teammate, who opened the playoffs with consecutive games of at least 35 points and 10 rebounds.\n\nBRUNSON VS. CARLISLE\n\nBrunson began his career in Dallas playing for Carlisle, who praised his former player's character and said they had a great three years together. Brunson was asked if he had extra motivation after an ESPN podcast referenced his frustration in getting only 10 minutes of playing time in a Game 7 loss to the Clippers in 2021.\n\n\"In all honesty, I said this last time, you're in the playoffs now, there is no extra motivation,\" Brunson said. \"It is what it is, the past is the past. Rick, he welcomed me into this league and he helped me become the player and he helped me grow from day one. So a coach has got to make decisions that suit their team. So whatever happened, happened and we're moving forward from there.\"\n\nOBI'S OPPORTUNTITY\n\nObi Toppin was the Knicks' first-round pick in 2020 and became a fan favorite, though rarely got extended playing time behind All-Star Julius Randle. He scored a career playoff-high 21 points off the bench in the clinching victory over Milwaukee and now heads back to his original NBA home.\n\n\"They're one of the most physical teams in the league,\" Toppin said. \"They've had that identity for many years and we've got to come in there and match that physicality and play our style of basketball, and I think we'll be good at that.\"", "source": {"uri": "syracuse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "syracuse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2020 NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Brunson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Points_per_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Points per game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison_Square_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Madison Square Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O.G._Anunoby", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "O.G.

Those were the days.\n\nTheir storied rivalry comes out of mothballs on Monday when the Pacers travel to Madison Square Garden to face the Knicks in Game 1 of their best-of-seven series in the second round of the NBA playoffs.\n\n\"It was inevitable that we play these guys,\" Pacers guard Tyrese Haliburton said. \"Those are some good friends of mine over there, but there's going to be a lot of competition, a lot of smoke. I'm sure they'll have a lot of their former guys coming to the games and I'm sure we'll have a lot of our former guys coming to the games. I just think it's going to be fun to add another part of that chapter.\"\n\nThe Knicks took care of the Philadelphia 76ers and Indiana dispatched the Milwaukee Bucks to advance to the second round where the Knicks own the home-court advantage due to their No. 2 seed in the Eastern Conference, while the Pacers earned the sixth seed. A packed Garden crowd is sure to offer a raucous start to the series where controlling the tempo of the game will be crucial.\n\nThe Pacers are a high-volume shooting team that likes to play fast and overwhelm their opponents with their athleticism. Indiana averaged 123 points a game during the regular season to lead the league and also ranked first in field goals made and attempted. Mr. Haliburton averaged 20.1 points per game during the season, while Pascal Siakam -- after coming over to the Pacers via a trade with Toronto -- averaged 21.3 in his 41 regular-season games.\n\nThe last thing the Knicks want is for the Pacers to be flying up and down the court.\n\n\"They play very fast,\" Knicks forward OG Anunoby said. \"They get the ball out quick. They get up a lot of threes. They just play really fast, the highest pace in the league. So it will be a challenge for us to get back on defense.\"\n\nThe Pacers won two of three teams' meetings during the regular season, but neither had the full roster available for this series. The Knicks will try to combat the Pacers' speed with a more half-court approach centered on their rebounding. If they can control the glass and shoot a decent percentage, they can control the tempo.\n\n\"Obviously, we want to play Knicks basketball,\" Knicks guard Jalen Brunson said. \"They're going to try to play Pacers basketball. It's going to be a grind. It's going to be a battle, and after the first game, we're going to have to adjust whether we win or lose. Adjusting is how you win these types of things.\"\n\nThe wildcard in the series could be Mr. Siakam. The 6-8 product of New Mexico State University averaged 22.3 points and 8.8 rebounds in the six games against Milwaukee, including a total of 73 points in Games 1 and 2. The two-time All-Star was acquired by the Pacers from Toronto on January 17, less than three weeks after the Knicks acquired Mr. Anunoby in a trade with Toronto.\n\n\"It will be weird playing against him,\" Mr. Anunoby admitted. \"I've never played against him. He's always been my teammate. He's made a big impact on their team. He's a great player. He plays both ends. He can score. He can rebound. He can pass. He can do everything.\"\n\nIt may have been nearly 30 years ago when the Knicks and Pacers were at their heated best. But one thing remains: both teams expect a physical game. The Knicks must impose their will to slow down the Pacers' offense. Among those who know what to expect is Pacers forward Obi Tobin, a former Knick.\n\n\"They're one of the most physical teams in the league,\" Mr. Tobin said. \"They've had that identity for many years. We just have to come in there and match that type of physicality and play our basketball.\"\n\nThe Pacers' coach, Rick Carlisle, a Knick on Rick Pitino's 1988 playoff team, and an assistant coach with Indiana during the rivalry years, has told his players what to expect in this series. \"It's a very intense matchup,\" he said. \"That's the simple truth about it. It's always great competition. It's an important time of the year when you get to the second round of the NBA playoffs. We're going to have to be very resilient and we're going to have to be very together.\"\n\nIt's no secret the Knicks will rely heavily on Mr. Brunson, who averaged 28.7 points a game during the regular season and 35.5 during the six-game playoff series with the Sixers.

What is the schedule for the series, how can you watch the games, and what can you expect?\n\nA lot of basketball fans didn't expect the New York Knicks or the Indiana Pacers to advance past the first round. They both had impressive series to open up the NBA playoffs, though, while also benefiting from their opponents having injury issues. Now, the two teams will play each other in the second round, and in this article, we will explain how you can watch their series.\n\nWhere is the Knicks vs. Pacers series?\n\nThe Knicks are the two-seed in the Eastern Conference, which means they will have home-court advantage in the second round. They will host Games 1, 2, 5, and 7 at Madison Square Garden in New York City, New York. The Pacers play their home games at Gainbridge Fieldhouse in Indianapolis, Indiana, and they will host Games 3, 4, and 6. Excluding games on TNT, you can watch the NBA playoffs on fuboTV.\n\nThe Knicks and Pacers play two very different styles, but both teams are led by an All-Star point guard who really came onto the scene this season. For the Knicks, that is Jalen Brunson. The former Maverick had 11 40-point games this season and proved that he is a true franchise player.\n\nHe helped the Knicks to their best record in over a decade with the help of his college teammates. Former Villanova stars Donte DiVincenzo and Josh Hart have taken their games to new levels on the Knicks, and they perfectly fit Tom Thibodeau's style.\n\nDiVincenzo has become one of the best shooters in the NBA, and Hart has become one of the best-rebounding non-bigs in the league. Thibodeau embraces an old-school style of play, and his bench doesn't go very deep. In addition to the former Villanova stars, OG Anunoby plays elite defense, Isaiah Hartenstein has taken over as the team's starting center, Mitchell Robinson has thrived off the bench, and Miles McBride does the little things to help the team win.\n\nThey don't play a style of basketball that looks like it belongs in 2024, but it works. The team plays with great hustle and high-intensity defense, which wears down opponents and leads to wins. Julius Randle is hurt, so it would be very impressive if the team could advance to the Conference Finals without him, but it is hard to doubt the team right now with how they are playing.\n\nPacers storylines\n\nWhile it is a gritty style that has gotten New York to this point, it is a dynamic offense that makes Indiana elite. In fact, the Pacers' 123.3 points per game were the most in the league this year. Tyrese Haliburton is their star point guard. Like Brunson, he didn't start his career with the team he is now on. Haliburton was traded for from the Sacramento Kings, and he has thrived since being handed the keys to the Pacers' offense.\n\nHaliburton led the league in assists per game this season and has become arguably the best playmaker in the league. His running mate was also a trade acquisition. Pascal Siakam was added at the NBA trade deadline, and he has made a scary offense even scarier.\n\nThe team will need to step things up on defense if they want to beat the Knicks, though, especially when it comes to guarding Brunson. Luckily, Myles Turner is one of the best rim protectors in the NBA. Additionally, T.J. McConnell is an irritant and will be counted on to make life harder for the Knicks' point guard.\n\nIndiana can score with anybody, but playoff basketball is a different breed, and you need to be able to grind out wins. The Pacers proved they could do that with their first-round win over the Bucks, but Milwaukee was without Giannis Antetokounmpo and Damian Lillard for most of that series. The Knicks won their first-round series against a Philadelphia 76ers team led by Joel Embiid. The star big man was clearly not at full strength, though, so it will be interesting to see how these teams compete against healthier lineups.\n\nBrunson may have a little extra motivation this series, too, as his former Mavericks coach, Rick Carlisle, is now the coach of the Pacers. Carlisle famously benched Brunson in the 2021 NBA playoffs before he became the star he is today. So, who do you think will advance to the Eastern Conference Finals?", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bailey_bassett@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Bailey Bassett", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gainbridge_Fieldhouse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gainbridge Fieldhouse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TNT_(American_TV_network)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TNT (American TV network)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donte_DiVincenzo", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donte DiVincenzo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villanova_Wildcats_men's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Villanova Wildcats men's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison_Square_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Madison Square Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_advantage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Home advantage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Hart", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Josh Hart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaiah_Hartenstein", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Isaiah Hartenstein"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitchell_Robinson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mitchell Robinson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Brunson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Randle", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Julius Randle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2021 NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myles_Turner", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Myles Turner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._J._McConnell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "T.

But while the matchup may be old-school, Jalen Brunson and the Knicks are bracing for an opponent who plays a new-age style.\n\nTyrese Haliburton runs the NBA's highest-scoring offense, with Indiana putting numbers on the scoreboard that make the ones in the past Knicks-Pacers contests look like a different sport, not just a different century.\n\n\"I guess whenever you have the original teams from back then, there's always going to be some type of history,\" Brunson said. \"But you have two good teams who play very -- I don't want to say different -- but like, they play their own style of basketball. And so it's going to be a grind of who's going to go out there, who's going to want it more and who's going to try to go get it.\"\n\nBrunson led the No. 2-seeded Knicks past Philadelphia in the first round, sending the Knicks into the East semifinals in consecutive seasons for the first time since making nine straight trips between 1992 and 2000.\n\nHe scored 40 or more points in the final three games, just the seventh player in NBA history with three straight 40-point games in the playoffs. The league's No. 4 scorer in the regular season tops all players in the postseason with 35.5 per game.\n\nIndiana's big numbers come as a team. The Pacers led the league with 123.3 points per game, sixth highest in league history, and also were tops in field goal percentage and assists. They reached 140 points 11 times, an NBA record.\n\nThe sixth-seeded Pacers haven't slowed down too much in the playoffs. They averaged 113 while knocking off No. 3 Milwaukee and reached at least 120 in all four victories during the six-game series.\n\nThe Knicks and the Pacers met three straight times from 1993-95 -- exchanging Game 7 victories in the latter two -- then again from 1998-2000, with the last two of those in the Eastern Conference finals. Indiana won the most recent meeting, ousting the No. 2-seeded Knicks in the 2013 East semifinals.\n\nNeither team ever reached 120 points in any of the 41 games.\n\n\"It's just a very intense matchup; that's really the simple truth about it,\" Pacers coach Rick Carlisle said. \"There's a lot of stuff with Reggie Miller for five or six years and I know in 2013 there was another matchup. We're going to have to be very resilient and we're going to have to be very together.\"\n\nIndiana went 2-1 against New York and was right at its season average with 123.3 points per game, including 140 in a Dec. 30 victory when the Knicks were short-handed after a trade. Brunson averaged 35.7 points.\n\nThe point guards were U.S. teammates last summer playing in the Basketball World Cup, then went on to have their best NBA seasons. Both were All-Stars, with Haliburton the Eastern Conference starter in his home arena en route to leading the league with 10.9 assists per game.\n\nPascal Siakam and OG Anunoby were starters in Toronto to begin the season before the forwards were traded, with Anunoby going to the Knicks in December and Siakam to Indiana in January. The Knicks are 24-5 with Anunoby in the lineup and may need him now to defend his former teammate, who opened the playoffs with consecutive games of at least 35 points and 10 rebounds.\n\nBrunson began his career in Dallas playing for Carlisle, who praised his former player's character and said they had a great three years together. Brunson was asked if he had extra motivation after an ESPN podcast referenced his frustration in getting only 10 minutes of playing time in a Game 7 loss to the Clippers in 2021.\n\n\"In all honesty, I said this last time, you're in the playoffs now, there is no extra motivation,\" Brunson said. \"It is what it is; the past is the past. Rick welcomed me into this league and he helped me become the player and he helped me grow from Day 1. So a coach has got to make decisions that suit their team.

But while the matchup may be old school, Jalen Brunson and the Knicks are bracing for an opponent who plays a new-age style.\n\nTyrese Haliburton runs the NBA's highest-scoring offense, with Indiana putting numbers on the scoreboard that make the ones in the past Knicks-Pacers contests look like a different sport, not just a different century.\n\n\"I guess whenever you have the original teams from back then, there\u00b4s always going to be some type of history,\" Brunson said. \"But you have two good teams who play very, I don\u00b4t want to say different, but like, they play their own style of basketball. And so it\u00b4s going to be a grind of who\u00b4s going to go out there, who\u00b4s going to want it more who\u00b4s going to try to go get it.\"\n\nBrunson led the No. 2-seeded Knicks past Philadelphia in the first round, sending the Knicks into the East semifinals in consecutive seasons for the first time since making nine straight trips between 1992 and 2000.\n\nHe scored 40 or more points in the final three games, just the seventh player in NBA history with three straight 40-point games in the playoffs. The league's No. 4 scorer in the regular season tops all players in the postseason with 35.5 per game.\n\nNew York Knicks' Jalen Brunson reacts after winning Game 6 in an NBA basketball first-round playoff series against the Philadelphia 76ers, Thursday, May 2, 2024, in Philadelphia. (AP Photo/Matt Slocum)\n\nIndiana's big numbers come as a team. The Pacers led the league with 123.3 points per game, sixth highest in league history, and also were tops in field goal percentage and assists. They reached 140 points 11 times, an NBA record.\n\nThe sixth-seeded Pacers haven't slowed down too much in the playoffs. They averaged 113 while knocking off No. 3 Milwaukee and reached at least 120 in all four victories during the six-game series.\n\nThe Knicks and Pacers met three straight times from 1993-95 - exchanging Game 7 victories in the latter two - then again from 1998-2000, with the last two of those in the Eastern Conference finals. Indiana won the most recent meeting, ousting the No. 2-seeded Knicks in the 2013 East semifinals.\n\nNeither team ever reached 120 points in any of the 41 games.\n\n\"It\u00b4s just a very intense matchup, that\u00b4s really the simple truth about it,\" Pacers coach Rick Carlisle said. \"There\u00b4s a lot of stuff with Reggie Miller for five or six years and I know in 2013 there was another matchup. We\u00b4re going to have to be very resilient and we\u00b4re going to have to be very together.\"\n\nIndiana went 2-1 against New York and was right at its season average with 123.3 points per game, including 140 in a Dec. 30 victory when the Knicks were short-handed after a trade. Brunson averaged 35.7 points.\n\nThe point guards were U.S. teammates last summer playing in the Basketball World Cup, then went on to have their best NBA seasons. Both were All-Stars, with Haliburton the Eastern Conference starter in his home arena en route to leading the league with 10.9 assists per game.\n\nPascal Siakam and OG Anunoby were starters in Toronto to begin the season before the forwards were traded, with Anunoby going to the Knicks in December and Siakam to Indiana in January. The Knicks are 24-5 with Anunoby in the lineup and may need him now to defend his former teammate, who opened the playoffs with consecutive games of at least 35 points and 10 rebounds.\n\nBrunson began his career in Dallas playing for Carlisle, who praised his former player's character and said they had a great three years together. Brunson was asked if he had extra motivation after an ESPN podcast referenced his frustration in getting only 10 minutes of playing time in a Game 7 loss to the Clippers in 2021.\n\n\"In all honesty, I said this last time, you\u00b4re in the playoffs now, there is no extra motivation,\" Brunson said. \"It is what it is, the past is the past. Rick, he welcomed me into this league and he helped me become the player and he helped me grow from day one. So a coach has got to make decisions that suit their team. So whatever happened, happened and we\u00b4re moving forward from there.\"\n\nObi Toppin was the Knicks' first-round pick in 2020 and became a fan favorite, though rarely got extended playing time behind All-Star Julius Randle.

I think we're fifth in scoring. I think we're probably second in fast break points, and then when you look at total shot attempts, we're always at the top,\" head coach Tom Thibodeau said after practice at the team's Tarrytown training facility on Saturday. \"So however you get there, you can make the stats say whatever you want, but the most important one is net rating, and so that's what we look at. You want to be strong on offense and defense. I think we're fourth and fifth, or fifth in offensive rating. And we'll be challenged again. Our defense has to be great.\"\n\nBoth the Knicks and Pacers orchestrated trades to elevate their ceilings mid-season.\n\nThe Knicks traded RJ Barrett and Immanuel Quickley for Anunoby and Precious Achiuwa on the day they lost to the Pacers on Dec. 30. They also traded Quentin Grimes, Evan Fournier, Ryan Arcidiacono, Malachi Flynn and a pair of second-round picks to the Detroit Pistons for Bojan Bogdanovic (who is out for the rest of the playoffs with an ankle injury) and Alec Burks.\n\nThe Pacers got their superstar point guard Haliburton some help in a deal with the Raptors, acquiring the two-time All-Star Siakam from Toronto.\n\nBoth Anunoby and Siakam were members of the Kawhi Leonard-led Raptors team that won an NBA title in 2019.\n\nThe Pacers own a 23-18 record in games Siakam has played, while the Knicks are 20-3 in games with Anunoby, who missed a chunk of the season due to an elbow procedure.\n\n\"He can do things on the court that's kind of hard to teach,\" Brunson said of Anunoby's defensive presence after practice on Saturday. \"And obviously have the athleticism, the length to cover ground the way that he does is remarkable, but I just think he has the confidence as well just because he's done it so many times and it's made him successful. So when you get in situations where you need to help your team win, you do things that make you comfortable and make you successful. And he's just been doing it his entire career. It's nothing new. He's just doing it with New York.\"\n\nThe upcoming second-round Eastern Conference series marks the eighth time the Knicks and Pacers have met in the playoffs. The two teams have two separate stints of meeting each other three postseasons in a row.\n\nThe rivalry began in 1993, when John Starks' headbutt of Reggie Miller in Game 3 sparked what would become one the more contentious battles in the league.\n\nStarks was ejected, and Miller went on to score 36 points to lead the Pacers to a 23-point victory, but the Knicks would go on to wrap up the series, 3-1, in Game 4 of a best-of-five series.\n\nA similar outcome ensued the following postseason, when the Knicks and Pacers met in the 1994 Eastern Conference finals.\n\nThat series is best-known for Miller's 25-point fourth-quarter comeback in Game 5, and the infamous choking gesture directed at Spike Lee as the Pacers outscored the Knicks, 35-16, in a stunner at The Garden.\n\nThe Knicks, however, won the series in seven games to advance to the 1994 NBA Finals, where they lost to the Houston Rockets in Game 7.\n\nAs history would have it, the Knicks and Pacers met a third consecutive year in the 1995 Eastern Conference semifinals. The Pacers acquired former Knicks point guard Mark Jackson in a deal with the Los Angeles Lakers, and Miller put on another clutch performance, scoring eight points in the final nine seconds of Game 1 at MSG to steal a win off the Knicks' home floor.\n\nMiller's Pacers secured their first playoff series victory over the Knicks in Game 7 on Patrick Ewing's blown layup, and Pat Riley resigned from his post as head coach at the conclusion of the NBA Finals.\n\nThe Knicks and Pacers met another three straight playoff series, beginning in the second round in 1998. Ewing played on with a broken wrist, and the Pacers won the series in five games.\n\nThey would meet again the following year after the lockout-shortened 1999 season, clashing once more in the Eastern Conference Finals with a trip to the Finals on the line for the victor. The Knicks stole Game 1 in Indiana and won the series in six games before falling to the San Antonio Spurs in five in the Finals.\n\nAnd in 2000, the Knicks made it back to the Eastern Conference Finals, but there was no answer for Miller, who was on a quest to make an NBA Finals appearance. He succeeded in eliminating the Knicks to lead Indiana to its only ever Finals appearance.\n\nIt would take 13 more years for the rivalry to be reborn, this time with new faces but similar agendas.\n\nAnthony's Knicks didn't have enough firepower for the stingy Pacer defense that moved past New York in the 2013 Eastern Conference semis to lose to LeBron James' Miami Heat in the conference finals.\n\nIt's now Haliburton and Siakam. Brunson, but with no Julius Randle, the three-time All-Star whose season ended on a dislocated right shoulder in late January.\n\nBrunson is coming off of his first-ever All-Star nod and exploded onto the scene as a bona fide star averaging 28.7 points per game in the regular season, then another 35.5 points and nine assists in the first round to power his Knicks through the Philadelphia 76ers in six games.\n\nHaliburton and Brunson have different play styles: Haliburton is more of a facilitator, whereas Brunson is the head of the Knicks' scoring punch.\n\nHaliburton averaged 16 points and nine assists in the first round, as his Pacers advanced past a Bucks team without Giannis Antetokounmpo, whose season ended on a non-contact calf injury. Without Antetokounmpo, Siakam averaged 36.5 points through the first two games of Indiana's first-round series against the Bucks.\n\nThe Knicks lead the all-time regular-season head-to-head matchup, 100-95, against the Pacers, but they are losing the playoff head-to-head, 22-19.", "source": {"uri": "nydailynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kristian_winfield@nydailynews.com", "name": "Kristian Winfield", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O.G._Anunoby", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "O.G.

This is a well-balanced team as it relates to scoring as seven players in the series against the Milwaukee Bucks averaged at least 9.5 points per contest.\n\nCaesars Sportsbook $1,000 BET ON CAESARS CLAIM OFFER Promo Code: NOLA1000 STATES: AZ, CO, IA, IL, IN, KS, KY, LA, MA, MD, MI, NJ, NY, OH, PA, TN, VA.

Call 1-800-GAMBLER.\n\nThe Pacers are coming off a 4-2 series win against the aforementioned Bucks, winning the series as the No. 6 seed. Indiana brings the best offense in the NBA to this series; the Pacers led the league in points (123.3 points per game) and field goal percentage (50.7%).\n\nThe Knicks are coming off one of the best first-round series in recent memory in their win against the Philadelphia 76ers. The series went six games and provided some of the most insane endings to games fans have seen in recent memory.\n\nNew York has been one of the best teams in the Eastern Conference the entire year and it will benefit from home-court advantage in this series. While Indiana goes deeper in its bench, the Knicks will play their best players for much of the game. Josh Hart averaged 46.3 minutes in the series against Philadelphia, while Jalen Brunson (43.8) and OG Anunoby (41.7) both played extended minutes too.\n\nCaesars Sportsbook lists the Knicks as 5.5-point favorites with an over/under of 217.5.\n\nLet's take a closer look at the odds and trends:\n\nIndiana Pacers at New York Knicks\n\nTime/TV: 6:30 p.m. CT (TNT)\n\nSpread (from DraftKings Sportsbook): Knicks -5.5\n\nTotal: 217.5\n\nMoneyline: Knicks -235, Pacers +192\n\nAnalysis: If the Pacers are going to get off to a fast start in this series, they will need to get more from their All-Star point guard Tyrese Haliburton. Haliburton has been dealing with a knee injury, so he's not been at his best.\n\nDespite that, he averaged 16.0 points and 9.3 assists per game against the Bucks. The concerning part is Haliburton shot only 29.6% from beyond the arc and only got to the free throw line 1.2 times per game. This is down from 36.4% and 3.3 free throws on average during the regular season.\n\nWhen the Pacers traded for Pascal Siakam, they brought him for these exact moments. He was exceptional in the opening round, averaging 22.3 points and 8.8 rebounds per game. His ability to guard multiple positions is a huge advantage in any matchup, and the duel between Siakam and Anunoby -- former Raptors teammates -- could be a deciding factor in this series.\n\nMeanwhile, Brunson is coming off an incredible series where he averaged 35.5 points and 9.0 assists per contest. He was unstoppable down the stretch against Philadelphia and a huge reason why the Knicks advanced.\n\nDuring the regular season against the Pacers, Brunson averaged 35.7 points. Brunson's former Villanova teammate, Hart, has an equally large role to play. He averaged 12.6 rebounds per game, while also hitting numerous big shots in the series against the 76ers. Role players like Mitchell Robinson, Isaiah Hartenstein and Donte DiVincenzo are all capable of making big plays for the Knicks too, which is a huge reason that New York is such a tough matchup.\n\nThis series is intriguing because the two teams play drastically different styles. The Knicks are a physical type of team, while the Pacers are looking to get out and run. Whichever team can control the contests will win this series, and the Knicks will get things started with a win.\n\nPrediction: Knicks 111, Timberwolves 104 (Under 217.5)\n\nBest bet: Knicks -5.5 (-110 via Caesars Sportsbook)", "source": {"uri": "theadvocate.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Advocate"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mark_kern@theadvocate.com", "name": "Mark Kern", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Bucks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Bucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2022 NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesars_Entertainment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Caesars Entertainment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Points_per_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Points per game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_goal_percentage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Field goal percentage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison_Square_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Madison Square Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BET", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "BET"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Maryland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Maryland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O.G._Anunoby", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "O.G.

As an unbiased observer, the Knicks and Pacers are two of my favorite teams to watch. They both carry themselves as underdogs, which makes them easy to support. The Knicks have a cast of overlooked players wanting to prove themselves, while the Pacers are a young, up-and-coming team. In this playoff series preview, we'll take a look at the matchup, various betting markets, the paths for each team to win, and my favorite values.\n\nThe Knicks and Pacers play contrasting styles of basketball. The Knicks finished the regular season ranking 30th in pace and ninth in defensive rating. In their first-round series against the Sixers, they held Philadelphia to 106 points or fewer in four of the six games. They love to play games at a slower pace and beat their opponents in the half-court.\n\nThe Pacers take a much different approach. They were second in pace during the regular season and were more concerned with their play on offense (second in offensive rating) than defense (24th in defensive rating). In their first-round series against the Bucks, they scored more than 120 points in all four of their wins.\n\nThis series could be as simple as which team can impose their will on the other. We shouldn't put much stock into regular season results, but interestingly, the Pacers won the two high-scoring meetings, and the Knicks won the single low-scoring game. The team that can dictate the pace and force their opponent to play their style of basketball should win the series.\n\nThe Knicks have home-court advantage and are currently -245 moneyline favorites to win the series at DraftKings. They opened as 6-point favorites in Game 1 and had a 27-14 record at home during the regular season. As long as they take care of business in Madison Square Garden, they will earn themselves a trip to the Eastern Conference Finals. The key for them is to avoid getting trapped in their opponent's pace of play. That's easier said than done given how fast Indiana plays.\n\nThe Pacers picked up a win on the road in the first round against the Bucks but were only 21-20 on the road throughout the regular season. We can't hold this against the Pacers, but it's worth noting that the Bucks were without Giannis Antetokounmpo for the entire series and without Damian Lillard for a couple of the games. For the Pacers to beat the Knicks, they need to force New York out of its comfort zone with their up-tempo play, and hopefully steal one of the first two on the road. If they head home with a 0-2 deficit, winning four of the next five games will be extremely difficult.\n\nKnicks vs. Pacers best bets\n\nJalen Brunson taking on Tyrese Haliburton is the matchup everyone is anticipating. Brunson is breaking playoff scoring records left and right and is currently -8000 to lead this series in points. He's clearly the top-scoring option on the Knicks, and the Pacers have more of a balanced offensive attack, so it's hard to see anyone else scoring more points. Unfortunately, that's not a bettable number unless you want to win $1 on a $100 bet.\n\nHaliburton is the favorite (-215) to lead the series in assists. While this is a slightly more appealing number, I prefer Brunson at +150. He's playing more minutes than Haliburton (averaged 43.8 minutes in the first round), he has a better matchup (as noted above), and the two had similar assists numbers in the first round (9.0 to 9.3). The Pacers will do whatever they can to get the ball out of Brunson's hands, which could create more assist opportunities for him.\n\nAs far as my pick to win, I have to go with the Knicks. They have home-court advantage, they escaped a tougher first-round matchup, and they seem to have all casual NBA fans behind them. If their fans can travel as well as they did in the first round against the Sixers, that should give them a big boost on the road. Even if they don't win on the road, they just have to hold serve at home and they'll find themselves in the Eastern Conference Finals for the first time in 24 years.\n\nIf you want to bet on the Knicks but are looking for a better payout, there are a couple of options. You can bet on the series spread, which is betting a team to win or lose by a certain number of games. The Knicks are -125 for -1.5 games and +165 for -2.5 games. You can also bet the correct series score. My favorite options here are the Knicks 4-1 (+310) and the Knicks 4-3 (+350).

And so it's going to be a grind of who's going to go out there, who's going to want it more who's going to try to go get it.\"\n\nBrunson led the No. 2-seeded Knicks past Philadelphia in the first round, sending the Knicks into the East semifinals in consecutive seasons for the first time since making nine straight trips between 1992 and 2000.\n\nHe scored 40 or more points in the final three games, just the seventh player in NBA history with three straight 40-point games in the playoffs. The league's No. 4 scorer in the regular season tops all players in the postseason with 35.5 per game.\n\nIndiana's big numbers come as a team. The Pacers led the league with 123.3 points per game, sixth highest in league history, and also were tops in field goal percentage and assists. They reached 140 points 11 times, an NBA record.\n\nThe sixth-seeded Pacers haven't slowed down too much in the playoffs. They averaged 113 while knocking off No. 3 Milwaukee and reached at least 120 in all four victories during the six-game series.\n\nThe Knicks and Pacers met three straight times from 1993-95 -- exchanging Game 7 victories in the latter two -- then again from 1998-2000, with the last two of those in the Eastern Conference finals. Indiana won the most recent meeting, ousting the No. 2-seeded Knicks in the 2013 East semifinals.\n\nNeither team ever reached 120 points in any of the 41 games.\n\n\"It's just a very intense matchup, that's really the simple truth about it,\" Pacers coach Rick Carlisle said. \"There's a lot of stuff with Reggie Miller for five or six years and I know in 2013 there was another matchup. We're going to have to be very resilient and we're going to have to be very together.\"\n\nTHIS SEASON\n\nIndiana went 2-1 against New York and was right at its season average with 123.3 points per game, including 140 in a Dec. 30 victory when the Knicks were short-handed after a trade. Brunson averaged 35.7 points.\n\nBRUNSON VS. HALIBURTON\n\nThe point guards were U.S. teammates last summer playing in the Basketball World Cup, then went on to have their best NBA seasons. Both were All-Stars, with Haliburton the Eastern Conference starter in his home arena en route to leading the league with 10.9 assists per game.\n\nEX-RAPTOR VS. EX-RAPTOR\n\nPascal Siakam and OG Anunoby were starters in Toronto to begin the season before the forwards were traded, with Anunoby going to the Knicks in December and Siakam to Indiana in January. The Knicks are 24-5 with Anunoby in the lineup and may need him now to defend his former teammate, who opened the playoffs with consecutive games of at least 35 points and 10 rebounds.\n\nBRUNSON VS. CARLISLE\n\nBrunson began his career in Dallas playing for Carlisle, who praised his former player's character and said they had a great three years together. Brunson was asked if he had extra motivation after an ESPN podcast referenced his frustration in getting only 10 minutes of playing time in a Game 7 loss to the Clippers in 2021.\n\n\"In all honesty, I said this last time, you're in the playoffs now, there is no extra motivation,\" Brunson said. \"It is what it is, the past is the past. Rick, he welcomed me into this league and he helped me become the player and he helped me grow from day one. So a coach has got to make decisions that suit their team. So whatever happened, happened and we're moving forward from there.\"\n\nOBI'S OPPORTUNTITY\n\nObi Toppin was the Knicks' first-round pick in 2020 and became a fan favorite, though rarely got extended playing time behind All-Star Julius Randle. He scored a career playoff-high 21 points off the bench in the clinching victory over Milwaukee and now heads back to his original NBA home.\n\n\"They're one of the most physical teams in the league,\" Toppin said. \"They've had that identity for many years and we've got to come in there and match that physicality and play our style of basketball, and I think we'll be good at that.\"\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Michael Marot in Indianapolis contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "valleycentral.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KVEO-TV"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@valleycentral.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "brian_mahoney@valleycentral.com", "name": "Brian Mahoney", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Brunson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Points_per_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Points per game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O.G._Anunoby", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "O.G.

They are physical, grinding, defense-first and opportunistic on offense. On the other hand, Indiana is free-flowing, has the ball moving, and wants to rain 3s.\n\nThe teams are led by stars perfect for their systems -- and two guys who became friends during the World Cup in the Philapeans last summer.\n\nJalen Brunson is the undersized, downhill-driving, physical star who has had to carry the New York offense through the playoffs. Dallas let Brunson walk out the door to New York, where he has become one of the game's elite.\n\nFor the Pacers, it's Tyrese Haliburton running a free-flowing, up-tempo game. Haliburton is one of the league's best passers and is the kind of guy other players want to play with and run hard for because they will be rewarded.\n\nIt sets up a clash of styles in the Eastern Conference Semi-Finals that should be entertaining.\n\nGame One between the Pacers and Knicks will be played on Tuesday, May 6, at 8 ET in Madison Square Garden in Manhattan, and it will be broadcast on TNT.\n\nThe Knicks want this series to look like when these teams were rivals -- a physical, slow, grinding 1990s kind of game where Brunson dominates in the half-court. The Pacers want this series to be played in the modern style -- up-tempo, a lot of transition offense and 3-pointers with Haliburton finding teammates all over the court.\n\nWhichever team forces the game to be played in its style will win this series -- and we'll discuss that more in item No. 3.\n\nHowever, in Game 1 on Monday night, don't be surprised if the Knicks come out and -- metaphorically -- punch the Pacers in the mouth. Indiana beat a shorthanded Milwaukee team that was easier for them to defend, which allowed Indiana to get out and run, and the Bucks weren't very physical. Playing the Knicks in Madison Square Garden is going to be a culture shock. It could take the Pacers a game to get into the flow of what it will take to win this series.\n\nThe Knicks might be the most heliocentric team left in the playoffs -- Jalen Brunson is their everything -- but the Pacers are not a great defensive team, and are an especially poor match to slow Brunson.\n\nLook for Andrew Nembhard to get the initial assignment on Brunson, but this will have to be a team effort with help coming from everywhere. Don't be surprised if Pascal Siakam ultimately gets the assignment, but Aaron Nesmith and T.J. McConnell will get turns.\n\nUnlike Philadelphia -- who the Knicks beat in the last round -- Indiana does not have an elite rim protector behind that front line. Myles Turner can block some shots but he's not an intimidating force in the paint. Will the Pacers pack their defense in a little, try to form a shell, and dare the Knicks to beat them from 3? This could be a big Donte DiVincenzo series.\n\nAgainst the 76ers in the first round, the Knicks grabbed the offensive rebound on 32.2% of their missed shots, and those second-chance points changed the series. Mitchell Robinson and Isaiah Hartenstein were a force on the offensive glass.\n\nFor the season, the Indiana Pacers were one of the worst defensive rebounding teams in the league (they grabbed 74.1% of opponent missed shots, 26th in the league).\n\nIf the Pacers are going to turn this series into a track meet, they need to get stops, get the rebound, and then get out and run. If the Knicks' big men -- and hustle plays from guys like Josh Hart -- give their team second chances, they will win the series.\n\nOffensive rebounds is a stat that will be a bellwether for the series.\n\nIf Haliburton can find his pre-injury form -- even just for a couple of games -- then this quickly becomes a six or seven-game series. Peak Indiana and peak Haliburton can play with New York, but he hasn't consistently been the same since his hamstring injury. New York is playing too well right now, and this is just not a great matchup for the Pacers.", "source": {"uri": "nbcsports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Brunson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison_Square_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Madison Square Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TNT_(American_TV_network)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TNT (American TV network)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Bucks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Bucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Nesmith", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Nesmith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myles_Turner", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Myles Turner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Nembhard", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Nembhard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Hart", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Josh Hart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donte_DiVincenzo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donte DiVincenzo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaiah_Hartenstein", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Isaiah Hartenstein"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._J._McConnell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "T.

This will be the eighth playoff matchup for these two.\n\nHighlights The Knicks and Pacers have a historic playoff rivalry with the Pacers leading 22-19 in playoff matchups. The rivalry dates back to the '90s with iconic moments, like Reggie Miller's trash talk. The current series will see young stars like Jalen Brunson and Tyrese Haliburton reignite the competitiveness.\n\nAfter the New York Knicks defeated the Philadelphia 76ers in the first round of the playoffs and the Indiana Pacers upset the Milwaukee Bucks, we see another chapter written for these rivals. These two teams will see each other in the playoffs for the eighth time.\n\nThe two have played each other 195 times, with the Knicks barely leading the all-time series with a record of 100-95. However, in the playoffs, it has been a different story as they have squared off 41 times with the Pacers having a record of 22-19. Out of the seven completed series, the Pacers have won four, including the last two.\n\nThis rivalry has been historic and entertaining to watch as there are so many iconic memories and moments from these playoff series between these two teams. ESPN even documented this rivalry and eventually turned it into a 30 For 30 series.\n\nA 30 Year Rivalry The Knicks and Pacers have been battling since the Reggie Miller days\n\nThe rivalry started in 1993. That was the first time these two teams met in the playoffs, where the Knicks were the heavily favored #1 seed. Meanwhile, the Pacers snuck in as the eighth seed with a .500 record. As expected, the Knicks won the first two games of the series, but Game 3 started off with a twist.\n\nDuring the pregame, Pacers legend, Reggie Miller claimed that Knicks point guard John Starks left him hanging for a handshake. Miller took that personally and went back and forth at Starks after every time he scored.\n\n\"From that point, on I made it a mission -- I'm going to embarrass this kid.\" -Reggie Miller\n\nDuring the third quarter, Starks lost his cool and headbutted Miller, getting himself ejected from the game. The Pacers won 116-93 as Miller had a game-high 36 points, but this game meant much more and started the rivalry that is 30+ years in the making. The Knicks won this series in five games, but the fuel was already ignited.\n\nRunning it Back in the 1990s The Knicks and Pacers met again four more times that decade\n\nThese two teams just a year later square off in the Eastern Conference Finals. Heading into Game 5, the series was tied 2-2, and during that game, Miller led the Pacers to an incredible comeback. At one point, Miller puts his hands over his neck, resembling a choking motion clearly directed at world-renowned movie director and Knicks superfan Spike Lee. Despite the Knicks choking that game away, they fought hard and took that personally and won both games six and seven to win the season and go into the NBA Finals.\n\nIn 1995, for the third year in a row, these two met up in the playoffs. However, the result was completely different. The Knicks thought they had the game won as they were up by six with 18.7 seconds remaining. However, a scorching hot Miller and crucial mental errors from Anthony Mason and Greg Anthony of the Knicks, the game suddenly became tied. Starks had a chance to give the Knicks the lead but missed both free throws.\n\nThe Knicks did not get swept like Miller thought, but the Pacers ended up winning this series in five games.\n\nAfter a two-year break from each other, they run into each other once again in 1997. Miller played spoiler once again, hitting the game-tying three to force overtime in Game 4, which they ultimately ended up winning. The Pacers also ended up winning that series once again in just five games.\n\nIn 1999, the two teams split the first two games and Knicks star player Patrick Ewing injured his Achilles, ruling him out for the rest of the playoffs. The Knicks were down three in pivotal Game 3. Larry Johnson answered the call and scored a four-point play, propelling the Knicks to victory. The Pacers responded well, winning Game 4. However, the Knicks won the next two and the series in six games.\n\nThe Rivalry Takes a Step Back The two teams have met only twice in the playoffs since 1999\n\nThey meet again in the 2000 Eastern Conference Finals with the Pacers still bitter about how last season went. After Games 1-5 went to the home team, the Pacers had a chance to be the first team to win an away game and go to their first NBA Finals. In his final playoff game at Madison Square Garden, Miller went nuclear, scoring 34 points to eliminate the Knicks and go to their first NBA Finals, but they would fall to the Los Angeles Lakers.\n\nAfter 13 years, Carmelo Anthony and Paul George became the new leaders of this rivalry for each team. As good as George was in that season, Roy Hibbert stepped up big time to help defeat the Knicks in six games. Hibbert even had the game-winning block on an attempted Anthony dunk to win the season.\n\nKnicks and Pacers Complete Playoff History\n\nYear\n\nRound\n\nResult\n\n1993\n\n1st Round\n\nKnicks Win 3-1\n\n1994\n\nConference Finals\n\nKnicks Win 4-3\n\n1995\n\nConference Semis\n\nPacers Win 4-3\n\n1998\n\nConference Semis\n\nPacers Win 4-1\n\n1999\n\nConference Finals\n\nKnicks Win 4-2\n\n2000\n\nConference Finals\n\nPacers Win 4-2\n\n2013\n\nConference Semis\n\nPacers Win 4-2\n\nIn that series, Hibbert averaged 13.3 points, 10.3 rebounds, 1.7 assists, and 3.1 blocks, which were higher than his career averages. This series loss, caused the Knicks to panic and trade solid role players in J.R. Smith and Iman Shumpert for second-round picks that became Thanasis Antetokounmpo and Cleanthony Early.\n\nThe Rivalry Returns Tyrese Haliburton and Jalen Brunson can capture the fire of the 1990s\n\nFast-forward to 2024 and now these rivals square up once again. Both of these teams are led by their elite point guards Jalen Brunson and Tyrese Haliburton. However, behind them, both teams have tons of depth. This is going to be a very fun series to watch as well as very physical.\n\n\"There's going to be more juice in this series with the storied rivalry.\" -Tyrese Haliburton\n\nHaliburton has always had a personal history with the Knicks and their fans since before he even played his first game.\n\n\"I'm honestly like a really petty person. If I go through my bookmarks right now on Twitter, once I get to 2020, it's gonna be nothing but people talking about the way I shoot, Knicks' fans saying they shouldn't draft me and all this stuff.\" -Haliburton\n\nHe even developed a rivalry with someone on the Knicks. However, he is not a player. Similarly to the Miller-Lee rivalry, Haliburton does not have a high opinion on Knicks announcer and former NBA player Wally Szczerbiak. Szczerbiak called Haliburton a \"wannabe All-Star\" and Haliburton's pettiness got the best of him and the first chance he got, he had some words and stared the Knicks announcer down.\n\nKnicks forward Josh Hart also added fuel to the fire by mentioning his hatred for Indiana and how he never wants to go there unless he has to play there.\n\n\"If I don't have to play the Indiana Pacers, I'm not stepping foot in that state.\" -Josh Hart\n\nThis series kicks off on Monday night and will be nothing short of excellence. Expect this series to get chippy at times while two very talented teams are going at it.\n\nRelated Mavericks, Jason Kidd Agree to Multi-Year Contract Extension The Mavericks have extended their head coach Jason Kidd.", "source": {"uri": "givemesport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GiveMeSport"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_rivalry", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "College rivalry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reggie_Miller", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Reggie Miller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Brunson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Bucks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Bucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_76ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia 76ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Anthony", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Greg Anthony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Mason_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Mason (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Johnson_(basketball,_born_1969)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Larry Johnson (basketball, born 1969)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Ewing", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Ewing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Hibbert", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Roy Hibbert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_throw", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free throw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spike_Lee", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spike Lee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Hart", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Josh Hart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_draft", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA draft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_George", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paul George"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wally_Szczerbiak", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wally Szczerbiak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iman_Shumpert", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iman Shumpert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleanthony_Early", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cleanthony Early"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thanasis_Antetokounmpo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thanasis Antetokounmpo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._R._Smith", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "J.

About Roy Hibbert, and of course about Reggie Miller -- about the choke sign and eight points in nine seconds, and his one and only NBA Finals trip that had to go through a series with New York.\n\nThe Pacers will meet the Knicks in the Eastern Conference semifinals starting Monday at 7:30 p.m. at Madison Square Garden, marking the eighth time the two teams have met in an NBA playoff series. The last meeting was 2013, though, and the previous six all came in an eight-season period between 1993 and 2000, so the defining period of the rivalry came when many of the Pacers were either toddlers or in grade school. Carlisle wanted to make sure his players had a sense of what they were in for.\n\n\"It's just a very intense matchup,\" Carlisle said. \"That's really the simple truth about it. There's a lot of stuff with Reggie Miller obviously for five or six years. The 2013 matchup that they had. It's always great competition. It's an important time of year when you get to the second round of the NBA Playoffs. We're going to have to be very resilient and we're going to have to be very together.\"\n\nAll-Star point guard Tyrese Haliburton was an infant when the Pacers won the 2000 Eastern Conference Finals over the Knicks to reach their only NBA Finals and he was in middle school for the last meeting when Roy Hibbert's block of Carmelo Anthony helped shift the momentum of Game 6 of the 2013 Eastern Conference semifinals. However, the 24-year-old Haliburton considers himself a basketball historian and considers Carlisle even more of one, so he knows it's only fitting that his first playoff run with the Pacers includes a Knicks series.\n\n\"I'm just excited to be a part of it,\" Haliburton said. \"I think me being with the Pacers and being a part of the long-term future here, it was only (a matter of time) before we were going to play these guys. It's kind of part of it. ... There's a lot of competition. There's going to be a lot of smoke in there. Obviously a lot of their former guys are coming to a ton of games. I'm sure we'll have a lot of our former guys coming to games too. There's no secret that that's a rivalry. So for me to be a part of it, I think is a lot of fun and I think it's just going to be fun to add another (chapter to that story.)\"\n\nThe classic Pacers-Knicks matchups in the 90s were chippy with the origin of the animosity going back to slights between John Starks and Reggie Miller in the 1993 first-round series which included Starks head-butting Miller. In this series, the teams' stars come in with healthy existing relationships. Pacers forward Pascal Siakam and Knicks forward O.G. Anunoby played together for years with the Raptors. Haliburton played with Knicks guards Jalen Brunson and Josh Hart with Team USA during the FIBA World Cup last summer and developed a very close relationship with both. Haliburton said Brunson was actually one of the first people he called after the Pacers secured a playoff spot on the season's final day.\n\n\"Those are two of my good friends, we talk all the time,\" Haliburton said. \"... Being out there with those guys with USA, I guess I was kinda substitute Dante (DiVencenzo) with (former Villanova teammates) Mikal (Bridges) and Jalen and Josh. I kinda got roped into being in that group. It was fun. We have a group chat we talk in all the time. Those are good friends of mine. Excited to play against them. Excited for all the shenanigans of who Josh Hart is as a human being. Excited to play against those guys.\"\n\nThere are more connections beyond that. Carlisle coached Brunson with the Mavericks and he also played for the Knicks in 1987-88 on a team coached by Rick Pitino that made the playoffs. And of course, the Pacers acquired forward Obi Toppin from the Knicks in a trade this offseason. Toppin had some disagreements with coach Tom Thibodeau in terms of playing time, but he's a Brooklyn native and life-long Knicks fan and his brother Jacob is on the Knicks roster on a two-way deal.\n\nToppin, of course, knows what the Garden is like in the playoffs, and knows the importance of the Pacers staying focused within that.\n\n\"We understand what type of crowd is gonna be there,\" Toppin said. \"Celebrities are gonna be there. We just have to lock in to our main things and play our type of basketball.\"\n\nThey know they are dealing with a Knicks team that is very locked in after winning a thrilling series with the 76ers and also winning the last five games of the regular season to finish 50-32 with the No. 2 seed in the East.\n\nBrunson has been particularly spectacular. After finishing fourth in the NBA in scoring with 28.7 points per game in the regular season, he's been on even more of a tear in the playoffs. He averaged 35.5 points per game against the 76ers, the most of any player in the first round, while also dishing out 9.0 assists per game. That was partially due to high volume shooting as he attempted 29.2 field goal attempts per game and shot 42.9% from the floor, but the Knicks need him for scoring and he provided it, scoring at least 40 points in each of the last three games.\n\n\"There's no betting against that guy,\" Carlisle said. \"I don't know if anybody saw this coming, what he's achieved in two years there, but if you know him and you know his character, you're not surprised. You're not shocked. ... He's obviously a highly-skilled player, but he has an indomitable will to accomplish what the naysayers don't think he can. He's just one of those types of guys.\"\n\nBrunson was trouble for the Pacers during the regular season -- scoring 28, 40 and 39 points respectively in their three outings -- but they managed to dodge Anunoby. The former IU star was acquired from the Raptors on Dec. 30 but wasn't available for the game against the Pacers that night then was dealing with an elbow injury in the other two games. However, the Knicks were 20-3 in the regular season when Anunoby was available and he's averaging 15.0 points, 6.8 rebounds and 1.0 steals per game in the playoffs.\n\n\"He fits in so perfect with what they do,\" Haliburton said. \"He's a Thibs guy, right? He guards the best player, guards his (expletive) off, crashes the glass like crazy. Makes open shots. What more could you ask for in today's game?\"\n\nAnunoby is one of several that fit in with Thibodeau's style of play, based on tough defense and hard rebounding. Brunson is the only player averaging over 20 points per game in the playoffs, but they grabbed 37% of available offensive rebounds in the first round, the highest rate of any team in the playoffs. The rivalry returns in a less personally nasty place than it was in the 90s, but the Pacers are dealing with a Knicks team that is just as gritty as those were.\n\n\"He's a great player, we have to be ready to compete against him and all of those guys,\" Haliburton said of Anunoby. \"They all play so hard. All their wings, all their bigs. Jalen's obviously a great player.

The No. 2 seed New York Knicks will face off against the No. 6 Indiana Pacers starting Monday (6:30 p.m. CT, TNT) at Madison Square Garden.\n\nThe Knicks survived a hard-fought first-round series against the Philadelphia 76ers, winning in six games. The Pacers upset the No. 3 seed injury-riddled Milwaukee Bucks in six games.\n\nIndiana will be facing another top team in the East that's missing a valuable piece. The Knicks are without three-time All-Star forward Julius Randle, who had season-ending shoulder surgery, but Brunson's stellar play and a strong defense has covered up Randle's absence for the most part.\n\nThis matchup will be a clash of styles. The Pacers have the NBA's second-highest rated offense but rank 24th in defense. New York ended the season with a top-10 offensive and defensive unit.\n\nHow Pacers can pull upset\n\nThe Pacers made an aggressive move before the trade deadline by acquiring two-time All-Star Pascal Siakam from the Toronto Raptors to team up with Haliburton. Siakam is averaging 21.3 points and shooting a career-high 38.6% on 3-pointers.\n\nThe 76ers didn't get consistent big-time performances from their two stars on the same night against the Knicks. Haliburton's playmaking combined with Siakam's scoring could give the Knicks trouble if they are on the same page. Indiana has the ability to play an up-tempo brand of basketball, where its depth could overpower the short-handed Knicks.\n\nCan Knicks overcome depth issues?\n\nThree of the top five Knicks by scoring average are either hurt or have been traded, but that hasn't stopped the show in New York. Knicks coach Tom Thibodeau at times went with a trusted rotation of six players during the first round and they have played well.\n\nBrunson has led the way, but the Knicks also have quality defenders to throw at Siakam and Haliburton. They can use elite wing defender OG Anunoby to guard his former teammate Siakam and attempt to make Haliburton one-dimensional. The Pacers' point guard averaged 19.7 points and 13.3 assists in three regular-season games against the Knicks. At least one of those numbers needs to go down.\n\nGIANNOTTO: How Ja Morant, Memphis Grizzlies fit into NBA's 'changing of the guard' | Giannotto\n\nKnicks vs. Pacers: Who wins?\n\nThe Pacers can struggle on defense, but that offense is potent. New York has been able to overcome the absences of multiple key role players, but a long series may favor the Pacers. Haliburton was dynamic against the Knicks this season and Indiana is currently the deeper team.", "source": {"uri": "commercialappeal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Commercial Appeal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Brunson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_Siakam", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pascal Siakam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_on_TNT", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA on TNT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIBA_Basketball_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FIBA Basketball World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Bucks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Bucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_76ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia 76ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison_Square_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Madison Square Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Randle", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Julius Randle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Raptors", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Toronto Raptors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O.G._Anunoby", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "O.G.

But while the matchup may be old school, Jalen Brunson and the Knicks are bracing for an opponent who plays a new-age style.\n\nTyrese Haliburton runs the NBA's highest-scoring offense, with Indiana putting numbers on the scoreboard that make the ones in the past Knicks-Pacers contests look like a different sport, not just a different century.\n\n\"I guess whenever you have the original teams from back then, there's always going to be some type of history,\" Brunson said. \"But you have two good teams who play very, I don't want to say different, but like, they play their own style of basketball. And so it's going to be a grind of who's going to go out there, who's going to want it more who's going to try to go get it.\"\n\nBrunson led the No. 2-seeded Knicks past Philadelphia in the first round, sending the Knicks into the East semifinals in consecutive seasons for the first time since making nine straight trips between 1992 and 2000.\n\nHe scored 40 or more points in the final three games, just the seventh player in NBA history with three straight 40-point games in the playoffs. The league's No. 4 scorer in the regular season tops all players in the postseason with 35.5 per game.\n\nIndiana's big numbers come as a team. The Pacers led the league with 123.3 points per game, sixth highest in league history, and also were tops in field goal percentage and assists. They reached 140 points 11 times, an NBA record.\n\nThe sixth-seeded Pacers haven't slowed down too much in the playoffs. They averaged 113 while knocking off No. 3 Milwaukee and reached at least 120 in all four victories during the six-game series.\n\nThe Knicks and Pacers met three straight times from 1993-95 -- exchanging Game 7 victories in the latter two -- then again from 1998-2000, with the last two of those in the Eastern Conference finals. Indiana won the most recent meeting, ousting the No. 2-seeded Knicks in the 2013 East semifinals.\n\nNeither team ever reached 120 points in any of the 41 games.\n\n\"It's just a very intense matchup, that's really the simple truth about it,\" Pacers coach Rick Carlisle said. \"There's a lot of stuff with Reggie Miller for five or six years and I know in 2013 there was another matchup. We're going to have to be very resilient and we're going to have to be very together.\"", "source": {"uri": "syracuse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "syracuse"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

About Roy Hibbert, and of course about Reggie Miller -- about the choke sign and eight points in nine seconds, and his one and only NBA Finals trip that had to go through a series with New York.\n\nThe Pacers will meet the Knicks in the Eastern Conference semifinals starting Monday at 7:30 p.m. at Madison Square Garden, marking the eighth time the two teams have met in an NBA playoff series. The last meeting was 2013, though, and the previous six all came in an eight-season period between 1993 and 2000, so the defining period of the rivalry came when many of the Pacers were either toddlers or in grade school. Carlisle wanted to make sure his players had a sense of what they were in for.\n\n\"It's just a very intense matchup,\" Carlisle said. \"That's really the simple truth about it. There's a lot of stuff with Reggie Miller obviously for five or six years. The 2013 matchup that they had. It's always great competition. It's an important time of year when you get to the second round of the NBA Playoffs. We're going to have to be very resilient and we're going to have to be very together.\"\n\nAll-Star point guard Tyrese Haliburton was an infant when the Pacers won the 2000 Eastern Conference Finals over the Knicks to reach their only NBA Finals and he was in middle school for the last meeting when Roy Hibbert's block of Carmelo Anthony helped shift the momentum of Game 6 of the 2013 Eastern Conference semifinals. However, the 24-year-old Haliburton considers himself a basketball historian and considers Carlisle even more of one, so he knows it's only fitting that his first playoff run with the Pacers includes a Knicks series.\n\n\"I'm just excited to be a part of it,\" Haliburton said. \"I think me being with the Pacers and being a part of the long-term future here, it was only (a matter of time) before we were going to play these guys. It's kind of part of it. ... There's a lot of competition. There's going to be a lot of smoke in there. Obviously a lot of their former guys are coming to a ton of games. I'm sure we'll have a lot of our former guys coming to games too. There's no secret that that's a rivalry. So for me to be a part of it, I think is a lot of fun and I think it's just going to be fun to add another (chapter to that story.)\"\n\nThe classic Pacers-Knicks matchups in the 90s were chippy with the origin of the animosity going back to slights between John Starks and Reggie Miller in the 1993 first-round series which included Starks head-butting Miller. In this series, the teams' stars come in with healthy existing relationships. Pacers forward Pascal Siakam and Knicks forward O.G. Anunoby played together for years with the Raptors. Haliburton played with Knicks guards Jalen Brunson and Josh Hart with Team USA during the FIBA World Cup last summer and developed a very close relationship with both. Haliburton said Brunson was actually one of the first people he called after the Pacers secured a playoff spot on the season's final day.\n\n\"Those are two of my good friends, we talk all the time,\" Haliburton said. \"... Being out there with those guys with USA, I guess I was kinda substitute Dante (DiVencenzo) with (former Villanova teammates) Mikal (Bridges) and Jalen and Josh. I kinda got roped into being in that group. It was fun. We have a group chat we talk in all the time. Those are good friends of mine. Excited to play against them. Excited for all the shenanigans of who Josh Hart is as a human being. Excited to play against those guys.\"\n\nThere are more connections beyond that. Carlisle coached Brunson with the Mavericks and he also played for the Knicks in 1987-88 on a team coached by Rick Pitino that made the playoffs. And of course, the Pacers acquired forward Obi Toppin from the Knicks in a trade this offseason. Toppin had some disagreements with coach Tom Thibodeau in terms of playing time, but he's a Brooklyn native and life-long Knicks fan and his brother Jacob is on the Knicks roster on a two-way deal.\n\nToppin, of course, knows what the Garden is like in the playoffs, and knows the importance of the Pacers staying focused within that.\n\n\"We understand what type of crowd is gonna be there,\" Toppin said. \"Celebrities are gonna be there. We just have to lock in to our main things and play our type of basketball.\"\n\nThey know they are dealing with a Knicks team that is very locked in after winning a thrilling series with the 76ers and also winning the last five games of the regular season to finish 50-32 with the No. 2 seed in the East.\n\nBrunson has been particularly spectacular. After finishing fourth in the NBA in scoring with 28.7 points per game in the regular season, he's been on even more of a tear in the playoffs. He averaged 35.5 points per game against the 76ers, the most of any player in the first round, while also dishing out 9.0 assists per game. That was partially due to high volume shooting as he attempted 29.2 field goal attempts per game and shot 42.9% from the floor, but the Knicks need him for scoring and he provided it, scoring at least 40 points in each of the last three games.\n\n\"There's no betting against that guy,\" Carlisle said. \"I don't know if anybody saw this coming, what he's achieved in two years there, but if you know him and you know his character, you're not surprised. You're not shocked. ... He's obviously a highly-skilled player, but he has an indomitable will to accomplish what the naysayers don't think he can. He's just one of those types of guys.\"\n\nBrunson was trouble for the Pacers during the regular season -- scoring 28, 40 and 39 points respectively in their three outings -- but they managed to dodge Anunoby. The former IU star was acquired from the Raptors on Dec. 30 but wasn't available for the game against the Pacers that night then was dealing with an elbow injury in the other two games. However, the Knicks were 20-3 in the regular season when Anunoby was available and he's averaging 15.0 points, 6.8 rebounds and 1.0 steals per game in the playoffs.\n\n\"He fits in so perfect with what they do,\" Haliburton said. \"He's a Thibs guy, right? He guards the best player, guards his (expletive) off, crashes the glass like crazy. Makes open shots. What more could you ask for in today's game?\"\n\nAnunoby is one of several that fit in with Thibodeau's style of play, based on tough defense and hard rebounding. Brunson is the only player averaging over 20 points per game in the playoffs, but they grabbed 37% of available offensive rebounds in the first round, the highest rate of any team in the playoffs. The rivalry returns in a less personally nasty place than it was in the 90s, but the Pacers are dealing with a Knicks team that is just as gritty as those were.\n\n\"He's a great player, we have to be ready to compete against him and all of those guys,\" Haliburton said of Anunoby. \"They all play so hard. All their wings, all their bigs. Jalen's obviously a great player. We gotta be ready to go.\"", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jabo_Starks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jabo Starks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlisle", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carlisle"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reggie_Miller", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Reggie Miller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Hibbert", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Roy Hibbert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Hart", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Josh Hart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Johnson_(basketball,_born_1969)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Larry Johnson (basketball, born 1969)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Ewing", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Ewing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Carlisle", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rick Carlisle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spike_Lee", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spike Lee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmelo_Anthony", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carmelo Anthony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison_Square_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Madison Square Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O.G._Anunoby", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "O.G.

The Knicks are looking to overcome the Pacers in the playoffs for a chance at the Conference Finals for the first time in years. Brunson has shone in the playoffs with high scoring games, drawing comparisons to NBA legend Allen Iverson.\n\nThe New York Knicks have been one of the best teams in the NBA this season, despite being plagued by injuries to some of their starters throughout the 2023-24 regular season.\n\nHowever, Jalen Brunson has remained a constant, and league insider Mark Medina argues that over the course of his time in New York, he has 'blossomed' into the Knicks' leading man, and subsequently, is putting to bed comments made over him being a '1A-type superstar'.\n\nSeeking Trip to Eastern Conference Finals Pacers won two of their three regular season meetings over Knicks\n\nEarning a reputation in the past for being one of the fiercest post-season rivalries in the Eastern Conference that has spanned for over 30 years, as the luck of the playoff bracket would have it, the Knicks and the Indiana Pacers will once again square off against each other with a chance of reaching the Conference Finals at stake.\n\nHistory has Indiana leading 22-19 in their 41 previous playoff meetings, but the Knicks and their blue-collar squad spearheaded by Tom Thibodeau are hoping to tack on some more wins, and edge past the Pacers, who have themselves superseded expectations over the course of the regular season, which saw them reach the playoffs for the first time since the 2020-21 season, and win their first post-season series since 2017-18.\n\nNew York Knicks - 2023-24 Playoff Statistics\n\nCategory\n\nStatistic\n\nPost-Season Rank\n\nORTG\n\n116.7\n\n6th\n\nDRTG\n\n116.9\n\n13th\n\nNRTG\n\n-0.2\n\n9th\n\nTS%\n\n54.1\n\n12th\n\nPACE\n\n91.09\n\n15th\n\nPIE\n\n49.9\n\n9th\n\nDespite injuries to Mitchell Robinson, trade deadline acquisition OG Anunoby, and Julius Randle, the latter of who is the only player who has been unable to return to the court, plaguing them throughout the season, the Knicks somehow muscled their way to the second seed in the East, edging past a gritty Philadelphia 76ers which featured a determined - yet hobbling - Joel Embiid in six games.\n\nIt also helped that they had the sixth man, the fans, behind them regardless of whether they were playing at Madison Square Garden, or Philadelphia's Wells Fargo Center, even if the 76ers owner did buy 2,000 tickets to try and 'block out' Knicks fans; support which Thibodeau was quick to praise after they clinched the series 4-2.\n\nGIVEMESPORT Key Statistic: Jalen Brunson became the first player to score at least 37 points in four consecutive playoff games since Michael Jordan in 1993.\n\nNow, the surging Knicks, who have former Villanova trio Donte DiVincenzo, Josh Hart and leading star, Brunson, at the heart of their core, are looking to shake things up in the post-season once again, and hoping to overcome a Pacers squad with All-Star talent in Tyrese Haliburton and Anunoby's former teammate when with the Toronto Raptors, Pascal Siakam, and reach the Conference Finals for the first time since 2000.\n\nBrunson Is the 'Head of the Snake'\n\nMedina alluded back to when Golden State Warriors veteran, Draymond Green, referred to Brunson as the 'head of the snake', and the journalist feels it is a very fitting description for the 27-year-old, with him becoming a star right before everybody's eyes, despite the ongoing debate about whether he is franchise-leading material for a winning organization.\n\n\"Draymond Green called him the head of the snake, and that's an apt description for Jalen Brunson because he has been a dominant leader. I know there has been debate that he's not a 1A-type superstar, and maybe that can still be true, but he is blossoming into a star that you see as a definitive go-to guy and the numbers back it up.\n\nHe's on pace to become the first Knicks guard named All-NBA since Clyde Frazier in 1975. He became the first Knick since Carmelo Anthony in 2014 to have back-to-back 40-point games, and so he is the real deal.\"\n\nComing Alive in the Post-Season Eclipsed the 40-point mark in three of the Knicks' six outings versus 76ers\n\nEntering the playoffs, Brunson had come off a career-high scoring season in which he averaged 28.7 points at a 47.9 percent shooting clip, while he also saw improvements in his ball distribution, in which he dished out 6.7 assists, and grabbed 3.6 boards, 0.3 shy of his career high of 3.9 rebounds which he set during the 2021-22 season.\n\nBut in the first-round of the post-season, the Sixers failed to contain the Knicks' All-Star guard, allowing him to score 40-plus points three times, and in New York's 4-2 triumph, he averaged 35.5 points, 9.0 assists and 4.5 rebounds, though his shooting efficiency suffered a slight dip, particularly from behind the three-point line, where he shot 30.4 percent from distance, and 42.9 percent from the field, both down on his 2023-24 regular season campaign numbers.\n\nJalen Brunson - First-Round Scoring and Assists\n\nGame\n\nPTS\n\nFG%\n\n3P%\n\nAssists\n\n1\n\n22\n\n30.8\n\n16.7\n\n7\n\n2\n\n24\n\n27.6\n\n16.7\n\n6\n\n3\n\n39\n\n48.1\n\n42.9\n\n13\n\n4\n\n47\n\n52.9\n\n25.0\n\n10\n\n5\n\n40\n\n46.9\n\n36.4\n\n6\n\n6\n\n41\n\n48.1\n\n37.5\n\n12\n\nDespite a slow start to the series, Brunson's, at times, dominant performances, particularly in the previous four outings, saw him dubbed as the best performer in the first-round, which has even drawn comparisons to the great Allen Iverson, and his role in leading his Sixers to an improbable NBA Finals run back in 2001.\n\nBoth undersized point-guards, with Brunson standing at 6-foot-1 and Iverson at 6-foot, and Brunson's playing style similar to that of the Hall-of-Famer's, the Knicks will be hoping for similar success in reaching the Finals, and perhaps going one step further, and going all the way to lifting the Larry O'Brien trophy.\n\nBut, the Pacers, and Brunson's former head coach when with the Dallas Mavericks, Rick Carlisle, may have something to say about that, and are the first of a few more challenging obstacles left that Brunson and New York have to overcome beforehand.\n\nStrap in tight, because this series has the potential to become another classic in the longstanding Knicks-Pacers rivalry.\n\nAll statistics courtesy of Statmuse, ESPN, NBA.com and Basketball Reference.\n\nRelated The Knicks Need to Utilize A Midseason Trade Aquisition The Knicks need to get out of their seven man rotation in the playoffs especially against the Indiana Pacers who have a lot of depth.

That is certainly the case at ESPN, where a poll of ESPN's NBA reporters and analysts unanimously picked the Knicks to win the series.\n\nAll 16 of the reporters and analysts who made a prediction picked the Knicks.\n\nThe most common prediction was Knicks in six.\n\nOf course, these are just guesses, but it's a telling outlook for the series: the Knicks, coming off a draining, intense series win over the Philadelphia 76ers, are the heavy favorites to make the Eastern Conference Finals for the first time since 2000.\n\nThe two teams are stylistic opposites, and that is part of what makes this series so compelling.\n\nBoth teams are led by elite point guards -- Jalen Brunson for the Knicks and Tyrese Haliburton for the Pacers. But the two players play far differently. Haliburton likes to race up the court, sprinting in for easy buckets or spraying the ball out to shooters. Meanwhile, Brunson has a plodding, probing style that is heavy on dribbling, pivots, and maneuvering in small, tight spaces.\n\nRebounds might be a big factor in this series. The Knicks are one of the most dominant offensive rebounding teams while the Pacers are a poor defensive rebounding team. If the Knicks control the glass and the pace, the Pacers might have a hard time keeping up in a half-court setting. But if Indiana controls the glass -- or catches the Knicks out of position -- it could open up their transition game.\n\nThe series has the potential to be a close one, full of interesting matchups and adjustments.\n\nBut Indiana has at least one mental advantage: all of the pressure is on the Knicks to win this series.", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sporting News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison_Square_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Madison Square Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Brunson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_76ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia 76ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://library.sportingnews.com/styles/twitter_card_120x120/s3/2024-04/Knicks%20and%20Pacers%20043024.jpeg?itok=5k_8v-Gz", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9539735", "eventUri": "eng-9539735", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

The Pacers killed what was supposed to be the 2012-13 dream season and stunned the Knicks in the East Semifinals. Thirteen years prior, the Pacers robbed the Knicks of a second straight trip to the NBA Finals. Indiana eventually lost to the Shaq-and-Kobe Lakers, but New York still feels the sting. Twenty years of suck tend to have that effect!\n\nThis year, however, is different. The Knicks aren't relying entirely on a one-dimensional Carmelo Anthony, a tired Tyson Chandler, and streaky J.R. Smith. This team, though shorthanded thanks to injuries, still plays hard and refuses to go down easy. Jalen Brunson has put the Knicks on his back all year and seems ready to floor it in the playoffs.\n\nHowever, he and the Knicks will have to get back a Pacers team that might not defend well, but had enough size and speed to finish top in the league in scoring.\n\nKey Storyline: Indiana offense vs. New York defense. This is a tough series to call because though the Pacers won the season series 2-1, both wins have asterisks. Indiana defeated New York 140-126 on December 30, but the Knicks were down Mitchell Robinson. OG Anunoby had also just been acquired from Toronto and wasn't yet with the team. The Pacers lost at MSG on February 1, but beat the Knicks at home again on February 10, 125-111.\n\nExcept in that game, the Knicks were without Robinson, Anunoby, and Isaiah Hartenstein, leaving Precious Achiuwa and an aging Taj Gibson to man the paint. New York, one of the top rebounding teams in the league, got outclassed on the boards 41-32.\n\nBoth teams are as healthy as they're going to be right now and it's a simple numbers game again. The Pacers were the best scoring team in the NBA, but ranked 27th in points allowed. The Knicks' modest offense ranked 19th, but 2nd in points allowed.\n\nWere the Pacers that good in the first round, or were the Milwaukee Bucks just that bad without Giannis or a healthy Damian Lillard? We'll soon find out.\n\nKey Matchup: Pascal Siakam vs. OG Anunoby. Siakam was the Pacers' go-to guy in the first round, averaging 22.3 points and 8.8 rebounds against Milwaukee. On the New York side, Anunoby has been a defensive stalwart while also chipping in 15 points per game. He will be tasked with stopping Siakam, who the Pacers acquired from the Raptors in January.\n\nThe two have similar builds and the Pacers need Siakam's offense to get past the Knicks. Anunoby is well aware he'll be guarding the Pacers' leading scorer. On top of that, the Pacers are arguably a better coached team under Rick Carlisle than Nick Nurse's Philadelphia 76ers.\n\nRemember what ultimately sunk Philly? It was the lack of a consistent third option aside Joel Embiid and Tyrese Maxey. Can the Pacers get to the East Finals with Tyrese Haliburton and Myles Turner leading the way?\n\nX-Factors: Mitchell Robinson & Isaiah Hartenstein. The Pacers' key advantage over the Knicks is that their bigs can shoot. Myles Turner shot nearly 44% from three in the first round and has shot 36.7% for his career. This is where Robinson and Hartenstein's defense becomes critical.\n\nRobinson cannot score outside the paint. Hartenstein has range, but largely stays in the paint for rebounding purposes. The two now have to be prepared to defend guys like Turner or Siakam stretching and spacing the floor. But in doing so, the Knicks also risk losing the rebounding game.\n\nThe Knicks are the better defensive team, but the Pacers' offense is fast and feisty. Robinson and Hartenstein might need to be perfect the whole series for the Knicks to have a chance.\n\nPacers predicted starters: Tyrese Haliburton (PG), Andrew Nembhard (SG), Aaron Nesmith (SF), Pascal Siakam (PF), Myles Turner (C)\n\nKnicks predicted starters: Jalen Brunson (PG), Donte DiVincenzo (SG), Josh Hart (SF), OG Anunoby (PF), Isaiah Hartenstein (C)\n\nSeries Prediction: We've heard the old adage a gazillion times before. Offense wins games, defense wins championships. By that measure, the Knicks should win this series in a walk. ESPN unanimously picked New York to advance to the East Finals.\n\nSorry, Knicks fans, but yours truly is not ESPN. It's been a great season, one that can hopefully be built on next year, but New York's road ends at the East Semis again. Between Turner and Siakam's range, Indy's army of shooters, and Knicks coach Tom Thibodeau almost certainly having to rely on Alec Burks coming in cold, the Pacers will pace themselves to the East Finals.

But Brunson has complete confidence in his team, partly because of New York's not-so-secret weapon in the form of trade acquisition OG Anunoby.\n\nVia Zach Braziller of the New York Post:\n\n\"Obviously, having him will make a difference,\" Jalen Brunson said. \"I'm excited, he's healthy. I'm excited he's back with us. It's going to be a great matchup.\"\n\nAnunoby could be the ace in the hole of the Knicks in the Pacers series. Although the Pacers beat New York twice in three meetings back in the regular season, none of those games featured Anunoby in Knicks uniform. The first meeting between New York in Indiana this season happened on the same day that the Knicks traded for Anunoby from the Toronto Raptors. In the next two games between the two rivals, Anunoby was not able to suit up because of an injury.\n\nNow, Anunoby is healthy and has been a key cog for the Knicks in their playoff run. In the Sixers series, he was third on the team in scoring with 15.0 points per game while shooting 51.3 percent from the floor and providing an average of 6.0 rebounds, 1.0 steals, and 1.3 blocks per contest.\n\nFor More NBA And College Basketball Content:", "source": {"uri": "hardwoodheroics.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "hardwoodheroics.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Brunson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O.G._Anunoby", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "O.G.

But while the matchup may be old school, Jalen Brunson and the Knicks are bracing for an opponent who plays a new-age style.\n\nTyrese Haliburton runs the NBA's highest-scoring offence, with Indiana putting numbers on the scoreboard that make the ones in the past Knicks-Pacers contests look like a different sport, not just a different century.\n\n\"I guess whenever you have the original teams from back then, there's always going to be some type of history,\" Brunson said. \"But you have two good teams who play very, I don't want to say different, but like, they play their own style of basketball. And so it's going to be a grind of who's going to go out there, who's going to want it more, who's going to try to go get it.\"\n\nBrunson led the No. 2-seeded Knicks past Philadelphia in the first round, sending the Knicks into the East semi-finals in consecutive seasons for the first time since making nine straight trips between 1992 and 2000.\n\nHe scored 40 or more points in the final three games, just the seventh player in NBA history with three straight 40-point games in the playoffs. The league's No. 4 scorer in the regular season tops all players in the postseason with 35.5 a game.\n\nIndiana's big numbers come as a team. The Pacers led the league with 123.3 points a game, sixth-highest in league history, and also were tops in field-goal percentage and assists. They reached 140 points 11 times, an NBA record.\n\nThe sixth-seeded Pacers haven't slowed down too much in the playoffs. They averaged 113 while knocking off No. 3 Milwaukee and reached at least 120 in all four victories during the six-game series.\n\nThe Knicks and Pacers met three straight times from 1993-95 - exchanging Game 7 victories in the latter two - then again from 1998-2000, with the last two of those in the Eastern Conference finals. Indiana won the most recent meeting, ousting the No. 2-seeded Knicks in the 2013 East semi-finals.\n\nNeither team ever reached 120 points in any of the 41 games.\n\n\"It's just a very intense matchup, that's really the simple truth about it,\" Pacers coach Rick Carlisle said. \"There's a lot of stuff with Reggie Miller for five or six years and I know in 2013 there was another matchup. We're going to have to be very resilient and we're going to have to be very together.\"\n\nPascal Siakam and OG Anunoby were starters in Toronto to begin the season before the forwards were traded, with Anunoby going to the Knicks in December and Siakam to Indiana in January.

Now, both teams will collide to see who can advance to the Eastern Conference Finals. How good are the Knicks' chances against the Pacers?\n\nImpressively, the Knicks outgunned a Sixers scoring front led by 2023 scoring champion Joel Embiid's 33.0 points per game and 2024 All-Star Tyrese Maxey's 29.8 PPG.\n\nJalen Brunson went off for 35.5 points per game despite struggling from outside at 30.4 percent and had help from five teammates who scored in double figures for the series.\n\nThough Brunson didn't have another 20-point-per-game producer alongside him, Josh Hart averaged 16.8 points on 43.2 percent shooting from three-point range and OG Anunoby pitched in 15 PPG on 51.3 percent shooting from the field. Miles McBride also did his job off the bench with 11.3 PPG behind a 48.1/43.3/83.3 percent shooting line.\n\nThe Pacers also got scoring up and down their lineup, with six of their own players averaging double figures. However, unlike New York, Indiana was led by 22.3 points per game from Siakam, while Haliburton's post-All-Star break struggles carried over into the postseason. Haliburton shot 43.5 percent from the field and 29.6 percent from deep against Milwaukee.\n\nEven without 2024 All-Star Julius Randle healthy, who would have given the Knicks a point guard-power forward duo to stack up against the Pacers, New York looks primed to outgun the Pacers on offense. The Knicks shut down every 76ers scorer not named Embiid, Maxey, or Kelly Oubre Jr. to single digits, including Tobias Harris. If they can do the same to the Pacers' role players, they'll have a less potent scoring duo to worry about stifling.\n\nThe Knicks have the second-highest scoring fast-break offense in these NBA playoffs. New York is putting up 15.7 points per game in transition. However, the Pacers aren't allowing jets to get turned on. They are the best transition defense, conceding only 17.1 points combined off of the fast break and off of turnovers.\n\nThe game slows down in the postseason, and increasingly so as the rounds advance. Albeit, the Knicks will have a successful area of their offense bothered by a Pacers team that gets up and down the floor with bigs in Myles Turner and Siakam who can protect the rim.\n\nThe Pacers' fast break offense (11.8 PPG) is comparable to the Knicks' defense in that category (11.7 PPG allowed), so Indiana may not get the upper hand in transition.\n\nThe Knicks had their way on the offensive glass against the Sixers and were able to turn that success into 19.2 second-chance points per game, a playoff best. Conversely, the Pacers have been strong on the glass, giving up 9.5 offensive rebounds and bringing down 33.5 defensive boards a night.\n\nAdditionally, the Pacers rank No. 10 in allowing 43.7 points in the paint. The Bucks did not have Giannis Antetokounmpo for the entire series and Damian Lillard missed two games. Yet, Milwaukee was able to convert inside. With the way that Hart, Isaiah Hartenstein, and Mitchell Robinson have played, their activity levels alone position them to get efficient looks at the basket in close.\n\nOn the other hand, seeing that the Pacers play well in the pick-and-roll and led the league in paint scoring during the 82-game slate, the Knicks could benefit from enticing Indiana to kick out to their supporting cast for catch-and-shoot opportunities, where they completed 37.2 percent of their looks in the first round. The Pacers only had two role players, Andrew Nembhard and Ben Sheppard, who average better than 30.8 percent from deep (min 10 minutes per game).\n\nExploring offensive play types, the Pacers thrive in the pick-and-roll. Their ball handlers are the fourth-most efficient unit in screen-and-roll situations, shooting 48.8 percent from the field. They also frequently look to their bigs, who average 9.5 shot attempts when coming off screens. However, they only convert 45.6 percent of those looks.\n\nThe Knicks can expect Myles Turner to pop out the three-point line most of the time that they trap Haliburton off of the curl. Siakam likes to swing over to the corners for three-point opportunities and fancies pick-and-pop shots from the free-throw line extended, 15-17 feet out.\n\nIf the Knicks can force Haliburton to shoot tough shots and stay home on the Pacers' rollers, they'll stand a great chance of containing their screen plays.\n\nAll in all the series will have many components to it, but these factors will be crucial in deciding its winner. Based on what's been seen through the regular season and the first round, the Pacers may not have an answer for the Knicks' well-rounded front.\n\nThe only point of concern for the Knicks will be whether or not they have enough scorers that can come up big should Pacers head coach Rick Carlisle opt to take Brunson completely out of the game.

Both series ended in six games.\n\nBrunson led the way for the Knicks with a 35.5 ppg scoring average and scored 39, 47, 40 and 41 over the final four games of the series.\n\nBrunson is a bona fide star in his second season in New York but that wasn't the case when he was a member of the Mavericks, who faced the Los Angeles Clippers during the first round of the 2021 playoffs.\n\nDallas let a 3-2 series lead get away and as things disintegrated in Game 7, Brunson watched from the bench. The highly competitive guard played just 10 minutes, scoring 2 points in a 126-111 defeat.\n\n\"In all honesty, I said this last time, you're in the playoffs now, there is no extra motivation,\" Brunson told reporters when asked about his unhappiness at the time. \"It is what it is. The past is the past. Rick welcomed me into the league and helped me become the player (I am today) and helped me grow from Day 1.\"\n\nThat Game 7 loss was Carlisle's final game in Dallas. Now in his third season with the Pacers, he fears Brunson but doesn't think a coaching decision made three seasons ago has any bearing on the current series.\n\n\"Jalen Brunson is a guy you would never bet against,\" Carlisle told reporters. \"You just don't bet against that guy. I don't know if anybody saw this coming, what he's achieved for two years now, but if you know him and you know his character, you're not surprised. You're not shocked.\"\n\nThe Pacers went 2-1 against New York in the regular season but Brunson made an impact by averaging 35.7 points.\n\n\"The last two times we played him he had 40 in one game and 39 in the other,\" Carlisle said. \"He's leading the playoffs in scoring average. It's pretty obvious that he established a very high level during the season, and he's maintained and/or exceeded it in the postseason, and that's hard to do.\"\n\nBrunson departed Dallas after the following season as a free agent en route to becoming a star with the Knicks.\n\n\"Coaches got to make decisions that better suit their teams,\" Brunson said of Carlisle. \"Whatever happened, happened, and we're moving forward from there.\"\n\nThis will be the eighth time the Pacers and Knicks have met in the postseason with Indiana holding a 4-3 lead.\n\nSix of the meetings came in an eight-season span (1993-2000) when Reggie Miller was the star of the Pacers. Those series were filled with drama and memorable moments.\n\nIndiana will rely on its top-rated offense (123.3 ppg in the regular season) in this series, while the Knicks are stingy, ranking second in scoring defense at 108.2.\n\nTyrese Haliburton makes the Pacers go with help from big men Pascal Siakam and Myles Turner.\n\nBut in the clinching win over Milwaukee on Thursday, it was a pair of reserves, former Knick Obi Toppin (21 points) and T.J. McConnell (20), leading the way in the 120-98 victory.\n\n\"It means a lot,\" McConnell said. \"Not getting into the playoffs since the bubble, not being able to advance since 2014, we take great pride in being able to advance and extend our season.\" - Rappler.com", "source": {"uri": "rappler.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Rappler"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Brunson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Carlisle", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rick Carlisle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Bucks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Bucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_76ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia 76ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Clippers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Clippers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myles_Turner", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Myles Turner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._J._McConnell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "T.

The \"World's Most Famous Arena\" has been the site of many legendary battles between these clubs, and more could be in store over the next few weeks.\n\nBut before Jalen Brunson and Tyrese Haliburton lead their teams onto the court, let's take a trip down memory lane and revisit some of the best playoff moments between the two franchises, who faced off six times in the postseason over an eight-year span between 1993 and 2000.\n\n1993: Starks ejected for headbutting Miller\n\nThe Indiana Pacers made the jump from the ABA to the NBA when the two leagues merged ahead of the 1976-77 season. Once ABA royalty, they struggled to find their footing in the NBA until the 1990, when they began a run of 16 playoff appearances in 17 seasons.\n\nIn 1993, they met the Knicks in the playoffs for the first time. While the Knicks won the best-of-five first-round series 3-1, the competitive nature of the games was a sign of what was to come.\n\nDuring Game 3, John Starks and Reggie Miller were jawing at each other as they ran up the court, when Starks suddenly headbutted Miller. Starks was ejected from the game and Miller went on to score 36 points in the Pacers' only win of the series.\n\n1994: Miller taunts Spike Lee; Ewing plays hero in Game 7\n\nThe next season, the Knicks and Pacers met again in the playoffs, but this time in the Eastern Conference Finals. New York jumped out to a quick 2-0 lead in the series, but Indiana won the next two at home to even the matchup at 2-2 and send it back to MSG for a pivotal Game 5.\n\nAfter jumping out to an early lead, the Knicks were in control much of the night and entered the fourth quarter with a 12-point lead. That's when Reggie Miller took over the game. He poured in 25 of his game-high 39 points in the final frame to lead a stunning comeback. The Pacers outscored the Knicks 35-16 in the fourth en route to a 93-86 win and a 3-2 series lead.\n\nDuring his scoring barrage, Miller got into it with Knicks superfan and acclaimed film director Spike Lee, and flashed the choke sign his way.\n\nMiller's taunt became an iconic image and one of the defining moments of his career.\n\nLee and the Knicks got the last laugh that season, however. The Knicks won the next two contests to take the series in seven games, thanks in large part to a heroic effort from Patrick Ewing, who put up 24 points, 22 rebounds, seven assists and five blocks in Game 7.\n\n1995: 8 points, 9 seconds; Ewing can't save the Knicks this time\n\nAfter a first-round meeting in 1993 and a conference finals showdown in 1994, the Knicks and Pacers met in the second round in 1995. This time, the Pacers finally came out on top in another classic seven-game series that is still being talked about today.\n\nIn Game 1, the Knicks were up 105-99 with less than 20 seconds to play, and seemed to be on their way to an important win to start the series. Reggie Miller had other ideas. He scored eight points in nine seconds to flip the game on its head and give the Pacers the win.\n\nMiller hit a 3-pointer to make it 105-102, then stole Patrick Ewing's inbound pass and hit another 3 to tie it up at 105-105. The Pacers then fouled John Starks, but he missed both free throws and Ewing missed a follow-up jumper off the offensive rebound. Miller was then fouled in the scramble for the rebound. He went down to the other end and made both shots at the line to put the Pacers in front for good at 107-105.\n\nThe Knicks bounced back to win Game 2, but the Pacers defended homecourt to take a 3-1 series lead and were feeling comfortable ahead of Game 5. They nearly closed it out in five games, but Ewing hit a spinning game-winner in the closing seconds to keep the Knicks' season alive. The Knicks then went on the road to take Game 6 and force a Game 7 back in the Garden.\n\nIn fitting fashion, that final game also went down to the wire, but Ewing couldn't save the Knicks again. With five seconds to play, the Knicks were down by two with the ball and Ewing drove to the rim but somehow missed a layup that would have sent the game to overtime.\n\n1999: Johnson's 4-point play key in Knicks' Cinderella run\n\nThe Knicks snuck into the playoffs as the No. 8 seed in the playoffs in the lockout-shortened 1999 season. Once there, they stunned the Miami Heat in the first round, then swept the Atlanta Hawks to reach the Eastern Conference Finals, where they again met the Pacers.\n\nNew York won Game 1, but their Cinderella run seemed to be over when Patrick Ewing went down with an Achilles injury in Game 2 that would sideline him for the rest of the playoffs. As it turned out, luck was still on their side. At the end of Game 3, Larry Johnson delivered one of the most important players in franchise history by converting a (controversial) 4-point play in the closing seconds to turn a three-point deficit into a one-point lead.\n\nThe Knicks held on to win Game 3, then took the series in six games to become the first No. 8 seed in NBA history to reach the NBA Finals.\n\n2000: Miller leads Pacers to first (and so far only) Finals\n\nFollowing their surprise defeat in 1999, the Pacers regrouped and established themselves as the best team in the Eastern Conference in 2000. When they met the Knicks again in the Eastern Conference Finals, they were out for revenge and did not waste their opportunity.\n\nWith a chance to clinch the series on the road in Game 6, Reggie Miller (17 points) nearly outscored the Knicks (18) by himself in the fourth quarter, to send the Pacers to the Finals for the first, and so far only, time in franchise history.\n\n2013: Hibbert blocks Carmelo to seal the series\n\nHere's a look at their most-recent playoff meeting. It would take 13 years for the Knicks and Pacers to meet again after the 2000 matchup. By then, the Knicks were led by Carmelo Anthony and Amar'e Stoudemire, while the Pacers had a budding young superstar in Paul George.\n\nWith George leading the way, the Pacers jumped out to a 3-1 series lead, but the veteran Knicks would not give up without a fight. New York won Game 5 at home to keep its season alive, and Game 6 back in Indianapolis was heading down to the wire until Roy Hibbert came up with the best play of his career.\n\nLate in the fourth quarter, the Knicks were up by two when Anthony caught the ball on the block, spun past George and went to the rim for a slam that could have pushed the lead to four and deflated the crowd. Instead, Hibbert met Anthony at the summit for an incredible block that turned the tide.\n\nThe Pacers outscored the Knicks 16-7 the rest of the way to take the series and advance to the Eastern Conference Finals.", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jack_maloney@cbssports.com", "name": "Jack Maloney", "type": "author",

Both series ended in six games.\n\nBrunson led the way for the Knicks with a 35.5 ppg scoring average and scored 39, 47, 40 and 41 over the final four games of the series.\n\nBrunson is a bona fide star in his second season in New York but that wasn't the case when he was a member of the Mavericks, who faced the Los Angeles Clippers during the first round of the 2021 playoffs.\n\nDallas let a 3-2 series lead get away and as things disintegrated in Game 7, Brunson watched from the bench. The highly competitive guard played just 10 minutes, scoring two points in a 126-111 defeat.\n\n\"In all honesty, I said this last time, you're in the playoffs now, there is no extra motivation,\" Brunson told reporters when asked about his unhappiness at the time. \"It is what it is. The past is the past. Rick welcomed me into the league and helped me become the player (I am today) and helped me grow from Day 1.\"\n\nThat Game 7 loss was Carlisle's final game in Dallas. Now in his third season with the Pacers, he fears Brunson but doesn't think a coaching decision made three seasons ago has any bearing on the current series.\n\n\"Jalen Brunson is a guy you would never bet against,\" Carlisle told reporters. \"You just don't bet against that guy. I don't know if anybody saw this coming, what he's achieved for two years now, but if you know him and you know his character, you're not surprised. You're not shocked.\"\n\nThe Pacers went 2-1 against New York in the regular season but Brunson made an impact by averaging 35.7 points.\n\n\"The last two times we played him he had 40 in one game and 39 in the other,\" Carlisle said. \"He's leading the playoffs in scoring average. It's pretty obvious that he established a very high level during the season, and he's maintained and/or exceeded it in the postseason, and that's hard to do.\"\n\nBrunson departed Dallas after the following season as a free agent en route to becoming a star with the Knicks.\n\n\"Coaches got to make decisions that better suit their teams,\" Brunson said of Carlisle. \"Whatever happened, happened, and we're moving forward from there.\"\n\nThis will be the eighth time the Pacers and Knicks have met in the postseason with Indiana holding a 4-3 lead.\n\nSix of the meetings came in an eight-season span (1993-2000) when Reggie Miller was the star of the Pacers. Those series were filled with drama and memorable moments.\n\nIndiana will rely on its top-rated offense (123.3 ppg in the regular season) in this series, while the Knicks are stingy, ranking second in scoring defense at 108.2.\n\nTyrese Haliburton makes the Pacers go with help from big men Pascal Siakam and Myles Turner.\n\nBut in the clinching win over Milwaukee on Thursday, it was a pair of reserves, former Knick Obi Toppin (21 points) and T.J. McConnell (20), leading the way in the 120-98 victory.\n\n\"It means a lot,\" McConnell said. \"Not getting into the playoffs since the bubble, not being able to advance since 2014, we take great pride in being able to advance and extend our season.\"", "source": {"uri": "deadspin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Deadspin"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Carlisle", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rick Carlisle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Brunson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Bucks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Bucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_76ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia 76ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Clippers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Clippers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myles_Turner", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Myles Turner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reggie_Miller", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reggie Miller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_Siakam", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pascal Siakam"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Recruiting", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Recruiting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fill,h_675,pg_1,q_80,w_1200/16b5fb73f679bbc37605a46f4dde06dd.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9539735", "eventUri": "eng-9539735", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

The Pacers are looking to steal homecourt advantage against the depleted Knicks playing without All-Star forward Julius Randle.\n\nIndiana pulled off the upset over the No. 3 seed Milwaukee Bucks in the first round. They dispatched the Bucks in six games and took advantage of Giannis Antetokounmpo's injury. Damian Lillard also missed two games, so the Pacers went to work to get their first postseason series win in a decade.\n\nMeanwhile, the Knicks outlasted the Philadelphia 76ers in a very entertaining first-round series. The Knicks choked a lead in Game 5 before a series-clinching victory in Game 6 in Philadelphia. Jalen Brunson was nearly unstoppable in the series, scoring at least 40 points in the last three games.\n\nIndiana Pacers vs New York Knicks Top 10 player props for Game 1\n\n#10 - Aaron Nesmith, Points - Over 11.5 (-134)\n\nAaron Nesmith has done a wonderful job as a starter for the Indiana Pacers. Nesmith averaged 11.0 points, 4.2 rebounds and 2.7 assists in the first round against the Milwaukee Bucks.\n\n#9 - Andrew Nembhard, Points - Over 10.5 (-115)\n\nThe Indiana Pacers needed Andrew Nembhard to step up after Bennedict Mathurin's season-ending injury. Nembhard averaged 13.8 points, 3.3 rebounds and 4.7 assists in their first round series versus the Bucks.\n\n#8 - Isaiah Hartenstein, Pts+Reb - Over 19.5 (-112)\n\nIsaiah Hartenstein has shined as the starting center for the New York Knicks ever since Mitchell Robinson went down in December. Hartenstein did a solid job against Joel Embiid in the first round and should have an easier series versus Myles Turner.\n\n#7 - Donte DiVincenzo, 3-Pointers Made - Over 2.5 (-167)\n\nDonte DiVincenzo was having a sub-par series against the Philadelphia 76ers before an explosive Game 6. DiVincenzo had 23 points and went 5-for-9 from beyond the arc. It would be great for the New York Knicks if the \"Big Ragu\" carries some momentum heading into the second round.\n\n#6 - Josh Hart, Rebounds - Under 12.5 (-110)\n\nJosh Hart may be an undersized forward, but he's one of the best rebounders in the NBA. Hart averaged 8.3 rebounds in the regular season and was even better in the postseason, putting up 12.3 rebounds per game against the Philadelphia 76ers.\n\n#5 - OG Anunoby, Points - Over 16.5 (-106)\n\nThe New York Knicks have been reliant on Jalen Brunson on offense, so a player like OG Anunoby has to step up. Anunoby should be the Knicks' second option on scoring with Julius Randle still out with injury. He averaged 15.0 points, 6.8 rebounds, 1.0 steals and 1.3 blocks in the first round.\n\n#4 - Myles Turner, Blocks - Over 1.5 (-130)\n\nMyles Turner has been one of the best shot blockers in the NBA in the past five years. Turner is averaging just 1.2 blocks per game this postseason, but he's capable of blocking a lot of shots in a single game. However, he's also had games wherein he had zero blocks.\n\n#3 - Pascal Siakam, Points - Over 20.5 (+100)\n\nPascal Siakam has considerably cooled down after scoring 36 and 37 points in Games 1 and 2 against the Milwaukee Bucks. Siakam will have to be a force on the offensive end if the Indiana Pacers want to have a shot at taking down the New York Knicks.\n\n#2 - Tyrese Haliburton, Pts+Reb+ Asts - Over 31.5 (-108)\n\nTyrese Haliburton has not been the same player since after the All-Star break. Haliburton has struggled at times over the past two months, but remains a vital part of the Indiana Pacers offense. He's one of only a handful of players capable of dropping a triple-double every game.\n\n#1 - Jalen Brunson, Points - Over 34.5 (-102)\n\nJalen Brunson averaged 35.5 points per game in the first round, which is currently the highest in New York Knicks postseason history. Brunson has been nearly unguardable and the Indiana Pacers will need to throw different looks at him on defense.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"},

Since the 2000-01 season, the Knicks have won three playoff series, while the Pacers have won eight postseason series.\n\nThe Knicks have not advanced beyond the Eastern Conference semifinals since the 1999-2000 season, while the Pacers hadn't made it past the first round in 10 years until they defeated the Milwaukee Bucks last week.\n\nThis year, one of those franchises is guaranteed to make the conference Finals, as the No. 2 seed Knicks and No. 6 seed Pacers face each other in the semifinals starting on Monday night at Madison Square Garden.\n\nIt is the first time the franchises have met in the playoffs since the 2014 conference semifinals when the Pacers won in six games. Still, although the teams do not have much playoff success over the past two decades, they have a rich history as rivals in the 1990s.\n\nFrom the 1992-93 through 1999-2000 seasons, the Knicks and Pacers played six times in the playoffs in eight seasons. Each team won three series. To this day, older fans recall that era when the franchises had memorable games that featured plenty of trash talk but mutual respect. Below, we take a look at each of the series.\n\n1993 - Knicks Defeat Pacers 3-1 In First Round\n\nThe Knicks entered the playoffs as the Eastern Conference's top seed. They had gone 60-22 in the regular season under second-year coach Pat Riley, who had won four NBA titles as the Los Angeles Lakers coach in the 1980's. The Phoenix Suns (62-20) were the only team in the league with a better record.\n\nThe Pacers, meanwhile, were the No. 8 seed. They had tied with the Orlando Magic with a 41-41 record but made the playoffs because they outscored the Magic, 444-439, in the teams' four head-to-head matchups.\n\nThe Pacers hadn't won a playoff series since entering the NBA in the 1976-77 season, and that streak continued against the Knicks. The Knicks won the first two games at home before the Pacers won Game 3 by 23 points thanks to the trio of Reggie Miller (36 points), Detlef Schrempf (29) and Rik Smits (25). Knicks guard John Starks was ejected from that game for headbutting Miller, but the Knicks bounced back and won Game 4, 109-100, in overtime to clinch the series as guard Doc Rivers scored New York's final 11 points in overtime.\n\nThe Knicks won the next series over the Charlotte Hornets before losing in six games to the Chicago Bulls in the conference finals. The Bulls ended up defeating the Suns in the NBA Finals to win their third consecutive championship.\n\n1994 - Knicks Defeat Pacers 4-3 In Conference Finals\n\nWith Bulls star Michael Jordan retired and playing baseball, the Eastern Conference was wide open. The Bulls had won three consecutive titles and seemed unstoppable with Jordan, but that was no longer the case.\n\nIn the second round, the No. 2 seed Knicks defeated the No. 3 seed Bulls in seven games, while the No. 5 seed Pacers upset No. 1 seed Atlanta in six games. The Pacers had a first-year coach in Larry Brown, who had coached four other NBA teams and had led the University of Kansas to the 1988 NCAA tournament championship.\n\nThe Knicks won the first two games at Madison Square Garden, followed by the Pacers winning two in their home arena. In Game 5, Miller famously made a choke sign at director/Knicks fan Spike Lee as the Pacers overcame a 12-point deficit after three quarters and won, 93-86, thanks to Miller's 39 points, including 25 in the fourth quarter.\n\nStill, the Knicks bounced back and won the next two games, 98-91 in Indianapolis and 94-90 in New York, advancing to the franchise's first NBA Finals since 1973. But the Knicks lost in seven games to the Houston Rockets, who won their first NBA title as Most Valuable Player Hakeem Olajuwon had 30 points and 10 rebounds in Game 6 and 25 points and 10 rebounds in Game 7.\n\n1995 - Pacers Defeat Knicks 4-3 In Conference Semifinals\n\nThe Knicks and the Pacers met in the playoffs for the third consecutive season. This time, though, the Pacers were the higher seed (No. 2), although they had a worse record (52-30) than the No. 3 seed Knicks (55-27) and secured the No. 2 seed only because they won the Central Division, whereas the Knicks were second in the Atlantic Division. Still, the Knicks had homecourt advantage thanks to their superior record.\n\nIn Game 1, Miller added to his postseason heroics. With the Pacers trailing by six points with 18.7 seconds left in Game 1, Miller made a 3-pointer, stole the ball and made another 3 to tie the score with 13.2 seconds remaining. Starks then missed two free throws before Miller made both free throws, giving the Pacers a 107-105 lead with 7.5 seconds remaining. The Knicks couldn't get a shot off on the other end, giving the Pacers an improbable victory.\n\nThe Pacers took a 3-1 lead after four games before the Knicks won Game 5 by one point on a Patrick Ewing shot with 1.8 seconds left and then Game 6 by 10 points as Ewing had 25 points and 15 rebounds. In Game 7 at Madison Square Garden, the Pacers led, 97-95, with five seconds remaining. The Knicks inbounded the ball and found Ewing for an easy finger roll layup, but Ewing couldn't convert, giving the Pacers the series.\n\nIn the Eastern Conference Finals, the Pacers lost to the Magic in seven games. The Magic dominated Game 7, winning 105-81, but they ended up losing in a four-game sweep to the Rockets in the NBA Finals.\n\n1998 - Pacers Defeat Knicks 4-1 In Conference Semifinals\n\nBefore the season, the Pacers hired Larry Bird as coach, replacing Brown, who left to become the Philadelphia 76ers coach. Bird was a three-time Most Valuable Player as a player and a future Hall of Famer, but he had never coached, although he proved to be a quick study as the Pacers won a franchise-record 58 games.\n\nThe Knicks, meanwhile, went 43-39 under coach Jeff Van Gundy, their worst record since the 1990-91 season. In the first round, the Knicks upset the Miami Heat three games to two, winning Game 5 on the road to set up another matchup with the Pacers, who defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers three games to one.\n\nThe Pacers took advantage of their home court, winning the first two games before losing, 83-76, on the road in Game 3. But they rebounded to win Game 4, 118-107, in overtime as Miller had 38 points, including making a 3-pointer late in the game to force overtime. The Pacers closed out the series by winning by 11 in Game 5 and getting a 22-point, 14-rebound, 13-assist performance from point guard Mark Jackson, who had the first postseason triple-double in Pacers history.\n\nThe Pacers then lost to the Bulls in seven games in the Eastern Conference Finals. The Bulls ended up winning their third consecutive title, and Jordan retired again for the second time, only to return later to play with the Washington Wizards.\n\n1999 - Knicks Defeat Pacers 4-2 In Conference Finals\n\nThis was a strike-shortened season that didn't begin until early February, so each team only played 50 games. The Pacers went 33-17 in the regular season, tied with the Heat and Magic for the Eastern Conference's best record, but they secured the No. 2 seed thanks to tiebreakers. The Knicks finished 27-23 and barely made the playoffs as the No. 8 seed.\n\nStill, the Knicks went on an unexpected run in the postseason starting in the first round against the Heat and Riley, New York's former coach who had left for Miami following the 1994-95 season. The Knicks upset the No. 1 seed Heat, winning the decisive Game 5 by one point after Allan Houston made a shot with 0.8 seconds remaining.\n\nThe Knicks then swept the Hawks, setting up a Conference Finals matchup with the Pacers, who had won their first seven playoff games via sweeps over the Milwaukee Bucks and 76ers.\n\nThe teams split the first two games in Indianapolis, and it looked like the Pacers were in control late in Game 3, leading by three points before Knicks forward Larry Johnson made a 3-pointer and was fouled. Johnson converted the free throw for the 4-point play, and the Knicks hung on for a 92-91 victory. The Knicks ended up winning in six games to advance to the NBA Finals, where they lost in five games to the San Antonio Spurs.\n\n2000 - Pacers Defeat Knicks 4-2 in Conference Finals\n\nThe Pacers made the playoffs for the 11th time in 12 seasons, but they had become accustomed to difficult endings. Still, this year they finally broke through and made the NBA Finals for the first time.\n\nIt wasn't easy getting there, though. In the first round, the No. 1 seed Pacers (56-26 regular season record) faced the No. 8 seed Milwaukee Bucks (42-40). The teams split the first four games, setting up a decisive Game 5 in Indianapolis. That day, the Pacers trailed, 94-93, before reserve guard Travis Best made a corner 3-pointer to put them up by two points. The Pacers hung on to win the game and series.\n\nIndiana then beat the 76ers in six games, advancing to the Conference Finals, where they faced the Knicks, the No. 3 seed who had beaten the No. 2 seed Heat in seven games in the semifinals.\n\nThe Pacers and Knicks split the first four games before the Pacers won the next two to win the series. In the decisive Game 6 at Madison Square Garden, Miller had 34 points and made 5-of-7 3-pointers and 9-of-9 free throws.\n\nIn the NBA Finals, the Pacers lost in six games to the Los Angeles Lakers, who had gone 67-15 in the regular season. The Lakers won the next two titles, as well, as Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O'Neal solidified their Hall of Fame careers.", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"},

And this Eastern Conference semifinal between the Knicks and Pacers is going to come down to the Knicks looking for a slugfest and the Pacers wanting a track meet.\n\n\"Obviously, we want to play Knicks basketball. They're going to try to play Pacers basketball. It's going to be a grind. It's going to be a battle,\" Jalen Brunson said. \"After the first game, we're going to have to adjust, whether we win or lose. Adjusting is how you win these types of things.\"\n\nBrunson, an MVP candidate in the regular season, has leveled up in the postseason. His scoring average of 35.5 points per game coming into this series is the highest in the playoffs, shouldering the offensive burden after All-Star teammate Julius Randle went down for the season with surgery on his shoulder.\n\nNow, Brunson will face off against his Team USA teammate in Tyrese Haliburton in a battle of star point guards. Haliburton averaged 19.7 points and 13.3 assists in three games against the Knicks, with Indiana taking the season series. But that series has little bearing on this one.\n\nAll of those meetings took place before the All-Star break, and OG Anunoby didn't face Indiana in any of them. The Knicks are 24-5 with their defensive ace in the lineup, and expect his work on Pacers star Pascal Siakam -- his former Toronto teammate -- to be pivotal.\n\nHis key to pulling out the series against the league's highest-scoring team?\n\n\"Togetherness. Resilience. Competitiveness,\" Anunoby said. \"Just not letting go.\"\n\nThe Post takes a look at how the teams match up:\n\nThe strongest link in a weak chain called Indiana's defense.\n\nWhile the Pacers allowed the fourth-most points per 100 possessions, their 3-point defense, based on shooting percentage, was 16th in the league, though they were the best in the league in attempts (29.3) and makes (10.7) allowed per game.\n\nAnd those numbers got even more impressive when one adjusts for their breakneck pace. The Pacers conceded just 28.7 attempts per 100 possessions; nobody else was less than 32.4. They don't do a ton of things well on defense, but running shooters off the line is one of them.\n\nMeanwhile, despite Donte DiVincenzo shattering the team record for 3-pointers (283), the Knicks were still just 10th in makes and 14th in percentage.\n\nIndiana was a decent 3-point shooting team in the regular season, top 10 in percentage. But in the postseason, they've leaned into that.\n\nThe Pacers took more attempts from deep in the first round (40.7) than any other team, and their 14.0 makes per game were second. No, Haliburton didn't shoot well, just .296 against Milwaukee, but he sure got his looks up, as did Myles Turner, Aaron Nesmith and Co.\n\nThe Knicks are going to have to stay home on the arc or pay the price. If there's a way to attack their withering defense, this is it.\n\nOnly two teams allowed more 3s in the first round than their 13.5 per game, and the Bucks and Heat both got sent packing. Rest assured, Haliburton will test this.\n\nEdge: Pacers\n\nLook up the definition of lopsided, and it's this matchup on the boards.\n\nRandle is out for the season. Mitchell Robinson missed 51 games, and the Knicks still mauled teams on the boards like Jaws going after bloody meat. They led the league in rebounding percentage (52.7), while Indiana ranked just 24th. New York was first in offensive rebound percentage as well.\n\nEven against the Joel Embiid-led Sixers, their 37.0 offensive rebound percentage was the second-best of any team in the first round. The platoon of Robinson and Isaiah Hartenstein are already a handful, but adding 6-foot-4 wing Josh Hart's preternatural ability to rebound (8.3) almost seems unfair.\n\nThe addition of Pascal Siakam gives Indiana a capable rebounder (team-high 7.8) to go with Turner, but they're outclassed on the glass. Badly.\n\nEdge: Knicks overwhelmingly\n\nPossibly due to the loss of Randle, the Knicks were just 14th at earning free throws at 21.8. That's just one extra foul shot more than the Pacers (22nd at 20.5). That's a barely noticeable razor-thin margin.\n\nBut the playoffs have told a different story. The Knicks attacked the paint against Philadelphia and averaged two dozen attempts, while Indiana earned just 17.8 in its first-round series. It bears watching how these games are called.\n\nIndiana doesn't have an Embiid-like presence, the Sixers' star having drawn a league-best 11.6 attempts this season. Siakam has drawn just five per game -- 4.2 since joining the Pacers midseason. Turner is at 4.1, the rest even worse.\n\nEdge: Knicks overwhelmingly\n\nThe only thing the Pacers do better than run is allow points in the paint.\n\nIndiana surrendered the most paint points in the entire league this season at 58.4 points.\n\nThe Knicks finished 19th in paint scoring at 48.9, and that's hamstrung by the loss of Randle and his post game. Brunson averaged 11.6 points in the paint, second among guards. But the Pacers don't appear to be set to provide much resistance.\n\nThe Knicks' board work has been well-established. They were second in the league in second-chance points at 16.3 per game, while Indiana allowed the fifth-most second chance points (15.8).\n\nThe Pacers are a top-10 team in blocks, but weakside rejections are not the same as positional defense in the paint. Indiana allowed the second-highest shooting percentage between five and nine feet from the rim. The Pacers full-court press helped beat the Bucks; but break that, and they're vulnerable in the paint.\n\nIndiana scores the most paint points in the league at 57.9, more than two points better than the runner-up Lakers. They won't post up the way Embiid did, but have Haliburton and Siakam in the pick-and-pop.\n\nAnd the Knicks are stout. Robinson and Hartenstein provide rim protection. They allowed the sixth-fewest points in the paint over the course of the season. And coming out of a first-round win over Philadelphia and Embiid having averaged the fewest paint points allowed of any team in the playoffs so far (36.3) is nothing short of miraculous.\n\nEdge: Even\n\nThe Knicks ranked just 15th in transition points, though they bumped that up to second (15.7) in the opening round of the playoffs thanks to the active ball-hawking perimeter defense of Anunoby, Hart and Miles McBride.\n\nBut if the Knicks were middle of the pack, the Pacers have led that pack all season. Indiana's pressure kept the Bucks on the back foot, and they allowed the fewest transition points in the postseason at just 6.3. And their own running game is well-documented. Indiana was second in the league in pace and averaged 16.6 fast-break points. Slowing them down will be a huge key.\n\n\"Yeah, they play very fast. They get the ball out quick, throw it ahead, get up a lot of 3s. They just play really fast, probably the highest pace in the league. ... So, it'll be challenging for us to get back on defense,\" said Anunoby. \"It's an emphasis in film. Coach does a good job preparing us for that and we know coming into it to be ready for that.\"\n\nEdge: Pacers\n\nThe Pacers averaged 46.8 bench points per game in the regular season, the most in the league. The Knicks averaged 28.4, the least. Then the playoffs hit, and Tom Thibodeau -- known for short rotations and extended minutes -- doubled down.\n\nIn the clinching Game 6 in Philadelphia, his usual seven-man rotation essentially became six. The bench had just five points on 2-of-7 shooting. Every starter logged at least 44 minutes except Hartenstein, who continued his platoon with Robinson. Robinson played 17:46, McBride just 9:02 and everybody else got a DNP.\n\nMeanwhile, ex-Knick Obi Toppin was the Pacers' leading scorer when they closed out Milwaukee with 21 points, while TJ McConnell added 20 on 7-of-9 shooting and a stellar plus-22. It was the first time since 2014 the Pacers won a series, and the bench will have to dominate for them to make it two in a row.\n\nEdge: Pacers overwhelmingly\n\nThibodeau has two Coach of the Year trophies, but this might be his finest job yet. He's gotten blood out of a stone with this team, earning the second seed in the East and the Knicks' first 50-win season since 2013 despite a long-term injury to Robinson and the absence of Randle.\n\nRick Carlisle has his own NBA Coach of the Year in 2002, and a title from nine years later that Thibodeau would love to emulate.\n\nEdge: Even\n\nIndiana is flying high after winning its first series in a decade, and adding Siakam's experience to Haliburton's leadership and playmaking is dangerous.\n\nBut scouts that The Post talked to just gushed over the Knicks' toughness, grit and selfless play.

It's the eighth-ever series between the two franchises. They have a long history of playoff battles.\n\nThis year, the clash in styles will make the series special. During the regular season, Indiana ranked second in offense while New York was known for their defense -- though the Knicks were a top-10 offense, too. The Pacers were second in pace while the Knicks were 30th. One team wanted to fly around and make the game about tempo. The other group hoped to slowly grind you down.\n\nNow, for a best-of-seven set, both teams will try to impose their style and earn a trip to the Eastern Conference Finals. \"One of the hardest playing teams in the league,\" Pacers center Myles Turner said of the Knicks. \"They work a lot on the offensive glass.\"\n\nThat battle on the boards will be one of the defining characteristics of the series. In the first round of the postseason, New York had the sixth-best offensive rating in the league, but they were 12th out of 16 teams in true shooting percentage. They ranked 11th in effective field goal percentage. A team that struggled to put in shots yet had such a great offense is unique, and it all came down to offensive rebounding.\n\nIn their series against the Philadelphia 76ers, the Knicks pulled in 37% of their own missed shots. New York and the MInnesota Timberwolves were the only teams over 32%. That made the Knicks offense hum, and their defense has always been terrific. They dispatched Joel Embiid and company in six games.\n\n\"It's no secret how hard they play. It's no secret how hard everybody crashes the glass,\" Pacers guard Tyrese Haliburton said of the Knicks. Indiana loves to play in transition, but they need to actually get rebounds to do so. Multiple Pacers players, as well as head coach Rick Carlisle, stressed the importance of hitting the glass to make sure the blue and gold can play their style.\n\n\"If we're rebounding and running, that can probably change for them. If they're killing us on the glass, that probably changes how much we run,\" Haliburton said. That battle could be one of the first things that leads to adjustments in the series.\n\nAnother could be the star guards. Haliburton and Jalen Brunson, two star floor generals who were teammates for Team USA last year, will be across from each other in this series, though they likely won't be defending one another. Andrew Nembhard or Aaron Nesmith will likely start the series with the Brunson assignment while OG Anunoby, Donte DiVincenzo, and Josh Hart could all spend time on Haliburton.\n\nHow effective either of the lead guards can be will be important early in the best-of-seven set. Forcing the opposing team to adjust their coverage -- like the Milwaukee Bucks had to do against Pascal Siakam in the first round against Indiana -- can be the difference in a series.\n\nHaliburton and Brunson still keep up with each other. They are friends, and they chatted on the phone just before the playoffs. But now, they are foes looking to push their teams into the conference finals.\n\nThe depth of the two teams could also end up being vital in the best-of-seven set. The Knicks are banged up and missing multiple important players due to injury, and they only had seven players suit up for Game 6 of their first round series. Indiana, meanwhile, had nine guys in their rotation and played even more in a blowout Game 6 victory.\n\nThat dynamic, especially given the speed of the Pacers, could be important. New York may need to dust off some deeper bench players, such as Alec Burks or Precious Achiuwa, to manage their minutes appropriately. But their top end talent is tremendous, and the Knicks starting five fits incredibly well together.\n\n\"We want to keep fresh bodies out there,\" Turner said of the battle with depth. Pacers wing Aaron Nesmith said it will be important for Indiana to play hard for 48 minutes. Depth could be a factor there, too.\n\n\"They play heavy minute guys, so we've just got to make sure that we be us and run. Use our depth,\" Nesmith said on Sunday.\n\nThese will all be defining characteristics of the series. If Brunson looks great again, the Knicks grab offensive rebounds, and their top-seven guys play well, then they will be tough to beat. Indiana will have to adjust and look for answers throughout the series.\n\nMeanwhile, should the Pacers get out in transition, run, and wear down a thin New York team, then the series could swing in their favor. Haliburton's excellence will be important along the way -- his stats weren't eye-popping in the first round, but he drew a ton of defensive attention and was an extremely effective player.\n\n\"It's a great team. They play really hard,\" Haliburton said of the Knicks. His star running mate in Siakam agreed, and he added that every game will be tough for 48 minutes.\n\nBetween the stylistic clash, history, and star power on both sides, this is set up to be an epic series. Both franchises have good reasons to believe they can win and move on, and their preparation will be key. It all begins on Monday in Madison Square Garden.\n\n\"We're looking forward to it. It's just a very intense matchup,\" Carlisle said. \"That's the simple truth about it.\"", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tony_east@si.com", "name": "Tony East", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoff_format", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Playoff format"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myles_Turner", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Myles Turner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_goal_percentage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Field goal percentage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O.G._Anunoby", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "O.G.

We're here to share our NBA odds series, make a Pacers-Knicks Game 1 prediction, and pick while showing you how to watch.\n\nThe Pacers upset the Milwaukee Bucks four games to two to seal their ticket to the Eastern Conference Semifinals. After losing 109-94 in Game 1, they dominated the Bucks 125-108 in Game 2 to send the series home with a split. The Pacers edged out the Bucks 121-118 in Game 3 in overtime and then routed them 126-113 in Game 4. However, they fell 115-92 in Game 5 in Milwaukee. But the Pacers ensured this series ended in six games when they destroyed the Bucks 120-98 in Game 6.\n\nThe Knicks defeated the Philadelphia 76ers four games to two to advance to the Eastern Conference Semifinals. They started the series by edging out the Sixers 111-104 in Game 1 and then winning a close Game 2 104-101 in the final seconds. But they fell 125-114 in Game 3 in Philadelphia. Yet, they snagged a 97-92 win in Game 4. The Knicks fell 112-106 in overtime in Game 5 at the Garden before closing out the series with a 118-115 win in Game 6, thanks to a game-winning three-pointer by Josh Hart with 24 seconds left.\n\nThe Pacers took the season series two games to one, including a 125-111 win at the Garden. Curiously, this will be the first playoff showdown between the two teams since 2013.\n\nThe Pacers' offense has been explosive throughout this series. Amazingly, all of their players have found ways to contribute on offense, helping Indiana advance to the second round.\n\nPascal Siakam has been the best player after averaging 22.3 points and 8.8 rebounds while shooting 54.3 percent from the floor. Thus, expect him to continue to be the top option for the Pacers to turn to, and likely will go head-to-head with former teammate OG Anunoby. Myles Turner averaged 19.2 points and 7.2 rebounds per game in the first round. Likewise, he shot 48.2 percent from the floor, including 43.9 percent from the triples. Turner will face off with Isaiah Hartenstein, which will provide a difficult assignment.\n\nTyrese Haliburton is still the face of the franchise. Significantly, he averaged 16 points and 9.3 assists per game in the series while shooting 43.5 percent from the hardwood. Everyone will have their eyes on the matchup between him and Jalen Brunson. Meanwhile, Andrew Nembhard is another scoring option after averaging 13.8 points per game while shooting 59.6 percent against the Bucks. Nembhard is the premiere shooter the Pacers rely on when they need another option.\n\nObi Toppin is a backup forward/center but is incredibly effective. In fact, he averaged 12.3 points per game while shooting 49.2 percent from the floor against Milwaukee. Aaron Nesmith will be intriguing to watch in this series. Significantly, he averaged 11 points per game while shooting 35.1 percent from the floor. Nesmith will go head-to-head with Josh Hart.\n\nThe Pacers will cover the spread if they can continue to stay hot on offense. Then, they need to find ways to slow down Brunson and this red-hot Knicks team.\n\nWhy The Knicks Could Cover The Spread/Win\n\nSpeaking of Brunson, he is ready for this matchup as he tries to lead the Knicks to the Eastern Conference Finals for the first time in over two years. Brunson averaged a ridiculous 35.5 points per game while shooting 42.9 percent in the series against the 76ers. Now, his battle against Haliburton should be a classic.\n\nHart averaged 16.8 points and 12.3 rebounds per game while shooting only 40.5 percent from the floor. Ultimately, the Knicks will need his shooting to improve and need him to contain Nesmith. Anunoby is probably the main reason why the Knicks have been able to thrive despite losing Julius Randle for the season. Also, he averaged 15 points per game while shooting 51.3 percent from the hardwood against the 76ers. His showdown with Siakam will be special, especially given their history as teammates.\n\nDonte DiVincenzo averaged 12 points per game against the 76ers. However, he also shot 36.4 percent from the floor. Miles McBride averaged 11.3 points per game while shooting 48.1 percent from the floor. Therefore, he gives the Knicks a great option off the bench when Brunson needs a break. Hartenstein averaged 10.3 points per game while shooting 60 percent from the field. But Turner will be a tough matchup for him.\n\nThe Knicks will cover the spread if they can win the board battle. Then, they need Brunson to continue to dominate.\n\nFinal Pacers-Knicks Game 1 Prediction & Pick\n\nThe Pacers took down one of the best teams in the association. Now, they face a team that has almost no weaknesses. Many believe the Knicks will dominate this game. However, they will have a tough time winning the boards against Siakam and Turner. That may keep this game closer. The only way the Knicks destroy the Pacers is if they can force multiple turnovers and Brunson dominates. We believe Brunson will dominate. Consequently, the Pacers will be able to keep up with them. Knicks win a close one, but the Pacers cover the spread.\n\nClick here for more betting news and predictions", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rb_hayek@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Rb Hayek", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "2022 NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Bucks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Bucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Points_per_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Points per game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Nembhard", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Nembhard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Hart", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Josh Hart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_76ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia 76ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison_Square_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Madison Square Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O.G._Anunoby", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "O.G.

The two seeded Knicks came into their series with the seven seeded Philadelphia 76ers as the underdog. Every game was close and the 76ers were close to forcing a game seven on Thursday night, but the Jalen Brunson-led Knicks prevailed and won on the road to advance. They have the NBA finals on their mind, but Draymond Green doesn't think that Brunson can lead them to a championship.\n\nThere's no denying the fact that Jalen Brunson has been extremely impressive in the playoffs so far. In the six games that the Knicks played against the 76ers, Brunson scored 22, 24, 39, 47, 40 and 41. He has been on fire and he put the Knicks on his back to get them past Philadelphia. However, Draymond Green doesn't think that this is sustainable.\n\n\"I don't hate the Knicks, however, I am honest and I'm not delusional, and a ball dominant Jalen Brunson ain't going to get you to the promised land I said,\" Green said on his podcast. \"I didn't say you weren't going to win a first round series, I didn't even say you weren't going to win the second round series, because if I'm honest I think you guys should easily win the second round series. So I didn't say that, I said you can't get to the promised land, and quite frankly if I'm honest, I still don't think you can. However, Jalen Brunson, as I told you already, has respect from me, he's earning more and more respect. Guy is getting it done every single night, had a couple bad games, bounced back. That's what I want to see when you're an up and coming guy and you're taking that next step in your career.\"\n\nBrunson and the Knicks proved a lot of people wrong in that first series, and they want to keep that up.\n\nKnicks fans can rally around the Draymond Green Show\n\nDraymond Green knows that his comments are getting under the skin of Knicks fans, and he has had a lot to say about those fans on his podcast recently. He thinks that they need something to rally around, and he is fine if they want to rally around his show.\n\n\"I'm not a Knicks hater, I'm just honest,\" Green said. \"I think a lot of Knicks fans are delusional and a lot of Knicks fans are nuts. We know Knicks fans are nuts, I don't need to go into it, I know they need something to rally around, and that's cool, like rally around the Draymond Green Show.\"\n\nThe Knicks are now up against the Indiana Pacers in their next series. This should end up being a better matchup for New York than the 76ers, and that's why Green said that he thinks they will win this series. The road is bound to get tougher in the conference finals, however.\n\nGame one between the Knicks and Pacers will get going on Monday night in New York at 7:30 ET. The Knicks are favored by 6.5 points.

The New York Knicks should get through the Indiana Pacers with ease compared to what they just went through against the Philadelphia 76ers in their first-round playoff series. The Knicks won 50 games in the regular season and secured the second seed in the Eastern Conference despite dealing with significant injuries to a number of starters. Still, it's the NBA playoffs and anything can happen, so let's make some real bold Knicks predictions for the 2024 Eastern Conference Semifinals vs. the Pacers.\n\nThey played three times, with the Pacers winning two of the three games. Their first matchup on December 30 was played without OG Anunoby and Precious Achiuwa, as well as RJ Barrett and Immanuel Quickley, as it took place just before all players involved in the trade joined their new teams. So, instead of being the first test for a re-tooled Knicks team, New York lost to the Pacers 140-126 with a depleted roster.\n\nThey also played on February 1, just five days after Anunoby and Julius Randle went down with respective injuries. Incidentally, the Knicks won that particular matchup, but it did nothing to prepare Indiana for the current iteration of the Knicks team.\n\nThe final matchup between New York and Indiana on February 10 was toward the beginning of a dark period for the Knicks in which they were not only without Randle and Anunoby, but they also had Isaiah Hartenstein and Jalen Brunson also miss time.\n\nSo, let's make some bold predictions regarding why New York should have a relatively easy path to their first conference finals in more than 20 years.\n\nOG Anunoby and Mitchell Robinson will trip up the Pacers' offense\n\nThere's a lot to be said for Anunoby and how he's impacted the Knicks. They're flat-out better after adding him. Including the playoffs, New York is 24-5 since adding Anunoby. And Anunoby was +353 through 23 regular season games. He has demonstrated incredible defensive versatility since joining the Knicks; however, he showed off a new level of offensive aggression in the first-round matchup with the 76ers.\n\nIndiana really doesn't know what they're in for with Anunoby. But there's someone else who's been missing in each of the Knicks-Pacers matchups who can impact the game about as much, Mitchell Robinson.\n\nRobinson was playing at a border-line All-Star level before injuring his ankle in December. He was leading the league in offensive rebounds (by a lot), and putting up 6.2 points and a career-high 10.3 total rebounds per game. Then he ended up missing three-and-a-half months due to ankle surgery.\n\nSince returning, and especially in the team's first-round matchup with the 76ers, Robinson has looked like an absolute monster. Despite playing only about 20 minutes per game and missing an entire game due to a separate ankle injury, Robinson was tied (with Josh Hart) for the NBA lead in offensive rebounds through the first round, grabbing 22 in total. He also collected seven blocks.\n\nThere's also the intangibles. Like his willingness to accept a reserve role when he was previously the team's starter. And his willingness to do the dirty work like fight to the floor for rebounds and bang with the bigger Joel Embiid. Despite having recently returned from a fairly long absence, Robinson was actually more successful than any other Knick at slowing down Embiid.\n\nTo be fair, Indiana played at the second-fastest pace in the NBA this season, whereas New York played at the slowest pace in the league. So, it would have been difficult for the Knicks to keep up, even if they were entirely healthy. But they're not. And losing Bojan Bogdanovic to an ankle injury that required surgery in the first round hurts even more given that the Knicks are currently down to a seven-man rotation.\n\nStill, the Pacers will struggle to score against the Knicks' stout defense. This one will end up looking a lot like the Knicks-76ers matchup, at least in terms of scoring. New York will hold the Pacers below their scoring average, and that will drive a lot of their success.\n\nKnicks rebounders will generate second-chance points, and lead to victories\n\nThe Knicks' rebounding prowess is nothing new. But examining team rebounding in the playoffs through only one round is tricky given that results are very much predicated on your opponent. But looking at the results of an 82-game season is most certainly statistically significant. And this is an area in which the Knicks have a major advantage. New York was the fifth-best rebounding team this season, while Indiana was 28th.\n\nFurthermore, New York led the league in offense rebounds this season, too. And that trend was highlighted time and again in their first-round playoff series. In other words, the Pacers will have to work diligently to keep New York from generating second (and third) possessions and dominating through second-chance buckets.\n\nBut keeping any team off the glass is easier said than done, especially when we're dealing with dawgs like Josh Hart, Hartenstein, and Robinson. The Knicks will win the rebounding battle against Indiana. And as we know, the team that won the rebounding battle in each of the Knicks' first-round games emerged victorious.\n\nUltimately, the Knicks are just a little too deep and physical. They rebound the ball and defend too well for Indiana to realistically win four of seven games -- but the Knicks must slow the pace of the game. The addition of Pascal Siakam was an interesting move at the 2024 trade deadline. But the Knicks are just a little too much for the Pacers to handle.

The Pacers, at 41-41, had finished 19 games behind the Knicks. And the Knicks seemed poised for a sweep at Market Square Arena, up 55-49 at the half. But early in the third, Reggie Miller began goading John Starks, and Starks was easily goad-able. With 8:48 left, Starks put the Knicks up two, Miller said something, and Starks headbutted him, drawing an ejection. The Pacers outscored the Knicks 59-34 the rest of the way.\n\n2. June 1, 1994: Pacers 93, Knicks 86\n\nThe Knicks led after three, 80-69, and seemed ready to cruise to a 3-2 lead in the Eastern Conference finals. Then Reggie went berserk, nailing 3 after 3, and to make matters more interesting, he got involved in some verbal jousting with Spike Lee, capped by Miller flashing the choke sign. And thus was a New York villain officially born.\n\n3. June 3, 1994: Knicks 98, Pacers 91\n\nTwo days later, with Lee sitting courtside in Indiana, the Knicks kept their season alive, assisted by Miller. Trailing by one late in the game, Miller had two free throws to give Indiana the lead and possibly shove the Knicks into the abyss. But he missed one of two, Derek Harper hit a huge 3, and the Knicks survived.\n\n4. June 5, 1994: Knicks 94, Pacers 90.\n\nTwo days after that, the Knicks trailed by four at the half and by 90-89 with 30 seconds to go when Starks drove, missed a layup, and Ewing followed with the dunk that put the Knicks in the NBA Finals for the first time in 21 years.\n\n5. May 7, 1995: Pacers 107, Knicks 105\n\nWe heard a whole lot about this one last week. Down by six with 18.7 seconds left, Miller hit a 3, recovered the ball after a bad throw-in, hurried back behind the line and buried another 3. Starks had a chance to end the madness but blew two free throws, and on the rebound Miller was fouled and made two free throws.\n\n6. May 17, 1995: Knicks 96, Pacers 95\n\nDown 3-1 and down a point after a late Byron Scott 3, Ewing drove to the basket, maybe (lol) took an extra step and at the buzzer saved the Knicks' season.\n\n7. May 19, 1995: Knicks 92, Pacers 82\n\nFor the second straight year, the Knicks ruined a Market Square clinching party, outscoring the Pacers 27-13 in a decisive third quarter to force Game 7\n\nThis was a house-money game for the Knicks, who'd already stunned the Heat in the first round and welcomed Ewing back after missing five months with a wrist injury. But the Knicks were one stop away from forging a 2-2 tie with the heavily favored Pacers in Game 4, up three late. Rik Smits went for a quick two and missed, Chris Mullin won a scramble for the rebound and ... well, of course Reggie hit a game-tying 3 to force OT. And that was that.\n\n10. June 1, 1999: Pacers 88, Knicks 86\n\nThe Knicks had already stolen Game 1, and Ewing lofted a good-looking 16-footer at the buzzer of this one that barely missed. What nobody knew in the moment was Ewing was playing on a damaged Achilles that would end his season and hinder the rest of his career.\n\n11. June 5, 1999: Knicks 92, Pacers 91\n\nThe Knicks trailed 91-88 with 5 seconds to go. Then Larry Johnson made a 3, was fouled, made the free throw and some of the 19,763 people who were there that day still don't hear right.\n\n12. June 11, 1999: Knicks 90, Pacers 82\n\nFor one of the few times, Miller came up small in a big spot, shooting 3-for-17 and 1-for-8 from 3 as the Garden serenaded him all across the fourth quarter, and the Knicks advanced to the NBA Finals.\n\n13. May 23, 2000: Knicks 91, Pacers 89\n\nThe last gasp of the Ewing Era Knicks came with Ewing sitting out Game 4 of the Eastern finals. Johnson dropped 25 and the Knicks tied the series 2-2\n\n14. June 2, 2000: Pacers 93, Knicks 80\n\nReggie's playoff swan song at MSG was a keeper, 34 points and 5-for-7 from 3 eliminating the Knicks in Game 6 after the teams entered the fourth tied at 62.\n\n15. May 18, 2013: Pacers 106, Knicks 99\n\nThe Knicks were up 92-90 when Carmelo Anthony rose for a poster dunk over Roy Hibbert. Instead it was Hibbert who did the posterizing, the Pacers scored 16 of the final 23 points and ousted the Knicks in Game 6 of the East semis.\n\nI am fully aware that you don't come here seeking advice on either gambling or ice hockey, which is probably wise, but I do think its remarkable that the Rangers are slight underdogs to the Hurricanes in this series.\n\nYep. Sure looks like it'll take Caitlin Clark a while to adjust to the WNBA. She scored 21 points and had five 3s in her exhibition debut, which is sure to make Diana Taurasi more than a little salty.\n\nGodspeed Danny Castellano, who covered the Mets for many years for the Newark Star-Ledger, who was an early mentor of mine when I started writing baseball in earnest, and who was among the gentlest souls I've ever met.\n\nI think Michael Douglas is just superb playing Benjamin Franklin, and it only took a few episodes before I stopped waiting for him to whisper to some haughty Frenchman that \"greed is good.\"\n\nRich Nash: I really don't think the Pacers have any idea what they are in for. Rick Carlisle is a terrific coach who will make things interesting. At the end of the day, they don't have enough to match up with this team. Knicks in five.\n\nVac: I just think it's a great time to be alive, with so many New Yorkers not necessarily waiting for the sky to fall. (Yet.)\n\nJoe Nicoletti: Joel Embiid is at the top of the list of all-time bigs for shooting and scoring for three quarters. Unlike Russell, Reed, Ewing, Olajuwon and Jokic, he gets nowhere near lists that include integrity, leadership and effort.\n\nVac: The 76ers need Embiid to commit to getting fit this summer. They don't need him biding his time with Team USA. And should tell him that.\n\n@JohnWil33368589: I think it's pretty obvious that if Embiid wasn't hurt, the Sixers sweep. The Knicks are better without Randle and starting both Hart and OG.\n\n@MikeVacc: I suppose it will come as little surprise to you, dear readers, that his X bio defines him thusly: \"Philly sports diehard.\"\n\nStewart Summers: The Yankees hired a former MIT physicist to join their analytics department.

Indiana led the NBA with 123.3 points per game (PPG) in the regular season and haven't slowed down in the playoffs -- averaging 113 PPG in the first round -- good for second best behind only the Minnesota Timberwolves.\n\nThey're led by a trio of Tyrese Haliburton, Pascal Siakam and Myles Turner, all who scored 16 PPG or more this season and continue to be the focal points so far this postseason.\n\nIn their four wins against the Milwaukee Bucks, the Pacers scored 120 or more points in each of them and averaged 123 PPG.\n\nDefensive advantage: Knicks\n\nThe other side of the court is clearly dominated by the Knicks.\n\nNew York was arguably the best defensive unit in the entire regular season.\n\nIn three of their four wins versus the Sixers in the first round, the Knicks allowed more than 104 points just once -- which didn't come until Game 6.\n\nDating back to the regular season, the Knicks surrendered the second-fewest points (108.2 PPG), behind only the Minnesota Timberwolves.\n\nNew York has proven under head coach Tom Thibodeau that he can put together a unit that has a stranglehold even against the best offenses in the NBA.\n\nKnicks-Pacers Game 1 info: When is Knicks vs. Pacers Game 1? Ticket prices, how to watch conference semifinals\n\nKnicks vs. Pacers series prediction\n\nIn the regular season, the Pacers took two of three games, including putting up 125 and 140 points respectively in those two matchups.\n\nIn the Knicks' lone win on Feb. 1, they limited Indiana to 105 points and held the aforementioned Pacers' trio (Haliburton, Siakam and Turner) to just 45 total points between the three of them.\n\nThe one difference maker in this series could be O.G. Anunoby. New York did not have the defensive minded first guard during any of the three matchups between these two franchises in the regular season.\n\nThis series will ultimately come down to can the Pacers sustain enough offensive success over a seven-game series against their biggest defensive challenge so far?\n\nThe answer for that is no. The Knicks will ultimately be able to limit this high-powered Indiana offense just enough, moving on to their first conference final appearance in 24 years.", "source": {"uri": "mycentraljersey.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MyCentralJersey.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_76ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia 76ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myles_Turner", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Myles Turner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Bucks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Bucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_Siakam", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pascal Siakam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O.G._Anunoby", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "O.G.

They've engaged in heated battles dating back to the Reggie Miller episodes and to the Roy Hibbert block of Carmelo Anthony that ended the 2013 Knicks title hopes. This latest version doesn't carry the rivalry and head-butting history, but presents an interesting contrast in styles.\n\nTyrese Haliburton was being mentioned in MVP conversations in the first half of the season and deservedly so, putting up crazy numbers while leading the Pacers and orchestrating a high-scoring offensive attack. But after being sidelined with a hamstring strain Jan. 8 -- missing 10 of the next 11 games -- he has seen his numbers plummet. He was averaging 23.8 points, 12.5 assists and 2.5 turnovers before the injury -- shooting 40.3% from beyond the arc. In 35 games after returning he averaged 16.8 points and 9.3 assists -- shooting 32.4% from long range. And in the six playoff games against Milwaukee he averaged 16 points, 9.3 assists, 2.7 turnovers and shot just 29.6% from three. If the Knicks can hold him near those numbers maybe Wally Szczerbiak won't hear as many reminders of his \"fake wannabe All-Star\" assessment from last season.\n\nThe attempt to stifle Haliburton will be, as Tom Thibodeau often repeats, a team job. But one difference from the three meetings in the regular season is that OG Anunoby was not with the Knicks for any of the three games against Indiana in the regular season. Anunoby, an elite on and off ball defender, did face Haliburton once this season while he was with Toronto before being traded to New York, and in nine minutes of serving as the primary defender against him, Haliburton had seven points and one assist.\n\nObi Toppin was one of the fan favorites during his time in New York after being drafted No. 8 overall by the current front office in 2020. Toppin came with raw athleticism and dunking ability to light up the Garden. But parked behind Julius Randle in the rotation -- and looking for his next contract after this season -- the Knicks moved him out last summer. And what he has settled into is a similar role, coming off the bench, averaging 10.3 points per game. But he did raise his shooting numbers across the board, converting on 40.3% from beyond the arc while playing in all 82 games, and added a 21-point effort off the bench in Game 6 to knock out the Bucks. So does he get out on the break against New York? Or do the Knicks know him better than anyone and stop his run-outs and open looks?\n\nOnce Bojan Bogdanovic suffered a season-ending injury just 71 seconds into his Game 4 appearance against Philadelphia, the Knicks only played seven players the remainder of the series. Do the Knicks keep that tight rotation in place against the Pacers, who will try to run them up and down the floor with their fast-paced attack? Three things worth considering -- first, Precious Achiuwa may be a useful piece again against Indiana so adding him makes sense. Then, consider that although the Pacers utilized 13 players in the opening round, only eight were a regular part of the rotation (the next most used player appeared in four games totaling 24 minutes). And finally, the fast pace is just not as fast in the postseason. Actually, add a fourth factor to this: The Knicks players who already are playing 48 minutes -- or 53 in the case of Josh Hart in Game 5 against Philly -- have shown no sign of fatigue.\n\nIt's a pretty good bet that Jalen Brunson is going to do what he does -- his postseason numbers against Miami last season and Philadelphia in the first round (as well as his work in Dallas) are evidence that defenses focusing in on him aren't going to shut him down. But without Julius Randle, the Knicks could use a reliable second option every night and that didn't happen in the first round. At times, Josh Hart delivered. Other times, Donte DiVincenzo broke out. The Pacers defense is not their strong suit so open shots will be there. Whether it's one of those two or OG Anunoby, they must provide offensive y help for Brunson to keep up with Indiana's offense.", "source": {"uri": "newsday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsday"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turnover_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Turnover (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O.G._Anunoby", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "O.G.

Indiana won't be an easy out", "body": "The Eastern Conference's No. 2 seed, the New York Knicks (50-32), will take on the sixth-seeded Indiana Pacers (47-35) in the 2024 Eastern Conference semifinals. The two franchises last met in the postseason in 2013, when the Pacers eliminated the Knicks in a six-game series perhaps best known for a towering block that now lives in places of prominence in Roy Hibbert's abode.\n\nA couple of decades before that, New York and Indiana used to meet in the playoffs all the time. This guy named Reggie showed up a lot. They made a documentary about it.\n\nBy sticking to the script.\n\nThe Knicks won 50 games for the first time in 11 years by adhering to a simple formula: control the offensive glass, limit turnovers and turn 50-50 balls into 70-30 balls through the application of relentless physicality. And, when you need a bucket, let Jalen Brunson cook.\n\nThat game plan earned them the East's No. 2 spot, and with it, a matchup against Joel Embiid, Tyrese Maxey and the 76ers -- not exactly your typical No. 7 seed. The result was a first-round classic that had everything: superstar performances, dramatic last-second comebacks, flagrant fouls, hostile takeovers, chicken promotions, you name it.\n\nAfter 13 grueling days, the Round 1 slugfest ended with New York's hand raised, outpacing Philly by one measly point over the span of six games. How'd the Knicks do it? Well, there's a simple formula.\n\nIt's a simple formula. When it's gotten you this far, it's one worth sticking to.\n\nBy taking advantage of a golden opportunity.\n\nThe Pacers don't have to apologize for Giannis Antetokounmpo straining his calf two weeks before the postseason, or Damian Lillard straining his Achilles early in his third playoff game as a Buck. You can only play the competition in front of you, and when Milwaukee began to wobble -- well, more than it already had during its under-.500 run under Doc Rivers -- then Rick Carlisle's Pacers pounced, with aggressive full-court defensive pressure and a many-hands-make-light-work approach on the other end.\n\nA Milwaukee defense that was mediocre-at-best all season with Giannis didn't have a prayer of bottling up Indiana without him. The Pacers pressed their advantage, topping 30 assists and 120 points four times in six games -- they won all four -- en route to scoring a scorching 121.7 points per 100 possessions in the series, right in line with their No. 2 regular-season mark.\n\nThe Pacers took different paths to arrive at those crooked numbers. Early in the series, with Milwaukee intent on pressuring Haliburton so that he couldn't operate with impunity, Pascal Siakam showed why Indiana swung so hard for him before the trade deadline, scoring 73 points on 48 shots in the first two games -- a walking mismatch against a Milwaukee team that, with Antetokounmpo in street clothes, didn't have anybody capable of handling him straight up.\n\nWhen the Bucks shifted tactics, sending more attention and double-teams Siakam's way, the Pacers returned the favor by raining fire. In Game 4, pick-and-pop monster Myles Turner (7-for-9 from deep) and a finally-breaking-loose Haliburton (5-for-12) led the charge to a franchise-playoff-record 22 3-pointers:\n\nThe pathway wasn't always pretty, though. Indiana blew a 19-point lead in the second half of Game 3; saw Khris Middleton, balky ankle and all, hit an absurd triple to force overtime; and needed a Haliburton game-winner to escape with a victory and retain the home-court advantage they'd stolen in Game 2:\n\nWith a chance to close it out in five, they let a Bucks team without Antetokounmpo or Lillard shoot 52% from the floor, rebound more than 36% of their own misses, and get the previously free-flowing Pacers stuck in the mud with aggressive switching at the point of attack and cross-matches (like Middleton guarding Turner while goliath center Brook Lopez shifted over to swingman Aaron Nesmith). The result: a Game 5 stinker in which Indiana trailed by 20-plus for much of the second half.\n\nIt proved to be a detour rather than a derailment, though. Despite the return of Lillard from his Achilles strain, the Pacers took control of Game 6 with a 21-6 run midway through the first quarter and never looked back, riding their superior depth -- six Pacers in double figures, led by a combined 41 points off the bench from Obi Toppin and TJ McConnell -- to the franchise's first playoff series win in a decade ... and a date with their old friends from New York.\n\nThe Pacers won the season series, 2-1, though roster changes and injury absences muddle the takeaways from those three contests a fair bit.\n\nThe Knicks didn't have OG Anunoby or Mitchell Robinson in any of the three contests. Haliburton was playing on a minutes restriction after coming off of a strained hamstring when the Knicks got their lone win; he didn't play in the fourth quarter of that game. Evan Fournier was involved; Taj Gibson played rotation minutes in two games, and even started one, alongside Precious Achiuwa, in a frontline that's got a bit less juice than the one the Knicks are likely to run out in Round 2.\n\nIn the last days of 2023, the Pacers hung 140 on the Knicks in Indianapolis. Four Pacers topped 20 points, headlined by a 22-point, 23-assist performance by Haliburton -- a new career high in helpers for the NBA's top assist man:\n\nThe two teams faced off twice between their respective big-swing trades with Toronto and the All-Star break, with Brunson popping for 40 in a Knicks win on Feb. 1 ...\n\n... and Haliburton getting the upper hand against an injury-wracked Knicks squad 10 days later, highlighted by some audacious shot creation at MSG:\n\nThat sort of creativity and high-octane offensive efficiency gave New York massive problems during the regular season: Indiana scored a scorching 134.8 points per 100 possessions against the Knicks with Haliburton on the floor. If Tom Thibodeau and Co. can't find a way to put some restrictor plates on Indiana's All-Star point guard, the hot-rod Pacers could wind up running roughshod over the favorites.\n\n(Speaking of restrictor plates and running: Which team controls the tempo should be one of this series' biggest bellwethers. Haliburton's Pacers were second in the NBA in offensive possessions per 48 minutes this season, and had the league's lowest average time to shot, according to Inpredictable; Indy looks to launch quick. Brunson's Knicks, on the other hand: dead last in both categories. If the Pacers can put the show on speed, a Knicks squad that really only went seven-deep in Round 1 after Bojan Bogdanovi\u0107's injury might need more reinforcements to keep up. Paging Alec Burks?)\n\nAnunoby vs. ... wait, who is he going to guard?\n\nI know, I know: I should probably just say, \"Brunson vs. Haliburton: Battle of the All-Star Point Guards!\" But I think that where Thibodeau decides to station his top perimeter destroyer is maybe the most interesting wrinkle on the board at the start of this series.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, the Knicks didn't have Anunoby in any of the three regular-season matchups. Considering he played 250 of a possible 293 minutes in Round 1, it's a pretty good bet that he'll also play an outsized role in Round 2. But where?\n\nAnunoby opened the Philly series checking Tyrese Maxey, who shot just 6-for-16 when they were matched up, but had some trouble containing the lightning-quick Sixers lead guard (as did basically every Knick). Later, Thibodeau switched the matchups, sliding Donte DiVincenzo onto Maxey and moving Anunoby over to lower-usage, lower-wattage wings like Tobias Harris and Kelly Oubre Jr. -- assignments that allowed him to roam as a help defender and secondary rim protector, which proved really disruptive to Philly's offense: The Sixers shot 11-for-30 (36.7%) inside of 6 feet when Anunoby was the nearest defender, according to NBA.com's shot tracking data, and just 6-for-18 when he contested at the basket, according to Second Spectrum.\n\nIf we assume that Brunson opens on Andrew Nembhard and center Isaiah Hartenstein takes opposite number Myles Turner, that leaves the three wing spots -- Hart, DiVincenzo and Anunoby -- to slot in. Does Thibodeau again start with OG as the tip of the spear aimed at the opponent's most dangerous on-ball threat -- in this case, Haliburton, who's bigger than Maxey and not as speedy, with his quicks dampened at least a bit from their early-season peak by the hamstring issue? Or does he try to match size-for-size, lining Anunoby up against his old Raptors teammate Siakam in hopes of preventing the kind of hot start to the series for Siakam that wound up bedeviling the Bucks?\n\nThe Knicks need to throw some sand in the gears of the Pacers' smooth-operating offensive machine -- or, better yet, just smash it. OG is his best chance of doing it; it'll be interesting to see which assignment he thinks gives New York the best chance of putting great big dents into Indiana's offense.\n\nMyles Turner\n\nWe just saw Turner absolutely torch the Bucks' drop coverage, shooting 18-for-41 (43.9%) from 3-point range in the six-game victory over Milwaukee, headlined by his 7-for-9 performance in Game 4. Know who Turner was playing the first time he made seven triples in a game?\n\nYou guessed it:\n\nWhile today's Knicks are not the Knicks of three years ago, they do play two centers -- Hartenstein and Mitchell Robinson -- whom Thibodeau prefers to deploy as rim protectors first, second and third. And when you station your bigs deep in the paint, you leave yourself open to getting picked apart by the pick-and-pop; in a related story, Turner averaged 18.7 points in 28.6 minutes per game against the Knicks this season, shooting 21-for-32 (65.6%) from the floor and 8-for-10 from 3-point range.\n\nIf Turner gets a couple to go early, will Thibodeau continue to stick with the drop and live with the Pacers prioritizing those above-the-break launches? If not, how will he decide to switch it up -- by hard-rotating a third defender into the play off the wing to try to run Turner off the line, by cross-matching to put a wing on Turner and his center on someone like Nesmith? Could this be an opportunity to dust off the more switchable and athletic Precious Achiuwa, who's relegated to third center duty with Robinson healthy, but who shined when pressed into duty against Embiid in Round 1?\n\nWhatever answers Thibodeau test-drives, Turner's got the skillset to make the Knicks pay, and he's playing with a ton of confidence. If he gets hot and opens the floor up for Haliburton, Nembhard, T.J. McConnell and the rest of Indiana's penetrators, New York could have an awfully tough time cooling things down.\n\nKnicks in 7\n\nI think those predicting a quick Knicks victory are underestimating just how severe a set of problems this Indiana offense -- replete with shooters, adept at slamming the pedal to the metal, with an all-world orchestrator and multiple other high-quality complementary ball-handlers -- might be able to create for New York. But I do buy the argument that, in the styles-make-fights setting of a playoff series, the overwhelming physicality that the Knicks bring to bear -- especially now that Anunoby and Robinson are in the fold, which they weren't during the regular-season series -- will wind up grinding the glitter off of Indiana's bright young things, and land New York in the Eastern Conference finals for the first time since 2000.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O.G._Anunoby", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "O.G.

Will New York contain Tyrese Haliburton?", "body": "The New York Knicks and Indiana Pacers are ready to play each other in a playoff series for the first time since 2013. What was a regular occurrence in the '90s, when these two squads faced off in six postseason series over eight years, is happening again.\n\nThis one will be fun.\n\nThe Pacers, which downed the Milwaukee Bucks 4-2 in Round 1, are hoping to move onto the conference finals for the first time since 2014. The Knicks, which just beat the Philadelphia 76ers in six games, haven't advanced that far since 2000, when they played -- not so shockingly -- the Pacers, who beat them to move onto the finals.\n\nThese two teams already have epic playoff games: Reggie Miller's eight points in 8.9 seconds, the finger roll and the Roy Hibbert block.\n\nKnicks beat writer Fred Katz connected with Bucks beat reporter Eric Nehm, who will be filling in on Pacers coverage during this series, to discuss the upcoming matchup.\n\nAre the Knicks still bruised after they just exchanged blows with the 76ers for two weeks straight? Can the Pacers slow Jalen Brunson? Can the Knicks bother Tyrese Haliburton?\n\nHow do the Knicks defend the Haliburton-Myles Turner pick-and-roll? Who does OG Anunoby guard?\n\nThis is slow versus fast, duress versus finesse, one team that wants to beat its opponent down facing another that wants to elude every tag.\n\nWhat intrigues you most during this series?\n\nNehm: Typically, this is where I would write something nerdy about the third-quarter defensive rotations that the Pacers made against the Bucks in Game 4, but we'll have time to get into the weeds throughout the rest of this series. For me, this all starts with Haliburton.\n\nHaliburton did what he needed to do against the Bucks in the first round.\n\nWith the series tied 1-1 and 6.7 seconds remaining in overtime, the 24-year-old point guard hit Patrick Beverley with two crossovers, got into the lane and hit a floater, plus the foul, to give the Pacers a three-point lead with 1.6 seconds remaining.\n\nEventually, the Pacers won that game because of Haliburton's heroics and with Damian Lillard missing the next two games, that clutch bucket at the end of Game 3 gave the Pacers the advantage they would need to take the whole series. Without Haliburton stepping up in that moment, the Pacers might have dropped that game and the series could have gone much differently.\n\nInsanely cool, clutch playoff moment aside, Haliburton was not at his peak in the first round against the Bucks.\n\nWithout Giannis Antetokounmpo, the Bucks cannot be described as a good defensive team. They were terrible at the point of attack all season long, but Bucks coach Doc Rivers deserves credit for putting together a defensive plan that made Haliburton uncomfortable. The hamstring injury that sidelined Haliburton during the regular season and the back spasms he's been dealing with throughout the playoffs are currently affecting his game.\n\nAgainst the Bucks, Haliburton put up 16.0 points and 9.3 assists per game, down from 20.1 points and 10.9 assists per game during the regular season. With 56 assists and 16 turnovers, his assist-to-turnover ratio was 3.5 against the Bucks as opposed to 4.7 during the regular season.\n\nHaliburton shot 43.5 percent from the field, including just 29.6 percent from behind the 3-point line. His struggles offensively could've just been a function of seeing playoff defense for the first time, but if the Pacers want a chance to upset the Knicks in this series, they are going to need more from Haliburton.\n\nKatz: It's funny you mention Haliburton's game winner in Game 3 because that play was a microcosm of what makes the Pacers great when they're at their best.\n\nNo one moves in transition like this team. The Pacers manufacture transition opportunities other teams would never even consider. They run after turnovers and after grabbing defensive rebounds, which the Knicks try, too. But they don't stop there.\n\nIf Brunson hits a layup in the half court but falls in the process, the Pacers will speed the other way. They play at the fastest pace in the league after allowing made baskets, according to inpredictable.com. They are true to their name.\n\nThe game winner encapsulated that beautifully.\n\nThe play design almost mimicked a transition runway for Haliburton, with the inbounds pass setting him up 70 feet from the basket with a sprinting start and a screen at around half court. Instead of slithering through traffic, Haliburton burst through space. And he floated in an and-1.\n\nThe Knicks better be aware. This series won't move with the same brutish flow as the one against the 76ers. Instead, get ready to run and match up in transition time after time. If the Pacers notice a mismatch, they will exploit it.\n\nI'm curious how many players Knicks head coach Tom Thibodeau uses because of this. He shrunk the rotation to seven after Bojan Bogdanovi\u0107 went down for the season with a foot injury that required surgery.\n\nIn the second half of Game 6 against Philadelphia, he essentially played six guys, barely using Miles \"Deuce\" McBride. Can that work against a team that makes you run like the Pacers do? Could Josh Hart, who rested for a total of 15 minutes in six games against Philly, replicate his time on the court against a blazing squad like Indiana's?\n\nOr does Thibodeau dust off Precious Achiuwa and/or Alec Burks?\n\nBut that's not what I will ask you about, because I have another more intriguing topic.\n\nWe've discussed the Pacers' high-powered point guard, but the Knicks have one. And I'm not sure what Indiana is supposed to do against him in the half court.\n\nPart of the reason the 76ers had relative success against Brunson was because of all the long defenders they tossed his way -- along with a top-notch game plan that Brunson eventually exploited. Indiana has capable defensive options to stick on him. Aaron Nesmith and Andrew Nembhard fight hard, and Nesmith has a 6-foot-10 wingspan. T.J. McConnell remains one of the league's most irritating creatures.\n\nBut none of them boast the size of Kelly Oubre Jr. or Nicolas Batum.\n\nThe Sixers guarded Brunson well, and he still dropped 39-plus points in each of the final four games of the series.\n\nHow do you see the Pacers handling him? And how do you see Brunson responding?\n\nNehm: I think your assessment is correct. Nembhard, Nesmith and McConnell feel like the three Pacers that will see the most time on Brunson to start the series.\n\nDespite their differences in size, all three of them attack defense the same way under Rick Carlisle in Indiana. All three players will crowd Brunson as much as possible with Nembhard and McConnell likely picking him up with full-court pressure.\n\nThe Pacers spent the series against Milwaukee pressing its ballhandlers full court. And they'll likely start in a basic drop-and-chase, pick-and-roll coverage, but the Pacers guards are good at remaining connected and physical as they get over the top of screens, so they will make Brunson work.\n\nWhile Brunson does not do much foul grifting, it will be interesting to see if he can draw any fouls on Nembhard in the moments in which the Pacers guard is a bit overzealous with his physicality. Damian Lillard caught Nembhard multiple times in the first round when Nembhard was just way too close to him as he rose for a jump shot.\n\nThe Pacers were a bad defensive team the entire season, and they posted the fifth-worst defensive rating of the first round. Antetokounmpo didn't play a second for the Bucks, Damian Lillard and Khris Middleton played through injuries and Pat Connaughton, Pat Beverley and Andre Jackson Jr. were bringing up the ball at various times throughout the series. Brunson should respond to that by doing what he always does and dissecting it with a crafty set of pivots and step-throughs, plus stepback and pull-up jumpers.\n\nKatz: That could be a key in this series. The Pacers allowed more shots in the paint than any other team during the regular season. They will funnel the ball there, but Brunson loves to pull up eight or 10 feet short of the rim and drop in touch shots.\n\nThere's a world where he feasts on those against the Pacers, and Indiana has to shift to a trap just to get the ball out of his hands.\n\nNehm: We texted briefly about Thibodeau doing his best to search out Haliburton and force the Pacers star to play defense. Thibodeau will make sure Haliburton works defensively, but after their first-round series against the Bucks, I'm not sure the Knicks will need to work that deep into their playbook to get what they want offensively against the Pacers.\n\nThat isn't to say we won't see that as the series goes on, but the Knicks may come out in their base offensive sets and immediately find success against this Pacers team defensively.\n\nKatz: The Pacers just need to make sure the Knicks don't scramble their defense -- and not just because they want to force difficult shots. If they get mismatched in transition or New York can create switches and then attack, it will hurt Indiana on the boards, too.\n\nThe rebounding may be the battle to watch in this series.\n\nThe Pacers finished the regular season 26th in defensive rebound rate. That won't cut it against the Knicks, which were the best offensive-rebounding squad in the league and only got better during the Sixers series.\n\nThey wrecked Philadelphia, a big, physical team, on the glass for six games. Encourage Indiana's bigs to stray from the paint more than they prefer, and between Hartenstein, Robinson and Hart, the Knicks could wreak havoc on the glass.\n\nThe time to focus on the boards most will be with the second unit. The Pacers love playing a reserve lineup that includes Siakam and Obi Toppin as their two bigs, which sounds like a dream to the former contingent of Knicks diehards who just wanted to see Toppin in small-ball units with Julius Randle during his time in New York.\n\nThe Pacers speed up the game in those moments. But the man they may have to fight down low, Robinson, is one of the league's best offensive rebounders.\n\nIf the Knicks destroy the rebounding battle, they will put themselves in good shape to win the series. But Eric, the Pacers were a 47-win team with an elite offense for a reason.\n\nIf I told you Indiana were to win this series, who or what would you say is the major swing factor?\n\nNehm: The 3-point variance can always be a major swing piece in any small sample, so that is where I will turn for the Pacers to spring an upset on the No. 2-seeded Knicks.\n\nThe Pacers were at their best against the Bucks in the first round when Myles Turner put their drop pick-and-roll coverage into a bind with his 3-point shooting. In Games 2-4 of the series, Turner hit 14 of 25 3-point attempts (56 percent) and even knocked down a career single-game high of seven 3s in the Pacers' 126-113 Game 4 win in Indianapolis. It's no coincidence that the Pacers won all three of those games.\n\nIf Turner can spread the floor and get some open catch-and-shoot 3-point looks against the Knicks, that could play a major role in the series and make the Knicks change some things up defensively. If they change covers on Turner, maybe that allows for more space for Pascal Siakam or Haliburton and then all of a sudden, the series could look very different.\n\nThat same idea could be applied to any of the Pacers' 3-point shooters, but Turner looks like the biggest threat to go off against the Knicks.\n\nKatz: The Pacers are exhausting. There will be at least one game, maybe more, that morphs into a track meet and hands Indiana a victory. I just am not confident that will happen four times.\n\nSo for now, I'm picking the Knicks. They own home-court advantage. They have the best player in the series in Brunson, who just averaged 35.5 points during the six games against the Sixers -- and that was after struggling for the first two games. I fear for the Pacers on the boards. One weapon Indiana has not seen from New York all season could sway the advantage even more toward the Knicks.\n\nAnunoby played in none of the three games against the Pacers this season. He's the Knicks' defensive game-changer.\n\nThe Pacers are a joy to watch. They play fast and together. Their cutting and ball movement are a thing of beauty. But the Knicks play with a similar cohesion.\n\nNew York in six.\n\nNehm: I'll be honest, I wish we were getting this series with the pre-hamstring injury version of Haliburton. He just hasn't been the same player since that injury and his recent struggles with back spasms have not made things any easier. He was just such a marvelous heliocentric engine at the start of the season and is not quite as dynamic now.\n\nAgainst a well-coached team that plays as hard as the Knicks, the Pacers would need the best version of Haliburton to pull off another win. I think Siakam can help steady the Pacers in this series, just as he did throughout the first round against the Bucks, but I don't think the Pacers have enough to get past the Knicks. I will take the Knicks in five games.", "source": {"uri": "theathletic.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Athletic"}, "authors": [{"uri": "eric_nehm@theathletic.com", "name": "Eric Nehm", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "fred_katz@theathletic.com", "name": "Fred Katz", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Nembhard", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Nembhard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Bucks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Bucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_76ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia 76ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turnover_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Turnover (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Thibodeau", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tom Thibodeau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pick_and_roll", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pick and roll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damian_Lillard", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Damian Lillard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finger_roll", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Finger roll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Beverley", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Beverley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giannis_Antetokounmpo", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Giannis Antetokounmpo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball_positions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball positions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Brunson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reggie_Miller", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reggie Miller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Hibbert", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Roy Hibbert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doc_Rivers", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Doc Rivers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Nesmith", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Nesmith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precious_Achiuwa", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Precious Achiuwa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Hart", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Josh Hart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_Oubre_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kelly Oubre Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._J._McConnell", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "T.

Tom Thibodeau's squad wants to play a slow and physical game reminiscent of the past. Rick Carlisle's squad wants to run wild, pushing the pace on every possession.\n\nThere is plenty of history behind these two franchises meeting for the eighth time in the NBA Playoffs. The rivalry might be most remembered for the iconic picture of Miller's choking signal toward renowned film director and Knicks superfan Spike Lee, but there is much more to recall.\n\nBefore those contrasting play styles clash, take a trip down memory lane on a renewed rivalry.\n\nMORE: Knicks vs. Pacers prediction: Can Indy handle New York's physicality?\n\nThe 2024 Eastern Conference Semifinals will be the eighth time the Knicks and Pacers have faced off in the playoffs.\n\nIn the 90s, it felt inevitable that these two teams would collide in the postseason. New York and Indiana met in the playoffs six times in eight years from 1993 to 2000, then again in 2013.\n\nThey have had one first-round series, three (soon to be four) Eastern Conference Semifinals series and three Eastern Conference Finals series.\n\nTheir most recent playoff matchup was in the 2013 Eastern Conference Semifinals, where Paul George's Pacers took down Carmelo Anthony's Knicks in six games.\n\nThe Pacers have won four head-to-head playoff series to the Knicks' three.\n\nIn total, the Pacers have beaten the Knicks in 22 playoff games while New York has beaten Indiana 19 times.\n\nThe rivalry started with a headbutt.\n\nThe No. 1 seed Knicks were matched up with the No. 8 seed Pacers and New York was expected to take care of business with ease. The Knicks took the first two games of the series at Madison Square Garden, and Starks rubbed Miller the wrong way by snubbing his handshake after Game 2.\n\nIn Game 3, Miller came out firing, exploding for a game-high 36 points to lead the Pacers to a win. His constant trash talk toward Starks ignited a fire, as Starks headbutted Miller in the third quarter and got ejected from the game.\n\nThe 1994 Eastern Conference Finals was tied 2-2, setting the stage for a pivotal Game 5 at Madison Square Garden. The Knicks held a commanding 12-point lead going into the fourth quarter, but Miller wasn't going down easy.\n\nThe sharpshooter caught fire with 25 points in the final frame, finishing with 31 points to lead the Pacers to an improbable comeback to steal Game 5.\n\nDuring his scoring outburst, Miller delivered an iconic choking sign toward Knicks superfan Lee that is engraved in NBA history.\n\nWhat people might forget is that the Knicks went on to win Games 6 and 7, bouncing Miller and the Pacers from the playoffs to reach the NBA Finals.\n\nFamiliar foes at this point, the Knicks and Pacers met in the playoffs for the third consecutive year in the 1995 East Semis. Miller was quick to deliver another memorable moment at Madison Square Garden, bringing Indiana back from the dead in Game 1.\n\nNew York led by six points with 18.7 seconds remaining when Miller drained a clutch 3-pointer to make it a one-possession game. Knicks' Anthony Mason tried to inbound the ball to Greg Anthony, but Anthony fell forward and the ball ended up right in Miller's hands.\n\nThe 3-point sniper stepped beyond the arc and buried a game-tying 3 with 13.2 seconds left. Miller's teammate, Sam Mitchell, did not realize the score and intentionally fouled John Starks.\n\nStarks, shockingly, missed both free throws and Ewing missed the putback. Miller rebounded Ewing's miss and was fouled, calmly stepping to the line to sink both freebies to win the game.\n\nThe Pacers went on to win the series in seven games.\n\nThe Knicks and Pacers met again in the 1999 Eastern Conference Finals and the series was tied 1-1 going into Game 3. New York was without star forward Ewing after he injured his Achilles in Game 2, but Larry Johnson stepped up.\n\nIndiana led 91-88 with 11.9 seconds remaining, and the Knicks had the ball out of a timeout. Johnson confidently stepped into a 3-pointer, burying the shot while getting fouled by Pacers forward Antonio Davis.\n\nJohnson hit the free throw to complete the four-point play and the Knicks won the game.\n\nNew York went on to win the series in six games and advance to the NBA Finals.", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sporting News"}, "authors": [],

Despite battling constant injury woes and the heartbreaking loss of Julius Randle for the entirety of the campaign, they fought tooth and nail to acquire the second seed in the East.\n\nThey carried the tenacity into the 2024 playoffs, beating the Philadelphia 76ers 4-2 to reach the second round for a second consecutive year (a feat that took place for the first time since 2000). Despite the air of optimism surrounding Tom Thibodeau's team, Draymond Green cast doubts over their ability to reach the 'promised land,' by simply relying on Jalen Brunson, whose impact on games hinges on having the ball in his hands.\n\n\"A lot of Knicks fans are making it trying to make it out to be, 'Draymond don't like us.' I don't hate the Knicks. However, I am honest and I'm not delusional. A ball-dominant Jalen Brunson ain't gonna get you to the promised land, I said. I didn't say you were going to win the first-round series,\" Green said on his podcast. \"If I'm honest, you guys are easily going to win the second-round series. I said you can't get to the promised land. Quite frankly, if I'm honest, I still don't think you can.\"\n\nDray has a ton of respect for JB\n\nListening to Green's perspective, many could've argued that he was potentially trying to downplay Brunson's series-best average of 35.5 points against the Sixers. That is why the four-time NBA Champ made sure to applaud JB's ability to take over in clutch situations, admitting how his respect for the 6'2\" point guard has only increased.\n\nGreen particularly highlighted Brunson's ability to bounce back after tough games. This was evident when, despite the Knicks leading the series 2-1 and Jalen averaging 28.3 points in the first three games, he recognized the need to elevate his performance to shift the momentum in his team's favor. Consequently, the 1-time All-Star averaged 42.6 points in the last three games to close out the series in six.\n\n\"Jalen Brunson... already had respect from me. He's earned more and more respect. Guy's getting it done every single night. Had a couple of bad games (but) bounced back. That's what I wanna see,\" Green added. \"When you're an up-and-coming guy, and you're taking that next step in your career, and you get into these playoffs, I wanna see how you bounce back from a bad game.\"\n\nWhile Draymond's assessment may seem exaggerated, he does raise a valid point: the Knicks players cannot solely rely on Brunson to carry the scoring load in the second-round series against the young Indiana Pacers team.\n\nDespite Jalen's impressive scoring average against the 76ers, no other player came close to matching his output, leaving the Knicks vulnerable. This imbalance in scoring allowed Nick Nurse's team, even without a fully fit Joel Embiid, to remain competitive until the final minutes in multiple games.\n\nBrunson is the key for the Knicks against the Pacers\n\nRick Carlisle's Indiana Pacers, who won the regular season series 2-1 against New York, boasted the league's second-best offensive rating. Furthermore, in their first-round series against the Milwaukee Bucks, they continued that form with six players averaging double-digit points. So, it is clear that Brunson will require assistance from his teammates to ensure that the Knicks experience no scoring droughts, no matter how brief.\n\nAs Jalen has averaged 35.7 points in the three games against the Pacers in the regular season, he will be the Knicks' focal point on offense even in the second-round series, and NY will go as far as JB can take them.\n\nRelated: \"One of the best free agent signings of all time\" - Charles Barkley gushes over Jalen Brunson after he closed out the first round against the Sixers", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "yakshpat_bhargava@postandcourier.com", "name": "Yakshpat Bhargava", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draymond_Green", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Draymond Green"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Brunson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Randle", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Julius Randle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_76ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia 76ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Bucks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Bucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Embiid", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joel Embiid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Barkley", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charles Barkley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/0/ea/0eac6408-664a-5820-a6c7-9a81bf5d92b3/6637641e1258c.image.jpg?crop=1200%2C630%2C0%2C22&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9539735", "eventUri": "eng-9539735", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

His performance in the first round against the Philadelphia 76ers only strengthened that argument.\n\nIn their series clinching victory on the road Thursday night, Brunson scored 41 points and took over late in the fourth quarter to ensure that the series didn't head back to Madison Square Garden for a Game 7, sending the 76ers home for the summer with yet another disappointing finish. He added 12 assists to his line as well in the win.\n\nBrunson became just the third player in NBA history to score at least 35 points and have at least five assists in four consecutive games in a single postseason, joining LeBron James in 2006 and Michael Jordan in 1989 and 1990, according to NBA History on X.\n\nBrunson put on a dazzling scoring display that the franchise hasn't seen in decades. He scored a total of 213 points in the six games played in the series, tying Bernard King back in 1984 for the most points scored in a single playoff series in Knicks history, according to NBA History on X.\n\nFor the series against Philadelphia, Brunson averaged 35.5 points (best in the NBA playoffs) and 9.0 assists per game despite struggling in the first two games of the series. Since Game 3, Brunson is averaging a staggering 41.8 points, which is an unreal number to see given the high intensity the playoffs bring.\n\nPhiladelphia posed challenges for Brunson, as their defensive wings made life more difficult for him to get clean looks. But for him, it didn't matter what was thrown at him, as time and time again he found a way to come through when the Knicks needed him to.\n\nThey couldn't have needed him anymore this series, as Julius Randle and Bojan Bogdanovic are out for the remainder of the playoffs, and Mitchell Robinson missed Game 4 of the series while dealing with an ankle sprain. In Game 6, the Knicks played seven guys and had only five bench points and yet still won the game thanks to Brunson's brilliance.\n\nWhen the Knicks signed Brunson to a four-year, $106 million contract in the 2022 offseason, many thought that the team overpaid for the small 6'0\" guard who was a second round draft pick. Two years later, it is looking like one of the best free agent signings in league history just in terms of pure impact as well as his rapid rise to stardom.\n\nLooking ahead, the Knicks will play the Indiana Pacers in the second round, who just knocked off a battered Milwaukee Bucks team in six games in their first round series.

They moved OG Anunoby to the 4 and inserted Josh Hart into the starting lineup.\n\nHart has been the team's best rebounder since Randle was sidelined, averaging 10.6 boards to go with 12 points and 5.8 assists in 36 games.\n\nAnunoby has been the missing piece of the puzzle for the Knicks, who boasted a 20-3 record with him in the lineup during the regular season, losing by just 16 total points in those three losses.\n\nAdditionally, it took the Knicks just six games in the first round to knock off the 76ers, a team that seemed unstoppable when Joel Embiid was healthy (31-8 record in the regular season).\n\nDuring that first-round series, the Knicks overcame a few poor shooting nights to advance to the conference semifinals, including a Game 4 win in Philadelphia in which they shot just 25.9 percent from 3-point land.\n\nFinding a way to win despite having a few underwhelming outings offensively will be paramount if the Knicks want to advance past this offensive-centric Indiana team.\n\nThe Knicks have a significant edge against the Pacers in rebounding and physicality (see their series against Cleveland last season for reference).\n\nThey rely heavily on crashing the offensive glass, ranking first in offensive rebounding percentage this season, which could trouble the Pacers since they have the sixth-lowest defensive rebounding percentage.\n\nMyles Turner and Pascal Siakam are solid rebounders, but Isaiah Hartenstein, Mitchell Robinson and Hart are bordering on elite in that category. The difference in physicality will be shocking for the Pacers' frontcourt.\n\nThe Knicks transition defense will also be key in this series. Indiana ranks fourth in fast-break points per game and eighth in fast-break efficiency.\n\nThe Pacers utilize their up-tempo play (No. 2 in pace) and solid 3-point shooting (10th in 3-point percentage) to either break games wide open or shrink a deficit in an instant.\n\nIf the Knicks can successfully force the Pacers to play at a slower pace, they will be in a favorable position because they are used to grinding out games in the half-court.\n\nExpect the Knicks to wreak havoc on the offensive glass, resulting in numerous put-backs and second-chance opportunities. They will also slow the pace down enough to make the Pacers extremely uncomfortable.\n\nThe recommendation here would be to lay the points with the Knicks in Game 1.", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New York Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O.G._Anunoby", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "O.G.

Their opposition in pursuit of the Conference Finals are the Indiana Pacers, fresh off a six-game series win over the Milwaukee Bucks without star Giannis Antetokounmpo.\n\nUnlike Philly, this will be more of a clash of styles, as New York prefers to play at a slower pace, while Indiana wants to run track meets. The good news for the Knicks is they're facing less star power, going up against two All-Stars instead of one and a reigning MVP.\n\nThe two teams met twice after their midseason shake-up trades, a 1-1 split at Madison Square Garden that didn't include OG Anunoby or Mitchell Robinson. Without much reliance on their regular season games, projecting this series won't be cut and dry, but let's dive in.\n\nAs with any Knicks match-up, stopping or slowing down Brunson will be a top priority for the opponents. Like with Philly, expect Indy - flush with big guards and wings - to throw their larger defenders at him.\n\nAaron Nesmith standing at 6-foot-6 and 215 pounds with a seven-foot wingspan will likely open on Brunson. Indy's 6-foot-5 backcourt of Tyrese Haliburton and Andrew Nembhard will also get their chances, as well as Knick killer and general on-court annoyance TJ McConnell.\n\nBrunson hasn't had much trouble scoring on these guys in the regular season. He put up 28 points on 22 shots in the first game, his worst of the season, followed by efficient 40 and 39-point performances.\n\nGuarded by Nesmith, Brunson scored 29 points on 12-of-18 shooting in under 10 minutes, however he struggled from the field against Haliburton and Nembhard, who also have size advantages but can better match Brunson's speed.\n\nThe individual match-ups won't matter as much as the team schemes. Indiana will likely try shading off Josh Hart to send Brunson an extra defender, much like Philadelphia did, and New York will need Hart to make plays and shots like he did last series.\n\nIn theory, the Pacers are more switchable against Brunson, and would live with him constantly isolating against Pascal Siakam or Myles Turner. Even if that works, Brunson will turn to his target basketball and get whatever match-up he prefers, and both teams will need to adjust from there.\n\nThe identities of these two teams are pretty embedded at this point, and with both falling on opposite ends of the basketball spectrum, whoever's game gets played will likely emerge victorious.\n\nNew York is a slow, grind-you-down and beat you with metal bats team that defends well and makes up for their offensive limitations by winning the possession game via offensive rebounds and low turnovers. Indiana is constantly pushing the pace and wants to space you out and kill you with offense, with little resistance on the other end.\n\nBoth have built-in advantages. The Pacers finished the regular season 24th in defensive rating, 26th in defensive rebound percentage, and 19th in opponent turnover rate, all suggesting that if the Knicks defense holds up they should find enough offense to win easily.\n\nOn the flip side, New York misses a ton of shots, which will lead to many transition opportunities for Indiana. The Knicks defense can also struggle against five-out teams like the Pacers, who boast a starting front-court that shoots 36.4 percent from three.\n\nThis series may very well come down to these simple things both teams have done all season but need to solidify this round. Can the Knicks keep their turnovers low and abuse the Pacers on the boards, or will Indiana punish them for every missed shot and overwhelm with their youth and athleticism?\n\nIndiana finished with the second-best offense of the season and has kept that pace in the postseason, albeit against a shaky Bucks defense. The Knicks will have more weapons to throw at them, but there are still a ton of unknowns.\n\nFor one, how do the Knicks match-up? Anunoby is their Swiss-army knife that guarded everybody from Tyrese Maxey to Joel Embiid last series, and we'll likely see him deployed similarly this time.\n\nHis natural slot is on Siakam, who cooked Milwaukee with 36 and 37 points in Games 1 and 2. He's had plenty of time to guard him in Toronto Raptors practices, but none yet in the course of NBA action, so this will be an interesting head-to-head to watch.\n\nThat leaves Isaiah Hartenstein guarding Turner, who will be stationed beyond the three-point arc to pull New York's rim protection out of the paint. The Knicks likely live with this until it burns them, at which point they have some options.\n\nThey can try hiding Hartenstein on Nesmith or another non-shooting perimeter threat, making Turner have to post up Hart to turn an advantage. They can also put Hartenstein on Siakam and Anunoby on Turner, so the rim is protected and OG can easily help and recover with his speed.\n\nIt will probably be defense by committee on Haliburton, who's offensive danger largely comes from his passing ability. We could see Anunoby on him if he shakes too loose, perhaps in combination with a center on Siakam to shut down that pet play.\n\nLike last series, don't expect the Knicks to be consistent in their approach. Tom Thibodeau made Philly's stars uncomfortable in the biggest moments of the series with defensive adjustments, and will try to do the same here.\n\nOne thing going in the Knicks favor is Indy's lack of shooting. Only Nembhard and Turner had strong outings from deep last round, so if they can corral the paint and force the ball into poor shooters' hands, they could have an edge there.\n\nNo postseason foe should be overlooked or dismissed, but the Knicks just looked the part going to war with close to a legitimate contender and MVP-level player. The Pacers should pale in comparison.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Nembhard", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Nembhard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Bucks", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Bucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O.G._Anunoby", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "O.G.

Indiana leads the all-time series 4-3 with the current decider being the conference semifinal in 2013, which saw them dispose of the second-seeded Knicks in six games. New York has had to defeat the Pacers en route to each of its last two NBA Finals appearances, doing so in the conference finals of both 1994 and 1999.\n\nThe Knicks are fresh off a six-game victory over the Philadelphia 76ers, sealing the deal with a 118-115 thriller at Wells Fargo Center last Thursday. Indiana, on the other hand, won its first playoff series since 2014, taking down the third-seeded (if not shorthanded) Milwaukee Bucks in six.\n\nNew York and Indiana met three times during the regular season. The Pacers took two, but the first win (back on Dec. 30) had the Knicks severely shorthanded as they worked the immediate aftermath of the trade that brought OG Anunoby and Precious Achiuwa to Manhattan.\n\nWhat: Indiana Pacers @ New York Knicks, Eastern Conference Semifinals, Game 1 (Series tied 0-0)\n\nOne could realistically place a large asterisk next to the Pacers' two wins against the Knicks this season, as neither featured the services of Anunoby (who sat out of both February meetings due to injury). This time of year is exactly why the Knicks traded two homegrown franchise faces to attain his services and the Pacers are about to feel his metropolitan wrath. Anunoby lived up to his advertised billing in round one, showcasing his trademark defense while making several clutch shots on the offensive end. His skillset will be essential in snuffing out any hope Indiana is carrying.\n\nObi Toppin will gain the most metropolitan eyes on the Pacer bench for obvious reasons but McConnell has proven to be an equally deadly depth star, one that forced the mild-mannered Josh Hart into cussing as tip-off loomed. McConnell certainly rose to the occasion in the Pacers' closer over the Bucks, scoring 20 points in Thursday's Game 6 victory. If the Knicks continue to employ a seven-man set to Bojan Bogdanovic done for the season, the Pacers' depth could be one of the lingering x-factors that gives them a fighting chance against their recurring rivals.\n\n\"It's not about taking away things from him: It's collectively outscoring them and limiting what they want to do. You're not going to take [him] away. He's an All-Star for a reason ... You're not going to go into a matchup and just say all right we're going to take away X, Y, Z, and you're just going to take it away. They're too good to do that. You just try to slow them down.\"-Donte DiVincenzo on guarding Tyrese Haliburton (h/t Brian Lewis, New York Post)\n\nThe Knicks are the clear favorite in this series but they're in no position to throw away any advantage they can hoard. Indiana, known for its pace and transition, feels like a team that's tailor-made to pull off an upset of the Knicks, one that has absolutely nothing to lose moving forward and already took down one of the East's established contenders (albeit an abbreviated version). The Knicks have proven very capable of repaying the faith their home crowd has placed in them on countless occasions this seasons and Monday is the next biggest opportunity to do so ... and it won't be the last.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [{"uri": "geoff_magliocchetti@si.com", "name": "Geoff Magliocchetti", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O.G._Anunoby", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "O.G.

The winner of Pacers/Knicks will face the winner of the Cavaliers vs Celtics in the NBA playoff bracket.\n\nIndiana caught a huge break in the first round against #3 Milwaukee. Two-time NBA MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo didn't play a minute in the series, and Damian Lillard missed half of the six-game affair. But the Pacers were full value for the series victory. Three of Indiana's four wins came by at least 13 points and they finished the series with a 119.4 Offensive Rating, second-highest in the postseason to date. Rebounding was an issue for the Pacers throughout the regular season, when they finished 24th in rebound percentage (49.2%) but they won the battle on the boards convincingly against the Bucks, grabbing 51.5% of all rebounds.\n\nThe Knicks won a hard-fought six-game series against Philadelphia, despite entering the series as slight underdogs. Jalen Brunson was all-world, averaging a playoff-best 35.5 PPG along with 9.0 APG and 4.5 RPG. But the Knicks actually finished the first round with a negative Net Rating (-0.2). Their four wins against the Sixers came an average of 4.5 points and their biggest margin of victory was just seven points. The Knicks, who were the best rebounding team in the NBA in the regular season, continued to dominate the glass against Philly, coming away with 51.9% of all rebounds.\n\nThe Knicks aren't really built to blow teams out. They play at the slowest pace in the league and don't shoot particularly well (16th in EFG% in the regular season and 11th out of 16 teams in the playoffs). Their only victory against Indiana this season was a 109-105 win at MSG on Feb. 1, and they were routed by the Pacers in their two other meetings this year: 140-126 in Indiana on Dec. 30 and 125-111 at MSG on Feb. 10.\n\nOddsmakers are continuing to underestimate Indiana. The young Pacers have the talent to beat any team on any court on any night, and they are playing up to their potential more and more.\n\nDraftKings is actually the only sportsbook that has this line at Knicks -6. FanDuel, BetMGM, Caesars, and ESPN Bet all have the spread at 5.5 in Monday's NBA odds. But ironically the best moneyline price on the Pacers is at FanDuel, where bettors can get the Pacers to win straight-up at +194. DraftKings has the best price on the Knicks, though, at -230.\n\nThe game total ranges from a low of 216.5 (BetMGM) to a high of 217.5 (DK, FanDuel, ESPN).\n\nAt -230, the Knicks have a (minimum) implied win probability of 69.7%. The Pacers, whose shortest odds are +180, have a maximum implied win probability of just 35.71%.\n\nNew York suffered a significant blow in the first round, losing Bojan Bogdanovic (15.2 PPG, 2.7 RPG, 1.7 APG) to season-ending foot surgery. New York's injury report still lists Julius Randle (24.0 PPG, 9.2 RPG), who hasn't played since Jan. 27 and was officially declared out for the season ahead of the playoffs.\n\nThe Pacers' injury report once again lists All-Star point guard Tyrese Haliburton (20.1 PPG, 10.9 APG) as questionable due to back spasms. Haliburton played in all six games against the Bucks, but wasn't nearly as prolific as he was in the regular season, averaging just 16.0 PPG and 9.3 APG in 36.5 minutes per night.\n\nNBA player props from DraftKings on May 6.\n\nThe player props for Game 1 pick up on some themes from the first round. Brunson is listed with a sky-high total of 35.5, a total he exceeded in the last four games against the 76ers (39, 47, 40, 41). Josh Hart leads the rebound total as 12.5 O/U. Hart averaged 12.3 RPG in six slow-tempo, low possession games against the Sixers and is expected to have a field day against a small Indiana lineup that likes to run.", "source": {"uri":

Brunson played under Carlisle for the first three seasons of his career with the Dallas Mavericks. However, the way their player-coach relationship ended was not pleasant according to recent reports.\n\nPer Peter Botte of the New York Post, ESPN's Tim MacMahon assured the NBA world on a recent episode of The Hoops Collective podcast that Brunson \"remembers getting essentially benched in\" the Mavs' 2021 first-round series against the Los Angeles Clippers, but Botte revealed words from Brunson that say otherwise:\n\n\"Coaches got to make decisions that better suit their teams. Whatever happened, happened, and we're moving forward from there,\" Brunson said.\n\nThe Villanova product did credit much of his maturation in his first few seasons to Carlisle's coaching. As for the Mavs' first-round loss to the Clippers in 2021, Brunson only averaged roughly 16 minutes per game. Therefore, the 10 minutes he saw in Dallas's Game 7 loss was not a stark dropoff. He wasn't much of a factor with only two points on 1-3 shooting from the field in that outing.\n\nNo matter, Brunson would go on to average 16.3 points and 4.8 assists in his final year in Dallas without Carlisle, and has risen to fringe-MVP status with the Knicks. Carlisle had nothing but positive things to say about Brunson as he prepares to game plan on how to stop the 2024 All-Star.\n\nThe former 2002 Coach of the Year will need to equip his perimeter defense to stymie Brunson, who lit up the 76ers for 35.5 points and nine assists per contest.\n\nBrunson has been the standout performer of the playoffs so far and can help New York reach their first Eastern Conference Finals since 2000. The New Jersey native also excelled against Indiana in the regular season, averaging a near-identical 35.6 points a night in their three-game season series, though the Knicks lost 2-1.\n\nThe Pacers finished the season as the highest-scoring team (123.3 points per game) and best-distributing ball club (30.8 assists per game) in the Association. Brunson and the Knicks will have their hands full trying to contain Tyrese Haliburton and a Pacers team that upset the Milwaukee Bucks in the first round and scored at least 120 points in four of their six contests.", "source": {"uri": "empiresportsmedia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Empire Sports Media"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matthew_legros@empiresportsmedia.com", "name": "Matthew Legros", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Carlisle", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rick Carlisle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Brunson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Player-coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Player-coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Embiid", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joel Embiid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_76ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia 76ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Post", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villanova_Wildcats_men's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Villanova Wildcats men's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Clippers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Clippers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Coach_of_the_Year_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Coach of the Year Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Bucks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Bucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Points_per_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Points per game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://empiresportsmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/NBA-Playoffs-New-York-Knicks-at-Philadelphia-76ers-23138841.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9539735", "eventUri": "eng-9539735", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

They finished with the NBA's second-best offensive rating (121) and pace (101.7), but the 24th-ranked defensive rating (118). Conclusion: they are fleet of foot and score a bunch but are soft on defense. If the Knicks slow down the game and play their brand of physical ball, they'll stand a good chance of winning.\n\nThe two teams have met in the playoffs eight times total: once in the first round (1993), three times in the Eastern Conference Semifinals (1995, 1998, 2013), and thrice in the Eastern Conference Finals (1994, 1999, 2000). The Pacers won four of the seven playoff series, and of the 41 games played, they hold a 22-19 advantage.\n\nHighlights from their epic battles over the years include John Starks headbutting Reggie Miller in the 1993 playoffs, Miller's \"choke\" sign to Spike Lee in the 1994 Eastern Conference Finals, and Miller's eight points in nine seconds to keep the Pacers alive in the 1995 Eastern Conference Semifinals. And we will never forget Larry Johnson's four-point play to lift the Knicks in the 1999 Eastern Conference Finals.\n\nTheir most recent playoff matchup was in the 2013 Eastern Conference Semifinals, where the Pacers defeated the Knicks in six games.\n\nThe Pacers are led by point guard Tyrese Haliburton, who averaged 20.1 points, 10.9 assists, and 3.9 rebounds in 69 games this season. He shot 48% from the floor and 36% from downtown on almost eight attempts per game.\n\nIn January, he slipped on a drive against Boston and injured his hamstring. He missed several games as a result. Before the injury, he had been shooting 40% from downtown, and averaging 12.5 assists per game. Since then, he's shot 32% from deep and his dimes have dropped to 9.5 per game. Even injured, he's still a handful-he averaged 19.7 points, 13.3 assists, and four rebounds in three games versus the Knicks this season.\n\nIt's predicted to be Must-See TV when Haliburton squares off with New York's Jalen Brunson tonight. Brunson averaged 35.5 points and nine assists in the series against Philadelphia and must be salivating about the potential of a softer defense.\n\nShooting guard Andrew Nembhard averaged 9.2 points, 4.1 assists, and 2.1 rebounds in 68 games this season. He shot 50% from the field and 36% from deep on 2.5 attempts per game. The sophomore averaged 10.3 points, five assists, and three rebounds in his three tries against the Knicks this season. He will pair up with Donte DiVincenzo tonight. DiVincenzo averaged 12 points against the Sixers while shooting 36% from deep.\n\nAaron Nesmith averaged 12.2 points, 3.8 rebounds, and 1.5 assists in 72 games this season. The 6'5\", 215 lb small forward has a nice touch from deep, hitting 42% of his 4.6 attempts. He'll square off against Josh Hart, who averaged a 16.8-point, 12.3-rebound double-double against Philly.\n\nLike Anunoby and Precious Achiuwa, power forward Pascal Siakam was jettisoned from the Toronto Raptors mid-season. Since the trade to Indiana, Siakam has averaged 21.3 points, 7.8 rebounds, and 3.7 assists in 41 games for the Pacers. He's a player to watch in the series, but perhaps OG and Precious will provide valuable intel about how to neutralize him. Pascal has averaged 19.2 points and 6.8 rebounds in 24 games against the Knicks in his career.\n\nCenter Myles Turner averaged 17.1 points, 6.9 rebounds, and 1.9 blocks this season. A stretch-big, he can stroke the longball, hitting 36% of his 4.5 attempts this season. Turner has averaged 14.5 points, 6.7 rebounds, and 1.8 blocks in 27 games versus the Knicks in his career. He'll face off with Isaiah Hartenstein tonight. Hartenstein had a difficult series against Joel Embiid during which he averaged 10.3 points and 6.5 rebounds. We expect him to have an easier time against Turner.\n\nFor the Pacers, expect Brooklyn's own Obi Toppin to make an exuberant return to the Garden tonight. The high-flying former Slam Dunk champion averaged 10.3 points and 3.9 rebounds, playing all 82 games this season. And point guard T.J. McConnell may not be an imposing character, but he has been a pest when these two teams have met. He scored 16 points in 18 minutes when they last played.\n\nAs for the Knicks, Tom Thibodeau's bench is depleted. Guard Miles McBride averaged 11.3 points and 23.4 minutes in the Philadelphia series while shooting 43% from deep on five attempts per game. Mitchell Robinson, nursing a sore ankle, played five of the six first-round games, averaging 7.8 rebounds in his 20.6 minutes. And Precious Achiuwa appeared in only two games against the Sixers, despite being a big contribution to New York's Game Four victory.\n\nESPN.com gives the Knicks a 62% chance to win this one. Yessir! The Knicks lack the firepower to keep up with Indiana's scoring, so a tenacious defense will be the key to victory tonight. Look for New York to apply similar defensive strategies to this Tyrese (Haliburton) that they did for the previous Tyrese (Maxey). The Pacers were at the bottom of the league for rebounding, so New York should flex their collective muscle on the glass and keep those offensive boards coming. No doubt both teams will score in the one-teens, but the freight train of Brunson, DiVincenzo, Hart, Anunoby, and Hartenstein will prove too much for the Hoosiers. Knicks by +4.\n\nWhat: Game One, 2024 NBA Eastern Conference Semifinals", "source": {"uri": "postingandtoasting.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Posting and Toasting"}, "authors": [{"uri": "russell_richardson@postingandtoasting.com", "name": "Russell Richardson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "2022 NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1994_NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "1994 NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reggie_Miller", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reggie Miller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Bucks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Bucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spike_Lee", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spike Lee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_76ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia 76ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1995_NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "1995 NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Nesmith", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Nesmith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Nembhard", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Nembhard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donte_DiVincenzo", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donte DiVincenzo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Brunson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shooting guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_Siakam", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pascal Siakam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-double", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Double-double"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obi_Toppin", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Obi Toppin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myles_Turner", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Myles Turner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precious_Achiuwa", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Precious Achiuwa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Maxey", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Maxey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Hart", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Josh Hart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaiah_Hartenstein", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Isaiah Hartenstein"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._J._McConnell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "T.

Still, Green doubled down on his take that the Knicks are not a championship-caliber team with Brunson dominating the scoring.\n\n\"The Knicks are on their way to the second round led by Jalen Brunson, \"Green said. \"Oh, but let me tell you he was not as ball-dominant as he has been,\" Green said. Donte DiVincenzo, who I told you needed to play well, needed to get touches in order to get off to help the team, finished with 23 points. A lot of Knicks fans are trying to make it out to be Draymond doesn't like us, Draymond hates the Knicks. I don't hate the Knicks. However, I am honest, and I'm not delusional.\"\n\nWhile Green remains skeptical of the Knicks' title chances with Brunson as the 1A star, he was impressed though with the point guard's mentality.\n\n\"I didn't even say [Knicks] weren't gonna win the second round series. Because if I'm honest, I think [Knicks] should easily win the second round series,\" said Green as he made his point clear. So I didn't say that.\n\nI said you can get to the \"Promised Land.\" And quite frankly, if I'm honest, I still don't think you can. However, Jalen Brunson as I told you already had respect from me, he's earning more and more for getting it done every single night. Had a couple of bad games then bounced back. That's what I want to see. When you're up-and-coming guy and you're taking that next step in your career, and you get into these playoffs, I want to see how you bounce back from a bad game.\"\n\nAfter shooting under 30% in the first two games in the first round, Brunson bounced back in the next four as he became the the first NBA player to score 39-plus points in four straight playoff games since Michael Jordan in 1993 capping off their first round win with 41 points in Game 6. He also added 12 assists.\n\nBoston Celtics icon Paul Pierce issued a public apology for doubting Brunson and the Knicks' ability to beat the Philadelphia 76ers in the first round of the NBA Playoffs.\n\n\"First off, I like to say sorry to the Knicks and Jalen Brunson because I've shown them no respect,\" Pierce said on \"Undisputed\" on May 3. \"But after this [first-round win], my hat off to them. I didn't see this coming Skip (Bayless), I really didn't. When I looked at the series before it started, I thought Philadelphia just had too much manpower for the short-handed Knicks.\"\n\nBrunson averaged 35.5 points and 9.0 assists to lead the Knicks past the Sixers in a tightly-fought six games.\n\n\"Did I know that Jalen Brunson was going to play well,\" Pierce continued. \"I thought he would play well.

He was there in 1993 when John Starks head-butted Reggie Miller. He was there in 1994 when Miller threw the choke sign at Spike Lee. And he was there in 1995 when Miller scored eight points in 8.9 seconds.\n\nNow, he can't wait for the next chapter.\n\n\"It's going to be a great series,\" Brown told Newsday on Sunday from his home in Charlotte, North Carolina.\n\nBrown's ties to both teams run deep. He grew up a Knicks fan and can remember taking the train from Long Beach to the old Garden where he would pay 50 cents for a ticket. He coached the Knicks during the 2005-2006 season. And, having had a home near the Villanova campus for years, he closely followed the careers of the Knicks' Villanova trio of Jalen Brunson, Donte DiVincenzo and Josh Hart.\n\nAs for the Pacers, Brown took over a franchise that hadn't won a playoff series in its first 13 years of existence and led them to the conference finals twice. He has some incredible memories of his years there, many involving the Knicks.\n\nOne of the biggest happened 29 years ago Tuesday at the Garden when Miller led the Pacers to a 107-105 victory in Game 1 of a second-round series.\n\nWith the Pacers trailing by six, Miller hit a three-pointer from the left wing with 16.4 seconds to go. He then hit another three with 13.2 seconds left after Anthony Mason turned the ball over on an inbounds pass. Then, after John Starks missed two free throws and Patrick Ewing's 10-footer hit the back iron, Miller came up with the rebound and was fouled by Mason. Miller made both free throws with 7.5 seconds to go, the Pacers held on for the win and would ultimately win the series in seven games.\n\n\"Reggie, the bigger the moment, the more he thrived,\" Brown said with awe in his voice.\n\nThough Miller is most remembered as being the Knicks' biggest villain, Brown said it was 7-4 center Rik Smits who ended up being the pivotal player for Indiana when the teams played each other because the Knicks were so physical. Smits actually was the Pacers' leading scorer with 34 points in that Game 1 win in 1995.\n\n\"If we could keep Rik Smits in the game, we could beat the Knicks,\" Brown said. \"Every time we played in the Garden, he had three fouls in the warmups.\"\n\nBrown is expecting the same kind of intensity between the two teams in this series, which he believes will be all about guards Jalen Brunson and Tyrese Haliburton.\n\n\"It's going to be critical to see which point guard prevails,\" said Brown, a former point guard. \"The point guards are so different. Jalen, I hate to say he's score-first because he'll make the right play and he's very unselfish. The Knicks, though, really need him to score. That's when they are at their best. Also, what people don't realize is how much he gets teams into foul trouble, which really helps you offensively.\n\n\"Haliburton shoots open shots and gets everyone involved. He very rarely turns the ball over.\"\n\nThe 83-year-old Brown has always been a big fan of players who know their roles, and he loves the pieces both the Knicks and Pacers have around their point guards. Brown won an NBA title with a group of players who knew their roles in Detroit in 2003-04. Only two players from that team ended up being Hall of Famers, Ben Wallace in 2021 and Chauncey Billups, who will be enshrined in August.\n\nAt the beginning of the season, the Knicks were often compared to that Pistons team given that they both had good point guards but lacked any superstars. At this point, it's fair to say that Brunson has reached superstar status. While some think the Knicks' lack of depth will get them in trouble, Brown is not worried.\n\n\"OG Anunoby? I wouldn't want him or [Josh] Hart off the court,\" Brown said. \"Play them 48 minutes. If the Knicks can stay out of foul trouble, they are as deep as anybody. You don't need to play more than seven or eight guys.\"\n\nThe Knicks and the Pacers have met seven previous times in the postseason, including six times in an eight-year span in the 1990s.

I mean, that's their whole shtick.\n\n\"If Indiana is taking the ball out of the basket, walking it up, that's the Knicks' advantage. So if the Knicks continue to play good team basketball and they're scoring, then that's going to be advantage New York. ...

The Knicks, on the other hand, are defensively dominant.\n\n\"[The Pacers] like to play fast, and [the Knicks] need to deal with [Haliburton]. Who is going to be the guy to guard him? He's a big, long point guard. That'll be a problem,\" ex-76ers scout Michael VandeGarde told The Post. \"[But] the Knicks control pace well. I don't think the Knicks want to play in the 110s, 120s. I don't think that's [Tom] Thibodeau. I don't think that's Jalen Brunson.\n\n\"They want to grind it out and they're super good at grinding it out. They've got tougher dudes that have better focus and make more consistent gritty tough plays. ... That's the difference in the game.\"\n\nBut will the refs let them play that way?\n\nVandeGarde felt that will be a big key, after the Last 2 Minute Reports showed several blown calls that favored the Knicks and the officials allowing a physical game that played into New York's hands.\n\n\"The referees were letting them play the style for the Knicks to be successful, and that's gonna be a huge, huge piece to this next series,\" VandeGarde said.\n\n\"If you let New York just grind gritty, foul, shove, push -- and that's how Thibs wants to play -- Indiana is gonna have trouble, just like the Sixers. And I don't think Indiana is nearly as talented as the Sixers. So, if they can impose their will and the referees let them do that, they should win.\"\n\nA Western scout cited Isaiah Hartenstein getting out to contest Myles Turner's 3s and who guards Brunson (possibly Aaron Nesmith) as keys.\n\nBut his most important key will be OG Anunoby's defense on Pascal Siakam.\n\n\"I assume OG is going to be matched with him, and that's a great matchup,\" the scout said. \"[The Pacers] need Siakam to be as good as he was in the prior series; they need his production. But for the Knicks that's a good matchup.\n\n\"That's a fair matchup. I'm not saying he's going to stop him, but one of the key guys for the Pacers is [Siakam], and you have this reputedly very good defender in Anunoby. And he's been everything he's cracked up to be defensively.

Latest injury update", "body": "The latest on the status of Pacers star Tyrese Haliburton ahead of clash vs Knicks.\n\nFor the first time in 10 years, the Indiana Pacers have reached the second round of the NBA Playoffs. The last time they did it prior to the 2023-24 NBA season was back in 2014 when Paul George was still starring for the franchise and with Frank Vogel at the helm as head coach. This time, it's Tyrese Haliburton pacing Indiana and Rick Carlisle calling the shots from the sidelines.\n\nSpeaking of Haliburton, the Pacers point guard is carrying a question mark at the moment with regards to his availability to play in the series opener against the New York Knicks at Madison Square Garden this Monday night. The question is this: Is Tyrese Haliburton playing tonight vs. the Knicks?\n\nWithout a doubt, the Pacers wouldn't have a game to play at this point of the year without the excellent play this season of Haliburton. But Haliburton is listed as questionable at the time of this writing for Game 1 of the Knicks series because of low back spasms, according to the NBA's official injury report for Monday's games. It is worth mentioning, though, that Haliburton also had to deal with the same back issue in the first round versus the Milwaukee Bucks and managed to play all six games in that matchup.\n\nDuring the series against the Bucks, the former Iowa State Cyclones star averaged 16.0 points, 9.3 assists, and 5.8 rebounds per game while shooting only 43.5 percent from the floor and 29.6 percent from behind the arc. Outside of rebounds, all those numbers are down from his regular-season digits, as his back injury perhaps slowed him down. The Knicks are a different animal than the Bucks.\n\nNew York can be stingy defensively and is a team that seems to like wearing out its opponents, so expect the Knicks to have a target on the back (no pun intended) of Haliburton, who played well in three games opposite the Knickerbockers back in the regular season. Conversely, Haliburton and the Pacers love pushing the ball and moving the leather around. In the regular season, the Pacers ranked second in adjusted offensive rating (120.1) and second overall in pace (102.1). In the three meetings thus far with the Knicks this season, Haliburton averaged 19.7 points on 51.2 percent shooting from the field, 13.3 assists, and 4.0 rebounds.\n\nIn the event that Haliburton gets ruled out for Monday's showdown against Jalen Brunson and company, the Pacers could turn to TJ McConnell to start at the point guard position, while Ben Sheppard can also expect an uptick in minutes. McConnel has been fantastic in the playoffs thus far for Indiana. He was especially impressive during the Pacers' series-clinching 120-98 win over the Bucks last Thursday when he poured 20 points on 7/9 shooting with nine assists and four steals in just 23 minutes of action off the bench.\n\nMoreover, the pair of Pascal Siakam and Myles Turner would have heavier loads, particularly on offense, if Haliburton sits out Game 1 of the Knicks series. It would be interesting to see how Siakam and Turner operate on the court without the Pacers' top facilitator in Haliburton, but either way, they have big roles in the second round.\n\nSo, when it comes to the question of if Tyrese Haliburton is playing tonight vs. the Knicks, the answer is that he's likely to see action, considering that he played through the back injury in the first round.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rexwell_villas@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Rexwell Villas", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Bucks", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Bucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_George", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paul George"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Vogel", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Frank Vogel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Carlisle", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rick Carlisle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison_Square_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Madison Square Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa_State_Cyclones_men's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Iowa State Cyclones men's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myles_Turner", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Myles Turner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Brunson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_Siakam", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pascal Siakam"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/North_America", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/North America", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/Europe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/Europe", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill_or_Bust", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill or Bust", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Is-Tyrese-Haliburton-playing-in-Game-1-vs.-Knicks-Latest-injury-update.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9539735", "eventUri": "eng-9539735", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

The past is the past. Rick welcomed me into the league and helped me become the player [I am today] and helped me grow from Day 1.\n\n\"Coaches got to make decisions that better suit their teams. Whatever happened, happened, and we're moving forward from there.\"\n\nBrunson's role expanded with the Mavericks the following season under Jason Kidd, and he averaged 34.9 minutes in 18 postseason games in 2022 before signing with the Knicks as a free agent that summer.\n\nThe former Villanova star finished fourth in the NBA with 28.7 points during the regular season in his second season in New York, and he upped those numbers to an NBA-best 35.5 points per game in the Knicks' six-game elimination of the Sixers in the first round.\n\nIt marked the second straight year since Brunson's arrival that the Knicks have advanced in the postseason, and the first time that has happened since they won nine consecutive first-round series from 1992-2000.\n\n\"Jalen Brunson is a guy you would never bet against,\" Carlisle told reporters Saturday in Indiana. \"You just don't bet against that guy. I don't know if anybody saw this coming, what he's achieved for two years now, but if you know him and you know his character, you're not surprised. You're not shocked.\"\n\nAccording to Carlisle, he visited with Brunson at Villanova before he was drafted by the Mavs in the second round in 2018, adding that he asked multiple people associated with the program who was the greatest player in school history.\n\n\"Right down the line, everybody responded the same thing, Jalen Brunson,\" Carlisle said. \"So there's a program that's got three national championships and he was a big part of two of those. He's very special, he was great to work with in Dallas for I think it was three years.\n\n\"Just professional, great character, great basketball, great respect and love for the game. You cannot say enough great things about him and what he's accomplished. He's obviously a highly skilled player, but he's got an indomitable will to accomplish what naysayers don't think he can do. He's just one of those kinds of guys. You have to respect what he's doing.\"\n\nBrunson, who will go head-to-head with All-Star point guard Tyrese Haliburton in this series, posted 35.7 points per game in three appearances this season against the Pacers.\n\n\"The last two times we played him he had 40 in one game and 39 in the other. He's leading the playoffs in scoring average,\" Carlisle said. \"It's pretty obvious that he established a very high level during the season, and he's maintained and/or exceeded it in the postseason, and that's hard to do.\"", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New York Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlisle", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carlisle"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Brunson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villanova_Wildcats_men's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Villanova Wildcats men's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Bucks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Bucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Kidd", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jason Kidd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_draft", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA draft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football_national_championships_in_NCAA_Division_I_FBS", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "College football national championships in NCAA Division I FBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Baby_Showers", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Baby Showers", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/newspress-collage-1t54ohfab-1714857970134.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1714843613&w=1024", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9539735", "eventUri": "eng-9539735", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

He was listed on the injury report with that same ailment in the final three games of the first round, but he played in each outing.\n\n\"I locked up... My back just locked up,\" Haliburton said after Game 4, a dominant Pacers win. \"I couldn't really move. Thank god for our amazing medical staff. There was a hot second there where I didn't think I was going to play.\"\n\nThe two-time All-Star guard averaged 16.0 points and 9.3 assists per game in the first round as Indiana toppled the Milwaukee Bucks in six games. It was the first playoff series win for the Pacers since 2014, and that set up their date with the Knicks.\n\nHaliburton's offensive firepower and ability to run a high tempo offense is vital in the upcoming series against the Knicks. New York finished the regular season 30th in pace -- they are on the opposite end of the spectrum from Indiana. The Knicks are more threatening on the glass, which makes their possessions much longer.\n\nOn top of Haliburton, the Pacers will be without Bennedict Mathurin. He's out for the season with a torn labrum in his right shoulder, so he won't play in this series. He's traveled with the team throughout the postseason.\n\nThe Knicks will be missing Julius Randle (right shoulder surgery) and Bojan Bogdanovic (left foot surgery) for the rest of the season.

Henderson/GettyImages\n\nJalen Brunson led the New York Knicks past the Sixers in the first round, and he's hoping to do the same against the Pacers in the second round. It's been 24 years since New York played in the Eastern Conference Finals.\n\nLast year, the Knicks learned not to overlook their second-round opponent, no matter if it's a lower seed. New York has homecourt advantage (again) and should send Indiana packing, but anything can happen in the postseason. The Knicks must stay focused.\n\nOutside of Obi Toppin, Brunson will be up against a familiar face. Pacers' Rick Carlisle was the Mavericks' head coach during the guard's first three years in Dallas. In Carlisle's final game in Dallas, Brunson played 10 minutes in a Game 7 loss against the Clippers in the first round. If things had gone differently during that year's postseason, Brunson most likely would've signed an extension to stay with the Mavericks.\n\nOn ESPN's 'Brian Windhorst & The Hoop Collective Show,' Tim MacMahon said that Brunson would \"enjoy lighting up\" Carlisle because he remembers \"getting benched\" in the 2021 series.\n\nOn Saturday, Brunson was asked if there's added motivation for him to beat his former head coach. Unsurprisingly, he brushed the question off and spoke highly of Carlisle.\n\nCarlisle was also asked about Brunson, and he raved about the now Knicks star guard.\n\n\"Just professional, great character, great basketball, great respect and love for the game. You cannot say enough great things about him and what he's accomplished. He's obviously a highly skilled player, but he's got an indomitable will to accomplish what naysayers don't think he can do. He's just one of those kinds of guys. You have to respect what he's doing.\"\n\nAfter Carlisle left Indiana, Brunson averaged a (then) career-high 16.3 points, 4.8 assists, and 3.9 rebounds per game under Jason Kidd. In the 2022 playoffs, he averaged 21.6 points, 4.6 rebounds, and 3.7 assists per game and was a large part of the reason the Mavericks made it to the Western Conference Finals.\n\nBrunson's used to being counted out. He'd never admit it, but knowing how he is as a competitor, there's a good chance a series win over the Pacers would be made a little sweeter because of the Carlisle connection.

They got an earful about Larry Johnson's 4-point play against the Pacers when the Knicks were on their way back to the NBA Finals in 1999, especially after Tyrese Maxey made a 4-pointer of his own against them in Game 5.\n\nAnd everybody who follows the NBA, any age, knows about the Sunday afternoon, almost 29 years ago exactly -- May 7, 1995 -- when Reggie scored eight points in 8.9 seconds at the end of Game 1. That was the day when Reggie looked over at Spike Lee (they're friends now, in case you're keeping score at home) and made the choke sign with his hands, and immediately bought prime real estate on the front and back pages of our tabloids.\n\nAfter Maxey did make his 4-point play and then followed that up by making a 3-pointer from the marquee to send Game 5 into overtime, I called Spike the next morning to see if he might be suffering some Reggie PTSD.\n\nSpike laughed, because he hadn't attended the game, he'd been up in the Bronx shooting another movie, his fifth, with Denzel Washington.\n\n\"They can't blame this one on me!\" Spike said. \"I wasn't in my seat this time, I was just uptown listening on the radio.\"\n\nThere was a pause and then he quietly said, \"Twenty-nine years ago since Reggie did it to us, and it's still too soon.\"\n\nThose were the days. And nights, here and in Indy. It was Reggie against Spike and Reggie against the Knicks and a back page at this paper that actually read this way: \"Knicks vs. Hicks.\" It was Reggie's 8 and Larry Johnson's 4. It was Patrick missing the finger roll that would have tied Game 7 in '95 and his old teammate, Mark Jackson, saying in the Pacers' locker room after the game, \"Patrick could never make a finger roll to save his life.\"\n\nAround here, it was all the stuff of legend, good and bad, and you better believe that legend informs the Eastern Conference semifinal series between the Knicks and Pacers that begins on Monday night at the Garden. This is a basketball time in New York, and a high time it is, when it's all right for those of us who were around in the '90s -- and I was lucky enough to literally have a front-row seat to it all -- to say this:\n\n\"You really had to be there.\"\n\nMiller wasn't just one of the great shooters in the history of the NBA, he was a dream leading man for his team in all ways. He wasn't afraid of the Knicks, he wasn't afraid of the Garden, he certainly wasn't afraid of the moment.\n\nAnd it always seemed to be a fair fight. The Knicks got him in '93, the series in which John Starks famously head-butted the Pacers star. Then came the Eastern Conference finals of '94, with the Knicks trying to make it back to the NBA finals for the first time since the '70s. That was the series when Reggie really got into it with Spike, on his way to scoring 25 points in the fourth quarter of Game 5. The next day the front page of the Daily News read this way:\n\n\"THANKS A LOT, SPIKE.\"\n\n\"Can I let you in on a secret?\" Reggie told me once when we were walking down Madison Ave. \"I loved it all.\"\n\nBut then at the end of Game 7, with the season for both teams on the line, Ewing produced the put-back dunk that put the Knicks back into the Finals. It was, in so many ways, as big as he ever was in the biggest game he'd ever played in the pros: 24 points, 22 rebounds, seven assists, five blocks.\n\nWhen it was over, there was one of the last pictures of his basketball life, Ewing standing on the scorer's table with his arms in the air in triumph.\n\nYeah, those were the days. And nights. And you better believe that the Indiana Pacers were right in the middle of it. Those Knicks fought more fights with Reggie than they did with Michael Jordan.\n\nThe two teams played again in the Eastern Conference semis in '98. The Pacers got the Knicks in that one, when one of the biggest moments was a 3-pointer from Reggie -- of course -- at the end of Game 4 in the Garden, forcing an overtime that the Pacers won, on their way to winning the series in five.\n\nThe next year after the 8th-seeded Knicks had knocked off the No. 1 Heat in the first round, it was the Pacers for them again. This time Reggie did not make the shots that saved his team, or laid out the Knicks. In Game 6, in fact, he played one of the worst big games of his entire playoff career, shooting 3-for-18 (looking a lot like Maxey did in Philly on Thursday night) and it was the Knicks turn to end his season.\n\nIt just always seemed to be Knicks vs. Pacers in the '90s, and it was still Knicks vs. Pacers in the spring of 2000. Patrick's knees were shot by then. The entire Knicks team limped into the Eastern Conference finals. Still the Knicks had enough to play six hard games against the Pacers, Reggie finally closing them out with 34 points in Game 6, what turned out to be Ewing's last game as a Knick in Madison Square Garden.\n\nAnd guess what? Even when it was a new generation of Knick and Pacer players in the playoffs of 2013, when we were sure the 54-win Knicks were on their way to play LeBron James and the Heat in the league's Final Four, there was that moment near the end of Game 6 in Indianapolis when Carmelo Anthony drove the baseline and got stuffed by Roy Hibbert of the Pacers so emphatically you imagined the Garden shaking back in the city, and the Pacers had laid out the Knicks again.\n\nBottom line on all of this history, now that the Knicks and Pacers get ready to do it again?\n\nKnick fans, young and old and in between, want games like those starting Monday night. They want nights like those. They want what the Knicks of the '90s had, and what they gave us, even if they never won a title. You had to be there.\n\nSince Aaron Judge returned to the Yankees at the end of July last season, two months after he hurt his toe running into that outfield door at Dodger Stadium, he's hit .226 in 314 at-bats, hit 24 homers with 53 RBI, with an OPS of .873 and a .494 slugging percentage.\n\nHe can still hit balls out of sight, even with his slow start this season.\n\nBut he hasn't looked the same as a hitter since he hurt his toe.\n\nMaybe that all changes starting now.\n\nThe Red Sox starting pitching continues to be one of the big stories of the early season in baseball.\n\nI know Buddy Hield had a big night off the bench for the Sixers in Game 6, but how in the world does he end up taking that crazy 3 at the end and not Maxey?\n\nSomehow three young guys who played their college ball in Philly -- Brunson, Hart, DiVincenzo -- have turned themselves into one of the best New York basketball stories of all time.\n\nIt would be a pretty fine New York baseball story, by the way, if Luis Severino has come all the way back.\n\nAnthony Volpe looked like a much tougher out to me before the Yankees force-fed him into the leadoff spot.\n\nBut that might just be part of the Yankees sometimes acting almost desperate to turn the kid into the next Derek Jeter.\n\nAs if somehow Volpe can make us forget all the kids out of the farm system who never became stars at Yankee Stadium.\n\nIt was a layup for Knicks fans to turn on Joel Embiid the way they did, especially after he grabbed Mitchell Robinson's legs and got away with it.\n\nAnd it's also fair to talk about how you couldn't find him in the fourth quarter of Game 6, not really.\n\nBut even playing on one good leg, Embiid dropped 50 on the Knicks in one game.\n\nAnd he sure had a triple-double in Game 5, even if Game 5 was pretty much Tyrese Maxey's show.\n\nWhat Embiid basically did, not even being close to 100%, is remind everybody why he has been one of the stars of the sport when healthy.\n\nJalen Brunson does make it look as easy as Clyde did sometimes.\n\nSomebody explain to all the Celebrity Row Row Rowers at the Garden that they're not part of the action.\n\nWith the exception of Shelton Spike Lee, of course.\n\nHe's got tenure.\n\nIf you have not read Anne Lamott's new book, \"Somehow,\" do yourself a favor and buy it today.\n\nAs always, she writes with beauty, and clarity, and gives her readers food for the soul.\n\nTo paraphrase a great old line by my pal Liz Smith, don't you wonder who gives Marjorie Taylor Greene the creeps?\n\nI was trying to set up my new laptop on Friday afternoon and it got so confusing, no kidding, I almost called Aaron Rodgers.\n\nI love the NBA saying Maxey should have been called for traveling at the end of Game 5.", "source": {"uri":

That wasn't enough to win over Green, as the Golden State Warriors agitator doubled down on his doubt on his eponymous web series.\n\n\"I'm not a Knicker hater, I'm just honest,\" Green said, mockingly remarking that he hasn't faced the Knicks in a postseason series. \"I think a lot of the Knicks' fans are delusional ... Knicks fans are nuts. We know Knicks fans are nuts, I don't need to go into that. I know they need something to rally around and that's cool, rally around The Draymond Green Show.\"\n\nGreen claims that he didn't have the Knicks falling in round one (though he did have Philadelphia pulling an upset in the quarterfinals) and believes that they \"should easily\" prevail in round two against the Indiana Pacers. But Green still sounds down on Jalen Brunson, believing that their championship drought will extend into a 51st season if he continues to be the primary ballhandler.\n\n\"I don't hate the Knicks. However, I am honest and not delusional,\" Green said. \"A ball-dominant Jalen Brunson ain't going to get you to the promised land, I said.\"\n\nDespite his doubt, Green did say that Brunson has begun to earn more of his respect, which is perhaps the most facetious benefit from his epic playoff cappers against the Sixers. Brunson scored at least 39 points in each of the final four games of the series, including a franchise single-game playoff record 47 in the Game 4 victory. But Green apparently believes that's not enough to push the Knicks forward into either the NBA Finals, which haven't hosted the Knicks since 1999.\n\nIn any event, landing Green's favor is perhaps the furthest thing from the Knicks' mind, as they're focused on another yellow team: the Indiana Pacers visit Madison Square Garden for Game 1 of the Eastern Conference Semifinals on Monday night (7:30 p.m. ET, TNT).", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [{"uri": "geoff_magliocchetti@si.com", "name": "Geoff Magliocchetti", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draymond_Green", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Draymond Green"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_76ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia 76ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Brunson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2022 NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TNT_(American_TV_network)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TNT (American TV network)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison_Square_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Madison Square Garden"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Sustainability", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Sustainability", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Communities", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Communities", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Green", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Green", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Auction", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Auction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_2738,h_1540,x_0,y_189/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/si-temp/01hx2g3bm7knamh63msf", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9539735", "eventUri": "eng-9539735", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

Of course, this was well before Brunson became the player that he is today, but it still holds significance given his rapid ascension to superstar status.\n\nESPN's Tim McMahon said on the Hoop Collective podcast that the star point guard will be playing this upcoming series with a chip on his shoulder.\n\n\"I can assure you this, Jalen Brunson remembers getting benched in that series,\" said McMahon. \"Jalen got a lot of the stuff that maybe should've been going to Luka. A lot of the film sessions were particularly harsh on Jalen.\"\n\nBrunson, however, said that facing his former head coach in the playoffs will not affect his mindset for the series.\n\n\"You're in the playoffs now. There is no extra motivation. It is what it is,\" said Brunson via SNY. \"The past is the past. Rick welcomed me into his league and helped me grow from day one.\"\n\nBrunson has been on a tear in the playoffs thus far, coming off of a historic first round series versus the Philadelphia 76ers where he established himself as one of the Knicks franchise's all-time best playoff performers. In his last four games, he is averaging 41.8 points and 10.3 assists.\n\nCarlisle, who is in his third season as Pacers head coach and in his first playoff appearance with them, went on The Dan Patrick Show earlier this week and gave his thoughts on the transformation his former player has undergone since coming over to the Knicks in 2022.\n\n\"He's a little bit of Steve Nash, there's some James Harden, there's some Dame Lillard. He's doing something that is very uniquely him,\" said Carlisle. \"He's a guy that has an extremely strong belief in himself. New York has turned him loose, it's been amazing to watch. I'm very happy for him and very proud of him and very much not looking forward to playing him.\"\n\nGame 1 of the series begins Monday night at Madison Square Garden. The Knicks will once again have home court advantage throughout the series and they will hope that Brunson can lead them to their first Eastern Conference Finals appearance in 25 years.", "source": {"uri": "empiresportsmedia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Empire Sports Media"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dylan_backer@empiresportsmedia.com", "name": "Dylan Backer", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Carlisle", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rick Carlisle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Brunson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2022 NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Clippers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Clippers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Nash", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steve Nash"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dan_Patrick_Show", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Dan Patrick Show"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Harden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "James Harden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damian_Lillard", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Damian Lillard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_76ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia 76ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison_Square_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Madison Square Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_advantage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Home advantage"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://empiresportsmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/NBA-Indiana-Pacers-at-New-York-Knicks-22495561.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9539735", "eventUri": "eng-9539735", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

They had five other guys averaging double figures in the Philadelphia series. They're 20-3 when O.G. Anunoby is healthy and the Pacers didn't have to deal with him at all in their three regular season games. I don't expect the Pacers to have the same kind of Game 1 freakout that they did against the Bucks, but I still think the playoffs at the Garden is going to take some getting used to.

They've made it fun to be a Knicks fan again.\n\nThey didn't do it with T-shirt cannons, Kiss-Cam videos or meet-and-greet ticket packages featuring players from 25 years ago.\n\nThey did it the old-fashioned way: By compiling a team that is not only good, but entertaining to watch and incredibly likeable. In fact, the Knicks are so likeable that they are luring back fans who swore to never fully give their heart to the team again.\n\nWhen the Knicks host the Indiana Pacers Monday night for Game 1 of the Eastern Conference semifinals, it will mark the second straight year that the team has made it to the second round of the playoffs.\n\nHow big of a deal is this? Consider that the Knicks have not gotten this far in two consecutive years since the 1999 and 2000 playoffs. In the 24 years since 2000, the franchise has had nine general managers, 15 coaches (including interims), seven winning seasons and a boatload of dysfunction.\n\nBrian Koppelman, the writer/director/producer best known for the movie \"Rounders\" and TV show \"Billions,\" grew up in Westbury and Roslyn Harbor and first fell in love with the Knicks when his father took him to see a playoff game in 1970. He bought season tickets when he moved to the city in 1988 but found it increasingly hard to support his team after the turn of the century. When the team didn't re-sign Jeremy Lin, he decided he had had enough.\n\n\"I tried quitting the Kicks for about a year after they let Jeremy leave but the connection is too deep, even after all the botched and disgraced years and moves,\" Koppelman said. \"This team, built by Leon and Wes, coached by Thibs and exemplified by the brilliance and art of Jalen and the Villanova squad, makes me remember all the good reasons I have always loved and needed this team.\"\n\nLeon and Wes are Knicks general manager Leon Rose and executive vice president William Wesley. Thibs is coach Tom Thibodeau. Jalen and the Villanova squad, of course, is point guard Jalen Brunson and his former college teammates Donte DiVincenzo and Josh Hart.\n\nInitially, the building of this team looked like something that was destined to fail in that ever-so-painful Knicks way.\n\nFirst, management hires Rose, a high-powered agent who had never run a team. Rose signs Brunson, who happens to be his godchild, to a four-year, $104 million free-agent contract that at the time looked like a massive overpay but is now the deal of the century. He later proceeds to add two of Brunson's 'Nova teammates.\n\nIt's exceedingly rare for three college teammates to win a championship together and then reunite on an NBA team. It's even rarer for all three to become starters, clinch a No. 2 seed and then close out a series the way they did in Game 6 of their first-round series against Philadelphia.\n\nPlaying without All-Star teammate Julius Randle, who had season-ending shoulder surgery, the Knicks not only beat a team that on paper had superior talent, they closed out the series in a way that delighted old fans and may have made some new ones. Brunson scored 40-plus points in this third straight game, Hart drilled the go-ahead three pointer and DiVincenzo hit two free throws with 11.1 seconds left as the Knicks won Game 6 in Philadelphia, 118-115.\n\nBrunson is the ultimate underdog/fan-magnet. He's short for his profession, can barely dunk, wasn't drafted until the second round and didn't start as a rookie. Yet in two years he's proven himself to be the team's best floor leader since Walt Frazier.\n\nNo one could have predicted that in his second year with the Knicks this season he would be the league's fourth-leading scorer. And no one could have predicted that he would have the kind of series he had against Philadelphia, where he became just the second player to register at least 35 points and 10 assists three times in a series, joining Oscar Robertson (1962).\n\nThe way Brunson is leading these Knicks has not only delighted current Knicks fans, it has made some strange new ones. Even a player from another team in the Eastern Conference playoffs seemed to be elbowing his way onto the Knicks' bandwagon. Emoni Bates, a two-way player on Cleveland, retweeted a post on X that pictured the three players from both their days in Villanova and Saturday's game with the caption \"how could you not like this team.\"\n\nIt's tough not to.\n\nJust ask Chris Delgado, a Knicka fan who grew up in Deer Park and Manhattan but now lives in Los Angeles. With all the dysfunction of the last decade, Delgado admits he has been so frustrated with the team's management that he basically \"went into hibernation\" for a while. Now, he's so far back into the team that he often drives an hour north from his home so he can watch games with other fans at a Knicks bar.\n\n\"For me, what changed is Jalen. He's what cleaned everything up there,\" Delgado said. \". . . It's just so weird as a Knicks fan. There's all this positive stuff happening.\"", "source": {"uri": "newsday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsday"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

We can establish, firmly, that the Knicks and the Pacers have a wonderful history together.\n\nStarting Monday, just past 7:30, none of that will matter much.\n\nReggie might be there for a few games, but he'll have a microphone in his hands, not a basketball. John Starks and Patrick Ewing will probably be there, but merely as the most celebrated denizens of Celebrity Row. The cameras will find them and maybe give Madison Square Garden a quick jolt of energy, and then everyone's attention will focus elsewhere.\n\nTo Jalen Brunson and Tyrese Haliburton, two of the game's most electric point guards. To OG Anunoby and Pascal Siakam, who began the season as teammates in Toronto before being dispersed to New York and Indianapolis, providing both teams with missing puzzle pieces. To Tom Thibodeau and Rick Carlisle, a couple of basketball lifers with more than 1,500 NBA wins between them, regular season and postseason, and whose own subtle duel will likely go a long way toward deciding this best-of-seven Eastern Conference semifinals series.\n\nMostly, to two hot teams who play fascinatingly diverse styles. The Pacers are young, deep, athletic and are capable of dropping 140 on you, even if you're guarding them well, because when they heat up from 3 they become almost unstoppable on offense. The Knicks are going to go with either a seven- or an eight-man rotation. Everything they do begins and ends with defense. And it might be tempting to them to quicken the pace because Indiana can sometimes make defense look more challenging than advanced calculus.\n\n\"They play very fast,\" Anunoby said. \"They get the ball out quick, throw it ahead. They get up a lot of 3s. They just play really fast, probably the highest pace in the league so it'll be challenging for us to get back on defense. It's an emphasis on film.\"\n\nThe Pacers beat the Knicks two out of three times in the regular season, though Anunoby didn't play in any of the games -- the first, Dec. 30, happened before he'd reported to the Knicks after he was traded, and the others he was dealing with his injured elbow. And the game the Knicks did win -- Feb. 1 at MSG -- they made a fourth-quarter comeback aided in large part by the absence of Haliburton, who was on a minutes restriction that night.\n\nSo there's not a lot to go on based on this version of these teams.\n\nFor the Knicks, Priority 1 will be defending their home-court advantage. Again, it's sometimes tricky to apply historical trends to contemporary teams. But one of the remarkable facts in Knicks history is this:\n\nIn their history, which dates to 1946, the Knicks have lost Game 1 of a seven-game series in which they owned home court six times:\n\nAnd they have lost all six series. And there is one recurring theme that appears in every one of them: They lose Game 1, and then they immediately have to chase. They immediately have to try to steal a game back. And look: 1969 through 2023 covers 55 seasons. So this has been true of teams from Clyde Frazier to Patrick Ewing to Carmelo Anthony to Jalen Brunson: They never quite catch up.\n\nMore chillingly: They are 1-16 in the road games in those series.\n\nTaking care of business at home has never quite felt so essential.\n\n\"Whatever happened in the past is in the past,\" Brunson said. \"We've got to learn from it and move on. So going into this series we just know that this team runs the floor, they share the ball, they're a good shooting team, they play fast, all that stuff. We have to know we have a a really good team coming to New York.\"\n\nAnd the Pacers know there'll be an equally good team waiting for them there. Knicks-Pacers, seven games to keep basketball season going into June. \"What's past is prologue,\" an old gym rat named Billy Shakespeare said. Time to hit the refresh button, starting just past 7:30 at the Garden.

Looking at Pacers guard's status for Game 1 (May 6)", "body": "Indiana Pacers All-Star guard Tyrese Haliburton has been added to the injury report, tagged as questionable for the highly anticipated Game 1 of the Eastern Conference semifinals against the New York Knicks on Monday.\n\nLast summer, Haliburton and Jalen Brunson were competing for the starting point guard position on Team USA's FIBA World Cup squad.\n\nNow, the two All-Star point guards are in the Eastern Conference semifinals. The second-seeded New York Knicks, led by Brunson, will go head-to-head with Haliburton's sixth-seeded Indiana Pacers.\n\nThe Knicks advanced through a tough first-round battle against the Philadelphia 76ers, clinching the series in six games. Meanwhile, the Pacers pulled off an upset against the injury-plagued, third-seeded Milwaukee Bucks, also in six games.\n\nNow, Indiana faces another formidable Eastern Conference team dealing with a critical absentee.\n\nThe Knicks are playing without three-time All-Star power forward Julius Randle, who underwent a season-ending shoulder surgery. Despite Randle's absence, Jalen Brunson's exceptional performance and the team's solid defense have primarily compensated for the loss.\n\nThe upcoming series presents a clash of styles. The Pacers boast the NBA's second-highest rated offense but find themselves ranked 24th in defense. Meanwhile, the Knicks ended the season strong with a well-rounded performance, finishing in the top-10 in both offense and defense.\n\nWhat happened to Tyrese Haliburton?\n\nTyrese Haliburton suffered a hamstring strain with 3:10 remaining in the second quarter during the 133-131 victory over the Boston Celtics on Jan. 8.\n\nThe injury happened as he attempted to maneuver past Derrick White, but a delayed defensive move by Kristaps Porzingis caused Haliburton to suddenly halt his momentum, leading to a split.\n\nHaliburton was unable to support himself on his legs. He needed help to exit the court and was later ruled out for the remainder of the game.\n\nTyrese Haliburton stats vs New York Knicks\n\nIn his fourth season, Tyrese Haliburton has appeared in eight games against the New York Knicks, going 3-5.\n\nHe has averaged 17.6 points, 3.3 rebounds and 8.9 assists with 1.1 steals and 1.0 blocks on 46.8% shooting, including 30.4% from the 3-point line on 7.0 attempts and 88.0% from the charity stripe on 3.1 attempts.\n\nIn three games against the Knicks, his averages increased across the board, with 19.7 points, 4.0 rebounds and 13.3 assists with 0.7 steals and 1.3 blocks on 51.2% shooting, 32.0% from beyond the arc and 90.0% from the free-throw line.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tanay_sahai@sportskeeda.com", "name": "Tanay Sahai", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Brunson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIBA_Basketball_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FIBA Basketball World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Randle", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Julius Randle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Bucks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Bucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_76ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia 76ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristaps_Porzi\u0146\u0123is", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_throw", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free throw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Gaming", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Gaming", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Murder-Mystery_and_Deduction", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Murder-Mystery and Deduction", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2024/05/23155893-1714981473.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9539735", "eventUri": "eng-9539735", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-01-08", "textStart": 1612, "textEnd": 1618}], "sentiment": -0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

The second game, O.G. (Anunoby) didn't play. The third game, O.G. and (Isaiah) Hartenstein didn't play, and (Mitchell) Robinson didn't play any of those games either. It will be different. What we've learned from this last playoff series is the regular season doesn't matter at all.\"\n\nSo the Pacers have to be ready for a much different matchup situation. Here's a look at how the Pacers and Knicks line up position-by-position, though both teams will certainly be cross-matching on defense.\n\nBrunson and Haliburton became close friends on Team USA last summer during the FIBA World Cup when Brunson was the team's starting point guard and Haliburton his backup. Haliburton won an Eastern Conference starting job in the All-Star Game while Brunson was selected as a reserve and Haliburton was selected for a position Team USA for this summer's Olympics in Paris, while Brunson was left off. However, Brunson seems to be the more certain bet to make an All-NBA team while Haliburton is sweating it out with more than $50 million on the line in his contract.\n\nBrunson and Haliburton are the engines that drive their respective teams, but they operate in very different ways which is partly why they were effective as a 1-2 punch with Team USA.\n\nThe Knicks need Brunson to score as well as create, and he can get his own shot in virtually any scenario. He's a three-level scorer who can get to the rim at will, get buckets in the mid-range and knock down 3-pointers. He averaged 28.7 points per game in the regular season which put him fourth in the NBA, and in the first round of the playoffs his 35.6 points per game was the highest figure of anyone in the tournament. He's scored at least 39 points in each of his last four games and at least 40 in each of his last three. He's averaging 29.2 field goal attempts per game, by far the most of anyone in the playoffs, but he's also averaging 9.0 assists per game, which puts him fourth in the playoffs.\n\nHaliburton has always been more focused on creating for others, and after his early-season scoring outbursts drew him more defensive attention, he's struggled to make shots. He's become more satisfied with moving the ball first and letting the ball get back to him. He was admittedly overly passive in Game 1 against the Bucks when he scored just nine points on seven field goal attempts, but he averaged 17.4 points per game in the last five. After leading the NBA in assists with 10.9 per game in the regular season, he had three double-figure assist games against the Bucks and 9.3 per game put him only behind Nikola Jokic and Luka Doncic in the playoffs.\n\nThere's a very low chance Haliburton and Brunson guard each other. Andrew Nembhard and Aaron Nesmith will likely take the assignment of guarding Brunson for the Pacers. Haliburton could see Josh Hart and O.G. Anunoby, among others.\n\nPartnering with former Villanova teammates Brunson and Josh Hart has allowed Donte DiVincenzo to rejuvenate his career at age 27. With Brunson taking so much attention as a volume scorer, DiVincenzo has taken advantage of collapsing defenses to turn into one of the NBA's most prolific outside shooters.\n\nDiVincenzo averaged a career high 15.5 points per game this season, his previous high being 10.4 per game for the NBA champion Bucks in 2020-21. His 283 3-pointers put him third in the NBA behind Stephen Curry and Luka Doncic, and he knocked those down at a 40.1% clip. More than 70% of his total field goal attempts were 3-pointers, but he also showed he could attack closeouts and finish at the rim, making 60.7% of his field goals within 3 feet of the basket.\n\nNembhard, a point guard by trade, isn't nearly as prolific of a scorer or an outside shooter, but he's growing into a defensive ace and his resilience in his matchup against Damian Lillard was a big reason the Pacers were able to pull out the series against the Bucks. Lillard scored 69 points in the first two games and he averaged 31.3 points per game for the series, but in the last two games, he made just 13 of 36 field goals (36.1%) with Nembhard making him work. Nembhard generally gets one of the toughest matchups on the floor and that matchup showed a lot of growth.\n\nNembhard averaged a modest 9.2 points per game to go with 4.1 assists in the regular season, but the Pacers pushed him to be aggressive in the first round of the playoffs, knowing he'd get an advantageous matchup. As the series wore on he made more of a point to drive the ball and backcut as well as take open 3-pointers and he scored in double figures each of the last five games. He averaged 13.8 points per game for the series, shot 59.6% from the floor and 45.0% from 3-point range while also dishing out 4.7 assists per game.\n\nNembhard will likely start on Brunson on defense but he could also be guarded by Brunson. The Pacers could put Haliburton or Nesmith on DiVincenzo.\n\nThe Knicks and Pacers start their selfless, glue guy wings at the 3. Both are tough, tenacious defenders who can play above their size and shoot and score when it's called for.\n\nThe 6-4, 215-pound Hart is the more experienced of the two players in his seventh season with his fourth franchise. He averaged 9.4 points per game on a shaky 43.4% shooting including 31.0% from the 3-point arc, but he grabbed a career high 8.3 rebounds per game and dished out 4.1 assists per game while always taking on a tough defensive assignment. In the first round against the 76ers, he caught fire from outside in the first three games, hitting four 3-pointers and scoring over 20 points in each of them. He finished the series averaging 16.8 points per game and shooting 42.3% from 3-point range in the series and also grabbed 12.3 rebounds per game and dished out 4.5 assists per game.\n\nAaron Nesmith had to take on Khris Middleton, a hero of his in childhood and a mentor in adolescence when he grew up in Charleston, S.C. Middleton ultimately won that matchup, but Nesmith battled him as he has so many other top-line forwards this season and Nesmith hit some key shots of his own. He scored in double figures in four of the six games and he hit 12 3-pointers in the series, third behind only Myles Turner and Tyrese Haliburton.\n\nHart could guard either Haliburton or All-Star forward Pascal Siakam and could end up taking on both. Nesmith could handle Hart, Brunson, DiVincenzo or O.G. Anunoby depending on how the Pacers decide to match up.\n\nAnunoby and Siakam came up together with the Raptors, with Siakam being taken with their first round pick in the 2016 draft and Anunoby being taken in the first round in 2017. They were key parts of Toronto's 2018-19 NBA championship team and they stayed to become pillars of the franchise after 2019 NBA Finals MVP Kawhi Leonard and others moved on. They were traded away this season within a month of each other, both dramatically altering the fortunes of the teams that acquired them, and their matchup could be the most important of this series.\n\nAnunoby, who helped IU win a Big Ten title and earn a Sweet 16 berth in 2016, has become one of the NBA's best perimeter defenders. He led the NBA in steals last year, earning a spot on the All-Defensive second team. He's averaged at least 1.4 steals per game in each of the last four seasons, and his 6-7, 232-pound frame allows him to guard any position 1-4. He's steadily improved offensively, averaging 14.7 points per game this season on 48.9% shooting from the field and 38.2% from 3-point range. He averaged 15.0 points per game on 51.3% shooting in the first round, grabbing 6.8 rebounds per game. Anunoby had surgery to repair an elbow injury shortly after he was acquired in late December which cost him extensive time, but the Knicks were 20-3 in the games he appeared in in the regular season.\n\nSiakam became the focal point of the Raptors' offense when Leonard left, earning two All-Star nods and two All-NBA selections in his last four years there. After earning Most Improved Player honors in 2018-19, he's averaged at least 20 points per game in each season since.\n\nThe Pacers determined quickly that Siakam could be a go-to scoring option with the range to score at all three levels. He's 6-8 with a 7-3 wingspan and has remarkably good ball-handling skills for that size, so he can create space off the dribble and shoot over people. He's excellent in transition which fits with how the Pacers want to play, but he can also score in isolation when teams force them to slow down. In 41 regular season games with the Pacers after the trade, he led them with 21.3 points per game on 54.9% shooting.\n\nSiakam had 73 points combined in the Pacers' first two games against Milwaukee. The Bucks adjusted with more double teams and different matchups and he didn't score more than 19 points in any game the rest of the series, but he still led the Pacers with 22.3 points per game on 54.7% shooting and also grabbed 8.8 rebounds and dished out 4.2 assists per game.\n\nThe Knicks will probably have to use Anunoby to start on Siakam simply because they don't have a better option, but Anunoby could also be used to harass Haliburton. Siakam's best defensive fit is probably Anunoby, but he could also be asked to guard Hart.\n\nHartenstein's and Turner's approaches to the center position are vastly different, but the player who wins the clash of styles could have a lot to say about which team wins the series.\n\nThe 7-foot, 250-pound Hartenstein has an old school post player's body and Knicks coach Tom Thibodeau has deployed him that way. After Hartenstein took 37 3-pointers last year and 30 the year before, he attempted just three this season and almost all of his offense came around the basket. He shot 64.4% from the field in large part because 63.6% of his shots came from within 3 feet and another 25.2% came from between 3 and 10 feet. He was also a force on the boards, grabbing a career high 8.3 per game.\n\nTurner, meanwhile, views versatility as the strength of his offensive game. He's an excellent partner with Haliburton in the ball screen game because he can roll to the basket and score, hit mid-range jumpers or pass out of short-rolls, or pop out for 3-point shots and spread the floor. He made 76.0% of his field goal attempts within 3 feet this year, but just 24.8% of his shots came from that close. He hit a career high 116 3-pointers at a 35.8% clip but also made 56.2% of his shots from between 10-16 feet and shot 62.3% on attempts between 16 feet and the 3-point line. He averaged 17.1 points per game in the regular season and he was trouble for the Bucks in the playoffs, averaging 19.2 per game.\n\nTurner's games against Hartenstein and the Knicks were among the best and worst of his season. He scored 28 points in a win on Dec. 30 but was held to just five in a loss on Feb. 1 when Hartenstein had 12 points and 19 rebounds. Turner scored 23, however, on 9 of 9 shooting in the Pacers' Feb. 10 win. If he can drag Hartenstein away from the rim and keep him off the offensive glass, Turner could make a huge impact.\n\nBench\n\nBojan Bogdanovic did excellent work as the Knicks sixth man before season-ending foot surgery during the 76ers series, averaging 10.4 points per game during the regular season. The Knicks stuck with a short bench -- playing Brunson, Hart and Anunoby over 40 minutes per game each against the 76ers -- but got excellent production from guard Miles McBride. He scored 21 points in Game 1, 13 in Game 4 and 14 in Game 5. The 6-2, 200-pounder scored in double figures 26 times in the regular season and shot 41.0% from 3-point range so he can be a very tough cover.\n\nCenter Mitchell Robinson dealt with injuries for much of the regular season, but he gives the Knicks size and athleticism beyond Hartenstein. The 7-foot, 240-pound Robinson averaged just 3.0 points, but 7.8 rebounds and 1.4 blocks per game in the 76ers series. Precious Achuwa, acquired with Anunoby from the Raptors, averaged 7.6 points and 7.2 rebounds in the regular season and gives the Knicks another forward option off the bench.\n\nThe Pacers, who played at the second-fastest pace in the NBA and had the highest scoring bench in the regular season, view their depth as a strength and relied more on subs in the first round, though Pacers coach Rick Carlisle did trim his rotation down to effectively eight players.\n\nPoint guard T.J. McConnell struggled in the Bucks series after the best regular season of his NBA career, but he finished strong with 20 points on 7 of 9 shooting, nine assists and four steals in Game 6. Former Knicks forward Obi Toppin averaged 12.3 points and 5.8 rebounds per game in the series, scoring in transition and from outside as he had all year and proving he could handle the 5 in small lineups so that he and Siakam could play together on the front line. Rookie guard Ben Sheppard held his own on defense and shot 50% from the floor and 50% from 3-point range on limited attempts, giving the Pacers a trustworthy wing defender off the bench.\n\nThe size of Hartenstein and Robinson might inspire Carlisle to use backup centers Jalen Smith and Isaiah Jackson more than he did in the first series. Smith averaged 9.9 points per game on 59.2% shooting and 5.5 rebounds but appeared in just two games against the Bucks. Jackson appeared in four and had some struggles, but Carlisle likes his energy as a lob finisher and shot blocker. Veteran wing Doug McDermott played in four games, but hit two of the five 3-pointers he attempted and could be used in short spurts to spread the floor.", "source": {"uri": "indystar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Indystar"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O.G._Anunoby", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "O.G.

Now, he's the master of the New York Knicks playoff run ... which makes him, of course, a master of evil in the eyes of the Indiana Pacers.\n\nBrunson is the talk and toast of the basketball world with the opening round of the NBA Playoffs nearly wrapped up, as the Knicks point guard guided Manhattan to a six-game triumph over the Philadelphia 76ers. The reward is a second round clash with Rick Carlisle's Pacers, which begins on Monday night at Madison Square Garden (7:30 p.m. ET, TNT).\n\nThere is no shortage of headlines for the revival of the turn-of-the-century rivalry, but a buried subplot is the reunion between Brunson and Carlisle, who collaborated in Dallas during the former's first three NBA seasons. Carlisle, now the head coach of Indiana, lauded his former protege in an interview with Dan Patrick earlier this week.\n\n\"He has forged out a niche in the NBA and really in league history and Knick history, which is very, very unique,\" the third-year Pacer boss and brief Knicks reserve said. \"I know Jalen well because we had him for his first couple of years when I was in Dallas. He's a guy that has an extremely strong belief in himself. New York has turned him loose to really go and just take it to whatever extreme he can take it.\n\n\"It's been amazing to watch. I'm very happy for him, very proud of him, and very much not looking forward to coaching against him.\"\n\nCarlisle went on to remark that Brunson had hints of Steve Nash, James Harden, and Damian Lillard in his game, but praised the point guard for \"doing something that is very uniquely him.\"\n\nBrunson launched himself into rarefied air in both the Knicks and Association realms during the six-game win over the 76ers, notably capping the series off with at least 39 points in each of the final four games, including a franchise-record 47 in the Game 4 triumph at Wells Fargo Center last weekend.\n\nCarlisle learned how dangerous Brunson can be the hard way: Brunson scored 40 points in the Knicks' lone win against the Pacers this season, helping New York erase a 15-point deficit in a 109-105 triumph at MSG on Feb. 1. He was one of the few who publicly predicted Brunson's rise to metropolitan glory, notably awed when the Knicks and Pacers did battle in a preseason game in October 2022.\n\n\"Jalen Brunson's one of my favorite guys that I ever coached in however many years of coaching. Going back to my assistant days, it's been over 30 years, and he's just very, very special,\" Carlisle foretold, per Peter Botte of the New York Post. \"He's a winning player that would fit with any team at any level.

Getty Images\n\nThe first round of the 2024 NBA playoffs is in the books. The Cavaliers wrapped up the first round with a Game 7 comeback win over the Magic on Sunday afternoon. The Cavs advance to face the Celtics in the conference semifinals, and every second-round series is now set.\n\nThese second-round series, as the kids would say, look like fire. Minnesota vs. Denver kicked off second-round action Saturday night, and I'm here to tell you the Timberwolves are for real. They took a 1-0 series lead against the reigning champs in Denver.\n\nThe second West semifinal is No. 5 Dallas vs. No. 1 Oklahoma City. SGA vs. Luka? That series speaks for itself.\n\nIn the East, we have a throwback to the Reggie Miller/Patrick Ewing wars of the 90s with the No. 2 Knicks taking on the No. 6 Pacers. The 64-win Celtics, meanwhile, will try to make quick work of the fourth-seeded Cavs.\n\nBelow, our experts have weighed in with their predictions for all four second-round series.\n\nNuggets vs. Timberwolves\n\n(Note: These predictions were all made ahead of Nuggets-Wolves Game 1 on Saturday.)\n\nBrad Botkin James Herbert Jack Maloney Sam Quinn Colin Ward-Henninger Jasmyn Wimbish Nuggets vs. Timberwolves Nuggets Nuggets Nuggets Nuggets Nuggets Timberwolves\n\nBotkin: Nuggets in 6. This is tight. Minnesota can match up with Jokic without having to waste Gobert on him, leaving the likely DPOY as a roving rim protector, and the Wolves' collective ball pressure is up to the task of reasonably challenging Jamal Murray and Denver's two-man action. But in the end, the Nuggets know exactly where to go for high-leverage buckets. It won them close games against the Lakers, and it'll win them close games against Minnesota.\n\nHerbert: Nuggets in 7. Minnesota's first-round series was more impressive, and it has already shown it has the personnel to make the defending champs uncomfortable. If this series is as tight as I imagine it'll be, though, it makes sense to roll with the team that executes better in crunch time. (I'm assuming Jamal Murray is available and productive here; if not, uh-oh.)\n\nMaloney: Nuggets in 7. I have to admit that these teams' respective performances in the first round have made me slightly less confident in this prediction, but I don't want to overreact to those series. I've expected the Nuggets to come out of the West all season long, and while the Wolves will give them a real challenge, one team has Nikola Jokic and the other does not.\n\nQuinn: Nuggets in 7. I really struggled with this one, especially with Jamal Murray hobbled. No defense has more bodies to throw at Murray or Nikola Jokic. Anthony Edwards is peaking into superstardom at the perfect time. Minnesota's bench is far better than Denver's. The Timberwolves could very well win this series. I ultimately when Denver by the slimmest of margins. The Nuggets have home-court advantage. They have the best player in the world. Aaron Gordon and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope can give Edwards much more trouble than any Sun did, and Denver's at-the-level defense on pick-on-rolls is going to force the ball out of his hands more. I just worry that Minnesota is a few points of offense short in this matchup, but man, it could go either way.\n\nWard-Henninger: Nuggets in 6. I get all the reasons why the Wolves will give the defending champions problems -- familiarity, size/length and an absolute killer in Anthony Edwards. I just can't get there, given that I've watched the Nuggets eviscerate opponent after opponent during crunch time over the past two years. Denver had a plus-41(!) net rating in the clutch in their opening-round series win over the Lakers, and it only backs up the eye test. When it comes down to close games, which this series likely will, it's going to be Nikola Jokic and Jamal Murray against Anthony Edwards. As great as Ant has been, I know who I'm taking 10 times out of 10 in that situation -- or in this case, four out of six.\n\nWimbish: Timberwolves in 7. The Timberwolves gave the Nuggets some problems in the first round last year, and they split their regular=season matchups with each side winning two games. I know it's wild to go against Denver and Nikola Jokic, but Minnesota looked far more dominant than I expected in the first round. Granted the Suns had zero depth, but the combination of length, athleticism, scoring and oh yeah, Anthony Edwards, legitimately makes me think this team can dethrone Denver.\n\nKnicks vs. Pacers\n\nBrad Botkin James Herbert Jack Maloney Sam Quinn Colin Ward-Henninger Jasmyn Wimbish Knicks vs. Pacers Knicks Knicks Knicks Knicks Knicks Knicks\n\nBotkin: Knicks in 6. New York owns the offensive glass and Jalen Brunson has a huge series against a soft Indiana defense. With New York's rim protection, Indiana can't make enough 3s to keep up with what I think is going to be a huge series from the Knicks' shooters.\n\nHerbert: Knicks in 5. I think the Sixers series prepared New York well defensively, and I'm worried about the Pacers on the glass. It's possible that Tyrese Haliburton goes into his early season supernova mode and makes this prediction look silly, but I am not convinced that Indiana is sturdy enough on defense to expose the Knicks' over-reliance on Jalen Brunson.\n\nMaloney: Knicks in 6. What a contrast of styles here. It's going to be fascinating to see if the Knicks can grind down the Pacers and keep them in the half court. Ultimately I trust Jalen Brunson, the Knicks' defense and the Madison Square Garden crowd more than any of the Pacers' advantages.\n\nQuinn: Knicks in 4. What an absolute nightmare matchup for the Pacers. They rank 26th in defensive rebounding. The Knicks rank 1st in offensive rebounding. No team allows more paint points than Indiana. Their best back-court defender is T.J. McConnell, and yes, he'll bother Jalen Brunson with full-court pressure, but the Knicks aren't the Bucks. This isn't an old team you can wear down with pace and pressure. It's the opposite. the Knicks demand more stamina out of their best players than any other team. In a pure battle of execution, the Knicks are far better than the Pacers.\n\nWard-Henninger: Knicks in 5. This matchup is basically \"Opposite Day,\" with the Pacers playing at breakneck speed and the Knicks finishing with the slowest pace in the league during the regular season. To me, the Knicks will have an easier time getting the Pacers to acquiesce to their style than vice versa, and that's a recipe for disaster for Indiana. Jalen Brunson will relentlessly hunt Tyrese Haliburton and the Knicks will demolish the Pacers on the boards -- New York was first in the league in offensive rebounding, while Indiana was 26th in defensive rebounding. The Pacers want to spread you out and get you scrambling, but the Knicks are so disciplined and willing to give multiple defensive efforts that a lot of those easy points Indiana needs will be erased. The Pacers are a nice story, but the Knicks know exactly who they are and have executed brilliantly all season, even if their rotation is paper-thin.\n\nWimbish: Knicks in 6. This is going to be an interesting matchup up differing styles. The Pacers had the second-best offense all season, playing at a breakneck pace and dizzying their opponents with how quickly and efficiently they could score the ball. The Knicks play at the lowest pace, but wear an opponent down over the course of the game, with the No. 9 defense. It's literally water and oil combining here, but I'm going with Jalen Brunson and the Knicks to outlast Indiana. When the Pacers are on, they're cooking, but when they're not hitting their shots and struggling to defend, it's a rough watch.\n\nCeltics vs. Cavaliers\n\nBrad Botkin James Herbert Sam Quinn Colin Ward-Henninger Celtics vs. Cavaliers Celtics Celtics Celtics Celtics\n\nBotkin: Celtics in 5. Donovan Mitchell has one game huge enough for Cleveland to pull out a win, but Boston is way to much on both ends for a Cavs team that had to squeak past the Magic. This series won't last long.\n\nHerbert: Celtics in 5. I think the Cavs are better than they showed in their three losses against Orlando, but there are probably more blowouts in their future. I can't imagine the shock of trying to deal with all of Boston's shooters after packing the paint without any fear of consequences for a couple of weeks. (Thought about going with \"Celtics in six\" because of Kristaps Porzingis' injury, but, with Jarrett Allen's status up in the air and Boston killer Dean Wade having not played in almost a month, I couldn't get there.)\n\nQuinn: Celtics in 5. There was something fitting about the Magic and Cavaliers playing the final game of the first round. While the best teams had already long punched their tickets to Round 2, it almost felt like Orlando and Cleveland were playing in a glorified Play-In game for the right to lose to Boston. The level of offensive execution in that series compared to what awaits out of Boston is night and day. The Celtics might blow a game because that tends to happen to them against inferior opponents, but by and large, this series shouldn't be competitive.\n\nWard-Henninger: Celtics in 5. I'm giving the Cavs a game here just in case they have a hot shooting night or the Celtics' brains fall out of their heads during a fourth quarter, but yeah, this one shouldn't be close. The Cavs were less than inspiring in their first-round win over the Magic, with Donovan Mitchell basically their only source of offense. Well, guess who's fully rested, eagerly waiting to lock up Mitchell in the second round? Derrick White, Jrue Holiday, Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum! If Jarrett Allen returns, the Cavs' size could bother Boston, which is expected to be without Kristaps Porzingis for most, if not all of the series. But the Celtics have plenty of ways to counter a size disadvantage, and Cleveland's offense just won't be able to keep up.\n\nThunder vs. Mavericks\n\nBrad Botkin James Herbert Jack Maloney Sam Quinn Colin Ward-Henninger Jasmyn Wimbish Thunder vs. Mavericks Thunder Thunder Thunder Thunder Thunder Thunder\n\nBotkin: Thunder in 7. I am leaning toward OKC's defense in this one and I think the Thunder have the coaching edge if an adjustment or two ends up being the difference. But we are talking about two pretty similar teams with shooting around two elite one-on-one players in Luka Doncic/Kyrie Irving and Shai-Gilgeous Alexander/Jalen Williams. This looks like a hell of a series on paper. Flip your proverbial coin.\n\nHerbert: Thunder in 7. I'm shrugging my shoulders as I type this, and that's a good thing: This series should be awesome. It'll probably come down to whose role players shoot better, but I'll take OKC because I like its 5-out configuration more than Dallas' and I trust Mark Daigneault's ability to solve problems.\n\nMaloney: Thunder in 6. This has been the hardest pick for me to make, and I hope the series ends up reflecting that. Here's why I'm siding with the Thunder: they have the personnel to at least make life difficult on Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving and the Mavericks don't have the personnel to punish the Thunder's lack of size.\n\nQuinn: Thunder in 7. I'm expecting a series similar to the one the Mavericks and Clippers just played. A ton of help thrown at the best scorers on both sides, and a lot of questionable shooters left open. We've never seen these Dallas centers play in a true five-out matchup, and the Thunder are going to stretch them away from the rim all series. I lean Oklahoma City because I trust their worst shooters more than I trust Dallas', and because I think Oklahoma City is slightly better-positioned to defend straight up.\n\nWard-Henninger: Thunder in 7. It may be because the Pelicans were hobbled, but I can't get over how great OKC looked in the first round. The only knock on them -- the only REAL knock -- is that they're young and inexperienced. Well, outside of Kyrie Irving and Luka Doncic, so are the Mavericks. The Thunder were third in offense this season and fourth in defense. They can play fast or slow. They can play big or small. Chet Holmgren is the ultimate rim-protecting antidote for any penetration from the Mavericks' dynamic backcourt. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander is a cheat code for instant offense. I just don't see many weaknesses for OKC, so it will basically come down to the individual talents of Irving and Doncic ripping out their hearts. This is a guess that will only happen in three out of the seven games, but it's a total toss-up.\n\nWimbish: Thunder in 7. This is going to be the most entertaining second-round matchup. The narratives, young stars and MVP debates alone will provide so many talking points. The actual basketball should be compelling too, and while the Thunder skated through the first round, the same won't be true against Dallas. The combination of Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving can be lethal for opposing teams, with one guy dominating in the first half while the other guy picks up the slack in the last two quarters. But the Thunder have unreal depth, and it's not just \"sit out at the 3-point line and launch shots\" type of depth that Dallas possesses. It's going to be incredibly difficult for the Mavericks to contain Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Jalen Williams while also accounting for Chet Holmgren who is having a standout playoff debut averaging 15.3 points, over eight rebounds and nearly three blocks. I don't trust Dallas' role players to knock down enough shots this series for them to beat OKC.", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Since the 2013-14 season, this was their first postseason success over the first round. Despite Joel Embiid's stellar performance, the Philadelphia 76ers suffered a sad loss to the New York Knicks.\n\nPacers advance past Bucks in NBA playoffs\n\nThe Indiana Pacers defeated the Milwaukee Bucks, 120-98 in a dominant Game 6 at Gainbridge Fieldhouse. They earned their first trip to the NBA playoffs' second round since 2014.\n\nWith Giannis Antetokounmpo injured, they relied on Damian Lillard's comeback from an injury. Lillard scored 28 points, but it was unable to stop the Pacers' unrelenting attack.\n\nOn the other hand, the Pacers showed depth and resiliency. Tyrese Haliburton's lead of 17 points and 10 assists and Pascal Siakam's 19 points. Andrew Nembhard's 14 and Aaron Nesmith's 15 off the bench strengthened their triumph.\n\nThe Pacers dominated the Bucks, which limited their opportunities to score. Bobby Portis recorded a double-double with 20 points and 15 rebounds. While Milwaukee's Brook Lopez scored 20 points.\n\nWith the victory, the Pacers have now won six straight postseason series.\n\nSixers' season closes with Knicks' win\n\nMeanwhile, the New York Knicks secured a vital win with Josh Hart's clutch shot, igniting chants of \"Let's go Knicks!\" in Philadelphia's home court. Despite Joel Embiid's bold effort, Donte DiVincenzo secured the win for New York with two free throws.\n\nKnicks coach Tom Thibodeau described the fourth quarter as a flurry of pivotal plays. It highlighted the resilience of his team in crucial moments.\n\nThe former Villanova Wildcats trio played vital roles in saving the Knicks from a fall. In line with this, DiVincenzo contributed 23 points in 48 minutes and Hart added 16.\n\nFor Hart, redemption was sweet after a missed free throw in Game 5. But his play in Game 6 proved pivotal in securing the series victory.\n\nDespite a fine performance from Embiid who finished with 39 points and 13 rebounds. Embiid's prime was once again lost, and the Sixers faced another disappointing postseason exit.\n\nBoth Pacers and Knicks are now advancing to the second round of the NBA Playoffs.", "source": {"uri": "scoutmediaph.rappler.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "AMAPS"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jk_gamora@scoutmediaph.rappler.com", "name": "Jk Gamora", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Bucks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Bucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damian_Lillard", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Damian Lillard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gainbridge_Fieldhouse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gainbridge Fieldhouse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Embiid", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joel Embiid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_76ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia 76ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Nesmith", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Nesmith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-double", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Double-double"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Nembhard", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Nembhard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobby_Portis", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bobby Portis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giannis_Antetokounmpo", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Giannis Antetokounmpo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brook_Lopez", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brook Lopez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Hart", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Josh Hart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donte_DiVincenzo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donte DiVincenzo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villanova_Wildcats_men's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Villanova Wildcats men's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Thibodeau", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tom Thibodeau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_throw", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free throw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games/Spectrangle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games/Spectrangle", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://scoutmediaph.rappler.com/tachyon/sites/11/2024/05/photo_2024-05-04_22-31-36.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9539735", "eventUri": "eng-9539735", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-03", "textStart": 122, "textEnd": 127}], "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

Tyrese Haliburton and the Pacers disposed of the East's much-touted 'Championship contender' in just 6 games. Now they will be facing the New York Knicks, who should present a tougher matchup for the Indiana side. Tyrese Haliburton's Game 6 heroics have broken the decade-long playoff drought in Indiana. They will look to continue their winning ways against the Knicks, which shouldn't be a difficult task, as per some resurfaced comments of TNT analysts Charles Barkley and Shaquille O'Neal from months ago.\n\nRegardless of the Knicks' great form all season long, NBA legends Shaquille O'Neal and Charles Barkley already have the Pacers stealing the contest, as per predictions the duo made almost a month ago. During an Inside the NBA broadcast, Barkley aired his views on a then hypothetical playoff matchup between the Knicks and Pacers, \"If they play in the playoffs...the Pacers beat the Knicks.\"\n\nThe X account of New York Basketball recently resurfaced a clip of the comments. In the clip, Shaq could also be seen agreeing with the Chuckster's assessment, \"I agree with you Chuck.\"\n\nFast forward to present times, and Barkley is still standing his ground. After the Pacers made light work of Damian Lillard and the Bucks in the first round, Sir Charles was informed of the upcoming Pacers-Knicks matchup for the second round of the playoffs. Remembering his predictions from a month ago, Barkley provided his insights on the upcoming series,\n\n\"I think it's going to be a fabulous series. Personally, I like the Pacers in the series. I think their depth and their scoring ability are going to be a huge advantage for them.\"\n\nLooking at the two teams' regular season records against each other, it's obvious that the Pacers have emerged as the better team on most occasions. The Indiana team had a 2-1 advantage over New York side in this year's season series. But it's important to note that both teams have shown great form since then. The Indiana side has gotten significantly better adding 2-time All-Star Pascal Siakam to their fold. Meanwhile, Knicks fans will be counting on Jalen Brunson's meteoric rise as a MVP-caliber player to take them home.\n\nWhile addressing possible concerns for Haliburton and the Pacers ahead of their Knicks matchup, TNT hosts Shaq and Barkley named the fans in New York as being one of the biggest headaches to deal with for the opposing team in a playoff setting. What the duo forgot was that Knicks fans don't just go after their rivals, but also members of the media who choose to bet against their home team.\n\nKnicks fans did just that, storming the comments section of the post that showcased Barkley and Shaq picking the Pacers over the Knicks. The fans didn't go easy on the two Hall Of Famers at all. One fan wrote,\n\n\"Bro, what r these guys smoking?\"\n\nAnother fan doubled down on the duo's lack of enthusiasm for the game, asking them if they even watched the games properly,\n\n\"They don't watch the teams. The Pacers have zero defense.\"\n\nSetting the expectations for the upcoming series, another fan correctly pointed out,\n\n\"We can't act surprised if the Pacers win this series. The Knicks are down two key pieces and the Pacers are coming in being the far healthier team.\"", "source": {"uri": "thesportsrush.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsRush"}, "authors": [{"uri": "trikansh_kher@thesportsrush.com", "name": "Trikansh Kher", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaquille_O'Neal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shaquille O'Neal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Barkley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Charles Barkley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Bucks", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Bucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TNT_(American_TV_network)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TNT (American TV network)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inside_the_NBA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inside the NBA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damian_Lillard", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Damian Lillard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Brunson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://cdn-wp.thesportsrush.com/2024/05/83060529-nba-2024-05-05t210922.855.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9539735", "eventUri": "eng-9539735", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

Bird averaged 28 points per game in 16 career playoff games against the Knicks, including a 39-point performance in Game 7 of the 1984 Eastern Conference semifinals.\n\nThe Knicks and Heat also had an intense rivalry in the 1990s, and perhaps nothing symbolized that more than Mourning dragging then-Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy on his leg during a brawl in the first round of the 1998 Eastern Conference playoffs.\n\nEmbiid stamped his place as a Knicks villain during this year's first-round series with a number of dirty plays, including dragging down Mitchell Robinson by the leg. Embiid heard chants of \"(Expletive) Embiid!\" throughout the series, which ended with the Knicks winning in six games. Embiid might be hearing that from the MSG crowd for years to come.\n\nYoung heard derisive chants from the MSG crowd during the 2021 playoffs, but Young responded by leading Atlanta to a first-round series win in five games. Young averaged 29.2 points and 9.8 assists in that series while shooting 44.1 percent from the field and 34.1 percent from the perimeter. Young relished the chants - who can forget him bowing at midcourt after eliminating the Knicks - and at times egged fans on.\n\nNot much of an explanation is needed here. Jordan and the Bulls stood right in the Knicks' way throughout the 1990s. Jordan owned them during those years, including a 55-point performance in 1996, the most he ever scored against the Knicks. Jordan faced the Knicks in five playoffs series, and won all of them.\n\nWho else could it be?\n\nMiller relished the role of villain and constantly reminded Knicks fans of it. From giving Spike Lee the choke gesture in Game 5 of the Eastern Conference Finals to when he scored eight straight points in 8.9 seconds to steal a Pacers victory from the Knicks in Game 1 of the 1995 conference semifinals, Miller became one of the Knicks' most hated rivals. And fans surely haven't forgotten it.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Embiid", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joel Embiid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison_Square_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Madison Square Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitchell_Robinson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mitchell Robinson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Van_Gundy", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jeff Van Gundy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spike_Lee", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spike Lee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bulls", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bulls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/3kXpMKahpR3v3mTHsYQg4g--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD0xODAxO2NmPXdlYnA-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the-bergen-record/46ae45877b5075eac5a410e91f1de0d7", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9539735", "eventUri": "eng-9539735", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2156862745098039, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

After this, many people believed they would have an early end to their season. However, to everyone' surprise Jalen Brunson took matters into his own hands and led the team into the Conference Semifinals. However, despite the first-round success, Draymond Green is shockingly still not willing to give the Knicks his co-sign as a potential title winner this season.\n\nOn a recent episode of The Draymond Green Show, the Warriors star said he is happy for Brunson and the Knicks for their first-round win, but they're not going to the promised land this season. The major reason why he is in denial of their chances is that Brunson is a ball-heavy player and that would prove to be fatal for the Knicks as they go deeper into the season.\n\nAs he said this, Green did make it clear to the fans that he is not hating on their game and that he is only stating what he believes is a fact.\n\nHe said, \"A ball-dominant Jalen Brunson ain't gonna get you to the promised land.\" According to Green, they would even end up clearing the Pacers in the second round, but the climb up from there would be difficult if the Knicks don't find a way to make other players get just as involved in shooting. Green stated, \"I said you can't get to the promised land. And quite frankly, if I'm being honest. I still don't think you can.\", per Clutchpoints.\n\nThe Warriors star said that he has the utmost respect for Brunson and with his performance in the postseason so far. He stated that Brunson's ability to bounce back after having a few bad games is admirable and if he continues to develop his game like this, he'll only become a better player with time.\n\nDespite what he said, one has to wonder just how highly Green really thinks of the Knicks if he has already come out with such a strong prediction about their season. That said, being a four-time NBA champion, the Warriors star knows what it takes to reach the summit more than most ever will. So, perhaps his words really do come from a place of analysis and nowhere else.\n\nOf course, Green had a few encouraging words to say as well. And as one might expect, he was not the only one.\n\nPaul Pierce initially wasn't on board the Brunson hype train. He was in denial of the Knicks and their chances to make an impact. As it turned out, Pierce was wrong in his assessment, yet the NBA legend has no shame in admitting that he had it all wrong. On an episode of UNDISPUTED, he said, \"Did I know Jalen Brunson was gonna play well? I thought he'd play well but I didn't know he was gonna play this well.\"\n\nWhile The Truth had a late change of heart, the New York Knicks purist inside Stephen A. Smith always kept his hopes alive. As a superfan of the franchise, the media veteran seems to be on cloud nine with all the success they've had so far.\n\nIn addition to that, SAS is also willing to go out on a limb to predict their fate in the east. On an episode of The Stephen A. Smith Show, he said, \"My Knicks are going to the Conference Finals.\" Before anyone could call him out on it, SAS said that it's not a delusion and he's just confident in his team.\n\nThe Knicks are indeed on somewhat of a hot streak at the moment, having done so well against the Philadelphia 76ers. That said, can they really win it all this season?", "source": {"uri": "thesportsrush.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsRush"}, "authors": [{"uri": "prateek_singh@thesportsrush.com", "name": "Prateek Singh", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_A._Smith", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stephen A.

Getty Images\n\nThe first round of the 2024 NBA playoffs is in the books save for one series: Orlando is at Cleveland for Game 7 on Sunday, with the winner earning the distinct pleasure of facing the Celtics in the conference semis. So far, we have had two seeding upsets, with the No. 5 Mavericks eliminating the No. 4 Clippers and the No. 6 Pacers taking out the No. 3 Bucks. No. 5 Orlando could be the third to erase some chalk.\n\nMoving forward, these second-round series, as the kids would say, look like fire. Minnesota vs. Denver kicks off second-round action Saturday night, and I'm here to tell you the Timberwolves are for real with the bodies to match up with Nikola Jokic and the pressure perimeter defense to make life difficult on Jamal Murray.\n\nThe second West semifinal is No. 5 Dallas vs. No. 1 Oklahoma City. That series speaks for itself.\n\nIn the East, we have a throwback to the Reggie Miller/Patrick Ewing wars of the 90s with the No. 2 Knicks taking on the No. 6 Pacers. Below, our experts have weighed in with their predictions for each of the three series that we know of to this point. When we find out who is playing Boston, those picks will be along shortly after.\n\nNuggets vs. Timberwolves\n\nBrad Botkin James Herbert Jack Maloney Sam Quinn Colin Ward-Henninger Jasmyn Wimbish Nuggets vs. Timberwolves Nuggets Nuggets Nuggets Nuggets Nuggets Timberwolves\n\nBotkin: Nuggets in 6. This is tight. Minnesota can match up with Jokic without having to waste Gobert on him, leaving the likely DPOY as a roving rim protector, and the Wolves' collective ball pressure is up to the task of reasonably challenging Jamal Murray and Denver's two-man action. But in the end, the Nuggets know exactly where to go for high-leverage buckets. It won them close games against the Lakers, and it'll win them close games against Minnesota.\n\nHerbert: Nuggets in 7. Minnesota's first-round series was more impressive, and it has already shown it has the personnel to make the defending champs uncomfortable. If this series is as tight as I imagine it'll be, though, it makes sense to roll with the team that executes better in crunch time. (I'm assuming Jamal Murray is available and productive here; if not, uh-oh.)\n\nMaloney: Nuggets in 7. I have to admit that these teams' respective performances in the first round have made me slightly less confident in this prediction, but I don't want to overreact to those series. I've expected the Nuggets to come out of the West all season long, and while the Wolves will give them a real challenge, one team has Nikola Jokic and the other does not.\n\nQuinn: Nuggets in 7. I really struggled with this one, especially with Jamal Murray hobbled. No defense has more bodies to throw at Murray or Nikola Jokic. Anthony Edwards is peaking into superstardom at the perfect time. Minnesota's bench is far better than Denver's. The Timberwolves could very well win this series. I ultimately when Denver by the slimmest of margins. The Nuggets have home-court advantage. They have the best player in the world. Aaron Gordon and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope can give Edwards much more trouble than any Sun did, and Denver's at-the-level defense on pick-on-rolls is going to force the ball out of his hands more. I just worry that Minnesota is a few points of offense short in this matchup, but man, it could go either way.\n\nWard-Henninger: Nuggets in 6. I get all the reasons why the Wolves will give the defending champions problems -- familiarity, size/length and an absolute killer in Anthony Edwards. I just can't get there, given that I've watched the Nuggets eviscerate opponent after opponent during crunch time over the past two years. Denver had a plus-41(!) net rating in the clutch in their opening-round series win over the Lakers, and it only backs up the eye test. When it comes down to close games, which this series likely will, it's going to be Nikola Jokic and Jamal Murray against Anthony Edwards. As great as Ant has been, I know who I'm taking 10 times out of 10 in that situation -- or in this case, four out of six.\n\nWimbish: Timberwolves in 7. The Timberwolves gave the Nuggets some problems in the first round last year, and they split their regular=season matchups with each side winning two games. I know it's wild to go against Denver and Nikola Jokic, but Minnesota looked far more dominant than I expected in the first round. Granted the Suns had zero depth, but the combination of length, athleticism, scoring and oh yeah, Anthony Edwards, legitimately makes me think this team can dethrone Denver.\n\nKnicks vs. Pacers\n\nBrad Botkin James Herbert Jack Maloney Sam Quinn Colin Ward-Henninger Jasmyn Wimbish Knicks vs. Pacers Knicks Knicks Knicks Knicks Knicks Knicks\n\nBotkin: Knicks in 6. New York owns the offensive glass and Jalen Brunson has a huge series against a soft Indiana defense. With New York's rim protection, Indiana can't make enough 3s to keep up with what I think is going to be a huge series from the Knicks' shooters.\n\nHerbert: Knicks in 5. I think the Sixers series prepared New York well defensively, and I'm worried about the Pacers on the glass. It's possible that Tyrese Haliburton goes into his early season supernova mode and makes this prediction look silly, but I am not convinced that Indiana is sturdy enough on defense to expose the Knicks' over-reliance on Jalen Brunson.\n\nMaloney: Knicks in 6. What a contrast of styles here. It's going to be fascinating to see if the Knicks can grind down the Pacers and keep them in the half court. Ultimately I trust Jalen Brunson, the Knicks' defense and the Madison Square Garden crowd more than any of the Pacers' advantages.\n\nQuinn: Knicks in 4. What an absolute nightmare matchup for the Pacers. They rank 26th in defensive rebounding. The Knicks rank 1st in offensive rebounding. No team allows more paint points than Indiana. Their best back-court defender is T.J. McConnell, and yes, he'll bother Jalen Brunson with full-court pressure, but the Knicks aren't the Bucks. This isn't an old team you can wear down with pace and pressure. It's the opposite. the Knicks demand more stamina out of their best players than any other team. In a pure battle of execution, the Knicks are far better than the Pacers.\n\nWard-Henninger: Knicks in 5. This matchup is basically \"Opposite Day,\" with the Pacers playing at breakneck speed and the Knicks finishing with the slowest pace in the league during the regular season. To me, the Knicks will have an easier time getting the Pacers to acquiesce to their style than vice versa, and that's a recipe for disaster for Indiana. Jalen Brunson will relentlessly hunt Tyrese Haliburton and the Knicks will demolish the Pacers on the boards -- New York was first in the league in offensive rebounding, while Indiana was 26th in defensive rebounding. The Pacers want to spread you out and get you scrambling, but the Knicks are so disciplined and willing to give multiple defensive efforts that a lot of those easy points Indiana needs will be erased. The Pacers are a nice story, but the Knicks know exactly who they are and have executed brilliantly all season, even if their rotation is paper-thin.\n\nWimbish: Knicks in 6. This is going to be an interesting matchup up differing styles. The Pacers had the second-best offense all season, playing at a breakneck pace and dizzying their opponents with how quickly and efficiently they could score the ball. The Knicks play at the lowest pace, but wear an opponent down over the course of the game, with the No. 9 defense. It's literally water and oil combining here, but I'm going with Jalen Brunson and the Knicks to outlast Indiana. When the Pacers are on, they're cooking, but when they're not hitting their shots and struggling to defend, it's a rough watch.\n\nThunder vs. Mavericks\n\nBrad Botkin James Herbert Jack Maloney Sam Quinn Colin Ward-Henninger Jasmyn Wimbish Thunder vs. Mavericks Thunder Thunder Thunder Thunder Thunder Thunder\n\nBotkin: Thunder in 7. I am leaning toward OKC's defense in this one and I think the Thunder have the coaching edge if an adjustment or two ends up being the difference. But we are talking about two pretty similar teams with shooting around two elite one-on-one players in Luka Doncic/Kyrie Irving and Shai-Gilgeous Alexander/Jalen Williams. This looks like a hell of a series on paper. Flip your proverbial coin.\n\nHerbert: Thunder in 7. I'm shrugging my shoulders as I type this, and that's a good thing: This series should be awesome. It'll probably come down to whose role players shoot better, but I'll take OKC because I like its 5-out configuration more than Dallas' and I trust Mark Daigneault's ability to solve problems.\n\nMaloney: Thunder in 6. This has been the hardest pick for me to make, and I hope the series ends up reflecting that. Here's why I'm siding with the Thunder: they have the personnel to at least make life difficult on Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving and the Mavericks don't have the personnel to punish the Thunder's lack of size.\n\nQuinn: Thunder in 7. I'm expecting a series similar to the one the Mavericks and Clippers just played. A ton of help thrown at the best scorers on both sides, and a lot of questionable shooters left open. We've never seen these Dallas centers play in a true five-out matchup, and the Thunder are going to stretch them away from the rim all series. I lean Oklahoma City because I trust their worst shooters more than I trust Dallas', and because I think Oklahoma City is slightly better-positioned to defend straight up.\n\nWard-Henninger: Thunder in 7. It may be because the Pelicans were hobbled, but I can't get over how great OKC looked in the first round. The only knock on them -- the only REAL knock -- is that they're young and inexperienced. Well, outside of Kyrie Irving and Luka Doncic, so are the Mavericks. The Thunder were third in offense this season and fourth in defense. They can play fast or slow. They can play big or small. Chet Holmgren is the ultimate rim-protecting antidote for any penetration from the Mavericks' dynamic backcourt. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander is a cheat code for instant offense. I just don't see many weaknesses for OKC, so it will basically come down to the individual talents of Irving and Doncic ripping out their hearts. This is a guess that will only happen in three out of the seven games, but it's a total toss-up.\n\nWimbish: Thunder in 7. This is going to be the most entertaining second-round matchup. The narratives, young stars and MVP debates alone will provide so many talking points. The actual basketball should be compelling too, and while the Thunder skated through the first round, the same won't be true against Dallas. The combination of Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving can be lethal for opposing teams, with one guy dominating in the first half while the other guy picks up the slack in the last two quarters. But the Thunder have unreal depth, and it's not just \"sit out at the 3-point line and launch shots\" type of depth that Dallas possesses. It's going to be incredibly difficult for the Mavericks to contain Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Jalen Williams while also accounting for Chet Holmgren who is having a standout playoff debut averaging 15.3 points, over eight rebounds and nearly three blocks. I don't trust Dallas' role players to knock down enough shots this series for them to beat OKC.", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Looking at Knicks guard's status for Game 1 (May 6)", "body": "Battling numerous injuries, the Knicks advanced past Philadelphia in the first round, thanks to a tight seven-man rotation. As the slowest team in the NBA this season, this approach may not be effective against the Pacers, though.\n\nAn effective strategy against Indiana might be leveraging the league's top offensive rebounding percentage, a key factor in their victory over the 76ers. In the last four games of the first round, Jalen Brunson averaged 41.2 points and 10.3 assists per game, shooting 49.2%. He has proved that he can lead New York's offense single-handedly.\n\nEven with a focus on offense, defense remains the hallmark of New York's game. Coupled with top-notch rebounding, the Knicks were the sixth-best team in rim protection in the regular season.\n\nThey maintained their defensive consistency in the playoffs, allowing the same average points per game in the first round as in the regular season, at 108.2. They also limited free throw attempts, ranking fourth-lowest, but that came at the expense of less effective 3-point defense.\n\nHow they adapt to a Pacers team that challenged them in the regular season will be interesting.\n\nWhat happened to Jalen Brunson?\n\nJalen Brunson's injury history has been a source of concern for the Knicks this season. He sustained a left knee injury during a collision with Isaiah Hartenstein in a March 3 win over the Cleveland Cavaliers.\n\nAlthough MRI results revealed no significant damage, Brunson sat out the next game against the Atlanta Hawks.\n\nThe injury came shortly after he hada missed a game due to cervical spasms in his neck before facing the New Orleans Pelicans on Feb. 27. Earlier in the season, Brunson also missed a game following a right ankle sprain suffered against the Memphis Grizzlies on Feb. 7.\n\nHow to watch Game 1 between Indiana Pacers vs New York Knicks?\n\nThe highly anticipated Game 1 between the Indiana Pacers and the New York Knicks will tip off at 7:30 p.m. ET at the Madison Square Garden in New York.\n\nThe game will be nationally televised on TNT and Tru TV, including radio networks available on Sirius XM and ESPN NY 98.7. It will also be available for live streaming on Fubo TV and NBA League Pass, which gives viewers access to NBA TV for a week's worth of free trial.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tanay_sahai@sportskeeda.com", "name": "Tanay Sahai", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Brunson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_76ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia 76ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_throw", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free throw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TNT_(American_TV_network)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TNT (American TV network)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_League_Pass", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA League Pass"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_TV", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TruTV", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TruTV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memphis_Grizzlies", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Memphis Grizzlies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Hawks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Hawks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Orleans_Pelicans", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Orleans Pelicans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison_Square_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Madison Square Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FuboTV", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FuboTV"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Computer_Platforms", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Computer Platforms", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Game_Studies/Education", "label": "dmoz/Games/Game Studies/Education", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2024/05/23182873-1714985144.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9539735", "eventUri": "eng-9539735", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-03-03", "textStart": 1350, "textEnd": 1357}, {"amb": false, "date": "-02-27", "textStart": 1633, "textEnd": 1640}, {"amb": false, "date": "-02-07", "textStart": 1765, "textEnd": 1771}], "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

But I will beat him to a pulp.\"", "body": "It's time for Round 2 of the NBA Battle Royale as the Knicks will host the Pacers in New York for Game 1 of their second-round matchup on Monday, May 6.\n\nNew York took a few days off but went back to work throughout the weekend getting ready for what's coming to town to start the week, which is a very resilient and spry team led by an All-Star point guard. Sounds familiar?\n\nHere is what some Manhattanites and Hoosiers have said leading up to Monday's affair.\n\nOn the Indiana Pacers and what they'll bring to the Knicks table...\n\n\"The strengths of their team, that's not gonna change. They're an uptempo team. I think they average 113 in the playoffs. So we know that we gotta protect our basket.\"\n\n\"They've got good shooting, point guards. They've got Siakam. They've got [Myles] Turner. So they got a lot of weapons. A lot of pick-and-rolls. You got multiple point guards on the floor at the same time, so a lot of slips, a lot of flares.\"\n\n\"The main thing is the strengths of the players doesn't change. You gotta know what they do and you gotta know them inside and out.\"\n\n\"Great player. Didn't really know him until -- like, I knew of him, we met a couple of times -- but we didn't really become friends until last summer.\"\n\n\"Great guy, great family. He became one of my friends, obviously through that [experience at the FIBA World Cup], and I have all the respect in the world for him and the way he plays the game.\"\n\n\"He goes out there and plays the right way and does what he needs to do.\"\n\nOn the matchup against Indiana and how to attack and defend the Pacers...\n\n\"You're always adjusting. You can't, I guess, force a team to play your style. It depends on game by game, what's going on.\"\n\n\"After the first game, we're going to have to adjust whether we win or lose. Adjusting is how you win these types of things.\"\n\n\"Obviously, we want to play Knicks basketball, they're going to try to play Pacers basketball. It's going to be a grind. It's going to be a battle.\"\n\nOn the Knicks vs. Pacers rivalry...\n\n\"Whatever happened in the past is in the past. We've got to learn from it and move on. So going into this series we just know that this team runs the floor, they share the ball, they're a good shooting team, they play fast, all that stuff. We have to know we have a really good team coming to New York.\"\n\nOn what makes the Pacers dangerous...\n\n\"They get the ball out quick, throw it ahead. They get up a lot of threes. They just play really fast, probably the highest pace in the league, the way they play. So it'll be challenging for us to get back on defense.\"\n\nOn the preparation getting into a new series, this time against Indiana...\n\n\"It's an emphasis in film. Coach does a good job preparing us for that and we know coming into it to be ready for that. Definitely from game one to the next game to the next, the game changes. You learn more about an opponent each game and you're more prepared, of course, as well. The playoffs is just naturally slower tempo.\"\n\nOn how the Knicks will try to limit Pascal Siakam's production...\n\n\"Just to try to make him uncomfortable. He's a great player. He can shoot from really far. So just try to pick him up early and dictate which direction he goes. Don't let him choose which direction he goes -- force him away and then go from there.\"\n\nOn his comments about not liking Indiana...\n\n\"I love Indiana. Indiana's a great city. They have a lot of things going for them, like I always said, [such as] Long's Bakery. Indiana's a good city.\"\n\nOn whether or not he expects to get booed in Games 3 and 4 in Indy...\n\n\"I hope not, man, I love Indiana, but do I think I'll probably get booed? Probably. It's funny. But for me it's always like, I don't mind it. That's their job. Their job is to boo, to get loud, cheer for their team.\"\n\n\"So, like I said, as long as I can get some Long's Bakery donuts I'll be solid.\"\n\nOn Donte DiVincenzo's assignment on Tyrese Haliburton and its importance...\n\n\"It's gonna be huge. So obviously Donte's gonna have to be -- his defense and being solid is going to be huge for us.\"\n\n\"When Tyrese picks up the pace, he's an engine unto himself.\"\n\nOn playing in New York City and in the playoffs...\n\n\"Growing up playing basketball these are the moments that you dream of, these are the moments that you prepare for. These are moments that you want. In those moments or those games, for me, I love it just because the energy is there, the competitiveness. That's the biggest thing for me.\"\n\nOn Jimmy Butler's comments...\n\n\"I don't know why my name came up. I'm over here, just vibing, minding my own business, trying to have fun. That's all.\"\n\nOn his upcoming matchup with Pacers star point guard Tyrese Haliburton...\n\n\"It's not about taking away things from him: It's collectively outscoring them and limiting what they want to do. You're not going to take [him] away. He's an All-Star for a reason.\"\n\n\"It's collectively what [Haliburton] wants to get to, and what do we want to take away? What do we want to live with throughout the series, and it's gonna be a back-and-forth battle of that.\"\n\n\"You're not going to go into a matchup and just say all right we're going to take away X, Y, Z and you're just going to take it away. They're too good to do that. You just try to slow them down.\"\n\n\"It's competing. No matter what Tyrese likes to get to, if you compete hard enough on the ball, it takes some of that stuff away.\"\n\nOn his strong defense on Tyerese Maxey in the Game 6 victory over Philadelphia...\n\n\"I was very locked in for that game, honestly. The series initially wasn't going personally my way; but also it was that internal conversation of getting myself going guarding Tyrese and getting back to who I am.\"\n\nOn how he's approaching the series against his former team...\n\n\"I feel like I'm preparing myself just like I did for Milwaukee. Just locking into everything the coaches are telling us to do offensively and defensively, and playing my role.\"\n\n\"Literally the first call I had after we made the playoffs was a FaceTime with Jalen. So we're pretty good friends, but it's competition and fully excited to play against those guys.\"\n\nOn his time with Brunson and Josh Hart while playing for Team USA...\n\n\"I kind of got roped into that group. It was fun, we have a group chat that we talk in all the time, those are good friends of mine. So I'm excited for all the shenanigans of who Josh Hart is as a human being, and just excited to play against those guys.\"\n\nOn Brunson being the best Knicks player since Walt Frazier...\n\n\"And Brunson, I'm telling you, Brunson's the best thing since Walt Frazier. I know somebody gonna say, 'What about Patrick (Ewing) and Carmelo (Anthony)?' OK, they didn't do this. I mean, you know, they got a chance to show. We need more players. Brunson's playing without Julius (Randle), and what he's doing man, hey, it's incredible. Keep doing it.\"\n\nOn Brunson not being the best Knicks player since Walt Frazier (in response to Oakley's comments)...\n\n\"We love Oak, but Oak made Jalen Brunson's greatest New York Knicks basketball player since Clyde Frazier. Time out. Are you kidding me? I love you Oak, but what are we doing?\"\n\n\"Let me introduce you to the greatest, not just since Clyde Frazier, the greatest New York Knicks basketball player of all time. That includes everybody. You include everybody that ever played in the blue and orange and you put them on the draft board, the number one pick is Patrick Ewing.\"", "source": {"uri": "postingandtoasting.com", "dataType":

These two teams met each other six times from 1993-2000 in the playoffs.\n\nThis time around, it's Jalen Brunson vs. Tyrese Haliburton. It's a high-flying Indiana offense against the team-first, physical Knicks. It's going to be supreme postseason theatre.\n\n*If necessary\n\nDefense and rebounding win championships: The Pacers had the NBA's best offense in the regular season, which will put the Knicks' staunch defense to the test, but there is a clear discrepancy in two of the game's most important aspects. New York dominated the glass during the regular season and did for long stretches of their first-round series against the 76ers. The return of Mitchell Robinson helps and gives the Knicks a clear edge over a Pacers team that ranked 28th in rebounding this year. Snuffing out second-chance points and slowing down an efficient offense will be vital.\n\nIndiana's defense has been susceptible to down nights this season. They allowed over 120 points per game, which ranked 27th in the league, while opponents shot over 49% from the field. That ranked dead-last in the NBA. New York's offense could have some big nights this series.\n\nBrunson on big stage: The brighter the lights, the bigger Jalen Brunson appears to play. New York's superstar continued his MVP-worthy season in the first round of the postseason, shaking off mediocre showings in Games 1 and 2 to take over when it mattered most. In the final four games against Philadelphia, the All-Star averaged 41.8 points and 10.3 assists per game on 49.2% shooting from the field. He has shown an ability to carry the Knicks when needed with the tenacity to shoulder the high expectations that come with leading a championship-starved franchise in the postseason.\n\nHe is scoring from everywhere and doing practically everything right.\n\nBig-man rotation: The Knicks neutralized Joel Embiid enough in the first round and have another stiff test in Indiana's Pascal Siakam in Round 2. The power forward led his team with 22.3 points and 8.8 rebounds per game against Milwaukee and figures to be a central figure in Indiana's attack.\n\nHe will be an assignment of the team's best defender in OG Anunoby, but will also receive plenty of help from Precious Achiuwa. Robinson and Isaiah Hartenstein will also help securing the front court as they did in the first round when they held Embiid and Tobias Harris to just 43.9% shooting from the field.", "source": {"uri": "amny.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "amNewYork"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joe_pantorno@amny.com", "name": "Joe Pantorno", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reggie_Miller", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Reggie Miller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Brunson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Points_per_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Points per game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_76ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia 76ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O.G._Anunoby", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "O.G.

Larry Bird, Boston Celtics\n\nThe Celtics so often were a thorn in the Knicks' side during their playoff meetings in the 1980s, Bird was clearly right in the middle of it all. Bird averaged 28 points per game in 16 career playoff games against the Knicks, including a 39-point performance in Game 7 of the 1984 Eastern Conference semifinals.\n\n5. Alonzo Mourning, Miami Heat\n\nThe Knicks and Heat also had an intense rivalry in the 1990s, and perhaps nothing symbolized that more than Mourning dragging then-Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy on his leg during a brawl in the first round of the 1998 Eastern Conference playoffs.\n\n4. Joel Embiid, Philadelphia 76ers\n\nEmbiid stamped his place as a Knicks villain during this year's first-round series with a number of dirty plays, including dragging down Mitchell Robinson by the leg. Embiid heard chants of \"(Expletive) Embiid!\" throughout the series, which ended with the Knicks winning in six games. Embiid might be hearing that from the MSG crowd for years to come.\n\n3. Trae Young, Atlanta Hawks\n\nYoung heard derisive chants from the MSG crowd during the 2021 playoffs, but Young responded by leading Atlanta to a first-round series win in five games. Young averaged 29.2 points and 9.8 assists in that series while shooting 44.1 percent from the field and 34.1 percent from the perimeter. Young relished the chants - who can forget him bowing at midcourt after eliminating the Knicks - and at times egged fans on.\n\n2. Michael Jordan, Chicago Bulls\n\nNot much of an explanation is needed here. Jordan and the Bulls stood right in the Knicks' way throughout the 1990s. Jordan owned them during those years, including a 55-point performance in 1996, the most he ever scored against the Knicks. Jordan faced the Knicks in five playoffs series, and won all of them.\n\nMiller relished the role of villain and constantly reminded Knicks fans of it. From giving Spike Lee the choke gesture in Game 5 of the Eastern Conference Finals to when he scored eight straight points in 8.9 seconds to steal a Pacers victory from the Knicks in Game 1 of the 1995 conference semifinals, Miller became one of the Knicks' most hated rivals. And fans surely haven't forgotten it.", "source": {"uri": "mycentraljersey.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MyCentralJersey.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Embiid", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joel Embiid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Bird", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Larry Bird"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison_Square_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Madison Square Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villanova_Wildcats_men's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Villanova Wildcats men's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alonzo_Mourning", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alonzo Mourning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitchell_Robinson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mitchell Robinson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Van_Gundy", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jeff Van Gundy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_76ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia 76ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Heat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miami Heat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jordan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michael Jordan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trae_Young", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trae Young"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Hawks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Hawks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spike_Lee", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spike Lee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bulls", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bulls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Gaming", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Gaming", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Game_Studies/Conferences", "label": "dmoz/Games/Game Studies/Conferences", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Murder-Mystery_and_Deduction", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Murder-Mystery and Deduction", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2024/05/03/PNJM/73555835007-n-98130-c-034.JPG?auto=webp&crop=1586,892,x2,y618&format=pjpg&width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9539735", "eventUri": "eng-9539735", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2313725490196078, "wgt": 156, "relevance": 1}

The Knicks got to this point by beating the Philadelphia 76ers in six games in what was the most entertaining series of the first round, in which Hart was electric in the first two games, struggled a bit offensively during the next three, but then came back to hit a huge shot in the waning seconds of Game 6 to secure New York's spot in the conference semifinals for the seconds straight year.\n\nThe Pacers present a new challenge for the Knicks, as Indiana boasts one of the most electric offenses in the league but isn't necessarily known for their defensive prowess. However, one player on the Pacers roster who embodies the defensive-first attitude of the Knicks is backup guard TJ McConnell, who personifies the word \"pest\" (in a basketball sense) in the modern NBA.\n\nRecently, Hart had a hilarious take on McConnell ahead of the series.\n\n\"(McConnell is an) annoying little s*** who runs around, picks up 94 feet,\" said Hart, per Kristian Winfield of the New York Daily News on X, the social media platform formerly referred to as Twitter.\n\nHart also took some (friendly) personal jabs at McConnell.\n\n\"We have a lot of comparisons obviously. [I'm] a little taller, more handsome, better taste in wine, probably golf better,\" said Hart.\n\nAn interesting series\n\nFrom a stylistic perspective, the Knicks vs Pacers series figures to look quite a bit different than the series New York just wrapped up against Philadelphia. The Pacers prefer to play a much more \"run and gun\" style of offense, led by the electric point guard Tyrese Haliburton, rather than the 76ers, who generally were regarded as a bruising halfcourt offense led by Joel Embiid and Tyrese Maxey.\n\nFor his part, Hart has been unbelievable so far in these playoffs, hitting several clutch shots, including a game sealing three in Game 1 vs the 76ers and the aforementioned game winner in Game 6, as well as bringing relentless energy on the offensive glass for a Knicks team that looked to be on a different level of conditioning than Philadelphia.\n\nThe Knicks should once again enjoy a substantial edge on the glass against a Pacers team that isn't necessarily small but doesn't profile as a tenacious rebounding team either.\n\nMeanwhile, the Knicks will hope to have some continued excellence from point guard Jalen Brunson, who struggled mightily for the first three games of the series vs the 76ers but then came alive, scoring three straight 40 point games in Games 4, 5, and 6 to propel his team to the second round.\n\nIn any case, Game 1 of the series is set to take place on Monday evening back in the friendly confines of Madison Square Garden, where the Knicks went 2-1 vs the 76ers. The game is set to take place at 7:30 PM ET and will be carried nationally by TNT.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jackson_stone@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Jackson Stone", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Hart", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Josh Hart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_76ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia 76ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Daily_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York Daily News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison_Square_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Madison Square Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Maxey", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Maxey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_on_TNT", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA on TNT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Brunson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Embiid", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joel Embiid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Computer_Platforms", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Computer Platforms", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Murder-Mystery_and_Deduction", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Murder-Mystery and Deduction", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/7366441442.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9539735", "eventUri": "eng-9539735", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 156, "relevance": 1}

However, that approach could get the Knicks bounced from the playoffs says Golden State Warriors forward Draymond Green, who has won four NBA titles, a Defensive Player of the Year award, and is the defensive backbone of those all-time great Warriors teams.\n\n\"A ball dominant Jalen Brunson ain't gonna get you to the promised land,\" Green said on the most recent episode of The Draymond Green Show. \"However, Jalen Brunson, as I've told you, already had respect from me. He's earned it more and more. Earning more and more respect.\"\n\nGreen isn't counting the Knicks out, but feels the team must have a back-up plan as the Pacers will most certainly scheme to take Brunson away and make someone else beat them.\n\nBrunson is averaging 35 points and nine assists this postseason and is playing better than anyone not named Anthony Edwards, who has catapulted the Minnesota Timberwolves to Western Conference Finals after sweeping the Suns.\n\nNow, some might say that Draymond, who along with his Warriors lost to the Sacramento Kings in the play-in and did not make the playoffs, is hating. But it is a lot to ask for Brunson to continue carrying the Knicks as they face better teams with advanced scouting, who have time to game plan against his strong suits and tendencies.", "source": {"uri": "nj.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NJ.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Brunson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draymond_Green", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Draymond Green"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giannis_Antetokounmpo", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Giannis Antetokounmpo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Thibodeau", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tom Thibodeau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Bucks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Bucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damian_Lillard", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Damian Lillard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacramento_Kings", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sacramento Kings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.nj.com/resizer/v2/N3FSZ4U4UJGRFKC4IZ3L6S7C44.jpg?auth=f8b2edaee62b50ef4346ec906a89aaaaec4b08956ce9ed40903d30d81e59482a&width=1280&quality=90", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9539735", "eventUri": "eng-9539735", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1}

While the Pacers breezed past Milwaukee in the first round on the back of a collective offensive effort, the Knicks were heavily dependent on Jalen Brunson's scoring and assists against a feisty 76ers squad. During the series, Brunson collected 35.5 points and 9 assists per game, while delivering consistently in crunch-time situations. His historical offensive run in the series seemed to have resonated with Indiana Pacers Head Coach Rick Carlisle, who acknowledged the heroics of the lefty guard ahead of their face-off.\n\nCarlisle had coached Jalen Brunson for three seasons when the two of them were with the Dallas Mavericks. Therefore, he is well aware of the 27-year-old's strengths that have helped him rise through the ranks. While admitting that Brunson's ascension has been unprecedented, the Pacers Head Coach also expressed that this has been the modus operandi of the Knicks guard ever since he came to the league.\n\nThe former Mavs HC recalled how Brunson was a joy to coach when he was in a supporting role with Dallas. \"He [JB] was great to work with in Dallas for a couple of years. I think it was three years. Just absolutely professional, great character, great basketball perspective and love for the game,\" Carlisle told reporters.\n\nBefore the Mavs drafted Brunson as the 33rd overall pick in the 2024 draft, Carlisle had visited Villanova to conduct a workout with him. During his visit, the then Mavs head coach inquired \"several people\" about the greatest hooper in the Wildcats' history. The consensus was that there was none better than Brunson in their program's history.\n\n\"I asked several people around the Villanova program, 'Who is the greatest player in Villanova history?' And right down the line, everybody responded the same thing, 'Jalen Brunson!'\" Carlisle added.\n\nThe veteran coach declared that Brunson is always keen on shutting down his doubters. His current performances also stem from that tendency, especially after many experts had predicted that the 76ers will take care of his Knicks in the first round. However, while the 64-year-old has been admiring the Knicks guard lately, he preferred benching him during the 2021 playoffs.\n\nIn the build-up to the Knicks-Pacers series, NBA reporter Tim McMahon turned the clock to the 2021 playoffs and reminded NBA fans about Rick Carlisle benching Brunson during key postseason games. In an interview with ClutchPoints, McMahon highlighted how Carlisle had been harsh on Brunson during film sessions while he gave Luka Doncic preferential treatment over him.\n\nThe reporter recalled how the then Mavs HC entrusted just 10 minutes to the lefty guard during Game 7 of the 2021 first-round series against the LA Clippers. The Mavs lost the series in which Jalen Brunson didn't tally 20 minutes per game, per StatMuse.\n\nThis turned out to be the last series Carlisle coached the Mavs after being at the helm for more than a decade. Meanwhile, Jalen Brunson signed with the Knicks in 2022 to become their lead guard. He was no longer in the shadow of Luka Doncic.\n\nTherefore, the Knicks PG will enter the playoff series against the Pacers with an added motivation. As Carlisle himself has admitted, Brunson is always keen on proving his doubters wrong.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsrush.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsRush"}, "authors": [{"uri": "shubham_singh@thesportsrush.com", "name": "Shubham Singh", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlisle", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carlisle"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Brunson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2022 NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villanova_Wildcats_men's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Villanova Wildcats men's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Carlisle", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rick Carlisle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_76ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia 76ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Wildcats_men's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Clippers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Clippers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luka Don\u010di\u0107"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://cdn-wp.thesportsrush.com/2024/05/8c3ec16b-nba-2024-05-05t193517.652.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9539735", "eventUri": "eng-9539735", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1}

But now the Pacers don't play in the mud. They are among the fastest teams in the NBA in pace this season and are second in offensive rating. With Tyrese Haliburton orchestrating the attack, he and his high-flying teammates rush downcourt on fast breaks and pull up for three-point field goals from all angles.\n\nThe Knicks, on the other hand, ranked last in the NBA in pace this season, and in the first round of the playoffs, they basically engaged in hand-to-hand combat with the Philadelphia 76ers in the slowest-paced series of the first round.\n\nBut the simplistic view might not be the right one, because while Indiana still may want to run, there are two alternative realities to deal with in the series.\n\nFirst, as evidenced by the Pacers' first-round battle with Milwaukee, the playoffs are a different animal. Their pace dropped from 102.16 in the regular season to 92.89 in their six-game win over the Bucks. And while they remained at the bottom, the Knicks look to run when they can, too. They were seventh in offensive rating in the regular season and sixth in the postseason.\n\n\"It's how you would define pace,\" Knicks coach Tom Thibodeau said. \"I think we're fifth in scoring. I think we're probably second in fast-break points. Then when you look at total shot attempts, we're always at the top. So however you get there.\n\n\"I told you, you can make stats say whatever you want, but the most important one is the net rating. And so that's what we look at. You wanna be strong on offense and defense. I think we were fourth and fifth, or fifth in offensive rating. We'll be challenged again. Our defense has to be great.\"\n\nIt likely will be. The reality of the playoffs is that it isn't the same as a fast-paced team catching a team in January on the second night of a back-to-back, shocking them with the different style. In the playoffs, every tendency is studied meticulously. Every play is prepped for in film study and practices. And seeing each other at least four times and maybe seven, there is no surprise to seeing the speed of a player or a team.\n\n\"You're always adjusting,\" Jalen Brunson said. \"You can't, I guess, force a team to play your style. It depends on game by game, what's going on. Obviously, we want to play Knicks basketball, they're going to try to play Pacers basketball. It's going to be a grind. It's going to be a battle. After the first game, we're going to have to adjust whether we win or lose. Adjusting is how you win these types of things. \"\n\n\"They get the ball out quick, throw it ahead,\" OG Anunoby said. \"They get up a lot of threes. They just play really fast, probably the highest pace in the league, the way they play. So it'll be challenging for us to get back on defense. It's an emphasis in film. Coach does a good job preparing us for that and we know coming into it to be ready for that.\n\n\"Definitely from game one to the next game to the next, the game changes. You learn more about an opponent each game and you're more prepared, of course, as well. The playoffs is just naturally slower tempo.\"\n\nAnunoby's presence will play a large part in that. He was not with the Knicks for any of the three regular-season meetings with the Pacers and is the Knicks' best and most versatile defender. Anunoby, Josh Hart and Donte DiVincenzo give the Knicks the ability to switch liberally.\n\nAnunoby has been able to share some defensive tips for his team concerning his former teammate in Toronto, Pascal Siakam, but he might not draw that assignment himself. In his one meeting against Indiana while still with Toronto, he took on the assignment of defending Haliburton.\n\n\"Just to try to make him uncomfortable,\" Anunoby said. \"He's a great player. He can shoot from really far. So just try to pick him up early and dictate which direction he goes. Don't let him choose which direction he goes -- me force him away and then go from there.\"\n\n\"The strengths of their team, that's not gonna change,\" Thibodeau said. \"They're an uptempo team. I think they average 113 in the playoffs. So we know that we gotta protect our basket. They've got good shooting, point guards. They've got Siakam. They've got [Myles] Turner. So they got a lot of weapons. A lot of pick-and-rolls. You got multiple point guards on the floor at the same time, so a lot of slips, a lot of flares. But the main thing is the strengths of the players doesn't change. You gotta know what they do and you gotta know them inside and out.\"\n\nThe Knicks certainly will know that as they put Philadelphia behind them and get ready for this series. They won't do it with bats and chains, but it might feel that way sometimes.", "source": {"uri": "newsday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsday"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reggie_Miller", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Reggie Miller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O.G._Anunoby", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "O.G.

You're not shocked.\"\n\nBrunson averaged 10.1 points, 3.3 assists and 2.7 rebounds under Carlisle in Dallas in his first three seasons with the Mavericks. After Carlisle left, Brunson finally broke out, averaging 16.3 points, 4.8 assists and 3.9 rebounds in one season under Kidd.\n\nWith the Knicks, Brunson turned into a star.\n\nOver the last two seasons, Brunson averaged 26.5 points, 6.5 assists and 3.6 rebounds and earned his first All-Star berth this season.\n\n\"The last two times we played him he had 40 in one game and 39 in the other. He's leading the playoffs in scoring average,\" Carlisle said. \"It's pretty obvious that he established a very high level during the season, and he's maintained and/or exceeded it in the postseason, and that's hard to do.\"\n\nCarlisle revealed that he went to Villanova before the Mavericks selected Brunson with the 33rd pick in 2018. He asked around who is the greatest player in Villanova history and he received the same answer.\n\n\"Right down the line, everybody responded the same thing, Jalen Brunson,\" Carlisle said. \"So there's a program that's got three national championships and he was a big part of two of those. He's very special, he was great to work with in Dallas for I think it was three years.\"\n\nBrunson won two national championships in Villanova and he hopes to do the same with the Knicks.", "source": {"uri": "heavy.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Heavy"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alder_almo@heavy.com", "name": "Alder Almo", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlisle", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Carlisle"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Brunson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Carlisle", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rick Carlisle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Kidd", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jason Kidd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villanova_Wildcats_men's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Villanova Wildcats men's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://heavy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-2151190359-e1714941839939.jpg?quality=65&strip=all&w=780", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9539735", "eventUri": "eng-9539735", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-03", "textStart": 503, "textEnd": 508}], "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

But the rivalry laid dormant for more than a decade until the Pacers eliminated the Knicks in the 2013 playoffs. Well, it may be back another decade later, with Brunson and Carlisle at the center of it.\n\nCarlisle served as the Mavericks' head coach from 2008 to 2021, during which he won an NBA Championship in 2011. And in 2018, before the final season of Dirk Nowitzki's career, the Mavericks drafted a pair of eventual stars: Luka Doncic and Jalen Brunson. While Doncic was the clear-cut jewel of the Mavs' draft, Brunson would become an invaluable role player during his time in Dallas, although it would not come without issues.\n\nNBA reporter Tim McMahon brought attention to the potential tension between Carlisle and Brunson, stemming from a 2021 first-round playoff series against the Los Angeles Clippers.\n\n\"Three years ago, Jalen Brunson played 10 minutes in a Game 7 loss -- and he didn't play a whole lot more than that in the previous few games,\" McMahon said. \"Rick basically pulled the plug on him in that last series against the Clippers. Game 7 ended up being Rick's last game as the Mavericks' coach, and I can assure you this, Jalen remembers getting essentially benched in that series.\n\n\"That's something that I know for a fact will be in Jalen Brunson's mind. Rick, apparently, he has mellowed out significantly in Indiana. He definitely was not the easiest guy to play for in Dallas, and because he was not going to say anything to Luka for the last few years, because that relationship was damaged by Rick early on, as I chronicled, Jalen got a lot of the stuff that maybe should have been going to Luka. A lot of the film sessions were particularly harsh on Jalen. How much personal feelings will there be, I don't know, but I think there's definitely a decent chunk of Jalen Brunson that would enjoy absolutely lighting up the Indiana Pacers in the second round and bouncing them from the playoffs.\"\n\nJalen Brunson's rise from Mavericks backup to Knicks star\n\nJalen Brunson was selected with the 33rd overall pick in the 2018 NBA Draft, 30 spots behind Luka Doncic. And while Brunson's size was thought to have been a roadblock in his career, he has exceeded any and all expectations in the NBA.\n\nWhile his first two seasons were nothing spectacular as a rotational and sometimes starter, Brunson began to really ascend during the 2020-21 season. He averaged 12.6 points, 3.4 rebounds, and 3.5 assists in 25.0 minutes per game while shooting a career-high 52.3% from the field. But that year was also Carlisle's last, which seemed to serve Brunson well the next season. As a regular starter, Brunson averaged 16.3 points and 4.8 assists while playing next to Doncic, creating a stellar backcourt.\n\nWith Doncic sidelined due to injury to begin the 2022 playoffs, Brunson shouldered the bulk of the Mavericks' offense surprisingly well. After an inefficient 24-point performance in a Game 1 loss to the Utah Jazz, Brunson exploded for 41 points, 8 rebounds, and 5 assists in a 110-104 win. Brunson then delivered 31 points and 6 assists in a crucial Game 3 victory, still without Doncic, to ensure the Mavericks would be going back to Dallas for at least one more game.\n\nDoncic returned for Game 4 and reassumed control of the Mavericks' offense, but Brunson continued to prove his worth, averaging 19.5 points, 4.5 rebounds, and 3.3 assists alongside Doncic in those playoffs while Dallas made a run to the Western Conference Finals.\n\nIn the subsequent offseason, Brunson, who the Mavericks twice declined to extend for four years and $55 million before Brunson's breakout performance in the 2022 playoffs, signed a four-year, $104 million contract with the New York Knicks. Completely out of Doncic's ball-dominant shadow, Brunson has flourished, averaging 26.5 points and 6.5 assists over two seasons with the Knicks. Additionally, he has led New York to back-to-back playoff appearances for the first time in more than a decade and back-to-back first-round series victories for the first time in nearly a quarter of a century.\n\nBrunson and the Knicks host Carlisle's Pacers in New York for Game 1 on Monday at 7:30 p.m. ET.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "preston_byers@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Preston Byers", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Brunson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2013 NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_draft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA draft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Clippers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Clippers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirk_Nowitzki", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dirk Nowitzki"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Luka Don\u010di\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2022 NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah_Jazz", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Utah Jazz"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Hip-Hop", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Hip-Hop", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/Europe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/Europe", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Jalen-Brunson-Rick-Carlisle-Mavs-drama-resurfaces-ahead-Pacers-series.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9539735", "eventUri": "eng-9539735", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

Great guy, [has a] great family.\n\n\"I have all the respect in the world for him and the way he plays the game. He just goes out there, plays the right way and does what he has to do.\"\n\nBrunson and Haliburton are forever linked by their Team USA bond in last year's FIBA World Cup.\n\nDespite last summer's debate on who should have started between them for Team USA (Brunson ended up starting while Haliburton led the team in assists off the bench), they did not pay attention to it.\n\nBut whether they like it or not, the rivalry is a hit to NBA fans and their respective team's fan bases. It is a testament to their rising popularity as two of the league's young stars.\n\nThey became again a hot topic for debate on who is the best point guard in the Eastern Conference, which fans settled by voting Haliburton as an NBA All-Star starter while Brunson settled with a spot in the reserves voted by the coaches.\n\nAnd when Haliburton was named to Team USA who will play in the Paris Olympics this summer, Brunson's and Knicks' fans felt he should have been also selected.\n\nBrunson has no qualms and looks forward to his friendly rivalry with Haliburton in this year's playoffs.\n\nTheir paths are intertwined because both Brunson and Haliburton were overlooked players who rose to become All-Stars and face of their respective new teams.\n\nBrunson was an accomplished college player but was overlooked in the draft and slid to the second round. And he was again overlooked by his former team Dallas Mavericks, who twice declined to give him the max extension until it was too late and he decided to join the Knicks in free agency.\n\nHaliburton was also overlooked in the NBA Draft and slid to the backend of the lottery. Then his former team Sacramento Kings shipped him to Indiana, where he flourished as the main guy.\n\nBoth have similar paths to stardom but they possess different styles of play.\n\nBrunson is a bully-ball point guard who loves dominating his opponents in the halfcourt with his fundamentally-sound footwork. He is all business and rarely smiles on the court.\n\nBrunson carried the Knicks offense by scoring and dishing more in the playoffs, averaging 35.5 points, 9.0 assists and 4.5 rebounds, up from his regular-season averages of 28.7 points, 6.7 assists and 3.6 rebounds.\n\nHaliburton, on the other hand, loves the open court and dominates by his flashy passes and uncanny shooting stroke. He always flashes his megawatt smile and plays with unbridled joy on the court.\n\nHaliburton did not have to score as much as Brunson have to do with a complete and more balanced Pacers team. He averaged 16.0 points, 9.3 assists and 5.8 rebounds in six games against the injury-hit Milwaukee Bucks after averaging 20.1 points, 10.9 assists and 3.9 rebounds.", "source": {"uri": "heavy.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Heavy"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alder_almo@heavy.com", "name": "Alder Almo", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_rivalry", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "College rivalry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Brunson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Ewing", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Ewing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIBA_Basketball_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FIBA Basketball World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Bucks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Bucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacramento_Kings", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sacramento Kings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_draft_lottery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA draft lottery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://heavy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1450202689-e1714850360245.jpg?quality=65&strip=all&w=780", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9539735", "eventUri": "eng-9539735", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

Haliburton didn't record any shot attempts against the Knicks' backup this season.\n\nMiles McBride will try to pick it up on the defensive end against the Indiana Pacers, and win in his individual matchups.\n\nAnd the New York Knicks will be tasked with living up to the preset expectations of a thorough stomping and series win.", "source": {"uri": "heavy.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Heavy"}, "authors": [{"uri": "collin_loring@heavy.com", "name": "Collin Loring", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miles_McBride", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miles McBride"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Maxey", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Maxey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donte_DiVincenzo", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donte DiVincenzo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DraftKings", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "DraftKings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Thibodeau", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tom Thibodeau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Points_per_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Points per game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Hart", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Josh Hart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._J._McConnell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "T.

Brunson scored at least 39 points in each of the final four games, including a franchise record 47 in the Game 4 victory at Wells Fargo Center last weekend.\n\nPierce, a longtime metropolitan nemesis as a member of the Boston Celtics, originally doubted the Knicks but graciously accepted an order of humble pie of Friday's edition of Fox Sports' \"Undisputed.\"\n\n\"First off, I like to say sorry to the Knicks and Jalen Brunson because I've shown them no respect,\" Pierce said. \"When I looked at the series before it started, I thought Philadelphia just had too much manpower for the short-handed Knicks ... \"Did I know that Jalen Brunson was going to play well? I thought he would play well. I didn't know he was going to play this well.\"\n\nWith one game left on the opening round docket (Sunday's Game 7 between Cleveland and Orlando), Brunson is the leading scorer among all playoff participants at 35.5 a game. That average is the second-best in any Knicks playoff series, behind only Bernard King's work in the 1984 opening round against Detroit.\n\nBrunson barbs have often centered on the idea that a player of his stature (6-2, 190 lbs.) can't be the headliner of a championship run. But Pierce knows that size matters not come the postseason and compared Brunson's ongoing success to a former green successor.\n\n\"Just when you just didn't think a little guy at his stature can do it, he's continued to do it,\" Pierce continued. \"So they're going to ride his coattails. He reminds me of when Isaiah Thomas was in Boston. Remember that ride he had? They rode that to the Eastern Conference Finals and he just put on the show. A short guy you just didn't believe. Lefty, same thing. It reminded me of that.\"\n\nThe 5-9 Thomas was the headliner of a Celtics group that took the top seed in the East during the 2016-17 season. Many doubted such an approach but Thomas guided the Celtics to the conference finals before a hip injury sidelined him for most of that series against the Cleveland Cavaliers. Though injuries have prevented Thomas from reaping in the lasting benefits, his efforts kickstarted a run where Boston has reached at least the conference final round in five of the past seven seasons.\n\n\"A guy like Jalen Brunson who's had a great year, phenomenal year should be on the All-NBA First Team, arguably,\" Pierce said, also praising Knicks head coach Tom Thibodeau for his work in the face of several major injuries. \"Jalen Brunson is probably the most dominant player, he's the best player in the playoffs right now. I mean not the best player but he's playing the best.\"\n\nBrunson will get a chance to continue his Thomas-esque run on Monday when the Knicks open the Eastern Conference Semifinals against the Indiana Pacers (7:30 p.m. ET, TNT).", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [{"uri": "geoff_magliocchetti@si.com", "name": "Geoff Magliocchetti", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Brunson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Pierce", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paul Pierce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaiah_Thomas_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Isaiah Thomas (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wells_Fargo_Center_(Philadelphia)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wells Fargo Center (Philadelphia)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_76ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia 76ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlando,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Orlando, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Orlando, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2022 NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TNT_(American_TV_network)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TNT (American TV network)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Thibodeau", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tom Thibodeau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-NBA_Team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "All-NBA Team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Golo_Golf", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Golo Golf", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_4763,h_2679,x_0,y_92/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/si-temp/01hx4rrwabx850kkra3m", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9539735", "eventUri": "eng-9539735", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

The Indiana Pacers took advantage of an injury-riddled Milwaukee Bucks, as they clinched the series in six games to get one step closer to the conference finals.\n\nBennedict Mathurin is already scratched for the rest of the playoffs due to a torn labrum, while Tyrese Haliburton is marked as 'questionable' due to a bad back.\n\nWhat happened to Pascal Siakam?\n\nSince suiting up for the Indiana Pacers, Pascal Siakam has not missed a single game. The last time that two-time NBA All-Star was reported to have an injury was on January 10, 2024, when he was still playing for the Toronto Raptors.\n\nIn 41 regular-season games with the Pacers, Siakam averaged 21.3 points, 7.8 rebounds, 3.7 assists and 1.0 three-pointers. Siakam helped his club win the series against the Bucks by averaging 22.3 points, 8.8 rebounds and 4.2 assists.\n\nPascal Siakam's stats vs New York Knicks\n\nPascal Siakam faced the New York Knicks four times during the 2023-24 season, twice as a Raptor and twice as a Pacer, all in February. In his two games with the Pacers, he scored 19.5 points, 6.5 rebounds, and 4.0 assists.

A reporter asked if it would be similar to the challenge that Milwaukee Bucks guard Damian Lillard presented in the first round.\n\n\"Nah,\" said Toppin, who was traded from the Knicks to the Pacers last July. \"JB got the ball in his hands more than Lillard, and he plays 48 minutes, so we're prepared for that.\"\n\nToppin was only slightly exaggerating. Brunson played an average of 43.8 minutes in the first round, trailing only teammate Josh Hart (46.1) and opponent Tyrese Maxey (44.6). According to NBA.com's tracking data, he had the ball in his hands for 11.1 minutes per game, which is:\n\nAlmost twice as much as Lillard (5.7) did in the first roundNo. 1 in the league by a good margin (Luka Doncic, Brunson's former teammate, had possession of the ball for 9.3 minutes per game, and only three other players -- Maxey, Anthony Edwards and James Harden -- averaged more than seven minutes)Essentially half of New York's total time of possession, including the minutes in which he was on the bench.\n\nYou likely remember Brunson making a nasty, left-to-right floater over Joel Embiid during Game 4 against the Philadelphia 76ers. It was a remarkable shot because of the degree of difficulty and the fact that Brunson had just returned to the court after banging knees with Kyle Lowry at the end of the previous quarter. But do you remember that he dribbled away the entire 24-second shot clock before he put it up?\n\nIn that game, Brunson scored 47 points, seven more than the rest of the Knicks, and had a usage rate of 39 percent. In the series he had a usage rate of 35.6 percent overall and 38.6 percent in the fourth quarter (a number that understates his late-game ball dominance, as it doesn't include overtime of Game 5, in which he had an 83.3 percent usage rate -- yes, seriously, 83.3 -- and accounted for eight of his team's 10 shot attempts). For context, Allen Iverson had a usage rate of 34.9 percent in his 2001 MVP season (and 35.8 percent in that year's playoffs).\n\n\"He has the ball in his hands for 20 seconds out of the 24[-second] shot clock,\" Sixers wing Kelly Oubre Jr., who spent much of the series defending Brunson, said the day before that 47-point eruption. \"He passes the ball, gets it right back. He puts up probably the most shots on his team, as he should. But at the end of the day he's being used a lot. He's being used to to go play 48 minutes and have 40 points. He has to.\"\n\nOubre said it was his job to \"stay in front of him, stay disciplined, not go for his fakes.\" Now that job will fall to several Pacers. Andrew Nembhard will be one of them, according to coach Rick Carlisle, who spent three seasons with Brunson in Dallas and told Dan Patrick that he's \"very happy for him, very proud of him and very much not looking forward to coaching against him.\" Aaron Nesmith will likely be another.\n\nIndiana does not have Philadelphia's size and length on the wing, but it has Myles Turner patrolling the paint and it is well aware of how Brunson-dependent the Knicks' offense has become.\n\n\"They have their main guy that goes out there and pretty much does everything for 'em,\" Turner told reporters. As Monday's series opener approaches, maybe the big question shouldn't be what the Pacers can do to stop him, but whether or not he can keep playing his way without wearing down.\n\nIn the first round, Brunson was second to only Hart in both per-game and total distance traveled, per NBA.com's tracking data. If Brunson himself is concerned about his workload, though, he is not showing it. \"All out, no time to pace yourself anymore,\" he said after logging 51 minutes in Game 5. In terms of his share of the offense, the Sixers series was nothing new -- in the final month of the regular season, Brunson averaged 35.1 points and 9.7 minutes of ball possession per game with a 36.7 percent usage rate, all of which ranked No. 1 in the league.\n\nThe Knicks surely won't complain if Brunson continues to score 40-plus points on good efficiency, as he has now done in three consecutive games. It did not seem like an accident, though, that forward OG Anunoby got more aggressive as a scorer as the Philadelphia series went on. Ever since Julius Randle's shoulder injury in January, New York has had to scrounge points however it can. The Knicks' simplest, most reliable source of offense has been letting Brunson cook, but they also like to run wing Donte DiVincenzo off screens and use center Isaiah Hartenstein as a facilitator/handoff hub. Ideally, they'll find more success with that stuff in the second round than they did in the first, if only because it would presumably lower the likelihood that Brunson burns out.\n\nOne thing to watch in Game 1: How much of an effort the Pacers make to get the ball out of Brunson's hands. These decisions can be complicated, and Brunson has evolved into the type of player for whom there isn't a \"good\" coverage, only ones that are less bad than others given the personnel involved. If Indiana elects to blitz Brunson's pick-and-rolls most of the time, he probably won't drop 40, but his teammates might feast on 4-on-3 opportunities and relieve him of the pressure to make plays in isolation. For this reason, when facing a superstar player who is doing the absolute most, some coaches prefer not to put two on the ball or help aggressively off of his teammates.\n\nIn theory, this will tire out said superstar over the course of a game or a series and prevent anybody else from finding a rhythm. That plan sounds a lot more sensible before the series starts, though, than when the guy at the top of the scouting report is dicing your defense up.", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType":

Rick Carlisle?\n\nThe Knicks' upcoming Eastern Conference Semifinal series with the Indiana Pacers features no shortage of storylines: it's the latest entry in the long-running Knicks-Pacers rivalry and Indiana's bench features Obi Toppin, New York's first-round pick from 2020. One of the more subtle subplots, however, is the matchup between Knicks point guard Jalen Brunson and Carlisle, Indianapolis' third-year boss.\n\nESPN's Tim MacMahon perhaps added proverbial fuel to the fire this week, remarking on his Hoop Collective podcast that Brunson \"remembers getting essentially benched\" during his final collaboration and first career playoff series with Carlisle in Dallas. Brunson's minutes dwindled through an opening round series with the Los Angeles Clippers, bottoming out at 10 in the seventh and final game. Carlisle was relieved of duty after the series and replaced by Jason Kidd.\n\nIf Brunson is holding any grudges, he certainly didn't show it as the Knicks' made their final preparations Monday's Game 1 (7:30 p.m. ET, TNT) over the weekend.\n\n\"In all honesty, I said this last time, you're in the playoffs now, there is no extra motivation,\" Brunson said, per video from SNY. \"It is what it is. The past is the past. Rick welcomed me into the league and helped me become the player (I am today) and helped me grow from Day 1.\"\n\n\"Coaches got to make decisions that better suit their teams. Whatever happened, happened, and we're moving forward from there.\"\n\nGranted a breakout opportunity in the following postseason with Kidd in tow and Luka Doncic hurt in round one, Brunson didn't disappoint, averaging 27.8 points and 4.8 rebounds in an opening round victory over Utah. That eventually earned him a four-year, $104 million contract from the Knicks and the rest is (very recent) history.\n\nAs Indiana reached New York, Carlisle sang Brunson's praises in turn, remarking that he personally visited the point during the 2018 draft process. Dallas eventually selected Brunson with the 33rd overall pick of that draft, start a domino effect that would one day change New York basketball.\n\n\"He's very special, he was great to work with in Dallas for I think it was three years,\" Carlisle said, per Peter Botte of the New York Post. \"Just professional, great character, great basketball, great respect and love for the game, you cannot say enough great things about him and what he's accomplished. He's obviously a highly skilled player, but he's got an indomitable will to accomplish what naysayers don't think he can do. He's just one of those kinds of guys. You have to respect what he's doing.\"\n\nThe legend continued for Brunson in the opening round victory over Philadelphia: Brunson averaged a postseason-best 35.5 points in six games the second-best in Knicks history behind only Bernard King's first-round output in 1984.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [{"uri":

It's the first time the two times have clashed in the postseason since 2013.\n\nIndiana beat Milwaukee in the first round, 4-2. Giannis Antetokounmpo missed the entire series, while Damian Lillard missed Games 4 and 5. Except for Bennedict Mathurin, the Pacers are at full strength.\n\nEven without Julius Randle and Bojan Bogdanovic, the consensus is that the Knicks will advance to the Eastern Conference Finals. By no means should New York (or the fan base) take its second-round opponent lightly, though.\n\nIndiana won 47 games in the regular season, good enough to return to the playoffs for the first time in four years. The Pacers' first-round series win was the first in 10 years, the last time the team made it to the ECF.\n\nThere's a lot on the line for both teams. Led by Jalen Brunson, New York could advance to the ECF for the first time in 24 years. That year, the Knicks lost to the Pacers. In 2013, New York lost to Indiana in the second round. It's time for the Knicks to flip the script.\n\nTyrese Haliburton (back spasms) is listed as questionable. He dealt with the issue in the first round but didn't miss a game.\n\nMitchell Robinson (ankle) isn't on New York's injury report, which is a good sign after he missed a game-and-a-half against Philadelphia in the first round.\n\nBojan Bogdanovic (foot) and Julius Randle (shoulder) are out.

Brunson's Knicks, the No. 2 seed in the Eastern Conference, survived a physical and bruising series against Joel Embiid and the Philadelphia 76ers. The point guard's eye-opening performances, particularly in the closeout Game 6 on the road pushed them past the first round.\n\nHaliburton did the same for the Pacers against the injury-struck Milwaukee Bucks but in a somewhat understated way. Unlike Brunson, he didn't pile up the points but he was unquestionably the driver of Indiana's high-octane offense. The two former USA Basketball teammates in last year's FIBA World Cup will go head to head in the second round of the playoffs.\n\nComparing Tyrese Haliburton and Jalen Brunson's playoff stats\n\nTyrese Haliburton is making his debut in the NBA Playoffs this year. He couldn't do it in nearly two years with the Sacramento Kings and failed to do the same with Indiana until 2024. Haliburton already has a signature playoff moment in round one versus Milwaukee and could have more before the postseason ends.\n\nMeanwhile, Jalen Brunson is the more accomplished playoff performer, having 42 games under his belt past the regular season. His first two years (2021 and 2022) in the playoffs were with the Dallas Mavericks before leading the New York Knicks to back-to-back postseason appearances.\n\nThe Knicks' lefty guard had a solid case as the best player throughout the first round of the NBA playoffs. In his last three games of that series, he averaged a staggering 42.6 points, including a franchise playoff record of 47 in Game 5. More than the numbers, it was when he made those buckets that had the Wells Fargo Center crowd in Philadelphia serenading him with MVP chants.\n\nHere are Tyrese Haliburton and Jalen Brunson's numbers in this year's playoffs:\n\nTyrese Haliburton and Jalen Brunson's record in the playoffs\n\nAs a playoff debutant, Tyrese Haliburton has a modest 4-2 record in the playoffs. He tallied that win-loss mark for the Indiana Pacers in the first-round encounter against the Milwaukee Bucks.\n\nOn the other hand, Jalen Brunson is 22-20 in postseason games in his career. Last year, they disposed of the Cleveland Cavaliers 4-1 before falling to the Miami Heat's giant-slaying ways 4-2. 2024 is still unfolding for the Knicks' franchise cornerstone.\n\nHaliburton and Brunson will lead their respective teams in different ways in the playoffs\n\nAlthough they both play point guard, Tyrese Haliburton and Jalen Brunson are significantly different in how they operate. The former is a pass-first orchestrator while the latter is one of the NBA's most demoralizing forces on offense. Haliburton's scoring may be down but one can almost be sure his assists and rebounds are up.\n\nBrunson isn't just all about putting buckets as well. He has an underrated all-around game that opponents are still figuring out how to contain. In Games 1 and 2 versus Philadelphia, the All-Star guard gladly moved the ball around when the Sixers aggressively sent double or triple teams. New York went 2-0 against that strategy.\n\nBasketball fans can't wait to see how these two will go head-to-head starting on Monday at Madison Square Garden.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri": "michael_macasero@sportskeeda.com", "name": "Michael Macasero", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Brunson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Bucks", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Bucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIBA_Basketball_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FIBA Basketball World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Embiid", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joel Embiid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_76ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia 76ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "USA Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacramento_Kings", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sacramento Kings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wells_Fargo_Center_(Philadelphia)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wells Fargo Center (Philadelphia)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison_Square_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Madison Square Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Heat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miami Heat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Print_and_Play", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Print and Play", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2024/05/22431041-1714818598.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9539735", "eventUri": "eng-9539735", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 151, "relevance": 1}

Are you kidding me? I love you Oak, but what are we doing? Let me introduce you to the greatest, not just since Clyde Frazier, the greatest New York Knicks basketball player of all time.\"\n\n\"That includes everybody. You include everybody that ever played in the blue and orange and you put them on the draft board, the number one pick is Patrick Ewing.\"\n\nOakley's assertion came after the Knicks' recent playoff successes led by Brunson, who has undeniably been a pivotal figure in the team's resurgence. However, to suggest that Brunson has already surpassed the likes of Ewing, one of the greatest players in Knicks history, is a stretch.\n\nMark Jackson, in response to Oakley's statement, expressed his disbelief on his show, emphasizing Ewing's unparalleled impact on the franchise. Jackson reminded Oakley and listeners alike that Ewing's legacy as a Knick is unmatched, pointing out Ewing's 15-year tenure with the team and his numerous accolades, including 11 All-Star selections and leading the franchise in multiple statistical categories.\n\nEwing's arrival transformed the Knicks, leading them to multiple playoff appearances and deep postseason runs throughout the 1990s. Despite falling short of an NBA title, Ewing's contributions to the Knicks cannot be overstated, cementing his status as an all-time great in the franchise's history.\n\nWhile Jalen Brunson's impact on the Knicks has been significant and his potential is promising, it's premature to place him above a player of Ewing's caliber. Ewing's longevity, consistency, and statistical dominance over his tenure with the Knicks set him apart and solidify his place as the greatest Knick of all time.\n\nUltimately, Oakley's assertion may be attributed to recency bias and the excitement surrounding Brunson's performance. However, when considering the full scope of Knick's history and the impact of players like Ewing, it becomes clear that this trade doesn't make sense at any level. Ewing's legacy remains unmatched, and it's unlikely that Brunson, despite his contributions, will surpass it anytime soon.\n\nJalen Brunson's First Two Years As A Knicks Star Has Been Great\n\nJalen Brunson's impact on the New York Knicks in his first two years with the team has been nothing short of remarkable. Emerging as a star player, Brunson has not only transformed the Knicks into a legitimate playoff contender but has also revitalized the hopes and dreams of Knicks fans who have endured years of disappointment.\n\nBrunson's impressive statistics speak volumes about his impact on the court. Averaging 28.7 points, 3.6 rebounds, and 6.7 assists per game while shooting efficiently from both the field and beyond the arc, he has been instrumental in leading the Knicks to a 50-win season and securing the second seed in the Eastern Conference.\n\nHowever, Brunson's significance goes beyond his individual numbers. In just two years, he has guided the Knicks to the conference semifinals, showcasing his ability to elevate his team's performance on the biggest stage. With his leadership and skill, Brunson has instilled a newfound sense of hope and optimism among Knicks fans, who have long awaited a return to relevance for their beloved franchise.\n\nThe story of Jalen Brunson's journey to the Knicks adds an extra layer of significance to his success. As the son of former Knicks player Rick Brunson, Jalen grew up around the team, witnessing firsthand the passion and dedication required to succeed in New York. Now, as the star player for the Knicks, he is carrying on his family's legacy while making a name for himself as one of the premier talents in the NBA.\n\nBrunson's impact extends beyond the basketball court, as he embodies the resilience and determination of a true New Yorker.

Coming in fresh off a victory as the underdog, the Knicks will stroll into this one as the favorite.\n\nThe Knicks are headed into the game having just posted their closest win since February 26th on Thursday. They sure made it a nail-biter, but they managed to escape with a 118-115 victory over the 76ers.\n\nThe Knicks' win was a true team effort, with many players turning in solid performances. Perhaps the best among them was Jalen Brunson, who dropped a double-double on 41 points and 12 assists. That means Brunson has scored a third or more of the Knicks' points for four games straight. Donte DiVincenzo was another key contributor, scoring 23 points along with seven assists and three blocks.\n\nMeanwhile, there's no place like home for the Pacers, who bounced back after a tough loss on the road on Tuesday. They were the clear victor by a 120-98 margin over the Bucks on Thursday.\n\nT.J. McConnell was the offensive standout of the matchup as he almost dropped a double-double on 20 points and nine assists. He didn't help the Pacers' cause all that much against the Bucks on Tuesday but the same can't be said for this match.\n\nThe Knicks and the Pacers will be playing the first game of their best-of-seven series on Monday.

When the ball goes up, we have to be strong on both sides of the ball.\"\n\nOn the possibility of expanding the rotation considering Indiana's fast pace of play...\n\n\"We could. You have to look at who they're playing as well. They've cut back, so it's all about matchups.\"\n\n\"Observing them in the playoffs, it seems they're not doing the same stuff as in the regular season.\"\n\nOn how the Knicks will adjust to the Pacers' pick-and-roll-heavy playbook...\n\n\"We know they're a multiple pick and roll team. You got pick and pop, pick and slip, so we got to be ready for that. You got to contain the ball. There are a lot of slips, a lot of flares. Just know what everyone likes to do and be in tune so your communication is critical.\"\n\nOn Obi Toppin's breakout season in Indiana after getting traded away by the Knicks...\n\n\"No (I'm not surprised about it), we knew he was a good player. Very athletic, runs the floor great, shoots the ball well, and can score. We loved having him. He was in a situation here where he was playing behind Julius, so that was the story behind that.\"\n\nOn anticipating Brunson's rise to stardom...\n\n\"I was pretty confident because I had watched him grow up. You see each step how much he was growing. His high school career was very storied, and his experience with USA Basketball in high school and college. Every year he's gotten better, that's a testament to his work ethic. It doesn't surprise me.\"\n\nOn whether or not he'll be extra motivated by going against the coach that didn't trust him in Dallas...\n\n\"In all honesty, I said this last time, you're in the playoffs now, there is no extra motivation.\"\n\nOn getting just 10 minutes of play against the Clippers in Game 7 of the 2021 playoffs, one that saw Dallas getting eliminated and Rick Carlisle fired...\n\n\"It is what it is. The past is the past. Rick welcomed me into the league and helped me become the player [I am today] and helped me grow from Day 1. Coaches got to make decisions that better suit their teams. Whatever happened, happened, and we're moving forward from there.\"\n\nOn Jalen Brunson, who played for him at Dallas...\n\n\"He is a guy you would never bet against. You just don't bet against that guy. I don't know if anybody saw this coming, what he's achieved for two years now, but if you know him and you know his character, you're not surprised. You're not shocked.\"\n\n\"Just professional, great character, great basketball, great respect and love for the game. You cannot say enough great things about him and what he's accomplished. He's obviously a highly skilled player, but he's got an indomitable will to accomplish what naysayers don't think he can do. He's just one of those kinds of guys. You have to respect what he's doing.\"\n\nOn scouting Brunson before the 2018 draft and learning about him from Villanova coaches...\n\n\"Right down the line, everybody (at Nova) responded the same thing, Jalen Brunson (is one of the greatest players in Villanova's history). So there's a program that's got three national championships and he was a big part of two of those. He's very special, he was great to work with in Dallas for I think it was three years.\"\n\nOn Brunson's performances against the Pacers earlier this season...\n\n\"The last two times we played him he had 40 in one game and 39 in the other. He's leading the playoffs in scoring average. It's pretty obvious that he established a very high level during the season, and he's maintained and/or exceeded it in the postseason, and that's hard to do.\"\n\nOn the Knicks beating the odds even without Julius Randle...\n\n\"He's an All-Star. He [averaged] 24-9-5 or whatever it is, so that playmaking, shot making, is something that we're missing.\"\n\n\"It's funny: when people talk about us they somehow forget the big void we have of 24-and-9 gone. It's not like he's out there with us 70-80 percent. He's not out there. So that's something that's a big void that we knew was gonna be hard to fill; but his playmaking, his shotmaking, his energy is something that we definitely miss.\"\n\nOn getting eliminated from the playoffs nearly before they got started...\n\n\"If I was playing, Boston would be at home, [and] New York damn sure would be at home. Josh Hart? F-k that mean to me? Josh Hart? C'mon man.\"\n\nOn his relationship with Tom Thibodeau...\n\n\"I love Thibs, but I don't want Thibs. Thibs, I love you baby, but I want to beat you to a pulp. You want me. I don't want you. It's like a one-sided relationship. You in love with me and I love you but I'm not in love with you, you know what I'm saying.\"\n\nOn the Knicks not having a real shot at winning the championship...\n\n\"I didn't say you weren't gonna win your first-round series. I didn't even say you weren't gonna win the second-round series because if I'm honest, I think you guys should easily win the second-round series. So I didn't say that. I said you couldn't get to the promised land. And quite frankly, if I'm honest, I still don't think you can.\"\n\nOn Brunson's struggles through the first two games of the first round and his improvement after that...\n\n\"How you bounce back when you have a bad game in these playoffs matters, and Jalen Brunson did that at a level that not many people [have] done before.\"\n\n\"The Knicks need the version of Brunson that's sharing and getting off the ball, getting to his spots and setting up shots for others.\"", "source": {"uri": "postingandtoasting.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Posting and Toasting"}, "authors": [{"uri": "antonio_losada@postingandtoasting.com", "name": "Antonio Losada", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Carlisle", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rick Carlisle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2022 NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obi_Toppin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Obi Toppin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Randle", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Julius Randle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pick_and_roll", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pick and roll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Brunson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "USA Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_I_men's_basketball_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Hart", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Josh Hart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villanova_Wildcats_men's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Villanova Wildcats men's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Thibodeau", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tom Thibodeau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playmaker", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Playmaker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xfyDUD_aCEI9-I10nhM-FbOsIhM=/0x0:1901x951/fit-in/1200x600/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25434142/1201935827.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9539735", "eventUri": "eng-9539735", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-04", "textStart": 533, "textEnd": 538}], "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 150, "relevance": 1}

Leading the charge was Jalen Brunson, whose stellar play in the regular season propelled the Knicks to the playoffs.\n\nBrunson's outstanding performance in the playoffs has etched his name in NBA history. According to The Athletic, Brunson became the first player since NBA legend Michael Jordan to score at least 37 points in four consecutive playoff games.\n\nThis feat was achieved from Game 3 to 6, mirroring Jordan's performance in the 1993 NBA Finals against the Phoenix Suns. In that series, Jordan scored 42, 44, 55, and 41 points, setting a high standard for greatness. Following in the footsteps of such a legend is a significant achievement in itself.\n\nAdditionally, Brunson became only the third player in NBA Playoff history to record more than 40 points and 10 assists in a series-clinching victory. His playoff numbers exceeded expectations, propelling the Knicks to the second round of the playoff series.\n\nWhile the opening two games saw Brunson scoring 22 and 24 points respectively, securing a 2-0 lead, he truly shone in Game 3. In that game, he posted a double-double with 39 points and 13 assists despite the Sixers taking the win and narrowing the series to 2-1.\n\nIn the following game, Brunson showcased his resilience, tallying an impressive 47 points, 4 rebounds, and 10 assists. Despite his 40-point contribution in Game 5, the Sixers narrowly clinched the victory.\n\nDetermined to bounce back, Brunson delivered a stellar performance in Game 6, scoring 41 points and dishing out 12 assists, ending the Sixers' postseason journey.\n\nWith his brilliance on display, Brunson led the Knicks to victory over the 76ers and now prepares for the next challenge against the Indiana Pacers, starting on Monday.", "source": {"uri": "otakukart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "OtakuKart"}, "authors": [{"uri": "arin_tripathi@otakukart.com", "name": "Arin Tripathi", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jordan", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Michael Jordan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Brunson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Barkley", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charles Barkley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_Suns", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix Suns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_76ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia 76ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://otakukart.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Netflix-8.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9539735", "eventUri": "eng-9539735", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 148, "relevance": 1}

The Knicks relied upon Jalen Brunson's 41 points and the near-perfect free-throw team numbers, finishing 22-of-23 and a stellar 42.5 percent from the 3-point line.\n\nMeanwhile, in six games, the No. 6 seed Pacers knocked out the No. 3 seed Bucks. The Bucks were without several key pieces, including Giannis Antetokounmpo, who had a calf strain that impacted his entire playoff run, albeit briefly. This allowed the Pacers to dominate with the three-headed monster of Pascal Siakam, Tyreese Haliburton and Myles Turner, who each played a crucial role and finished in double figures in a 120-98 win at home to seal the deal.\n\nThe series is a throwback to the mid-90s, which featured several legendary games and talent on both sides, including Reggie Miller and John Starks, to name a few.\n\nKnicks vs. Pacers will air on TNT in the United States and TSN 1/4 in Canada.

I think every team now has at least one center who can play away from the basket. What that does is it opens up the floor,\" Knicks head coach Tom Thibodeau said after practice at the team's Tarrytown training facility Sunday afternoon. \"Now you're cutting, dribbling penetration, you're spread out more. The skill level of bigs has dramatically improved. You see guys shooting threes, putting it on the floor. A lot of offenses are inverted. And so you have to be able to guard. That's why your individual fundamental defense is important, as well.\"\n\nTurner is just one of a number of stretch fives the Knicks have had difficulty guarding this season.\n\nAnd then, of course, there's Turner, who is shooting 48 percent from three over his last 10 games against the Knicks, making 25 of his last 58 attempts from deep.\n\nTurner averaged three made 3s per game in the Pacers' first-round series victory over the Milwaukee Bucks and made seven 3s for 29 points in a Game 4 victory.\n\nHe is averaging 19.2 points per game in the playoffs, better than any single season of his nine-year NBA career and the second-most for the Pacers in their postseason run.\n\nAnd he had 23 points on two-of-two shooting from downtown in Indiana's Feb. 10 victory over the Knicks, the only game both teams played after the trade deadline, when the Knicks acquired Bojan Bogdanovic and Alec Burks.\n\n\"Obviously the spacing offensively for the other team, everything is more open,\" starting forward Josh Hart said after Knicks practice at the Tarrytown training facility Sunday afternoon. \"So we have to be more disciplined in terms of on-ball defending. More disciplined in terms of our close-outs. Not letting them get the ability to put us in rotations.\"\n\nTurner is not the head of the snake for the Pacers' offensive attack.\n\nThings in Indiana begin and end with Tyrese Haliburton, the All-Star point guard recently named to Team USA's 2024 Paris Olympic roster. Pascal Siakam is No. 2 and led the Pacers in scoring in their first-round series against the Bucks.\n\nThe attention paid to those two will inevitably create openings for Turner, who has feasted from deep against the Knicks over his career.\n\n\"It's a collective effort. It doesn't matter what they do. I think no matter what scheme they run, whatever play they run, you know what each player that they have on our team is capable of,\" said Donte DiVincenzo. \"So we know that. We have our schemes, we have our things that we want to do, and at the end of the day, they know that and we know what they run. So it's going to come down to different adjustments, different tweaks throughout the series.\n\n\"But ultimately it just comes down to competing. If you compete hard enough on the ball, if you compete hard enough off the ball, you take some of their actions away, and you're not relying on 'if they run this play, this is what you have to take away.' You can take away different things.\"\n\nFor what it's worth, Thibodeau appeared unfazed by the challenge posed by Turner's ability to knock down threes at a high clip, even though history -- against both Turner and other three-point-shooting bigs -- suggests there should be a reason for the Knicks to be concerned.\n\n\"It doesn't change the strengths of the team,\" he said. \"They're gonna take 40-45 threes. So just know what their strengths are. He's a stretch-five. He's been that for awhile. So we have to be aware and alert.\"", "source": {"uri": "nydailynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kristian_winfield@nydailynews.com", "name": "Kristian Winfield", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Embiid", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joel Embiid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myles_Turner", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Myles Turner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Bucks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Bucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_76ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia 76ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Hart", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Josh Hart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alec_Burks", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alec Burks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bojan_Bogdanovi\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bojan Bogdanovi\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Thibodeau", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tom Thibodeau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Points_per_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Points per game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trade (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donte_DiVincenzo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donte DiVincenzo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_Siakam", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pascal Siakam"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.nydailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/AP22005066457900.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9539735", "eventUri": "eng-9539735", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-02-10", "textStart": 1773, "textEnd": 1780}], "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 144, "relevance": 1}

That, of course, is ancient history at this point.\n\nThis series may be the start of a new Knick-Pacer rivalry. There are plenty of subplots (Jalen Brunson vs. his ex-coach Rick Carlisle; OG Anunoby vs. his old teammate Pascal Siakam; Obi Toppin vs. his old team, and on and on).

Below, Brown breaks down Knicks-Pacers ahead of Game 1:\n\n** PPG- (123.3) (1ST)...FGA- (92.7) (1ST)...FG%- (50.7) (1ST)...3PT%- (37.4) (9TH)...AST (30.8) (1ST)...TOs- (12.9) (9TH)...BLK- (5.9) (8TH)...PACE (2ND)...OFF RATING (2ND)...NET RATING (10TH)...POINTS OFF TOs (4TH)...2ND CHANCE POINTS (7TH)...FAST BREAK POINTS (4TH)...PONITS IN PAINT (1ST)...LEAST D3PTAs (1ST)...DEF AST (4TH)...\n\nNEGATIVE TEAM STATS- REGULAR SEASON\n\n** FTAs- (20.5) (22ND)...PERSONAL FOULS- (21.4) (30TH)...DEF RATING (24TH)...DREB% (26TH)...TOT REB% (24TH)...DPPG- (120.2) (27TH)...DFG% (49.6%) (30TH)...DFTA- (26.0) (30TH)...ALLOWING 2ND CHANCE POINTS (26TH)...ALLOWING POINTS IN PAINT (30TH)...\n\nBrown: \"The Pacers essentially went with an eight-man rotation in the Milwaukee series. Jackson can be a spot minutes player; he is a runner upfront. When Turner leaves the game, they will play Toppin and Siakam together at 4 and 5. If you are the Knicks, does Mitchell Robinson have a place in this series? The Pacers have small second unit and some pace. Or do you look to (Precious) Achuiwa as more of a mobile big? I can see (Tom) Thibodeau going either way here...\n\n\"When Haliburton and McConnell play together in the backcourt, they can be very dynamic in terms of creating pace and dribble penetration into the lane. They can do it without a pick or with a very quick pick. Both players have a good feel of playing without the ball - sensing and driving the seams of weakside closeouts and rotations.\n\n\"Their bench was at the top of the league as a scoring unit. Toppin and McConnell came up big in their clinching Game 6. But moving (Buddy) Hield at the deadline and (Ben) Mathurin's (14.5 ppg) injury thinned their firepower out a little. Sheppard is a three-point shooter.\n\nBrown: \"Much is made of their pace game; they ranked second in pace in the regular season. But the Pacers only ranked ninth out of 16 playoff teams in their series against the Bucks. They still have frenzies where they can hit you with an 8-0 or like 10-2 run- in a hurry - and especially in the their building. Their bigs are excellent runners and their best fast break chances either come off a blocked shots or when Haliburton gets a rebound and just takes off.\n\n\"Their secondary break and flow game can be dangerous because the trailer - usually Turner- is a live scorer. He doesn't just look to swing the ball; he will shoot that three if left alone. Siakam likes to leak out and look for the early postup/iso. If he draws a guard, he can be devastating. When he catches off the lane, he will take as many dribbles as needed to get off a shot. They slow down in these situations.\n\n\"In the halfcourt, they basically run all pick-and-roll sets with the exception of a couple of sets for Siakam (post or isolation for him). In charting them, I saw 20 different pick-and-roll calls within one game. So they are using Haliburton and McConnell in every different way and angle. They like staggered pick-and-rolls - just like the Sixers. Currently, Haliburton has not been the scorer or shooter that he was earlier in the season. He shot the three poorly (29 percent) vs the Bucks, and that suggests that you can go under (screens for him) and stay out of (defensive) rotations. If McConnell gets to the paint, very bad things happen. He is shooting as much as he ever has in his career; he makes those short jump shots. Otherwise, he has a great knack for picking out the open man. Turner is the last part of the equation. He is effective either rolling into the lane or popping. Turner averaged 19 on good shooting against Milwaukee.\n\n\"Coach Rick Carlisle is a good after time out play coach. Two concepts here: some form of a staggered screen is utilized; if it's an individual player call, they would go to Siakam. In the playoffs, these plays can be vital - especially if the game is decided by a few points. We had that last series vs Sixers- all the little pieces count...\n\nBrown: \"While some of the regular season numbers are gruesome, the Pacers guarded with more of a purpose in the Milwaukee series. They have good length in their starting lineup. Unlike the Sixers (Joel Embiid), they have bigs who are a lot more mobile and can be aggressive in pick-and-roll coverages. Siakam is a good switch defender in different sets.\n\n\"So who matches up with Brunson on the primary individual look? Unlike the Sixers, who used length to defend Brunson, Indiana can give the first call to a player who is kind of the same size and shape of Brunson in Nembhard. He guarded Damian Lillard Round 1. He is physical on the ball-very strong; think of Boston's Derrick White. Nesmith is the second call, and now we are going back to the length concept that the Sixers used. When McConnell comes in, he will pick up Brunson fullcourt, and basically faceguard Brunson everywhere. You can also see Haliburton and Siakam on Brunson as well. So there are lots of options here, but that doesn't mean Brunson can't beat the different looks. Remember, Carlisle coached Brunson in Dallas; how does that play into things?\n\n\"In the regular season, the Pacers were a weak defensive rebounding team; they also gave up a lot of second-chance points. They struggled to contain drives and prevent points in the paint. They fared a little better in those areas against the Bucks; but the Bucks didn't have Giannis Antetokounmpo, who would have impacted those categories. So can the Knicks convert on potential second-chance points again? They did it well against in their two playoff series wins (against Cleveland last season and Philadelphia in Round 1). Turner coming off the floor is significant for the Knicks. The Pacers hustle a little better in this area than the Sixers did, but you are still looking at a physical/toughness edge for the Knicks when Turner is off the floor.\n\nBrown: \"Due in part to the schedule, the Knicks didn't play a clean game against the Pacers in the regular season. The first game was the day of the Toronto trade, so you throw that out. The Knicks had an incredible comeback win at MSG in which they played great down the stretch. I think the \"pace game\" component from the regular season doesn't play out as much in the playoffs. But Indiana plays a little different - not good or bad - they just give you different things to consider as a defense. Something else to consider: Nesmith was a weak offensive player for them in Round 1; do the Knicks funnel things his way like they did with (Tobias) Harris in the Sixers series? Buckle up, this will be some different basketball than Round 1, but I think it will be very exciting...\"", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/30th_Primetime_Emmy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "30th Primetime Emmy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turner_Broadcasting_System", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Turner Broadcasting System"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_University", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brown University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_Siakam", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pascal Siakam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_break", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fast break"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O.G._Anunoby", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "O.G.

In the 21st century, they've cumulatively employed just nine All-Stars. Five of these players only earned the nod once, and only Carmelo Anthony and Julius Randle were selected at least thrice. Star power has been scarce, which is ironic considering the franchise is based in New York and plays at the iconic Madison Square Garden, but their latest All-Star, guard Jalen Brunson, has the city on a string.\n\nSince joining the Knicks in the 2022 offseason, he has led the franchise to two playoff series wins, one more than they had managed between 2000 and his arrival a couple of years ago. Brunson has shone in New York and those who root for the Knicks have already anointed him as their savior.\n\nBut some, including franchise icon Charles Oakley, are perhaps taking the praise a bit too far. During an interview with SiriusXM Radio following the Knicks' road win in Game 4 of their first-round playoff series against the Philadelphia 76ers, he said,\n\n\"[Jalen] Brunson's the best thing since Walt Frazier. I know somebody gonna say, 'What about Patrick [Ewing] and Carmelo [Anthony]?' OK, they didn't do this. I mean, you know, they got a chance to show. We need more players. Brunson's playing without Julius, and what he's doing man, hey, it's incredible. Keep doing it.\"\n\nClaiming Brunson already ranked ahead of Patrick Ewing, one of the greatest Knicks players ever, was a scorching take. The franchise's former star, Mark Jackson, recently took exception to his ex-teammate's shocking claim. On the latest episode of The Mark Jackson Show, the host, called out Oakley, saying,\n\n\"Time out. Are you kidding me? I love you Oak, but what are we doing? Let me introduce you to the greatest, not just since [Walt] Clyde Frazier, the greatest New York Knicks basketball player of all time. That includes everybody. You include everybody that ever played in the blue and orange and you put them on the draft board, the number one pick is Patrick Ewing.\"\n\nJackson lauded Brunson's impeccable impact and claimed he was elated that the guard has managed to reinvigorate the Knicks supporters' passion for the team. However, he aptly followed it up by stating that the guard's legacy with the Knicks doesn't yet hold a candle to Ewing's achievements with the franchise.\n\nThis is likely just a case of Oakley's emotions getting the best of him. Recency bias is inescapable and it's likely if the former Knicks star really ponders about his statement, he will revoke it immediately.\n\nPatrick Ewing spent 15 of his 17-year NBA career with the Knicks and was among the best players in the league for most of his stint with the franchise. He was a perennial All-Star who earned 11 nods during his glorious career and made it to seven All-NBA starting lineups.\n\nEwing leads the Knicks in almost every major statistical category. He leads the franchise record-holder for points (23,655), rebounds (10,759), blocks 2,758, and steals (1,061) [per Statmuse]. Like Jalen Brunson, a rookie Ewing joined a Knicks team that hadn't enjoyed much playoff success in the decade prior. They had only won three playoff series in 10 years, a damning stat for a franchise of New York's stature.\n\nBut Ewing's arrival turned the tide for them. It may have taken until his fourth season for the Knicks to enjoy success in the postseason, but, once he did, he did not look back.\n\nIn the 1990s, the Knicks, led by Ewing, were the second-most successful franchise, making it to four Eastern Conference Finals and two NBA Finals appearances. But he could not usurp the Michael Jordan-led Chicago Bulls and left the franchise after 15 seasons without a ring.\n\nWhile Ewing could not lead the Knicks to the ultimate prize, he is undoubtedly one of the best players in franchise history with a legacy far superior to Brunson's.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsrush.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsRush"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jay_mahesh_lokegaonkar@thesportsrush.com", "name": "Jay Mahesh Lokegaonkar", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Ewing", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Ewing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmelo_Anthony", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carmelo Anthony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mark Jackson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Oakley", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Charles Oakley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walt_Frazier", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Walt Frazier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Randle", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Julius Randle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Brunson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison_Square_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Madison Square Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_76ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia 76ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-NBA_Team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "All-NBA Team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bulls", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bulls"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://cdn-wp.thesportsrush.com/2024/05/602aaa23-untitled-design-2024-05-05t143207.221.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9539735", "eventUri": "eng-9539735", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 142, "relevance": 1}

This classic East rivalry adds another chapter when Game 1 of the conference semifinals tips off inside Madison Square Garden tonight.\n\nThey both advanced to this spot with six-game series wins, but it was the sixth-seeded Pacers that pulled off the upset in the opening round (beating a banged-up Milwaukee squad) and enter Game 1 as 6-point road underdogs in the Mecca of basketball Monday night.\n\nI dissect the spread and Over/Under total for this series opener and give my best NBA picks and predictions for Pacers vs. Knicks on May 6.\n\nMy analysis\n\nPascal Siakam proved his worth as a scorer in the first two games against Milwaukee, putting up a collective 73 points before drawing the ire of the Bucks defense. A tighter watch on Siakam held him to a combined 61 points over the next four contests.\n\nThe New York Knicks' stingy defense won't let Siakam catch it by surprise in Game 1, but the athletic forward can hurt the Knicks in other ways. He displayed his passing prowess in that opening-round series, dishing out 4+ assists in four of the six games, including efforts of six and seven dimes against the Bucks.\n\nTom Thibodeau's defense is a tough nut to crack but when opponents have success against it, those buckets come from ball movement. New York ranks 17th in defensive assist-per-FG percentage and watched the Sixers record an assist on more than 62% of their makes in Round 1.\n\nSiakam's assist prop for Game 1 against the Knicks is at 3.5 Over/Under, which sits right on his season average of 4.3 dimes per game. However, Siakam is logging more floor time in the postseason -- with his minutes jumping from 31.8 to 38 in the playoffs -- and has found his way into Rick Carlisle's playbook after being acquired from Toronto in mid-January.\n\nSiakam finished the first round topping that 3.5-assist bar in four of the six games and closed the series with 6.7 potential assists per outing. Player projections sourced for Game 1 all come in above that total with a ceiling of five dimes from some models, while my number comes out to four assists from him Monday night.\n\nThe Over 3.5 assist prop ranges in terms of vig, sitting as high as -113 at some books, but if you shop around, you can find that same offering at +105 on Monday morning.\n\nSiakam will be the focal point on the Knicks defense, which will try to take the ball out of his hands. Player forecasts call for 4-plus+ assists tonight.\n\nBruson's points projections range, with some flirting with 40 points. I'm not buying into that but I do see him knocking down 3+ shots from downtown.\n\nIndiana was able to get pasta busted Bucks team and while they could give the Knicks a scare at home, I like New York to guard the Garden in Game 1.\n\nLearn how to bet a same-game parlay with these helpful tips and strategies.\n\nThe Knicks have won outright on the moneyline in 52 of their last 82 games (+18.40 units).

The Knicks will need to overcome some challenges as the Eastern Conference Semifinals approach.\n\nThe Pacers are the definition of a \"run-and-gun\" team, with a pace of 102.16 (second in the NBA). Their youth, with an average age of 25.4, is the main reason behind that. Players like Tyrese Haliburton, Aaron Nesmith, and Andrew Nembhard can run the floor with or without the ball and space the floor to knock down shots in transition.\n\nLuckily, New York can overcome this challenge with its elite defense. The Knicks' defense ranks third in the NBA since January 1, mainly due to OG Anunoby. It will be interesting to see who will match up with Haliburton, as the one thing New York needs to do is not let him push the ball up the middle of the floor, as that's his bread and butter when working in transition.\n\nPlayers like T.J.

This team might not have the same layout, but they have some firepower, like Jalen Brunson, to make it back to the semifinals for the first time in 24 years. They were able to advance to Round 2 thanks to outlasting a tough Philadelphia 76ers squad in six games.\n\nThe Pacers stunned many by outplaying the depleted Milwaukee Bucks in the first round, beating Damian Lillard and company in six games. It marked Indiana's first series win since 2014, the last time the Pacers made it to the conference finals.

Will it translate to the playoffs?", "body": "By Kristian Winfield | kwinfield@nydailynews.com | New York Daily News\n\nJosh Hart doesn't want to make the assumption -- but the trend proved true at least through the first two games of the Knicks' first-round playoff series against the Philadelphia 76ers, which means a similar trend could be true, too, in the second round against the Indiana Pacers.\n\nJalen Brunson shot the ball poorly in four regular-season matchups against the 76ers. His slow shooting start in Games 1 and 2 -- where he shot a combined 16-of-55 from the field -- was not a surprise.\n\nNor should it be a surprise if Brunson reduced the Indiana Pacer defense to ash given he's picked them apart every time they've played since he signed with the Knicks two summers ago.\n\nThis season in particular, Brunson averaged more than 35 points per game on 38-of-77 (49.3 percent) shooting from the field in three games against the Pacers, including 39- and 40-point outings in early February.\n\nIt's the sixth-highest scoring clip the All-Star guard has posted against any team this year, trailing only his performances against the San Antonio Spurs, Phoenix Suns, Sacramento Kings, Chicago Bulls and Milwaukee Bucks.\n\nDoes that mean, however, his explosive regular-season scoring against the Pacers will translate to a playoff series?\n\n\"I don't assume nothing,\" Hart said after practice at the Knicks' Tarrytown training facility Sunday afternoon. \"I mean, JB's a guy who's going to be aggressive. He's a guy that can score the ball at a high level, but in the playoffs, everything's unpredictable. So we've gotta make sure we get him open, get him taking good shots, and if he's not, then some of us have to pick up that scoring punch, but he's someone who we're never really worried about. He's someone who plays his style no matter what, and we're happy he's on our team.\"\n\nThe 76ers used a combination of 6-foot-8 wings Kelly Oubre Jr. and Nicolas Batum to deploy length at the point of attack, which made life difficult early on for the 6-foot-2 Brunson. He and his teammates eventually figured out the Sixers: After his slow shooting start through the first two games of the first round, he never scored fewer than 39 points or shot worse than 46.9 percent from the field in Games 3 through 6.\n\nThe Pacers do not have Oubre or Batum, but they have their own perimeter defenders: Andrew Nembhard and Aaron Nesmith take turns defending the opposing team's best perimeter scorer and will each take their turns defending Brunson in the second round. The Pacers also utilize T.J. McConnell off the bench, who is known league-wide as a defensive pest.\n\n\"Just let the game tell you what to do. Be ready to play, and whatever comes, that's what Jalen's been great at,\" said head coach Tom Thibodeau. \"So I think we can pose some problems, too. I think the way Josh plays, there's times where he's play-making and leading the break. Donte [DiVincenzo] can lead the break. So there's a lot of versatility to our offense, as well. And I think with Isaiah [Hartenstein] playing away from the basket, we can play off that. So there's a lot of things that we have to do, but we know our defense has to be great.\"", "source": {"uri": "nydailynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kristian_winfield@nydailynews.com", "name": "Kristian Winfield", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_76ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia 76ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Hart", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Josh Hart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Daily_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Daily News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Brunson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolas_Batum", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nicolas Batum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Bucks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Bucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_Suns", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix Suns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacramento_Kings", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sacramento Kings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Points_per_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Points per game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Antonio_Spurs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "San Antonio Spurs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bulls", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bulls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Nesmith", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Nesmith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Nembhard", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Nembhard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_Oubre_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kelly Oubre Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Thibodeau", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tom Thibodeau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.nydailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/AP24033113916407.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9539735", "eventUri": "eng-9539735", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 138, "relevance": 1}

Jamal Murray's injury hinders him as he battles the Timberwolves' top-rated defense in the playoffs. Chet Holmgren must defend against crafty finishers like Luka Don\u010di\u0107 and Kyrie Irving, creating a tough defensive task for the young Thunder star.\n\nAs the NBA playoffs move into the second round, only eight teams remain alive. The destiny of the coveted Larry O'Brien Trophy depends on the actions of a few star players still fighting for glory, but which of these stars is faced with the toughest challenge in their second round matchup?\n\nHere are three NBA stars with the hardest path to the Conference Finals.\n\nJalen Brunson Pacers will have full attention on Knicks star after regular season\n\nIt is hard to imagine that Jalen Brunson will maintain his NBA-best 35.5 points per game playoff average throughout the second round, but then again, Brunson did not exactly struggle against the Indiana Pacers this season.\n\nBrunson averaged 35.7 points per game on 49.4 percent shooting in three games versus Indiana in 2023-24, and the New York Knicks will continue to rely on this type of volume scoring from Brunson as they look to reach their first Eastern Conference Finals as a franchise since 2000.\n\nHaving failed to contain Brunson during the regular season, and having now watched Brunson score at will in the later stages of the Knicks' first round series against the Philadelphia 76ers, Rick Carlisle has surely devised a dynamic defensive scheme for Brunson that involves a constantly rotating barrage of Pacers crowding Brunson's airspace and making things as difficult and as unpredictable for the All-Star guard.\n\nIndiana has the personnel to pull off such a plan. On one hand, Carlisle can bother Brunson with length by sticking Pascal Siakam on him for stretches. On the other hand, Carlisle can choose to wear down Brunson from the ground up with testy, indefatigable defensive pests like T.J. McConnell and Andrew Nembhard.\n\nPerhaps the most bothersome matchup of all for Brunson will be Aaron Nesmith, who plays with the same defensive ferocity of McConnell and Nembhard but also offers superior length and athleticism to Brunson where McConnell and Nembhard do not.\n\nCarlisle and the Pacers' perimeter-defense-by-committee are going to do everything in their power to prevent Brunson from beating them as a scorer. Brunson is likely to face an ever-changing myriad of coverages and be forced to make difficult decisions out of double teams and blitzes. Josh Hart and Donte DiVincenzo will have to shoot threes at a good percentage for the Knicks to survive this scenario.\n\nBesides being forced out of his comfort zone as a volume scorer, Jalen Brunson will also have his hands full on the defensive side of the ball, where he will inevitably be matched up with All-Star Tyrese Haliburton on a number of possessions. Although Brunson is no stranger to defending star guards (see: Tyrese Maxey in round one), Haliburton at 6-foot-5 presents a significant length mismatch for Brunson.\n\nIt might seem like Brunson just conquered a beast in defeating the 76ers, but he now faces a potentially far more arduous mountain to climb to reach the Conference Finals in the form of the Indiana Pacers.\n\nJamal Murray vs. Timberwolves Murray's injury could create problems for Nuggets in tough matchup\n\nJamal Murray is hurt. Anyone watching the Denver Nuggets' Game 1 loss to the Minnesota Timberwolves on Saturday night could see as early as the first quarter that Murray was not moving with anything close to 100 percent mobility.\n\nMurray's left calf strain was suffered during Denver's first round series against the Los Angeles Lakers, and he was listed as questionable leading up to Game 1 vs. Minnesota. Denver head coach Mike Malone revealed in interviews that Murray has been in and out of practice, and that Malone didn't even want Murray to play in Game 5 of the Lakers series.\n\nMurray went scoreless in the entire first half of Saturday's Game 1 vs. the Timberwolves, the first time in Murray's entire career that he has gone scoreless in one half of a playoff game. He finished the game with 17 points on 6-14 shooting but was unable to help Denver avoid losing home-court advantage in this pivotal second round series between two powerhouses.\n\nMurray might have been able to better hide his injury against a lesser foe, but he and the Nuggets are unfortunately facing off against the NBA's highest-rated defense from the 2023-24 season. Anthony Edwards looks like a top 5 player in the world right now, and all of Minnesota's lengthy defenders are hungrier than ever to shock the world and eliminate the defending champions from the playoffs.\n\nIn having to overcome Minnesota's top-rated defense on only one healthy leg, Murray faces perhaps the most difficult playoff challenge of his young career.\n\nChet Holmgren vs. Mavericks Holmgren faces a tall defensive task against Luka Don\u010di\u0107 and Kyrie Irving\n\nChet Holmgren finished his rookie season tied for fourth in the NBA in blocked shots, a clear indication that he is a legitimate rim protector despite his impossibly lanky frame. That being said, as the Oklahoma City Thunder face off against the Dallas Mavericks in a Western Conference Semifinal, Holmgren will be protecting the rim against two of the craftiest finishers that the modern NBA has to offer in Kyrie Irving and Luka Don\u010di\u0107.\n\nIrving's other-worldly skills as perhaps the best below-the-rim finisher in the history of the sport are well documented. Don\u010di\u0107's craftsmanship around the rim and in the paint is less showy than Irving's but is nonetheless a nightmare for shot-blocking bigs such as Holmgren.\n\nDon\u010di\u0107 uses endless shot and pass fakes deep in the paint along with his patented deceleration to not only avoid shot blockers but bait them into foul trouble. Holmgren's body control will be tested every time Irving or Don\u010di\u0107 enter the paint looking for an easy bucket, and it will be a huge challenge for Holmgren to avoid fouling.\n\nTo Holmgren's credit, he is an extremely high-IQ player (especially for his age) and is capable of doing an adequate job with challenging Irving and Don\u010di\u0107, especially given the context that, in defending these two players at the rim, there's often nothing that can be done.\n\nHolmgren's difficulties won't stop at rim protection, however. He is also going to be responsible for endless pick and roll defense coverages, during which Dallas will draw him out to the three-point arc and force him to hedge or switch in actions involving Irving and Don\u010di\u0107.\n\nGiven the high frequency at which Dallas runs pick and roll for Don\u010di\u0107, Holmgren's defensive involvement in these actions is likely to take up a ton of his energy, such that he will have less to offer on the offensive end.\n\nFurthermore, while Holmgren will be tasked with extending out to Irving and Don\u010di\u0107, he'll also have to recover into the paint and deter both Dereck Lively II and Daniel Gafford from becoming lob threats. Gafford is also likely to cause major issues for Holmgren from a strength standpoint, if Gafford's overpowering of Ivica Zubac in the first round is any indication.\n\nHolmgren will have his hands full all series long, as Dallas will be targeting his wiry frame time and time again.\n\nWith Great Playoff Power Comes Great Responsibility\n\nBrunson, Murray and Holmgren face uphill battles in a sense, because their teams rely on them heavily to win. All three players should feel empowered by their vital playoff roles, especially Holmgren, who is only playing in his rookie season.\n\nStill, there will be times in this second round when Brunson, Murray and Holmgren will be in danger of being overwhelmed by the burden that their responsibilities have created. This is the kind of pressurized atmosphere that only playoff basketball can foster, and it will be exciting to see which of these stars rises to the occasion and turns pressure into diamonds.\n\nAll statistics courtesy of Basketball Reference unless otherwise noted.\n\nRelated Jalen Brunson's Run of Dominance is Reminiscent Of Allen Iverson's 2001 Playoff Run Jalen Brunson's dominant one-man show to carry the Knicks into the second round reminds fans of Allen Iverson's legendary run.", "source": {"uri": "givemesport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GiveMeSport"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Nembhard", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Nembhard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Brunson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Carlisle", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rick Carlisle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Luka Don\u010di\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chet_Holmgren", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chet Holmgren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Points_per_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Points per game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_76ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia 76ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamal_Murray", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jamal Murray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_O'Brien_Championship_Trophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Larry O'Brien Championship Trophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_Siakam", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pascal Siakam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Nesmith", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Nesmith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Maxey", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Maxey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Hart", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Josh Hart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donte_DiVincenzo", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donte DiVincenzo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._J._McConnell", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "T.

While the starters are expected to play a bulk of the minutes in any playoff setting, the idea of Knicks head coach Tom Thibodeau expanding the rotation for the Eastern Conference Semifinals against the Pacers could become a real possibility.\n\nWhen asked if he would consider bringing in more bench players for the second round, Thibodeau gave the most Thibodeau answer you could get.\n\n\"We could,\" said Thibodeau via The Athletic's Fred Katz.\n\nOne of the Pacers' main strengths is their depth, with guys like TJ McConnell and Obi Toppin leading that unit. In their Game 6 victory over the Milwaukee Bucks, the pair combined for 41 points. In stark contrast, the Knicks only had five bench points in their Game 6 win over the Philadelphia 76ers.\n\nWith the injury to Bojan Bogdanovic that will end his season, the Knicks bench is essentially Miles McBride and Mitchell Robinson. However, starting center Isaiah Hartenstein found himself in foul trouble often during the first round against Philadelphia, so their options became very limited and nearly every starter had to play 40+ minutes.\n\nIn the first round against Philadelphia, three Knicks players averaged at least 41 minutes (Jalen Brunson, Josh Hart, and OG Anunoby), and Hart currently leads all players in minutes per game this postseason with 46.3 minutes on average.\n\nNow, Knicks players are used to carrying heavy workloads under Thibodeau's leadership, but the prospect of fatigue could certainly be a factor, especially after playing a physical team like Philadelphia and now playing against a relentless offense in Indiana.\n\nThe first name that comes to mind that could see action is Precious Achiuwa. Achiuwa is the team's third-string big, but he demonstrated the ability to step in and make plays at any point in time with his highly impactful performance on the defensive end in Game 4 against Philadelphia while Mitchell Robinson was out with an injury.\n\nWhat hurts Achiuwa's chances of getting significant burns is his inability to provide much offense. The lack of shot creation renders him nearly useless at the power forward position, and the Knicks have two impactful bigs in front of him. However, if injuries or foul trouble play a factor, Achiuwa could step in and provide important minutes.\n\nAlec Burks, meanwhile, has not played since April 12 as he has essentially been completely phased out of the rotation. With the injury to Bogdanovic, the Knicks lack a pure scorer in the second unit.

CBS Sports will be providing daily picks for the duration of the postseason. Sam Quinn will make at least one pick for every game between now and the NBA Finals.\n\nNew York Knicks vs. Indiana Pacers\n\nGive Jalen Brunson credit. Any player having a pre-game points line of 34.5 under any circumstances is remarkably impressive. Still, it's a bit high under the specific circumstances of Game 1. Notably, Game 1 against Philadelphia saw Brunson hit his series-low in both points (22) and field goal attempts (26). He played over 41 minutes, which is obviously quite a bit of playing time, but he never played fewer than 43 minutes and 32 seconds the rest of the way. We're splitting hairs here, but the Knicks are a bit more conservative with Brunson early in series than they are later on. When you couple that with Rick Carlisle's track record of coming up with creative schemes to bug opposing stars, and Brunson will probably need a game or two to really get going against the Pacers. The Pick: Brunson Under 34.5 Points\n\nDenver Nuggets vs. Minnesota Timberwolves\n\nNikola Jokic prefers not to emphasize scoring. As we saw in Game 1, he's going to need to if Denver is to win this series. Jamal Murray went scoreless for a big part of Game 1 because of his calf injury and the stifling defense of Anthony Edwards and Jaden McDaniels. Rudy Gobert broke up multiple alley-oops from Jokic to Aaron Gordon. The Timberwolves are too athletic and too disciplined for Denver to rely on its system alone. Its star needs to be the best player in this series, and considering Jokic has averaged 29.8 points in his last 12 regular-season games against Rudy Gobert and just scored 32 in Game 1, it seems safe to assume that he can do it.

The Knicks haven't made a conference final since 2000.\n\nMeanwhile, the defending champs are on the ropes a bit after losing Game 1 at home. Denver has plenty of time and talent to turn things around, but an 0-2 hole would be tough to come back from.\n\nHere's a look at Monday's NBA Playoff games with staff picks, odds and previews.\n\nThis is a classic 90s playoff rivalry reborn in a new era. Although these teams last met in the playoffs in 2013 (also in the second round), Pacers-Knicks became a thing when these two teams met in the playoffs six times from 1993-2000. Each team won three series, which included three conference finals series.\n\nPatrick Ewing and Reggie Miller won't be suiting up for this one, but there is an interesting matchup on paper. Jalen Brunson has to be the first player mentioned after the way he played against the 76ers last round. Brunson averaged 35.5 points per game over the six games in that series. Indiana must stop him from taking over games, but Brunson has seemed unstoppable at times.\n\nThe Pacers are a more balanced team than the Knicks and were a bit more up and down against the Bucks in the first round, though they also win in six games. Six players averaged double figures in the first round, led by Pascal Siakam at 22 points per game.\n\nIndiana won two of the three regular-season meetings between these teams, including a win at Madison Square Garden in February.\n\nThe Knicks are solid favorites for Game 1 and even bigger favorites to advance to the conference final. Knicks fans have justifiable confidence for the first time in years, perhaps decades.\n\nWhen factoring in injuries, there weren't any true upsets in the first round of the playoffs. The better seed won six series and the other two (Indiana over Milwaukee and Dallas over the LA Clippers) involved the losing team not having its best player due to injury. Minnesota is working on the first real upset of the playoffs after winning Game 1 in Denver in impressive fashion.\n\nThe Timberwolves won 106-99 and absorbed a lot of big shots from Denver in the fourth quarter. Minnesota held the defending champs at bay in front of a hostile crowd.\n\nSure, it took Anthony Edwards going off for 43 points on 17-for-29 shooting and Jamal Murray not scoring until the third quarter, but this was the formula Minnesota envisioned when it traded for Rudy Gobert. Edwards is turning into one of the best players in the league and Gobert remains one of the best interior defenders in the league. Minnesota has one of the best scorers and one of the best defenders in the league. That's enough to keep Minnesota in any game. Now, the Timberwolves have to do it over a seven-game series against the defending champs.\n\nThe pressure is on Denver for Game 2. The Nuggets can't afford to go down 0-2 heading to Minnesota. Nikola Joki\u0107 still had plenty of stats to show he had a good game (32 points, nine assists, eight rebounds), but he did have seven turnovers. Throw in Murray only scoring 17 points after a scoreless first half and you have the formula for a bad game for Denver.\n\nIt doesn't seem likely for those two to play like that again, but the Timberwolves already have a home-court advantage in the series. A loose Minnesota team could be very dangerous in Game 2, although the Nuggets are a solid favorite for Monday.\n\nAnonymous NBA player poll 2024: LeBron or Jordan as the GOAT? Most overrated?

I know somebody gonna say, 'What about Patrick (Ewing) and Carmelo (Anthony)?' OK, they didn't do this. I mean, you know, they got a chance to show. We need more players. Brunson's playing without Julius (Randle), and what he's doing man, hey, it's incredible. Keep doing it,\" said Oakley on a recent appearance on SiriusXM NBA Radio, per Paul Kasabian of Bleacher Report.\n\nNow, former point guard Mark Jackson is firing back at that audacious assertion.\n\n\"We love Oak...but Oak made Jalen Brunson's greatest New York Knicks basketball player since Clyde Frazier. Time out. Are you kidding me? I love you Oak, but what are we doing? Let me introduce you to the greatest, not just since Clyde Frazier, the greatest New York Knicks basketball player of all time,\" said Jackson on the Come and Talk 2 Me podcast, via New York Basketball on X, the social media platform formerly referred to as Twitter.\n\n\"That includes everybody. You include everybody that ever played in the blue and orange and you put them on the draft board, the number one pick is Patrick Ewing.\"\n\nIs Jalen Brunson a top five Knick?\n\nCharles Oakley's assertion that Brunson is the greatest Knicks player since Walt Frazier was obviously a prisoner of the moment hot take that can be easily forgiven. However, the question of whether Brunson cracks the top five in franchise history is certainly an interesting point to consider.\n\nBrunson has now made it as far as Carmelo Anthony ever did in a Knicks jersey (the second round of the playoffs), and has done so on twice as many occasions as Anthony (two against one). If the Knicks, as they are expected to do, are able to break through and make the conference finals this season, it will be the first time they will have done so in over two decades.\n\nHowever, even then, Brunson would need at least one Finals appearance (highly unlikely with the Boston Celtics lurking in the East) to approach the Ewing conversation, and even that might not be enough to actually put him in the number one spot.\n\nKnicks fans are likely better off just enjoying the moment without the need to compare it to the past.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jackson_stone@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Jackson Stone", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walt_Frazier", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Walt Frazier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Brunson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mark Jackson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Oakley", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Charles Oakley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Ewing", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Ewing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmelo_Anthony", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Carmelo Anthony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleacher_Report", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bleacher Report"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson,_Mississippi", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Hip-Hop", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Hip-Hop", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Recruiting", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Recruiting", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Jalen-Brunson-greatest-Knick-talk-gets-hit-with-Mark-Jackson-reality-check.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9539735", "eventUri": "eng-9539735", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 132, "relevance": 1}

Tyrese Haliburton and the Pacers will face New York in the second round of the playoffs. Will it be a revisit to the Pacers-Knicks intense rivalry of the 90s? Haliburton thinks so.\n\nThe Knicks defeated the Philadelphia 76ers and the Pacers beat the Milwaukee Bucks in the first round, respectively. The rivalry between these two teams was one of the biggest ever in NBA history. It involved players, celebrities and fans, marking some of the most intense moments in the game.\n\nWhen Pacers guard Haliburton was asked about the matchup after a decade and if it would renew the 90s rivalry, he didn't deny it.\n\n\"There's a lot of competition,\" Haliburton told Indy Star. \"There's going to be a lot of smoke in there. Obviously, a lot of their former guys are coming to a ton of games. I'm sure we'll have a lot of our former guys coming to games too. There's no secret that that's a rivalry.\"\n\nThe rivalry between both teams saw its zenith in the 1990s, with Reggie Miller, John Starks and Spike Lee at the forefront. The rivalry reached its height, with Starks headbutting Miller in 1993 in the first round of the playoffs.\n\nRemember the famous Miller choke sign? He had made it toward Lee, a Knicks superfan, in Game 5 of the ECF in 1994.\n\nBoth teams have faced each other 41 times in the postseason. And New York has won only 19 games while leading the record in the regular season. Since 1993, the Pacers and Knicks have met each other seven times, with the Pacers leading the contest 4-3.\n\nCan the new Pacers-Knicks second-round live up to the hype of their past rivalry?\n\nAlthough history suggests an intense matchup between New York and Indiana, there are still questions if they can emulate the past. Regarding the rivalry between teams in the 1990s era and the modern NBA, the rivalry has a completely different face with stricter rules.\n\nMoreover, other factors might undermine the new rivalry between the two teams. Pascal Siakam and OG Anunoby, now on opposing teams, were teammates a few months ago. Pacers' Haliburton and New York's Jalen Brunson and Josh Hart have been teammates on Team USA and share a good relationship.\n\nBut that should encourage competition, as Haliburton insisted that the former players would be present at their second-round matches. Furthermore, the Pacers have demonstrated their ability to trash-talk opponents in their battle with the Bucks. And they won't hesitate to do it with another team.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nandjee_ranjan@sportskeeda.com", "name": "Nandjee Ranjan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_rivalry", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "College rivalry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reggie_Miller", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Reggie Miller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spike_Lee", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spike Lee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_76ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia 76ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guard_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Guard (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Bucks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Bucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Indianapolis_Star", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Indianapolis Star"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O.G._Anunoby", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "O.G.

But now that he's on one of the Knicks's fiercest rival teams in the 90s, Toppin is not expecting a warm welcome.\n\n\"We understand what type of crowd is going to be there,\" Toppin told reporters after the Pacers' Saturday practice. \"Celebrities are going to be there like we just got to lock into our main things and play our type of basketball.\"\n\nThe Knicks will be looking to slow down the Pacers, who averaged 113.0 points (2nd in the playoffs) in their six-game conquest of the injury-hit Milwaukee Bucks. It's going to be the classic duel of offense versus defense. The Knicks had the second-best defense -- holding the Philadelphia 76ers to just 108.2 points per game -- next only to the surging Minnesota Timberwolves in the West.\n\nToppin claimed the MSG crowd no longer excites him.\n\n\"I'm from New York,\" said the Brooklyn-born Toppin. \"You play in Dyckman, you play in the Rucker Park. You see that every single day so it's like being from New York, that doesn't really excite me anymore.\"\n\nToppin was the first draft pick of current Knicks president Leon Rose. A consensus national player of the year in college, Toppin's selection by his hometown team was a dream come true for him.\n\nBut it gradually turned into a nightmare as he languished on the bench behind three-time All-Star forward Julius Randle. Now the Knicks are forced to playing Josh Hart almost the entire game (46.8 minutes) in their playoff run with Randle out for the season with a shoulder injury and Toppin, the former backup power forward, gone.\n\n\"We always thought [Toppin] was a good player,\" Knicks coach Tom Thibodeau told New York Post. \"I don't think anything has changed. Very athletic, runs the floor great, shoots the ball, can score the ball. He's always been able to score. Like I said, we loved having him. He was in a situation here where he's playing behind Julius [Randle]. So that was the story behind that.\"\n\nAfter three dismal season with the Knicks -- winning a Slam Dunk title was the only high point of his Knicks career -- he was traded to the Pacers last summer for a couple of second-round picks.\n\nToppin initially started in 28 games for the Pacers before coach Rick Carlisle pulled the plug on him. Carlisle moved Toppin to the second unit where he thrived and helped the Pacers in their first playoff series win since 2014.\n\nThe former No. 8 pick just scored a playoff career-high 21 points and 8 rebounds in the Pacers' 120-98 series-clinching win over the Bucks in Game 6.\n\nRevenge against the Knicks never came out of Toppin's mouth. But he understands the circumstances that he is in is now part of the rivalry between his former and current teams, who had physical and exciting playoff battles in the 90s.\n\n\"It's definitely a crazy rivalry,\" Toppin said, \"but at the end of the day, we all got here and basically we're going into battle as soon as we get to New York. Obviously like I said they're one of the most physical teams in the league. They've had that identity for many years and we just got to come in there and and match their physicality and play our type of basketball and I feel like we'll be good at that.\"\n\nToppin was not known for his physical plays but rather a finesse player who energizes the crowd with his highlight dunks. But this time his dunks will no longer draw \"oohs and aahs\" from the Garden crowd.\n\nThe once promising lottery selection is just content playing his role.\n\n\"I feel like I'm preparing myself just like I did for Milwaukee,\" Toppin said. \"Just locking into everything the coaches are telling us to do offensively and defensively, and playing my role.\"", "source": {"uri": "heavy.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Heavy"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alder_almo@heavy.com", "name": "Alder Almo", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obi_Toppin", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Obi Toppin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Randle", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Julius Randle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison_Square_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Madison Square Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_draft_lottery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA draft lottery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rucker_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rucker Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Thibodeau", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tom Thibodeau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Carlisle", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rick Carlisle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Bucks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Bucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Points_per_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Points per game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_76ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia 76ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Post", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slam_dunk", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Slam dunk"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Recruiting", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Recruiting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://heavy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1896128317-e1714913716876.jpg?quality=65&strip=all&w=780", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9539735", "eventUri": "eng-9539735", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-06", "textStart": 267, "textEnd": 272}], "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 131, "relevance": 1}

He goes out there and plays the right way and does what he needs to do.\"\n\nHaliburton, who was named to the 2024 Olympic roster last month while Brunson was not, registered a career-best 23 assists against the Knicks on Dec. 30.\n\n\"Literally the first call I had after we made the playoffs was a FaceTime with Jalen,\" Haliburton told reporters Saturday in Indiana. \"So we're pretty good friends, but it's competition and fully excited to play against those guys.\"\n\nWith Brunson, Hart and fellow Villanova alum Mikal Bridges on last summer's FIBA squad, Haliburton joked that he served as \"the substitute Donte,\" referring to Knicks guard Donte DiVincenzo, another former Wildcat.\n\n\"I kind of got roped into that group,\" Haliburton said. \"It was fun, we have a group chat that we talk in all the time, those are good friends of mine. So I'm excited for all the shenanigans of who Josh Hart is as a human being, and just excited to play against those guys.\"\n\nWith Haliburton at the helm, the Pacers fittingly played at the second-fastest pace -- the number of possessions a team gets per 48 minutes -- during the regular season, with the Knicks ranked 30th in the league.\n\n\"It [depends] how you would define pace,\" Tom Thibodeau said. \"I think we were fifth in scoring [in the first round]. I think we're probably second in fast-break points. Then when you look at total shot attempts, we're always at the top.\n\n\"So it's however you get there. I told you, you can make stats say whatever you want, but the most important one is the net rating. And so, that's what we look at. You wanna be strong on offense and defense. I think we were fifth in offensive rating. We'll be challenged again, and our defense has to be great.\"\n\nThe Knicks finished fifth in the NBA during the regular season in net rating, which measures point differential per 100 possessions.\n\nThibodeau said there were no new injuries to report after the first round aside from Julius Randle (shoulder) and Bojan Bogdanovic (foot).", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New York Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Brunson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIBA_Basketball_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FIBA Basketball World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donte_DiVincenzo", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donte DiVincenzo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villanova_Wildcats_men's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Villanova Wildcats men's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIBA", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FIBA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikal_Bridges", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mikal Bridges"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Hart", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Josh Hart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bojan_Bogdanovi\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bojan Bogdanovi\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Thibodeau", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tom Thibodeau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Randle", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Julius Randle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal_difference", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Goal difference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/newspress-collage-irg25aua6-1714893879199.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1714879519&w=1024", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9539735", "eventUri": "eng-9539735", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-12-30", "textStart": 831, "textEnd": 838}], "sentiment": 0.2941176470588236, "wgt": 130, "relevance": 1}

Meanwhile, in the Eastern Conference, fans can anticipate the resurgence of a classic postseason rivalry between the Knicks and Pacers, alongside the heavily favored Celtics taking on the Cavaliers.\n\nIn this upcoming series, the New York Knicks are poised to dominate the boards, particularly on the offensive end, giving them a significant advantage over the Indiana Pacers. The Knicks lead the league in Offensive Rebounding Rate, consistently capitalizing on second-chance opportunities. Conversely, Pacers struggles with defensive rebounding, ranking near the bottom of the league.\n\nThe Knicks' strength lies in their ability to generate more scoring opportunities through their dominant rebounding. Even without key player Mitchell Robinson in previous matchups, they managed to outrebound Indiana significantly. Players like Robinson, Isaiah Hartenstein, Precious Achiuwa, and Josh Hart will be crucial in controlling the glass.\n\nWith Hartenstein and Robinson sharing the center position effectively throughout the game, they pose a formidable challenge to Indiana's defense. This duo could prove as impactful as standout players like Pascal Siakam or the sidelined Tyrese Haliburton. While they may rack up impressive rebounding numbers, they'll also need to contend with defending against Myles Turner's perimeter shooting.\n\nJalen Brunson is expected to thrive as a scorer in this series, taking advantage of Indiana's vulnerable defense. Despite the Pacers' late-season defensive improvements, they remain the weaker unit. Brunson has historically performed well against Indiana, averaging high scoring numbers and should continue to excel.\n\nWhile injured Haliburton was a standout player for Indiana during the regular season, his current health status casts doubt on his impact in this series. The Knicks' ability to capitalize on turnovers for easy baskets adds another dimension to their offensive prowess.\n\nOverall, the Knicks' solid defense and defined identity since the beginning of the year give them the edge over the Pacers. Indiana's recent resurgence notwithstanding, their lackluster performance against Milwaukee raises concerns. The physicality of the Knicks' defense could pose significant problems for Indiana, similar to what they faced against other playoff contenders.\n\nThe upcoming matchup between the Oklahoma City Thunder and Dallas Mavericks promises a star-studded affair with Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Luka Doncic among the MVP finalists. Kyrie Irving's scoring prowess adds another dimension to the mix, while emerging talents like Jalen Williams and Chet Holmgren keep the excitement high.\n\nOklahoma City topped the league in points off turnovers, averaging over 20 points per game from this source. However, Dallas boasts the fourth-lowest turnover rate, potentially limiting the Thunder's ability to capitalize on these opportunities. Similarly, the Mavericks' tendency to avoid fouling may neutralize Oklahoma City's usual advantage from the free-throw line.\n\nWhile the Thunder may still hold an edge in fast-break points, Dallas mitigates some of these advantages typically seen in transition play.\n\nThe reliability of the Thunder's offense is a valid question. While Gilgeous-Alexander shines as an MVP finalist, he hasn't faced the pressure of leading a team in a playoff series of this magnitude before. Additionally, the Thunder's youthful roster raises concerns about their readiness for the postseason spotlight. Towards the end of the regular season, some of the young Thunder players showed signs of fatigue after a demanding year. However, with only four games played in three weeks leading up to the series, the team will either be refreshed or potentially rusty.\n\nIn Dallas, the offensive strategy revolves around Doncic. However, he will face a challenge, needing to involve his teammates and avoid shouldering the entire burden himself. Oklahoma City may opt to focus defensive attention on Irving rather than Doncic, relying on Holmgren's defensive prowess under the rim.", "source": {"uri": "heavy.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Enter Achiuwa.\n\nHighlights Precious Achiuwa's key role defensively could help the New York Knicks in the second round of the playoffs. Tom Thibodeau must trust the bench for playoff success. Achiuwa's defensive abilities are essential against the Pacers in upcoming games.\n\nSince being acquired by the New York Knicks at the trade deadline, Precious Achiuwa has played a crucial role for them as a guy who can change the game defensively and give you solid minutes off the bench.\n\nIn his first half of the season with the Knicks, he had career-highs in minutes (24.2), offensive rebounds (2.9), rebounds (7.2), and blocks (1.1). However, his playoffs have been completely different.\n\nAcross the six playoff games, he has a total of 30 minutes played, as he played 10 minutes in the Game 3 loss and 20 minutes in the Game 4 win.\n\nThibodeau Needs to Be Comfortable With His Bench Thibodeau needs to spread minutes down the stretch and preserve his players\n\nAs the New York Knicks gear up to take on the Indiana Pacers, they will be faced with a challenge: the Pacers have a lot of depth. They have Myles Turner, recently acquired Pascal Siakam, and former Knick Obi Toppin off the bench. Mitchell Robinson, Isaiah Hartenstein, and even OG Anunoby will have their hands full defensively with Turner and Siakam. It is imperative that Thibodeau plays Achiuwa a good amount and lets him guard Toppin and maybe even the other Pacers bigs. Toppin was solid in the Game 6 win, as he logged 21 points, eight rebounds, two assists, and a block.\n\nAchiuwa can control and even take Toppin out of the picture, as Achiuwa proved to be a solid defender in his limited playing time in the playoffs. As mentioned earlier, Achiuwa had career-highs in rebounds and blocks as well as averaging 0.6 steals per game, which he has done for the second year in a row.\n\nIn Game 4 against the 76ers, when Achiuwa was the primary defender, the 76ers shot 1-13 from the field. Even more impressive, the 76ers superstars in Tyrese Maxey and Joel Embiid shot a combined 0-5 against Achiuwa as the main defender.\n\nHe is great on the defensive end, and he must get playing time if the Knicks want to beat the Pacers and get to the Eastern Conference Finals for the first time since the 1999-2000 season.\n\nIn Game 4, Achiuwa also had seven rebounds and four blocks. Achiuwa serves as perfect insurance for Robinson, who is most likely still dealing with that ankle injury that sidelined him for a few months during the regular season.\n\nThe Knicks need to take care of the Pacers in Games 1 and 2 at home because the Pacers are not a very good away team at just 21-20 on the road in the regular season. On the other hand, they are a solid home team with a record of 26-15.\n\nAs long as the Knicks stay healthy, and their bench can contribute, they should be able to beat the Pacers and move into the conference finals.\n\nAchiuwa should play every game in the series, preferably in the 10-15 minute range. However, it should be subject to change based on how the game is going and how he and the other players are playing. Also, Robinson and Hartenstein dealt with foul trouble in the first round and if that continues, look for Achiuwa to earn more minutes in that regard as well.\n\nAchiuwa is definitely not an X-factor in this series.

The rivalry, however, appears to have gotten a lot friendlier if a Friday Instagram post from Lee is any indication.\n\n\"I'm Looking Forward To Seeing My Brother And Friend Mr. REGGIE MILLER [sic],\" Lee wrote in a caption accompanying a post of him hovering behind Miller in a facetiously threatening manner.\n\nThe Knicks and Pacers have met in the postseason on seven prior occasions, with Indiana currently holding the narrow 4-3 edge. All but one of those get-togethers came between 1993 and 2000 and each of the Knicks' most recent visits to the NBA Finals (1994, 1999) required a victory over the Pacers.\n\nMiller partook in every one of those showdowns, including the 2000 conference finals which saw the Pacers return the favor and clinch their own Finals ticket at MSG (in what became Patrick Ewing's final game as a Knick). He now serves as a game analyst for TNT, which will carry coverage of Game 1 on Monday night.\n\nThe most notable matchup came during the 1995 conference semifinals, a thrilling seven-game set that saw Indiana escape from New York with the win. The first game of the series, staged at Madison Square Garden, infamously saw Miller score eight points in 8.9 seconds, which turned a late six-point deficit into a 107-105 victory.\n\nWell-known for his trash talk, Miller frequently engaged in verbal sparring with Lee from the latter's customary courtside seat at MSG.

The only players to do it were LeBron James in 2009, and Michael Jordan in both 1989 and 1990.\n\nNot only that, but after Brunson scoring 41 points in Game 6, he became only the 7th player in NBA history with three consecutive 40+ point playoff games. The only other players to do that were Jerry West, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Bernard King, Michael Jordan, Allen Iverson, and Jamal Murray.\n\nWhile no one is comparing Jalen Brunson to Michael Jordan or LeBron James, what he's doing right now is certainly special. In the 2024 playoffs so far, Brunson has averaged 35.5 points, 9.0 assists, and 4.5 rebounds on 43/30/78 shooting from the field. He's been playing an astonishing 43.8 minutes a game in six games thus far. It's important to note that he's doing all of this without his accomplice and one-two punch Julius Randle.\n\nAfter shockingly defeating Joel Embiid and the Philadelphia 76ers, Brunson now has a much different team in the Indiana Pacers awaiting him.

According to Jackson, this is disrespectful to NBA legend Patrick Ewing, who played 15 seasons in NY.\n\n\"We love Oak... but Oak made Jalen Brunson's greatest New York Knicks basketball player since Clyde Frazier. Time out. Are you kidding me? I love you, Oak, but what are we doing? Let me introduce you to the greatest, not just since Clyde Frazier, the greatest New York Knicks basketball player of all time,\" Mark said as he introduced Ewing as a guest on his podcast entitled 'The Mark Jackson Show.'\n\n\"That includes everybody. You include everybody that ever played in the blue and orange, and you put them on the draft board, the number one pick is Patrick Ewing,\" Jackson added.\n\nTwo different players from two different eras\n\nJackson is correct in saying that Oakley needs to pause for a bit because while Brunson has been spectacular for the Knicks, he has yet to accomplish anything that puts him above legends like Ewing. Remember, Patrick was an 11-time All-Star, Rookie of the Year award recipient, and someone who led the NYK to the 1994 NBA Finals -- where they lost in 7 games to the Houston Rockets.\n\nWhen Ewing was asked about his former teammate's surprising take, the big man said he didn't take offense to it and even praised Brunson for bringing excitement to New York basketball again.\n\n\"I love Oak; we had some great years together. I always called him my Hitman because anything physical or dirty, he was going to take care of it. Jalen is a great player, and I'm happy for his success and for the New York Knicks. I'm happy for the success that Tom is having with that team,\" Pat said. \"I try not to get involved in all that. Who's better, or who's this? Is it Clyde [Dexter] or Willis?\"\n\nCan Jalen eventually get past Patrick?\n\nFor Brunson to eventually become the greatest Knick ever, he must do what Ewing never did: win a championship. Even if that might not be enough to match Pat's achievements, at the very least, a title is the greatest accomplishment a superstar can lead their franchise to. Now more than ever, JB's chances of doing that seem possible.\n\nThis is the best opportunity the Knicks have had to win a championship in the last decade. They're arguably the second-best team in the Eastern Conference behind the Boston Celtics, led by a dynamic combo guard and All-Star in Brunson. Will this finally be the year they make it to the NBA Finals? Only time will tell, but what's certain is that New York basketball hasn't been this exciting since Carmelo Anthony's departure.\n\nRelated: \"A ball-dominant Jalen Brunson ain't gonna get you to the promised land\" - Draymond Green on the Knicks' success in the 2024 playoffs", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nicole_ganglani@postandcourier.com", "name": "Nicole Ganglani", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mark Jackson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walt_Frazier", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Walt Frazier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Ewing", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Ewing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Oakley", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Charles Oakley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Brunson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_Rookie_of_the_Year_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball Rookie of the Year Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Rockets", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Houston Rockets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draymond_Green", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Draymond Green"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmelo_Anthony", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carmelo Anthony"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/5/c1/5c18a31c-91ae-5cc8-9897-a84679517487/6638eeec855be.image.jpg?crop=1200%2C630%2C0%2C22&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9539735", "eventUri": "eng-9539735", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4039215686274509, "wgt": 122, "relevance": 1}

But even more than the mere synchronization of competitive teams, the Knicks are playing their best basketball in more than decade, fueling a series of attendance and revenue gains for MSG Sports, while the Rangers won the Presidents' Trophy as the league's best regular-season team this year.\n\nIf the teams' respective postseason runs continue, it could echo the city's famous period three decades ago, when the Rangers won their first Stanley Cup in 54 years while the Knicks advanced to the NBA Finals, losing a hard-fought, seven-game series to the Rockets that was disrupted in part by coverage of the low-speed police chase of O.J.

As Knicks fever is quickly rising, resale ticket prices are beginning at more than $300 for the first game of the series Monday at MSG, with most lower-bowl inventory costing at least twice that much.\n\nThe opening of the series with Indiana will be a homecoming after the Knicks' fan support on the road helped prompt the 76ers to buy their own tickets and donate them in order to prevent New York fans from accessing them.\n\n\"We feel we have the best fans in the world. They travel. They go with us wherever we go,\" said Knicks coach Tom Thibodeau after the team overcame that Philadelphia maneuver and clinched a six-game series win.\n\nThe Rangers, meanwhile, quickly dispatched the Capitals in a first-round sweep, and are now facing the Hurricanes, currently the betting up favorite to win the Stanley Cup. Get-in pricing for the Rangers' series opener Sunday at the Garden, a 4-3 New York victory, began at $250, with a similar near-doubling in price for lower-bowl seats.\n\nThe New York teams' playoffs runs are also set to become a further boost for Knicks and Rangers owner James Dolan, already riding a high from the initial success of the Sphere in Las Vegas, which debuted last fall as a jaw-dropping spectacle, was quickly embraced by multiple sports properties, and has seen successful concert residencies from U2 and Phish.\n\nOn Thursday, MSG Sports reported fiscal third-quarter financials showing a 12% bump in revenue to $430 million and a 3% increase in adjusted operating income, fueled by the improved results of both teams.\n\n\"Our third-quarter results reflect solid operating performance across our business, driven by ongoing enthusiasm for the Knicks and Rangers,\" Dolan said.", "source": {"uri": "frontofficesports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Front Office Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "eric_fisher@frontofficesports.com", "name": "Eric Fisher", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison_Square_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Madison Square Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rangers_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rangers F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidents'_Trophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Presidents' Trophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ticket_resale", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ticket resale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Hockey League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_1940", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Curse of 1940"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/30_for_30", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "30 for 30"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_76ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia 76ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_L._Dolan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "James L.

This is not hyperbole. Joe has a point. He recently told TMZ \"That was the best pickup we ever had as a Knick,\" Fat Joe said.\n\nICYMI, Brunson averaged 28.7, 3.6 rebounds, and 6.7 assists a game this season. And get this, when the Knicks just eliminated the Sixers in a brutal series, he was all but unstoppable. Thursday night, he put up 41 points (13 for 27 FG), 3 rebounds and 12 assists in only 44 minutes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith the Knicks advancing to the second round of the NBA playoffs, Fat Joe credits much of their success to Brunson's stellar performances. Brunson's recent 41-point game has further fueled Joe's admiration for the player, calling him the best pickup in Knicks history. Well, Carmelo Anthony was a free agent signing but he arguably never had the playoff or regular season team success that Brunson is having in his early Knicks career.\n\nAccording to Fat Joe, Brunson's path to solidifying his legacy involves winning a championship. Even amidst praise for past Knicks greats like Clyde Frazier and Bernard King, Fat Joe sees Brunson's impact as unprecedented.\n\nThe 27-year-old NBA star even made time for a video chat with Joe after a crucial playoff win. As the Knicks gear up for their next series against the Indiana Pacers, Fat Joe eagerly anticipates witnessing Brunson's continued brilliance on the court.\n\nFat Joe ended his support with \"this Jalen Brunson, man, is must-see TV.

Even though Rick Carlisle's boys eventually clinched the win, the grueling six-game stretch resulted in players taking a beating and being exhausted. Tyrese Haliburton is one of the big names from the Pacers to sustain injuries against Doc Rivers' boys.\n\nThe Indiana Pacers would like to have a fully-fit roster if they want to stand a chance of upsetting the #2 New York Knicks. However, fans will not be pleased to learn that two important players have been added to the injury report ahead of Game 1 of the Eastern Conference Semifinal. While Bennedict Mathurin continues to sit out, Tyrese Haliburton is added to the dreadful list as \"questionable\" due to lower back spasms.\n\nDetails of Haliburton's back injury were first revealed just before Game 4 of the opening round series against the Bucks. Playing 46 minutes in Game 3 seemed to have taken a toll on the guard's back.\n\n\"I locked up... My back just locked up,\" Haliburton said on the Bally Sports Indiana broadcast after the game, per Sports Illustrated. \"I couldn't really move. Thank god for our amazing medical staff. There was a hot second there where I didn't think I was going to play.\"\n\nDespite admitting that he \"couldn't really move\", it is impressive that the 24-year-old participated in each of the games. In fact, his performance after the back injury in Game 3 somehow improved - recording 6 more points in the second half of the series, per ESPN.\n\nConsidering that Hali's back injury hasn't been a major setback yet, fans don't need to worry about their star player's health. They will also most certainly see him don the jersey and set foot on the hardwood without being on any kind of minutes restriction.\n\nComing off a 35.5 points per game (per ESPN) series against the 76ers, Jalen Brunson is projected to have a better performance than Haliburton. But, due to injuries suffered by the Knicks' Julius Randle and Bojan Bogdanovic, the Myles Turner-Pascal Siakam-Aaron Nesmith trio is the far superior frontcourt among the two teams. Hence, the Pacers will be confident enough to steal a win or two at the Madison Square Garden.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsrush.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsRush"}, "authors": [{"uri": "advait_jajodia@thesportsrush.com", "name": "Advait Jajodia", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Bucks", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Bucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doc_Rivers", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Doc Rivers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bally_Sports_Indiana", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bally Sports Indiana"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bennedict_Mathurin", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bennedict Mathurin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_Illustrated", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sports Illustrated"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Brunson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bojan_Bogdanovi\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bojan Bogdanovi\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Randle", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Julius Randle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_76ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia 76ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison_Square_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Madison Square Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://cdn-wp.thesportsrush.com/2024/05/a275b10d-untitled-design-36.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9539735", "eventUri": "eng-9539735", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0980392156862745, "wgt": 119, "relevance": 1}

With his total now trading at 17.5, it opens the door to a better price on a prop of 20+ points for Haliburton, and against the New York Knicks, I think this bet is worth a shot.\n\nThe Knicks' best defensive players are Josh Hart and O.G. Anunoby, but they're better at guarding wing players vs. a speedy, shifty point guard. You saw that in Round 1 when Tyrese Maxey had some monster games. N.Y. lacks a point-of-attack defender for an agile PG, and I think Haliburton can capitalize on that.\n\nI'm adding Anthony Edwards Under 26.5 points to this parlay, which is an alternate total as his normal total is trading at 28.5. If you want a much larger breakdown as to why I like this bet, there's a full breakdown in my daily NBA player props article,\n\nI'm pairing the alternate Under for Jokic and Edwards together because in order to hit two alternate Unders, we will most likely need something to break our way where they both see decreased minutes. For example, a blowout could send both players toward an alternate Under as it would impact their expected minutes.\n\nThe status of Rudy Gobert doesn't really concern me for this alternate Under on Jokic. While I prefer the Jokic Under more if Gobert is playing because his shot-blocking as a help defender takes away easy buckets near the rim, there's also a chance that Gobert's absence opens up more passing lanes and lobs to Aaron Gordon, which also hurts Jokic's overall points production.\n\nNot intended for use in MA.\n\nAffiliate Disclosure: Covers may receive advertising commissions for visits to a sportsbook or betting site.\n\nOur betting experts have searched through today's NBA odds to find your best SGP bets for both games on Monday's playoff slate:\n\nSiakam will be the focal point on the Knicks defense, which will try to take the ball out of his hands. Player forecasts call for 4-plus+ assists tonight.\n\nBruson's points projections range, with some flirting with 40 points. I'm not buying into that but I do see him knocking down 3+ shots from downtown.\n\nIndiana was able to get pasta busted Bucks team and while they could give the Knicks a scare at home, I like New York to guard the Garden in Game 1.\n\nRead Jason Logan's full Pacers vs. Knicks predictions.\n\nThe Nuggets appeared willing to let Edwards beat them in Game 1, his second straight game with 40+ points in these playoffs and fourth out of five with 30+.

Odds are via BetMGM.\n\nAfter narrowly getting the better of Philadelphia's Tyrese Maxey, the NBA's Most Improved Player, Jalen Brunson now matches up against another All-Star, Tyrese Haliburton. The league's assists leader (10.9) also averaged 20.1 points in 2023-24 and played well in the three games against New York, dishing out 13.3 helpers while averaging 19.7 points. He didn't shoot the 3-ball as well as he did against most teams and is struggling this postseason, shooting 29.6 from beyond the arc in his six games against Milwaukee.\n\nHaliburton is listed as questionable for Game 1 due to back spasms but should play barring an unforeseen flare up. However, seeing his assists total of should terrify Indiana backers. That's tantalizingly low given what he's accomplished this season, and even though he registered double-digit dimes in three of the six contests played against the Bucks, it's clear we should be fading him in Game 1 of this series.\n\nNew York should succeed in keeping the Pacers from pushing tempo, especially since Indiana has to hit the road for this series opener. Haliburton has played just 32.7 minutes over the last three games and has taken a step back from his duties running the show with fellow point guards Andrew Nembhard and TJ McConnell taking on larger roles as facilitators.\n\nHe's looking to find a flow shooting it and still has the capacity to deliver a flurry, but he shot just 12-for-44 (27%) from 3-point range over the last four games of Round 1. His number of made 3-pointers has been set at just . It simply looks too trap-ish not to recommend swallowing hard and fading. Back the UNDER on Haliburton's 3-point makes, too.\n\nRelated: 2024 NBA Championship odds | NBA prop betting\n\nMyles Turner will almost certainly be asked to pull Isaiah Hartenstein and Mitchell Robinson away from the basket, so even though his number of is juiced way up at , that's the case for a reason. Joel Embiid made multiple 3-pointers in four of the six first-round games against New York, finishing 13-for-39. Turner will look to be more accurate than Embiid and shot just 1-for-7 in the last two games of the first round, but he shot 17-for-34 over his first four playoff games. Count on him firing away early here and consider over 1.5 3-pointers made a virtual lock.\n\nBrunson's points total has been set at a ridiculous , which just happens to be his average this postseason. He averaged 35.7 points in the three regular-season games against Indiana, too, but I'd stay away from riding him in Game 1. I also wouldn't dare fade him. My expectation is that Donte DiVincenzo, who was held in single-digits scoring the ball in four of the six games against Philly after averaging 15.5 during the regular season, will build off his effort in Game 6 against the 76ers.\n\nDiVincenzo shot 5-for-9 from 3-point range in the clincher and scored 23 points, so his confidence should be back intact for this matchup with a Pacers squad he averaged 24 points per game against.

Few small guards have led teams deep in the playoffs like Iverson; Brunson seeks to be the second. Brunson uses superior skill to dominate like Iverson, trying to win games despite defensive focus.\n\nAfter hitting a clutch bucket with less than a minute left in the New York Knicks' decisive Game 6 victory, Jalen Brunson stared past the crowd and up into the rafters, where two Villanova championship banners hang. Brunson, Josh Hart, and Donte DiVincenzo helped win those banners and are now three main pieces of the first Knicks team to win playoff series in back-to-back years since 2000.\n\nFunnily enough, it was the same arena where an undersized guard with supreme skill led an undermanned team all the way to the NBA Finals. Allen Iverson even gave us one of the most legendary games in NBA history, which culminated in the \"step-over\" of Tyronn Lue as he dropped 48 points during an improbable win. Iverson's Philadelphia 76ers lost the next four to the dynastic Kobe Bryant/Shaquille O'Neal-led Los Angeles Lakers, but his run remains one of the most iconic moments in basketball history.\n\n23 years later, Jalen Brunson is attempting to pull off a similar feat with his Knicks.\n\nBoth Iverson and Brunson are Severely Undersized PGs Their display of scoring dominance is almost unprecedented\n\nThroughout NBA history, there have been very few dominant \"small\" players. Only Isiah Thomas and Stephen Curry have been the leaders of a championship team despite being around six feet tall, and only a handful of guards have ever led their teams on deep playoff runs through dominant scoring.\n\nThere have been several diminutive point guards who have contributed to winning at the highest level, but almost all of them have been floor generals who are paired with a dominant forward or center. Examples that come to mind include Chris Paul, John Stockton, and Steve Nash. Furthermore, none of these players were ever able to get over the hump and win an NBA title, despite playing next to talented teammates.\n\nThe Ceiling On Small Guys\n\nPlayer\n\nHeight\n\nFurthest Playoff Round Reached\n\nChris Paul\n\n6'0\"\n\nLost NBA Finals\n\nJohn Stockton\n\n6'1\"\n\nLost NBA Finals\n\nSteve Nash\n\n6'3\"\n\nLost WCF\n\nKemba Walker\n\n5'11\"\n\nLost ECF\n\nDamian Lillard\n\n6'2\"\n\nLost WCF\n\nGuys like Kemba Walker, Isaiah Thomas (Boston Celtics), and Damian Lillard are perfect examples of what typically happens to undersized scoring guards. They usually struggle to win at a championship level, their bodies break down under stress, or suffer a combination of both. Finding a smaller player with a score-first mindset who can be a team's leader is extremely rare, but it appears the Knicks have done so.\n\nBrunson's Game is Very Similar to Iverson's Each player uses supreme skill in their own way to dominate\n\nFor players that are small in stature compared to their peers, their margin of error is so much tinier because they can't weaponize any athletic gifts or play styles in order to get the job done. Bigger, more athletic forwards or centers have many replicable methods of scoring available to them, whether it is bully-ball drives, post-ups, cutting, shooting over the top, or even offensive rebounding.\n\nIn the case of Jalen Brunson and Allen Iverson, they have perfected their own style of skill-based scoring that takes advantage of angles, leverage, body position, and IQ. Iverson's craftiness was much more aesthetically pleasing than Brunson's, as he utilized a lightning-quick handle and fast-twitch moves vs. Brunson's more methodical, strength-based scoring bag.\n\nAlthough Brunson isn't the quickest, fastest, or most athletic guy on the floor, he may be the best in the NBA at getting his defender off-balance with purposeful dribble moves that each set up the next combo. Once he has his man beat, Brunson is elite at using his stocky frame to move defenders down to the paint for easy floaters, layups, and mid-range jumpers.\n\nIverson 2001 vs. Brunson 2024\n\nPlayer\n\n30-point games\n\n40-point games\n\nIverson\n\n34\n\n18\n\nBrunson\n\n36\n\n11\n\nOnly Iverson Has Found Success Similar to Brunson Brunson is trying to become the second small guard to shoulder this responsibility\n\nIn 2001, the Philadelphia 76ers won the Eastern Conference with one ball-dominant, isolation-scoring guard in Allen Iverson and a bunch of defensive-minded glue guys. Iverson averaged 32.9 points and 6.1 assists per game as the only star-level offensive threat, and the 76ers' stellar defense was enough to propel the undermanned roster past more talented teams like the Indiana Pacers, Toronto Raptors, and Milwaukee Bucks.\n\nCompromised by horrible spacing due to the lack of shooting, Iverson faced double and triple teams as well as big bodies in the paint providing help with tenacious physicality. Nevertheless, he was able to score the ball at an incredible level through ridiculous shotmaking, swift handles, and superior body control.\n\nCarrying Their Teams\n\nPlayer\n\nPlayoff PPG\n\n% of Team's Points\n\nPlayoff APG\n\n% of Team's Assists\n\nIverson 2001\n\n32.9\n\n34.1%\n\n6.1\n\n29.1%\n\nBrunson 2024\n\n35.5\n\n32.7%\n\n9.0\n\n40.0%\n\nFast-forward to 2024, and Jalen Brunson is attempting to accomplish the same feat for his Knicks team. New York is a tremendous defensive squad, is the league's best rebounding team, and has a coach in Tom Thibodeau who has established a terrific culture of toughness and playing for one another. All of this has allowed the Knicks to overcome injuries and a general lack of talent, as they move on to the second round.\n\nHowever, with Julius Randle and Bojan Bogdonavic out for the season, the offensive options for New York are very limited. DiVincenzo has been excellent, Hart has had his moments, and other players have stepped up in big moments throughout the season, but teams are happy to concede better opportunities for role players instead of dealing with Brunson.\n\nDespite the intense defensive attention on Brunson on every single possession, he put up a historic four-game stretch to close out the 76ers. The Knicks' star averaged 41.8 points and 10.3 assists on great efficiency over the last four contests, putting his name up with the greatest offensive stretches in playoff history. It has been much more than just his scoring, as he's done a great job trusting his teammates when he is double-teamed.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether Brunson can finish the job, but he has already far exceeded expectations in New York.\n\nRelated Knicks' Jalen Brunson Matches Michael Jordan With Incredible Series vs 76ers It's always special when someone gets mentioned in the same air as His

The athletic, high-flying 6-foot-9 Toppin averaged career highs in points (10.3), rebounds (3.9), assists (1.6) and minutes (21.1). He also shot a personal best 40.3 percent from 3-point range and is coming off of a stellar 21-point, eight-rebound performance in the closeout victory over the Bucks. Toppin started 28 games for the Pacers, but has become a key part of their second unit, which was his role with the Knicks for three years.\n\n\"We always thought he was a good player,\" Knicks coach Tom Thibodeau said. \"I don't think anything has changed. Very athletic, runs the floor great, shoots the ball, can score the ball. He's always been able to score. Like I said, we loved having him. He was in a situation here where he's playing behind Julius [Randle].

His younger brother, Jacob, is on the Knicks, although he doesn't get on the court much, if at all. Jacob appeared in nine games with the Knicks this year. So that should make it an easy decision for his parents, Roni and Obadiah, when it comes to who to root for.\n\n\"Jacob's not playing, so probably me,\" Obi said with a smile.", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New York Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obi_Toppin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Obi Toppin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ossining_High_School", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ossining High School"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Bucks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Bucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dayton,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dayton, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dayton, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Thibodeau", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tom Thibodeau"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Training", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Recruiting", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Recruiting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/newspress-collage-5i1pe4gqc-1714906846420.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1714892486&w=1024", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9539735", "eventUri": "eng-9539735", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 114, "relevance": 1}

It's a matchup that rekindles a late 1990s rivalry and carries strategic questions aplenty, which Van Gundy helped answer in an interview with The Post.\n\nHere's Van Gundy breaking down some of the most pressing:\n\n\"First of all, you've got a matchup of two of the really elite point guards. Different types of players, for sure. But two of the absolute best. ... I don't put a lot into the regular season in terms of, well Indiana 2 out of 3. I don't think any of that matters. But Jalen had a 40-point game against Indiana. Haliburton had a 23-assist game against New York. I think we're in for some great guard play.\"\n\n\"I think [Donte] DiVincenzo. He guarded him during the season. And did a pretty good job. I think you're going to see pretty much what you saw at the end of the Philly series [against Tyrese Maxey] -- DiVincenzo and McBride. I think Anunoby will start on [Pascal] Siakam, and then Hart will guard him, too. I wouldn't even be surprised at some point of the series -- because of the pick-and-pop of [Myles] Turner -- if Tom [Thibodeau] put Anunoby on Turner and put their center on Siakam to take away Siakam's post-up game. And switch the pick-and-roll with Turner, and then as Turner rolls down DiVincenzo, they just run him out of there and then move their center onto him on the roll.\"\n\n\"Obviously Brunson is a major challenge in everything. How do you play his pick-and-rolls? How do you play his isolations? They doubled him a lot. And then, can they keep New York off the glass? And the problem is, if you're going to double Brunson a lot, you're in rotation when New York's shot goes up so it gets even harder to block out and you're not a good rebounding team anyway. And now there's not bodies on anybody. I think there's a lot of really interesting things to watch and a lot of challenges for both coaches.\"\n\n\"New York will run more than people give them credit for. But Indiana really wants the pace up. And I think New York will want it a little slower in large part because of depth. I think that's a big Indiana advantage. Even with [Bennedict] Mathurin out [for the Pacers], I think there's a real depth advantage for Indiana with [Julius] Randle and [Bojan Bogdanovic] out [for the Knicks]. So I think in general Indiana would like to play faster than New York, anyway. But certainly the depth gives them an added advantage with that. To me, it's a fine line because New York is good in transition and they want to run. But they've got to pick their spots. They want to run on rebounds and certainly on turnovers. But they don't want to be in an up and down, run-and-shoot type of game with Indiana. So they've got to pick their spots.\"\n\n\"Shooting centers who can stretch the floor give the Knicks a problem in the pick-and-pop game. And I think Haliburton and Turner are a very, very good pick-and-roll combination. Turner hurt New York during the season both on the roll and on the pop. New York generally wants to be in drop coverage. They'll get up some. But either way, Turner's ability to pop to the 3-point line becomes a problem. ... Tom's never really wanted to switch his [center] much. He'll do it when he puts [Precious] Achiuwa there but not so much with [Isaiah] Hartenstein or Mitchell Robinson. So that's been a tough one for them.\"\n\n\"New York does it to everybody, but they've absolutely worn Indiana out on the glass during the season. And Indiana is not a good defensive rebounding team anyway. And New York is a great offensive rebounding team. I think that's probably New York's biggest advantage going into the series.\"\n\n\"They've got one of those teams that finds a way to win. They won the first two games against the Sixers with Brunson quite honestly playing poorly. And then he becomes the best player in the world to close out the series. Other than maybe their rebounding, they're just not reliant on any one area of the game to be able to win. They'll find different ways. They just compete, they'll never go away. They'll get down 10 or 12 and you know they're coming back. They're comfortable in those kind of games.\"", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New York Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stan_Van_Gundy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stan Van Gundy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turner_Broadcasting_System", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Turner Broadcasting System"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_Siakam", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pascal Siakam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball_positions", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Basketball positions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Maxey", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Maxey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TNT_(American_TV_network)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TNT (American TV network)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Riley", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pat Riley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pick_and_roll", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pick and roll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precious_Achiuwa", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Precious Achiuwa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaiah_Hartenstein", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Isaiah Hartenstein"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitchell_Robinson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mitchell Robinson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turnover_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Turnover (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bojan_Bogdanovi\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bojan Bogdanovi\u0107"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Adventure", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Adventure", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Streetball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Streetball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/newspress-collage-h7anno9zq-1714969332357.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1714955022&w=1024", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9539735", "eventUri": "eng-9539735", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 111, "relevance": 1}

Knicks legend Charles Oakley, for example, called Brunson \"the best thing since Walt Frazier,\" while ESPN analyst Jay Williams claimed he would \"go down as one of the greatest Knicks, if not the greatest, Knick ever.\"\n\nBut one former Knick isn't blinded by apparent recency bias: longtime NBA veteran/analyst Mark Jackson took advantage of Knicks legend Patrick Ewing's visit to his web series to make his case for Ewing's inclusion among the greatest New Yorkers, claiming Brunson still has a bit to learn if he's going to be included in the same category as No. 33.\n\n\"We love Oak. Oak's a warrior and a tremendous teammate, tremendous guy. But Oak made the statement that Jalen Brunson is the greatest New York Knick basketball player since Clyde Frazier. Timeout,\" Jackson declared on his eponymous show. \"Are you kidding me? Again, I love you Oak, but what are you doing? Let me introduce you again to the greatest Knick, not just since Clyde Frazier, the greatest New York Knick basketball player of all time, that includes everybody.\"\n\n\"You put everybody that ever played in the blue and orange and you put them on the draft board, the No. 1 pick is Patrick Ewing.\"\n\nEwing still stands as the Knicks' all-time leader in several major departments, including points, games played, total rebounds, steals, and blocks. While Jackson no doubt appreciates Brunson's ongoing efforts, he hoped fans wouldn't let modern euphoria blind them to Ewing's endless list of metropolitan accomplishments accumulated over 15 seasons in Manhattan.\n\n\"It is beyond question, no question, that (Ewing) is the best to ever do it in blue and orange.\"\n\nFor his part, Ewing tried not to get involved in the metropolitan GOAT discussion, remarking that he was only happy for the success that Brunson and head coach Tom Thibodeau have developed. Ewing tried to say that both Frazier and the late Willis Reed could lay claim to the title, but Jackson politely shut down Ewing's humbleness.\n\n\"I watched those guys, and they're great, and I loved them growing up, and they were heroes of mine,\" Jackson told Ewing. \"But it's you.\"\n\nBrunson can certainly make his case for the greatest Knick of all time by doing the one thing Ewing could not: win an NBA title. The journey continues on Monday night when the Knicks open an Eastern Conference Semifinal series against the Indiana Pacers (7:30 p.m. ET, TNT).", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [{"uri": "geoff_magliocchetti@si.com", "name": "Geoff Magliocchetti", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Ewing", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Ewing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mark Jackson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walt_Frazier", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Walt Frazier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Brunson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Williams_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jay Williams (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Oakley", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charles Oakley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_76ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia 76ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TNT_(American_TV_network)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TNT (American TV network)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willis_Reed", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Willis Reed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Thibodeau", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tom Thibodeau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_5316,h_2990,x_0,y_18/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/si-temp/01hx75pfvt9790awz2a4", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9539735", "eventUri": "eng-9539735", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3490196078431373, "wgt": 108, "relevance": 1}

after exhausting...", "body": "Tom Thibodeau often has noted that most teams reduce their playing rotations in the playoffs, but the Knicks only used seven players in the final two games against the 76ers after veteran reserve Bojan Bogdanovic went down with a foot injury in Game 4.\n\nThibodeau has used his standard \"we could\" response when asked in the past few days if he expects to expand his rotation -- most likely the addition of Precious Achiuwa -- beginning in Monday's series opener against the Pacers at the Garden.\n\n\"You gotta look at who they're playing, as well,\" Thibodeau said about the Pacers before the series started. \"They've cut back, too, so it's all about matchups.\"\n\nThe Knicks played their top-seven players -- their five starters, plus Mitchell Robinson and Miles McBride -- for 94.5 percent of their total minutes in the first round, according to the Ringer.\n\nThat's the 13th-highest figure out of 400 playoff teams since 2000, the study stated, and above the league average of 88 percent so far during this year's playoffs.\n\nThe Knicks' number also represents the highest by any NBA team in one playoff year since the 2014 Bulls, who also were coached by Thibodeau.\n\nThey allotted 95.8 percent of their minutes to their top-seven players in a first-round loss to the Wizards.\n\nIt should be noted, however, that the Nuggets relied on their top-seven rotation players nearly as much last year -- 93 percent -- on their way to their first NBA championship in team history.\n\nVeteran guard Alec Burks did not play at all against the Sixers after shooting just 30.7 percent from the field in 23 games for the Knicks following a February trade from the Pistons.\n\nStill, it would make sense for Achiuwa to see some time against the Pacers, with center Miles Turner often playing on the perimeter as a stretch-5.\n\nWith Robinson sidelined and Isaiah Hartenstein in foul trouble in Game 4 in Philadelphia, Achiuwa contributed four blocked shots in 20 minutes but then didn't get off the bench in the final two games of the series.\n\nJosh Hart played all 53 minutes in Game 5, and Donte DiVincenzo was on the court for the entire 48 minutes in the Game 6 clincher -- with Hart (46), OG Anunoby (45) and Jalen Brunson also remaining in for the majority of the closeout win.\n\nRobinson (18) and McBride (nine) accounted for the lone minutes off the bench in Game 6.\n\n\"It sounds like a line, but it really doesn't [matter],\" DiVincenzo said. \"I think Thibs does a good job of staggering timeouts and doing certain things where you kind of forget the minutes sometimes.\"\n\nAdded Hart: \"I think the conditioning -- we played a full season-plus, so the conditioning is there -- but we've gotta make sure we give our bodies every chance to operate at a high level as much as we can.\"", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New York Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

His outcome-defining displays in the 2024 playoff run have ensured the second consecutive semi-final qualification for the franchise for the first time since 2000. This meteoric surge excited the fanbase with a Knicks legend, Charles Oakley, openly applauding his endeavors through a seemingly controversial yet brave move.\n\nDuring his latest appearance on SiriusXM Radio, he re-arranged the pecking order of the franchise greats. The Ohio-born believed that Brunson had become the second greatest Knick of all time, only trailing behind the 2x champion, Walt Frazier. In the process, the 60-year-old publicly snubbed iconic figures such as Patrick Ewing and Carmelo Anthony, stating the following:\n\n\"[Jalen] Brunson, I'm telling you, Brunson's the best thing since Walt Frazier. I know somebody gonna say, 'What about Patrick [Ewing] and Carmelo [Anthony]?'. Okay, they didn't do this...Brunson's playing without Julius (Randle), and what he's doing man, hey, it's incredible. Keep doing it\".\n\nThe recency bias certainly played its part in this bold declaration. After all, Brunson has remarkably carried forward his regular season form of 28.7 points per game, as per StatMuse, into the playoffs. In each of the first-round series games against the Philadelphia 76ers, the Knicks guard scored 20+ points. On top of this, he crossed the 40-point mark in each of the last three clashes to help secure the semi-final spot.\n\nThis outstanding consistency caught the eyes of Oakley, serving as the major reason behind his remarks. However, not many agreed with this claim, paving the way for arguments on the matter.\n\nOakley's evident overemphasizing of recent events while expressing the order raised several eyebrows. Interestingly, his former teammate, Mark Jackson, was one of the most prominent names on the list. As a result, he called out the 1994 All-Star on his show Come And Talk 2 Me, in the presence of Ewing, stating the following:\n\n\"Time out. Are you kidding me? I love you Oak, but what are we doing? Let me introduce you to the greatest, not just since [Walt] Clyde Frazier, the greatest New York Knicks basketball player of all time. That includes everybody. You include everybody that ever played in the blue and orange and you put them on the draft board, the number one pick is Patrick Ewing\".\n\nThis vociferous rejection of Oakley's claim could give rise to exciting debates going forward. Yet, all these points toward the rise of Brunson in recent years, boosting his status rapidly as a Knick. The 27-year-old has time on his side to rise the ranks in everyone's list, with the opportunity of becoming the greatest franchise player of all time staying within his reach.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsrush.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsRush"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sourav_bose@thesportsrush.com", "name": "Sourav Bose", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Ewing", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Ewing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmelo_Anthony", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carmelo Anthony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Oakley", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Charles Oakley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walt_Frazier", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Walt Frazier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball_positions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball positions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Brunson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Points_per_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Points per game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_76ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia 76ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mark Jackson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franchise_player", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Franchise player"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://cdn-wp.thesportsrush.com/2024/05/6072128a-untitled-design-34.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9539735", "eventUri": "eng-9539735", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 104, "relevance": 1}

The finalists for the race have been announced and Nikola Jokic, Luka Doncic, and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander have made the final cut. While most people consider the Joker as the strongest MVP contender this season, Shaquille O'Neal has backed Shai for months. Now that his pick has made it to the final three, it seems Shaq also wanted Jalen Brunson to be considered for the honor.\n\nThe big fella shared a clip from 'Broadcast Boys' on his Instagram story to show his support for Brunson. Interestingly, the Knicks star didn't even make it to the top five list on the MVP ladder. Regardless, his performance in this season has been incredible and in the last three games in the postseason, he has registered 40+ points each game. Naturally, Shaq backed his claim this year.\n\nIn the clip, the fan explained why Brunson is better than everyone on the MVP ladder. He said, \"Jalen Brunson finished the season with more points than Nikola Jokic and Jayson Tatum. More assists than SGA and Damian Lillard.\" He also listed that Brunson had more three-pointers, free throws, 40-point games, etc. than some players.\n\nIn theory, this sounds like a valid argument because according to Stat Muse, Brunson had 2,212 points compared to Tatum's 1,987 and Jokic's 2,085. The same applies to the other brackets he provided as well.\n\nHowever, these stats don't represent anything, especially in comparison to some of the players who were name-dropped in the clip. If he really wanted to make a strong case for Brunson as the MVP, the ideal way to approach it should have been by comparing his stats to the top three players. Instead, the fan took the cherry-picking approach and only mentioned certain stats against certain players to aid to his narrative. On the other hand, Kendrick Perkins honored him with another title of his own.\n\nThere's no question that Brunson deserves every bit of praise that is coming his way. Despite a great season performance so far, his numbers and impact have failed to match up to the level of the likes of Jokic, Luka, and Shai. But it'd be unfair if his efforts go unappreciated and to tackle that, Perkins came up with a new plan.\n\nEven with their star forward Julius Randle out due to injuries, Brunson and Hart have uplifted the Knicks and how.

A High Court ruling in 2019 found that broadcasters would not be breaching their impartiality rules by doing so.\n\nThe civil society groups signing the letter, which was sent to broadcasters on Friday, were Possible, Green Alliance, WWF, Greenpeace UK, the RSPB, the National Trust, the Wildlife Trusts, Hope for the Future, the Climate Coalition and Wildlife and Countryside Link.\n\nA BBC spokesperson said: \"More than ever, the BBC is putting the public at the center of its election coverage. We'll ask the questions they want us to ask and report back on the issues that matter most to them.\n\nWe are committed to covering a range of topics across our business, including environment and climate, and will provide analysis of each party's plans if elected. Additionally, it is not uncommon for activists to seek greater media coverage for the causes they support.\n\nThe letter was sent to the BBC, ITV, Channel 4, Sky and Global.", "source": {"uri":

Further debates featuring all the main parties are scheduled for the coming weeks, ahead of a final head-to-head between Sunak and Starmer to be hosted by the BBC on June 26th.\n\nThe broadcasters have considerable control over the format and the questions posed, prompting leading green groups to write late last week to the producers of the debates to call on them to ensure the Parties are quizzed on how they intend to respond to the \"nature and climate crisis\".\n\n\"This is an issue of real concern to voters, consistently polling within the top five issues the electorate cares about,\" the letter states. \"Yet thus far, climate and nature have hardly featured in this election campaign. We believe this issue should be central to coverage of this general election, as an issue your audiences care deeply about.\"\n\nThe letter was co-ordinated by climate charity Possible and backed by Green Alliance, WWF, Greenpeace UK, RSPB, and National Trust, among others.\n\nThe group urged broadcasters to recognise how \"climate and nature are deeply intertwined with other key issues\".\n\n\"Energy costs have been spiking owing to volatility in the prices of fossil fuels,\" it said. \"Farmers are struggling to retain viable businesses because of extreme weather and a policy framework which doesn't support them. Clean air, clean water and access to nature are all vital for our health. The cost of living crisis is tied to the climate crisis, and the solutions are also linked.\"\n\nIt also highlighted how polling has consistently shown how support for climate action is high across all demographics. \"As broadcasters we believe you have a duty to ensure that general election coverage reflects the public's desire to see strong and serious leadership on climate and nature recovery - and a genuine debate about the solutions,\" it said.\n\nThe letter came as the election campaign entered its second full week with climate and environmental issues having featured only briefly to date.\n\n\"Where is the climate in this election?\" asked Hirra Khan Adeogun, co-director at Possible. \"It's a top five issue for the public, but you wouldn't think it when you listen to our party leaders. We need our leading broadcasters to get the campaigns away from gaffes and infighting and onto the real issues. Climate solutions can bring down bills, bring up quality of life and bring the country together - so let's have a conversation about it.\"\n\nLabour did unveil further details on Friday on its plans to set up a new investment vehicle called GB Energy to catalyse investment in clean energy infrastructure, while the government hit back by accusing the Opposition of pursuing excessively ambitious clean power goals that it claims could push up energy bills.\n\nThe two main Parties have also clashed over Labour's plans to end the issuance of new oil and gas drilling licenses for the North Sea. Labour has argued the move would help the UK meet its climate targets and create thousands of new jobs for oil and has industry workers in the booming clean energy sector. The government has countered by arguing the move could undermine investment, trigger job losses, and diminish the UK's long term energy security.\n\nHowever, wider environmental and climate issues have hardly featured in the campaign with few if any announcements from the main parties on nature protection, transport and building decarbonisation, or the UK's international climate obligations.\n\nIn a blog post late last week, Green Alliance executive director Shaun Spiers lamented a campaign that has been largely \"depressing, with both of the main parties indulging in 'fantasy economics'\".\n\nSpiers praised Labour's proposals for Great British Energy, but accused both main parties of failing to provide sufficient detail on either their economic or environmental policies.\n\n\"So far neither party has set out a compelling answer to the country's deep economic problems and neither seems likely to capitalise on the 'growth opportunity of the 21st century', net zero,\" he said, adding that there was also scant detail on how legally binding climate goals are to be met.\n\n\"How do the parties propose to meet legally binding climate targets and the UK's 2030 NDC (the nationally determined contribution under the Paris climate agreement to avert climate breakdown)?\" he asked. \"Labour's plans on energy are clear and ambitious, but on the biggest carbon gaps - transport, heat and buildings, and land - there is little detail, so far, from any of the parties.\"\n\nIn related news, the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU) today published new polling of MPs from YouGov showing how Parliamentarians views on climate and energy issues are often out of step with the public.\n\nThe survey found that 62 per cent of the public believe the best way to achieve energy security is to reduce the use of fossil fuels and expand the use of renewable energy, while less than a fifth believe the solution should be new oil and gas exploration licences.\n\nBut just 48 per cent of MPs surveyed thought renewables would provide more energy security than fossil fuels and 43 per cent of Conservative MPs thought the UK would be better to increase its supply of oil and gas compared to 28 per cent who preferred to prioritise renewables development.\n\nThe poll also found MPs were out of touch with the public on levels of support for solar and wind farms, as well as which sectors will generate economic growth.\n\nMeanwhile, a separate poll this morning from More in Common confirmed climate change and the environment remains in the top five issues likely to impact people's vote.\n\nNineteen per cent of voters identified it as a top issue, just behind small boat crossings on 20 per cent and levels of immigration on 24 per cent. The top two issues by some distance remain the cost of living and the NHS.\n\nSignificantly, the environment and climate climbs to a top three issue among those intending to vote Labour or Lib Dem.\n\nYou can now sign up to attend the fifth annual Net Zero Festival, which will be hosted by BusinessGreen on October 22-23 at the Business Design Centre in London.", "source": {"uri":

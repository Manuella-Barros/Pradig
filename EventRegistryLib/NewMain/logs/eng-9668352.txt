But many more have come home dead in recent months, deepening concerns that time is running out and that the safe return of the hostages may be at odds with Israel's war goal of destroying Hamas.\n\n\"What is happening now is that the families have the opposite feeling,\" says Roman, who has another relative, Carmel Gat, among the remaining hostages. \"It's about who will get a phone call saying the body of your family member has been found or he has been declared dead.\"\n\nOf the approximately 250 hostages taken in the Hamas-led Oct. 7 attack, 116 continue to be held captive, including many believed to be dead. Mediators in the hostage talks and a U.S. official familiar with the latest U.S. intelligence said the number of those hostages still alive could be as low as 50.\n\nThat assessment, based in part on Israeli intelligence, would mean 66 of those still held hostage could be dead, 25 more than Israel has publicly acknowledged.\n\nThe U.S. Office of the Director of National Intelligence declined to comment. The Israeli Prime Minister's Office and military declined to comment. Hamas didn't respond to a request for comment but has told mediators in the cease-fire talks that it doesn't know how many hostages are alive.\n\nThe bodies of 19 hostages have been returned to Israel, including eight in the past three months. Israel has determined that another 41 hostages are dead.\n\nEight Americans remain hostage in Gaza, including three who have been declared dead by Israel. The American families of the hostages meet regularly with White House officials.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported in February that as many as 50 of the remaining hostages could be dead based on an Israeli assessment shared with U.S. and Egyptian officials.\n\nThe number of hostages alive or dead has been an issue in cease-fire talks brokered by the U.S., Egypt and Qatar. As part of a deal, hostages would likely be exchanged for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. Israel was initially unwilling to accept dead bodies to meet the number of hostages required to be released in the first phase of any deal, but its latest proposal presented to Hamas says it would accept dead bodies.\n\nThe talks have been hung up on the need to square Hamas's demand for a path to end the war with Israel's insistence on continuing the fight until the group is destroyed. Hamas hardened its stance by adding new demands after a June 8 hostage rescue operation, in which four hostages were freed but scores of Palestinians died.\n\nEstimates of the number of dead hostages continue to rise due to the conditions of their detention, wounds they suffered during the Oct. 7 attack, and other causes. Israeli officials say that most of the hostages pronounced dead were killed on Oct. 7, but they have also confirmed that some hostages have been killed by Israel's own military action.\n\nThe June commando rescue of the four hostages held in Gaza apartments was a rare moment of joy in Israel, where families of those taken have grown frustrated with months of fruitless talks for a hostage deal amid a war that appears to be grinding on without end.\n\nBut the military and the rescued hostages say Israeli missions can't bring back everyone. A deal with Hamas would return at least some of the remaining hostages, but concern is deepening within Israel that an increasing number of the captives are dead.\n\n\"Along with the significant achievement, we must honestly say we will not be able to return everyone home in this way,\" Israeli military spokesman Daniel Hagari said Saturday. One of the rescued hostages, Andrey Kozlov, publicly called for a deal with Hamas to secure the release of those who remain in Gaza.\n\nAs the weeks without a hostage deal drag on, families and health professionals are growing more worried about some hostages' chances of survival due to their old age, conditions of captivity and pre-existing conditions.\n\n\"I think we should be extremely worried,\" said Hagai Levine, the head of the medical team for the Hostages and Missing Families Forum, an advocacy group. \"It seems like every week more hostages are dying or getting in danger or very sick.\"\n\nThe condition of hostages held in Gaza varies depending on the behavior of their captors as well as whether they are held above ground or in tunnels. Former hostages interviewed by the Journal described limited food and hygiene, lack of medical care, and fear of Israeli airstrikes. Hostages held alone rather than in groups are more at risk of deterioration, according to Israeli health professionals who have treated returned hostages.\n\nIzhar Lifshitz's 84-year-old father, Oded Lifshitz, is a hostage in Gaza. Hostages who were released in November said they saw him wounded but alive early in the war, but Izhar Lifshitz hasn't heard anything new from the military since then.\n\n\"We hang on to the hope that he might be alive,\" Lifshitz said. \"But in our stomach we know that older people, wounded people, people taken more than eight months ago, people like that even in Israel would need to change their medication several times, a doctor's treatment. And they are not getting that there.\"\n\nIsrael's successful raid could paradoxically make the remaining hostages' conditions worse as Hamas moves them to more secure locations.\n\n\"They probably tightened up security. They're looking for collaborators and any leakage of information. They may have moved hostages from above ground to underground,\" said Gershon Baskin, a hostage negotiator who facilitated the 2011 deal with Hamas that freed Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit from captivity in Gaza. \"I would think that the lives of the hostages were not better off after last Saturday,\" he said last week, referring to the June 8 raid.\n\nIsrael uses a strict set of forensic standards to determine hostage deaths and has tasked a small committee of medical experts with reviewing classified intelligence to make the determinations. When the committee began its work in October, it mostly relied on security-camera footage from Israel. Today, however, it relies more on Hamas videos that Israeli troops have recovered in Gaza.\n\n\"We were able to determine the death of people that we know were alive and we know how their life ended over there,\" says Ofer Merin, a member of the committee and director general at Shaare Zedek Medical Center in Jerusalem. \"We sit very quietly. We look at each frame. We listen to what happened. And we gather all this information.\"\n\nThe military has also been trying to learn the fate of Israeli hostages by tracing DNA found in tunnels inside Gaza, said Tamir Hayman, a former head of Israeli military intelligence.\n\nHamas traditionally is highly disciplined about keeping secret the whereabouts of its captives, who are often moved around the Gaza Strip, Baskin said. The four captors who guarded Shalit for more than five years never used electronic communication and had no connections or contacts in Gaza. But now that the militant group has dozens more hostages to guard, information could slip out more easily.\n\nThroughout the war, Hamas has trickled out videos of hostages in Gaza, sometimes showing them alive to pressure Israel to reach a deal. The videos are a much awaited sign of life for the families, but are also gut-wrenching for relatives to watch.\n\nElan Tiv was in the car with her sister and mother, a released hostage, in late April when Hamas released a video of her 65-year-old father, Keith Siegel, who remains captive. Tiv pressed play but didn't turn on the volume, fearing she would break down. She watched until her father began to cry.\n\n\"We stopped the car on the side of the road and cried a lot,\" she said.\n\nHer mother, Aviva Siegel, who was held with Siegel in Gaza before being released, couldn't bear to watch.", "source": {"uri": "livemint.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "mint"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org",

Of the 250 hostages taken in the bloody October 7 invasion of southern Israel, 116 continue to be held captive, the Washington Post reports. Now mediators in the hostage talks and a U.S. intelligence insider have reportedly told the newspaper that the number of those still alive could be less than half that number.\n\nIsrael has not confirmed the figures, which would mean that 66 of those still held hostage could be dead - 25 more than the government has publicly acknowledged. Distraught relatives of those remaining in Gaza say they cannot wait any longer, and are calling for their loved ones to be released immediately before it is too late. Many, including Gili Roman, whose sister was freed but relative Carmel Gat remains among the remaining hostages, said families are dreading phone calls. 'It's about who will get a phone call saying the body of your family member has been found or he has been declared dead,' he said.\n\nAn IDF operation brought home four hostages in June - including 26-year-old Noa Argamani, who was kidnapped from the Nova festival on October 7. Tragically, many captives have not escaped with their lives, with the bodies of 19 hostages have returned to Israel, including eight in the past three months. Israel has determined that another 41 hostages are dead in Gaza, with families demanding that their bodies are found and repatriated.\n\nA statement from the Hostages Families Forum, in response to various reports from U.S. intelligence sources: 'All the hostages must be released immediately. There should be no differentiation between bringing back living hostages for rehabilitation and bringing back those who were murdered for proper burial.'\n\n'The international community must take action to ensure the safe return of all 120 hostages and support the proposed deal. Time is of the essence, and we cannot let this critical moment pass,' they added.\n\nNeither the IDF, Israeli government, nor Israeli intelligence service Shinbet have commented on the report or confirmed the figures. Hamas has told mediators it does not know how many of the hostages are still alive, and says some are held by other groups in Gaza. Israel's ground and air campaign was triggered when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on October 7, killing around 1,200 people and seizing more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.\n\nThe offensive has left Gaza in ruins, killed more than 37,400 people, according to Palestinian health authorities, and left nearly the entire population homeless and destitute. Since a week-long truce in November, repeated attempts to arrange a ceasefire have failed, with Hamas insisting on an end to the war and full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. Ceasefire talks between the two sides, mediated by the U.S., Egypt and Qatar, have been at an impasse for many weeks.\n\nA deal, as with previous agreements, would include exchanging hostages with Palestinian prisoners in Israel. Israel was initially unwilling to accept dead bodies in the deal, but its latest proposal presented to Hamas says it would accept the return of deceased hostages to meet the numbers.\n\nIsrael has vowed to continue fighting until Hamas is destroyed, while the group has said a path to end the war is one of its demands in talks. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says he will agree only to temporary pauses and will not end the war until Hamas is eradicated and the hostages are freed.\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

Their sense of urgency is underscored by the sharp contrasts between, on the one hand, the number of hostages brought home through negotiations and those thought to have been killed in captivity, versus the relatively small number Israeli Defense Forces have managed to rescue.\n\nAccording to the Wall Street Journal report, the IDF has rescued 7 hostages alive, compared to 105 brought home through a release deal and as many as 50 that are believed to have been killed, 19 of whose bodies have been brought back to Israel by the army.\n\nThe report comes out just weeks after the IDF's heroic June 8 mission that brought home four of the seven rescued hostages and provided Israelis with a rare moment of collective joy. But in looking at the numbers, the family members of those still being held in Gaza are not feeling optimistic that their loved ones will be the next in line to be rescued.\n\n\"What is happening now is that the families have the opposite feeling,\" Gil Roman, whose relative Carmel Gat is among the remaining hostages, told the Wall Street Journal. \"It's about who will get a phone call saying the body of your family member has been found or he has been declared dead.\"\n\nParadoxically, the success of Israel's raid could actually make the remaining hostages' conditions worse as Hamas moves them to more secure locations.\n\n\"They probably tightened up security,\" Gershon Baskin, a hostage negotiator who facilitated the 2011 deal with Hamas that freed Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit from captivity in Gaza, told the Wall Street Journal. They're looking for collaborators and any leakage of information. They may have moved hostages from above ground to underground.\"\n\n\"I would think that the lives of the hostages were not better off after last Saturday,\" Baskin went on to say, referring to the June 8 raid.\n\nThe number of hostages alive or dead has also been a flashpoint in negotiations brokered by the U.S., Egypt and Qatar. As part of a deal, hostages would likely be exchanged for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel, who has previously said it was not willing to accept dead bodies as part of the swap. The latest proposal presented to Hamas, however, appeared to indicate otherwise, but for now, talks seem to be at a complete standstill.\n\nMeanwhile, as indicated by the Journal, the estimates of the number of dead hostages continues to rise due to the condition and duration of their detention, the advanced ages and pre-existing conditions of some of those held captive, wounds that have not been properly treated, as well as the dangers of Israel's own military actions in Gaza.\n\n\"I think we should be extremely worried,\" said Hagai Levine, the head of the medical team for the Hostages and Missing Families Forum. \"It seems like every week more hostages are dying or getting in danger or very sick.\"", "source": {"uri": "haaretz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "haaretz.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rachel_fink@haaretz.com", "name": "Rachel Fink", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Wall Street Journal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostage", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hostage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_City", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Carmel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mount Carmel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilad_Shalit", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gilad Shalit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qatar", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Math/Number_Theory", "label": "dmoz/Science/Math/Number Theory", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Journals", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Journals", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Large_Families", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Large Families", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Family_Resources_and_Support", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Family Resources and Support", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 59}], "image": "https://img.haarets.co.il/bs/0000018e-b64e-d50a-a1bf-fe6e8dc70000/4e/68/b25bf72c41ca8b2bef40d0b2ce08/81175.jpg?height=630&width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9668352", "eventUri": "eng-9668352", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-08", "textStart": 998, "textEnd": 1004, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.2862745098039217, "wgt": 201, "relevance": 1}

These holidays are about acknowledging the hard work and sacrifices parents make for their families, but for me and my three siblings, they are now accompanied by unfathomable tragedy.\n\nMy parents - two of the eight Americans held hostage in Gaza - were on their morning walk through the Kibbutz Nir Oz fields on Oct. 7 when hundreds of Hamas terrorists stormed the area and dragged my parents to Gaza.\n\nFor 83 excruciating days, we kept hope that they were among the living hostages. That was until Israeli intelligence and the FBI confirmed my worst fear: the terrorists brutally murdered my mother, 70-year-old Judy Weinstein, and my father, 72-year-old Gad Haggai.

At least 32 Americans were murdered on Oct 7. It can happen anywhere in the world, and tragically, Americans have experienced that firsthand.\n\nHamas is connected with the Iranian Regime, and while I can't thank the Biden administration enough for all that it's doing, it is time for the U.S. to push all G7 leaders to list the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as a terrorist organization, cut off their income, pass sanctions on them and their allies and continue to lead to a terror-free world.\n\nTime has run out; the fate of the hostages can change every second.

Initially, about 250 were taken captive during the Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) terror attack of Oct.7.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal writes, citing a new intel review of the situation, \"That assessment, based in part on Israeli intelligence, would mean 66 of those still held hostage could be dead, 25 more than Israel has publicly acknowledged.\" The hostages have been held for 258 days at this point.\n\nOf the eight captives with American citizenship (dual nationals), three were previously reported by Israel to be deceased. The fact that there are Americans among the hostages has received relatively little mainstream media attention.\n\nStill, hostage and ceasefire talks mediated by Qatar and Egypt have failed to move forward, and the situation remains dire given there could be more hostages lost by the day, with Hamas maintaining its position that it doesn't actually know how many still remain given there's a grinding war on in the Strip. Hamas officials have blamed unrelenting Israeli airstrikes for killing off many hostages.\n\n\"The number of hostages alive or dead has been an issue in cease-fire talks brokered by the U.S., Egypt and Qatar,\" WSJ continues. \"As part of a deal, hostages would likely be exchanged for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. Israel was initially unwilling to accept dead bodies to meet the number of hostages required to be released in the first phase of any deal, but its latest proposal presented to Hamas says it would accept dead bodies.\"\n\nThe Netanyahu government's lack of progress on getting the hostages released through negotiations has continued to drive large-scale protests, including a violent one earlier in the week in front of Netanyahu's residence in Jerusalem, resulting in nine arrests.\n\nCurrently tensions are soaring between military leaders and PM Netanyahu, following Wednesday remarks of military spokesman Daniel Hagari, who asserted that Hamas can not be completely be rooted out because it is \"an ideology\". This was seen as a direct contradiction of Netanyahu's vow to not stop until the group is eradicated.\n\n\"This business of destroying Hamas, making Hamas disappear -- it's simply throwing sand in the eyes of the public,\" Hagari had explained in an Israeli Channel 13 news interview. \"Hamas is an idea, Hamas is a party. It's rooted in the hearts of the people -- anyone who thinks we can eliminate Hamas is wrong.\"\n\nNetanyahu's office quickly responded, pointing out that this precisely remains the war's goal. The statement said the security cabinet \"has defined as one of the war goals the destruction of Hamas's military and governance capabilities.\" It emphasized, \"The Israel Defense Forces is of course committed to this.\"\n\nRetired Israeli General Israel Ziv commented in a US media interview that Israeli military leaders feel they have \"exhausted the purpose of the war\" and have reached a \"tactical peak\".\n\n\"We are getting close to finishing the job defined by the government and we'll reach a point when we're just fighting guerrilla warfare, and that could take years,\" Ziv described.", "source": {"uri": "zerohedge.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Zero Hedge"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostage", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hostage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Wall Street Journal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_Islamic_Jihad", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian Islamic Jihad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Citizenship of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Intelligence_Community", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Intelligence Community"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_citizenship", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Multiple citizenship"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mossad", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mossad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qatar", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airstrike", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Airstrike"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_of_Israel", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ideology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guerrilla_warfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Guerrilla warfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jerusalem"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jerusalem"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Military", "label": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Military", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Intelligence", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Intelligence", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/16_9_max_700/public/2024-06/israelihostagefreed.jpg?h=85da32a0&itok=PM8_TIwb", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9668352", "eventUri": "eng-9668352", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2862745098039216, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

Now, more than a quarter of its residents have been murdered or taken hostage. More than half of the homes are burnt to the ground, some with families still inside.\n\nToday, my kibbutz is vacant - the ones who survived the massacre are now a community of refugees with no stability, no future to plan, searching for a place to call home again.\n\nMore than eight months since Oct. 7, and not a single international aid organization has visited the hostages. The International Committee of the Red Cross has not provided any proof of life, medicine or care. It took the U.N. Security Council more than seven months to call a meeting for the hostages. Women's organizations have stayed silent, even after new video footage showed Hamas torturing seven female hostages.\n\nDaily threat of sexual violence: Hamas hostages in Gaza are still enduring sexual violence. Believe the survivors.\n\nAs we passed the 200-day mark, an 18-country coalition led by the United States issued a joint statement demanding the immediate release of all hostages. It was one of the most powerful responses to the hostage crisis since Oct. 7. Then, President Biden called on the world to pressure Hamas into accepting a deal, stating, \"Everyone who wants peace now must raise their voices and let the leaders know they should accept this deal.\" Just days later, the G-7 Leaders issued a statement calling on Hamas to accept this deal.\n\nThis is momentum, and the international community cannot let it go unharnessed. We need to use it to get our loved ones home and to work toward peace in the region. As U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in Cairo this week, the regional governments must \"press Hamas to say yes.\"\n\nThis crisis is not political. It is a global humanitarian issue, a global threat. The reality is that no one can guarantee Oct. 7 won't happen again. As a matter of fact, it seems closer than ever. At least 32 Americans were murdered on Oct 7. It can happen anywhere in the world, and tragically, Americans have experienced that firsthand.\n\nOpinion alerts: Get columns from your favorite columnists + expert analysis on top issues, delivered straight to your device through the USA TODAY app. Don't have the app?

It's been too long. Let me and my siblings mourn the loss of our parents. Please, to all of the world leaders, give us the chance to heal and live the life they wanted for us. Bring them home.\n\nIris Weinstein-Haggai is the daughter of 70-year-old Judy Weinstein and 72-year-old Gad Haggai, who were killed in the October 7 Hamas attacks.\n\nYou can read diverse opinions

Gen. (res.) Tamir Hayman, former chief of IDF Intelligence and currently the director of the Institute for National Security Studies, said that the army is also tracing DNA found in the vast networks of tunnels, knowing that at least some of the hostages have been held underground.\n\nWhile the seven hostages Israeli elite forces have managed to rescue alive so far have been malnourished and suffered physical and psychological abuse, all were found in apartment buildings.\n\nThose released in the only hostage deal made to date, in November, spoke of much worse, fetid and oppressive conditions in the tunnels they were forced to live in.\n\nWhile all of Israel rejoiced after the last rescue operation almost two weeks ago that freed four hostages, many people's thoughts turned to those who were left, in fear that their situations would now deteriorate as a result.\n\nVoicing what is perhaps the greatest concern, Gershon Baskin, a negotiator in the 2011 Gilad Shalit deal that saw the IDF soldier exchanged for over a thousand Palestinian prisoners, including current Hamas head Yahya Sinwar, said that Hamas \"may have moved hostages from above ground to underground.\"\n\nISRAEL, INTERNATIONAL JURISTS - RAFAH OP NOT FORBIDDEN BY ICJ RULING\n\nThe hostages' families are understandably the most anxious of all, with most of them demanding that the government pay Hamas' price of ending the war prematurely in order to achieve their loved ones' freedom.\n\n\"We hang on to the hope that he might be alive,\" said Izhar Lifshitz, whose 84-year-old father Oded was captured from Kibbutz Nir Oz during the invasion. \"But in our stomach we know that older people, wounded people, people taken more than eight months ago, people like that even in Israel would need to change their medication several times, a doctor's treatment.

Hamas could have answered with a single word: 'Yes,'\" Washington's top diplomat charged at a press conference.\n\nMore than 250 people were abducted to Gaza during Hamas's Oct. 7 terrorist invasion of the northwestern Negev, during which thousands more were killed and wounded, with numerous atrocities documented.\n\nOne-hundred and twenty hostages remain in the Strip, of whom 116 were abducted on Oct. 7 (the other four were captured earlier). The figure includes both living and deceased men, women and children.\n\nAt least dozens of the remaining hostages are believed to be alive, a senior Israeli official involved in the negotiations told AFP on Tuesday.\n\nThe official told the agency that Israel cannot commit to ending the war as a precondition for a deal because Hamas could \"breach their commitment...and drag out the negotiations for 10 years\" or more.\n\nOn Thursday, The Wall Street Journal cited mediators and a U.S. official familiar with intelligence information as saying that the number of living captives could be as low as 50. That would mean 66 could be dead, 25 more than Yerushalayim has acknowledged.", "source": {"uri": "matzav.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "matzav.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qatar", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostage", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hostage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arabic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antony_Blinken", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Antony Blinken"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Israel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Nations Security Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Secretary of State"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negev", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Negev"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Wall Street Journal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agence_France-Presse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Agence France-Presse"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Officiating", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Officiating", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://matzav.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/qatar.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9668352", "eventUri": "eng-9668352", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-31", "textStart": 682, "textEnd": 688}, {"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 832, "textEnd": 838, "freq": 3}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-10", "textStart": 1064, "textEnd": 1071}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-06", "textStart": 1594, "textEnd": 1599}], "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 141, "relevance": 1}

This month, when four Israeli hostages were rescued and returned home, the world was pleasantly surprised to see that they appeared fine to the naked eye.\n\nHowever, medical professionals who examined the hostages -- Noa Argamani, Almog Meir Jan, Andrey Kozlov and Shlomi Ziv -- warned that appearances could be deceiving.\n\nThey are not OK. They are extremely ill, suffering from severe malnutrition and a critical deficiency of vitamins and minerals.\n\n\"They are not OK,\" said Dana Weiner, head of the Nutrition Department at Sheba Medical Center, to The Media Line. She was referring not only to these most recently rescued hostages, but also those who were released in November. \"They are extremely ill, suffering from severe malnutrition and a critical deficiency of vitamins and minerals. It will take them a significant amount of time to physically recover to where they were before October 7.\"\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) defines malnutrition as \"deficiencies or excesses in nutrient intake, imbalance of essential nutrients, or impaired nutrient utilization.\" Dana Weiner explained that WHO sets a minimum standard for \"nutritional security\" -- the essential intake needed for survival -- and has clear guidelines for identifying hunger, particularly in disaster and war zones. According to Weiner, these guidelines recommend a food supply of at least 2,100 calories per person daily to ensure nutritional security and prevent disease and death. She noted that the returned hostages received far less than this accepted standard, usually between 500 and 800 calories daily.\n\nShe told The Media Line that in the first months, the hostages received only about a tenth of the required calories and no protein at all. Although their diets improved slightly over time, they only received between zero and 10 grams of protein daily -- far below the roughly 100 grams needed.\n\nThe result is something referred to by medical professionals as sarcopenia, when muscle mass, strength, and performance are significantly compromised.\n\n\"In such a state, the body breaks down available reserves -- mainly muscles,\" Weiner explained. \"We usually think of muscles as being in the arms and legs, but they also include internal organs like the heart, stomach, and diaphragm.\" She said that in extreme conditions, the body focuses on operating the heart, brain, and respiratory system, shutting down other functions. This can lead to damage to internal organs.\n\n\"We conducted muscle strength tests,\" Weiner added, \"and their results were below the minimum possible on our chart.\"\n\nThe team, which was led by dietician Meital Binyamin, also had to give the rescued hostages vitamin supplements. They needed vitamin D due to lack of sun exposure and vitamin B, which is crucial for brain function.\n\nShe explained that the hostages didn't appear particularly thin because, under extreme starvation, the body stores any extra calories as fat. Moreover, unlike during the Holocaust, these victims were not forced to work; instead, they were sedentary.\n\n\"We know from Holocaust research, which is somewhat the same because they were also starved, the reason they lost weight is that they were starving but also worked, so they lost a lot of energy,\" Weiner said. \"These hostages were kept in a room. They did not move, and if they tried to exercise, they did not have protein to build their body.\"\n\nShe noted that many of the 105 hostages released in November had lost up to 15 kilos during captivity, which is more than 10% of their usual body weight and sometimes as much as 15%. This significant weight loss puts them at high risk for malnutrition and other diseases. Weiner added that their condition was generally less severe because they were held for around 50 days compared to 250 days, like Argamani, Jan, Kozlov, and Ziv.\n\nHowever, she noted that according to medical research, malnourished people tend to have more complications and a higher risk of mortality once they are hospitalized.\n\nWeiner emphasized that the hostages were starved even when there was no shortage of food in Gaza. She explained that an analysis showed more than 3,000 calories per person were entering Gaza -- more than enough to feed the hostages. If the people and the hostages didn't receive food, it was because Hamas controlled the distribution and restricted access, according to Weiner.\n\n\"There is no hunger in the Western world,\" Weiner added. \"We don't really see this kind of malnutrition.\"\n\nCurrently, most released or rescued hostages have arrived in a condition where recovery is still feasible. However, older individuals from the initial release, who already had underlying health issues, are facing more significant challenges in physical rehabilitation. Weiner noted that their prospects for a complete recovery are significantly reduced.\n\nOne hostage experienced severe challenges with her lungs and heart. Another had problems swallowing and could not eat. Others are having trouble with their teeth.\n\n\"It depends on a lot of factors: Age, where they were -- tunnel or house -- how much food there was to spread around, the baseline of their physical status when they were kidnapped,\" Weiner said. \"Each person is different.\"\n\nToday, there are still 116 hostages captured on October 7 in Gaza, although Israel says it knows of at least 41 who are dead. Weiner said she did not want to cause grief to the families of hostages still in captivity but warned that for less healthy people still in Gaza, there may already be lasting effects.\n\nProfessor Hagai Levine, who heads the health team for the Hostages and Missing Families Forum, emphasized to The Media Line the importance of including hostage families in the rehabilitation process. He noted that many families have spent nearly nine months fighting to bring their loved ones back and are now focused on their rehabilitation, often neglecting their health. Levine added that many family members are experiencing increased addictions, such as smoking, improper eating habits, and heightened stress and mental health issues.\n\n\"The families also need to be considered,\" Levine said.\n\nLevine is advocating for the establishment of a national rehabilitation program for the hostages and their families. This program would include a dedicated center offering essential services and a platform for doctors to conduct research. He said such research could contribute to developing international protocols and best practices for managing the health of hostages.\n\nHe suggested implementing periodic questionnaires and medical examinations for hostages and their families. This approach, he said, would allow professionals to gather insights on what interventions are most beneficial and which ones are less effective, helping the country refine its rehabilitation strategies.\n\n\"On the one hand, rehabilitation is individual,\" Levine told The Media Line. \"On the other hand, we can learn some lessons from what we see about what we need to understand about rehabilitation.\"\n\nHe said rehabilitation needs to be holistic, encompassing \"the entire human life.\" This could include returning to work, achieving independence, socializing, forming relationships, starting a family, and resuming roles as parents or children. Rehabilitation should also address sleep and eating disorders, mental health issues like anxiety and depression, and physical impacts on the respiratory, cardiovascular, bone, and metabolic systems.\n\nPeople's resilience is outstanding, and despite the very challenging conditions, there is hope for them to find meaning and recover\n\n\"On the positive side, people's resilience is outstanding, and despite the very challenging conditions, there is hope for them to find meaning and recover,\" Levine added. \"However, it will be a very long and difficult struggle.\"", "source": {"uri": "themedialine.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Media Line"}, "authors": [{"uri": "maayan_hoffman@themedialine.org", "name": "Maayan Hoffman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Holocaust", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Holocaust"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calorie", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Calorie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malnutrition", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Malnutrition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineral", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mineral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrient", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nutrient"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Protein"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "World Health Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostage", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hostage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vitamin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeletal_muscle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Skeletal muscle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Muscle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(biology)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Organ (biology)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrey_Kozlov", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Andrey Kozlov"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheba_Medical_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sheba Medical Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rib_cage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rib cage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Skin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Physical therapy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarcopenia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sarcopenia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoracic_diaphragm", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thoracic diaphragm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_vitamins", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "B vitamins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Western world"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health", "label": "dmoz/Health", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Nutrition", "label": "dmoz/Health/Nutrition", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Nutrition/Nutrients", "label": "dmoz/Health/Nutrition/Nutrients", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Nutritional_and_Metabolic_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Nutritional and Metabolic Disorders", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Nutrition/Disease_Prevention", "label": "dmoz/Health/Nutrition/Disease Prevention", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://themedialine.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-2155967241-e1718911259402.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9668352", "eventUri": "eng-9668352", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 1141, "textEnd": 1150, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.192156862745098, "wgt": 128, "relevance": 1}

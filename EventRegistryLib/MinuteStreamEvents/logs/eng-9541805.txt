The awards, which will honor work from 2023, are scheduled to be announced via livestream at 3 p.m. Eastern time.\n\nWhile forecasting potential winners is a guessing game, the Pulitzers often go to coverage of the year's biggest stories. In this case, the Oct. 7 attack on Israel and subsequent war in Gaza is a possibility and may engender controversy.\n\nWith the Committee to Protect Journalists estimating at least 97 journalists and media workers have been killed in Gaza, many observers will be interested to see if the Pulitzers recognize work by Palestinian reporters.

Pulitzer Prizes are due to be announced on Monday, May 6, 2024, traditionally the most-anticipated day of the year for those hoping to earn print journalism's most prestigious honor. (AP Photo/Bebeto Matthews, File)NEW YORK (AP) - The prestigious Pulitzer Prize for public service journalism was awarded Monday to ProPublica for its \"groundbreaking\"\u009d reporting that revealed how billionaires wooed Supreme Court justices with gifts and travel, and The Associated Press was honored in the feature photography category for its coverage of immigration to the U.S. through Latin America. The public service award honored the work of ProPublica's Joshua Kaplan, Justin Elliott, Brett Murphy, Alex Mierjeski and Kirsten Berg. AP's photos were taken across Latin America and along the U.S.-Mexico border in Texas and California in a year when immigration was one of the biggest stories in the world. The award honored 15 photos by AP staffers Greg Bull, Eric Gay, Fernando Llano, Marco Ugarte and Eduardo Verdugo, and longtime AP freelancers Christian Chavez, Felix Marquez and Ivan Valencia. Along with honoring winners and finalists in 15 journalism categories, the Pulitzer Board also recognizes distinguished work in areas including books, music and theater. The prizes, established in the will of newspaper publisher Joseph Pulitzer, are administered by Columbia University in New York.

The public service winner receives a gold medal. All other winners receive $15,000.\n\nThe 15 photos in AP's winning entry were taken across Latin America and the U.S.-Mexico border in Texas and California, during a year in which immigration was one of the world's biggest stories. They were shot by staff photographers Greg Bull, Eric Gay, Fernando Llano, Marco Ugarte and Eduardo Verdugo, and longtime AP freelance photographers Christian Chavez, Felix Marquez and Ivan Valencia won Pulitzers for their work.\n\n\"These raw and emotional images came about through day-to-day coverage of a historic moment in multiple countries documenting migrants at every step of their treacherous journeys,\" said Julie Pace, the AP's senior vice president and executive editor.\n\nThe United States has seen more than 10 million border arrivals in the last five years, with migrants arriving from a wide range of new locations like Venezuela, Cuba, Ecuador, Haiti and Africa, in contrast with earlier eras.\n\nThe AP has won 59 Pulitzer Prizes, including 36 for photography. The news cooperative was named a finalist for the national reporting Pulitzer on Monday for its coverage of hundreds of thousands of children who disappeared from public schools during the pandemic.\n\nThe staff of The New York Times won for its \"wide-ranging and revelatory coverage\" of Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on Israel, the intelligence failures by Israel and the country's response in Gaza. The award comes even as The Times has faced some controversy about its coverage; last month a group of journalism professors called on The New York Times to address questions about an investigation into gender-based violence during the Hamas attack on Israel.\n\nThe Times' Hannah Dreier won a Pulitzer in investigative reporting for her stories on migrant child labor across the United States. Contributing writer Katie Engelhart won the newspaper's third Pulitzer, in feature writing, for her portrait of a family struggling with a matriarch's dementia.\n\nThe Washington Post staff won in national reporting for its \"sobering examination\" of the AR-15 semi-automatic rifle, which came with some gut-wrenching photos. The Post's David E. Hoffman won in editorial writing for a \"compelling and well-researched\" series on how authoritarian regimes repress dissent in the digital age. Its third award went to contributor Vladimir Kara-Murza, for commentaries written from a Russian prison cell.\n\nThe public service award honored ProPublica reporters Joshua Kaplan, Justin Elliott, Brett Murphy, Alex Mierjeski and Kirsten Berg, whose stories prompted the Supreme Court to adopt its first code of conduct.\n\nThe New Yorker magazine won two Pulitzers. Sarah Stillman won in explanatory reporting for her report on the legal system's reliance on felony murder charges. Contributor Medar de la Cruz won in illustrated reporting and commentary for his story humanizing inmates in the Rikers Island jail in New York City.\n\nThe staff of Lookout Santa Cruz in California won a Pulitzer in breaking news reporting for what the prize board called \"nimble community-minded coverage\" of flooding and mudslides.\n\nIn local reporting, Sarah Conway of City Bureau and Trina Reynolds-Tyler of the Invisible Institute won for an investigative series on missing Black girls and women in Chicago, and how racism and the police response contributed to the problem.\n\nBesides the Post, the Pulitzers gave a second award in national reporting to the Reuters staff for an \"eye-opening\" series that probed Elon Musk's automobile and aerospace businesses.\n\nThe photo staff of Reuters won that agency's second Pulitzer of the day for its coverage of the Hamas attack on Israel and the first week of the country's response in Gaza.\n\nThe Pulitzer in criticism went to Justin Chang of The Los Angeles Times for evocative and genre-spanning coverage of movies.\n\nThe Pulitzers are administered by Columbia University in New York, which itself has been in the news for student demonstrations against the war in Gaza. The Pulitzer board met away from Columbia this past weekend to deliberate on its winners.\n\nFor the first time, the Pulitzers opened eligibility to broadcast and audio companies that also operate digital news sites, such as CNN, NPR and the broadcast networks ABC, CBS and NBC. None of these companies won, however.\n\nThe Columbia Journalism School also administers the duPont-Columbia Awards, which recognize audio and visual journalism and are presented in the winter.\n\nThe Pulitzers also announced that five of the 45 finalists this year used artificial intelligence in research and reporting of their submissions. It was the first time the board required applicants for the award to disclose use of AI.\n\nThe prizes were established in the will of newspaper publisher Joseph Pulitzer and first awarded in 1917.\n\nDavid Bauder writes about media for The Associated Press.

The awards, which will honor work from 2023, are scheduled to be announced via livestream at 3 p.m. Eastern time.\n\nWhile forecasting potential winners is a guessing game, the Pulitzers often go to coverage of the year's biggest stories. In this case, the Oct. 7 attack on Israel and subsequent war in Gaza is a possibility and may engender controversy.\n\nWith the Committee to Protect Journalists estimating at least 97 journalists and media workers have been killed in Gaza, many observers will be interested to see if the Pulitzers recognize work by Palestinian reporters. Last month a group of journalism professors called on The New York Times to address questions about an investigation into gender-based violence during the Hamas attack on Israel.\n\nRead more: https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/celebrating-excellence-journalism-arts-pulitzer-prizes-awarded-monday-109947168", "source": {"uri": "democraticunderground.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Democratic Underground"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulitzer_Prize", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pulitzer Prize"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Journalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_Arts", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Master of Arts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ABC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Committee_to_Protect_Journalists", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Committee to Protect Journalists"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violence_against_women", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Violence against women"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Awards", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Awards", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Awards_and_Bestsellers", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Awards and Bestsellers", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 48}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 47}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541805", "eventUri": "eng-9541805", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 656, "textEnd": 662}], "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 206, "relevance": 1}

The public service winner receives a gold medal. All other winners receive $15,000.\n\nThe 15 photos in AP's winning entry were taken across Latin America and along the U.S.-Mexico border in Texas and California in a year when immigration was one of the world's biggest stories. They were shot by AP staffers Greg Bull, Eric Gay, Fernando Llano, Marco Ugarte and Eduardo Verdugo, and longtime AP freelancers Christian Chavez, Felix Marquez and Ivan Valencia.\n\n\"These raw and emotional images came about through day-to-day coverage of a historic moment in multiple countries documenting migrants at every step of their treacherous journeys,\" said Julie Pace, the AP's senior vice president and executive editor.\n\nThe United States has seen more than 10 million border arrivals in the last five years, with migrants arriving from a wide range of new locations like Venezuela, Cuba, Ecuador, Haiti and Africa, in contrast with earlier eras.\n\nThe AP has won 59 Pulitzer Prizes, including 36 for photography. The news cooperative was named a finalist for the national reporting Pulitzer on Monday for its coverage of hundreds of thousands of children who disappeared from public schools during the pandemic.\n\nThe staff of The New York Times won for its \"wide-ranging and revelatory coverage\" of Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on Israel, the intelligence failures by Israel and the country's response in Gaza.\n\nThe Times has faced some controversy about its coverage; last month a group of journalism professors called on The New York Times to address questions about an investigation into gender-based violence during the Hamas attack on Israel.\n\nThe Times' Hannah Dreier won a Pulitzer for investigative reporting for her stories on migrant child labor across the United States. Contributing writer Katie Engelhart won the newspaper's third Pulitzer, in feature writing, for her portrait of a family struggling with a matriarch's dementia.\n\nThe Washington Post staff won in national reporting for its \"sobering examination\" of the AR-15 semi-automatic rifle, which came with some gut-wrenching photos.\n\nThe Post's David E. Hoffman won in editorial writing for a \"compelling and well-researched\" series on how authoritarian regimes repress dissent in the digital age. Its third award went to contributor Vladimir Kara-Murza, for commentaries written from a Russian prison cell.\n\nThe Pulitzers gave a second award in national reporting to the Reuters staff for an \"eye-opening\" series that probed Elon Musk's automobile and aerospace businesses.\n\nThe photo staff of Reuters won that agency's second Pulitzer of the day for its coverage of the Hamas attack on Israel and the first week of the country's response in Gaza.\n\nThe public service award honored ProPublica reporters Joshua Kaplan, Justin Elliott, Brett Murphy, Alex Mierjeski and Kirsten Berg, whose stories prompted the Supreme Court to adopt its first code of conduct.\n\nThe Pulitzer board's second special citation went to the late hip-hop critic Greg Tate.\n\nThe New Yorker magazine won two Pulitzers. Sarah Stillman won in explanatory reporting for her report on the legal system's reliance on felony murder charges. Contributor Medar de la Cruz won in illustrated reporting and commentary for his story humanizing inmates in the Rikers Island jail in New York City.\n\nThe staff of Lookout Santa Cruz in California won in the breaking news category for what the prize board called \"nimble community-minded coverage\" of flooding and mudslides.\n\nIn local reporting, Sarah Conway of City Bureau and Trina Reynolds-Tyler of the Invisible Institute won for an investigative series on missing Black girls and women in Chicago, which showed how racism and the police contributed to the problem.\n\nThe Pulitzer in criticism went to Justin Chang of The Los Angeles Times for evocative and genre-spanning coverage of movies.\n\nThe Pulitzers are administered by Columbia University in New York, which itself has been in the news for student demonstrations against the war in Gaza. The Pulitzer board met away from Columbia this past weekend to deliberate on its winners.\n\nFor the first time, the Pulitzers opened eligibility to broadcast and audio companies that also operate digital news sites, such as CNN, NPR and the broadcast networks ABC, CBS and NBC. None of these companies won, however.\n\nThe Columbia Journalism School also administers the duPont-Columbia Awards, which recognize audio and visual journalism and are presented in the winter.\n\nThe Pulitzers also announced that five of the 45 finalists this year used artificial intelligence in research and reporting of their submissions. It was the first time the board required applicants for the award to disclose use of AI.\n\nThe prizes were established in the will of newspaper publisher Joseph Pulitzer and first awarded in 1917.",

The public service winner receives a gold medal. All other winners receive $15,000.\n\nThe 15 photos in AP's winning entry were taken across Latin America and along the U.S.-Mexico border in Texas and California in a year when immigration was one of the world's biggest stories. They were shot by AP staffers Greg Bull, Eric Gay, Fernando Llano, Marco Ugarte and Eduardo Verdugo, and longtime AP freelancers Christian Chavez, Felix Marquez and Ivan Valencia.\n\n\"These raw and emotional images came about through day-to-day coverage of a historic moment in multiple countries documenting migrants at every step of their treacherous journeys,\" said Julie Pace, the AP's senior vice president and executive editor.\n\nThe United States has seen more than 10 million border arrivals in the last five years, with migrants arriving from a wide range of new locations like Venezuela, Cuba, Ecuador, Haiti and Africa, in contrast with earlier eras.\n\nThe AP has won 59 Pulitzer Prizes, including 36 for photography. The news cooperative was named a finalist for the national reporting Pulitzer on Monday for its coverage of hundreds of thousands of children who disappeared from public schools during the pandemic.\n\nIn citing the Times for its work in Israel and Gaza, the Pulitzer board mentioned its coverage of the country's intelligence failures, along with the attack and Israel's military response.\n\nThe award comes even as The Times has faced some controversy about its coverage; last month a group of journalism professors called on the publication to address questions about an investigation into gender-based violence during the Hamas attack on Israel.\n\nThe Times' Hannah Dreier won a Pulitzer in investigative reporting for her stories on migrant child labor across the United States. Contributing writer Katie Engelhart won the newspaper's third Pulitzer, in feature writing, for her portrait of a family struggling with a matriarch's dementia.\n\nRelated Story: Wired Wednesday: How to Shoot a Photo or Video of Yosemite's Majestic\n\nThe Washington Post staff won in national reporting for its \"sobering examination\" of the AR-15 semi-automatic rifle, which came with some gut-wrenching photos. \"We were eager to find a way to cover it differently and change the conversation about mass shootings,\" Peter Walstein, the Post's senior national enterprise editor, said in the newspaper.\n\nThe Post's David E. Hoffman won in editorial writing for a \"compelling and well-researched\" series on how authoritarian regimes repress dissent in the digital age. Its third award went to contributor Vladimir Kara-Murza, for commentaries written from a Russian prison cell.\n\nThe New Yorker magazine won two Pulitzers. Sarah Stillman won in explanatory reporting for her report on the legal system's reliance on felony murder charges. Contributor Medar de la Cruz won in illustrated reporting and commentary for his story humanizing inmates in the Rikers Island jail in New York City.\n\nThe staff of Lookout Santa Cruz in California won in the breaking news category for what the prize board called \"nimble community-minded coverage\" of flooding and mudslides. On its website Monday, Lookout Santa Cruz said that it made its coverage free at a time of crisis in the community, and also used text messages to reach people without power.\n\n\"In short, we did our jobs,\" the staff said in an unsigned article, \"and we heard so many thanks for it. The Pulitzer is icing on that cake.\"\n\nThe Pulitzers gave a second award in national reporting to the Reuters staff for an \"eye-opening\" series that probed Elon Musk's automobile and aerospace businesses.\n\nIn local reporting, Sarah Conway of City Bureau and Trina Reynolds-Tyler of the Invisible Institute won for an investigative series on missing Black girls and women in Chicago, which showed how racism and the police contributed to the problem.\n\nThe Pulitzer in criticism went to Justin Chang of The Los Angeles Times for evocative and genre-spanning coverage of movies. The Pulitzer board's second special citation went to the late hip-hop critic Greg Tate.\n\nThe Pulitzers are administered by Columbia University in New York, which itself has been in the news for student demonstrations against the war in Gaza. The Pulitzer board met away from Columbia this past weekend to deliberate on its winners.\n\nFor the first time, the Pulitzers opened eligibility to broadcast and audio companies that also operate digital news sites, such as CNN, NPR and the broadcast networks ABC, CBS and NBC. None of these companies won, however.\n\nThe Columbia Journalism School also administers the duPont-Columbia Awards, which recognize audio and visual journalism and are presented in the winter.\n\nThe Pulitzers also announced that five of the 45 finalists this year used artificial intelligence in research and reporting of their submissions. It was the first time the board required applicants for the award to disclose use of AI.\n\nThe prizes were established in the will of newspaper publisher Joseph Pulitzer and first awarded in 1917.",

Pulitzer Prizes are due to be announced on Monday, May 6, 2024, traditionally the most-anticipated day of the year for those hoping to earn print journalism's most prestigious honor. (AP Photo/Bebeto Matthews, File)NEW YORK (AP) - The Associated Press won a Pulitzer Prize in feature photography Monday for its coverage of global migration through Latin America to the U.S., while The New York Times and the Washington Post each won three Pulitzer Prizes for their work in 2023. The Times and Reuters news service each won Pulitzers for their coverage of the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel and its aftermath. The Pulitzers' prestigious award in public service went to ProPublica for reporting that \"pierced the thick wall of secrecy\"\u009d around the U.S. Supreme Court to show how billionaires gave gifts and travel to justices. The Pulitzers also issued special citations to journalists and writers covering the war in Gaza, and to the late hip-hop critic Greg Tate. The Pulitzers honored the best in journalism from 2023 in 15 categories, as well as eight arts categories focused on books, music and theater. The public service winner receives a gold medal. All other winners receive $15,000. The 15 photos in AP's winning entry were taken across Latin America and the U.S.-Mexico border in Texas and California, during a year in which immigration was one of the world's biggest stories. They were shot by staff photographers Greg Bull, Eric Gay, Fernando Llano, Marco Ugarte and Eduardo Verdugo, and longtime AP freelance photographers Christian Chavez, Felix Marquez and Ivan Valencia won Pulitzers for their work. \"These raw and emotional images came about through day-to-day coverage of a historic moment in multiple countries documenting migrants at every step of their treacherous journeys,\"\u009d said Julie Pace, the AP's senior vice president and executive editor. The United States has seen more than 10 million border arrivals in the last five years, with migrants arriving from a wide range of new locations like Venezuela, Cuba, Ecuador, Haiti and Africa, in contrast with earlier eras. The AP has won 59 Pulitzer Prizes, including 36 for photography. The news cooperative was named a finalist for the national reporting Pulitzer on Monday for its coverage of hundreds of thousands of children who disappeared from public schools during the pandemic. The staff of The New York Times won for its \"wide-ranging and revelatory coverage\"\u009d of Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on Israel, the intelligence failures by Israel and the country's response in Gaza. The award comes even as The Times has faced some controversy about its coverage; last month a group of journalism professors called on The New York Times to address questions about an investigation into gender-based violence during the Hamas attack on Israel. The Times' Hannah Dreier won a Pulitzer in investigative reporting for her stories on migrant child labor across the United States. Contributing writer Katie Engelhart won the newspaper's third Pulitzer, in feature writing, for her portrait of a family struggling with a matriarch's dementia. The Washington Post staff won in national reporting for its \"sobering examination\"\u009d of the AR-15 semi-automatic rifle, which came with some gut-wrenching photos. The Post's David E. Hoffman won in editorial writing for a \"compelling and well-researched\"\u009d series on how authoritarian regimes repress dissent in the digital age. Its third award went to contributor Vladimir Kara-Murza, for commentaries written from a Russian prison cell. The public service award honored ProPublica reporters Joshua Kaplan, Justin Elliott, Brett Murphy, Alex Mierjeski and Kirsten Berg, whose stories prompted the Supreme Court to adopt its first code of conduct. The New Yorker magazine won two Pulitzers. Sarah Stillman won in explanatory reporting for her report on the legal system's reliance on felony murder charges. Contributor Medar de la Cruz won in illustrated reporting and commentary for his story humanizing inmates in the Rikers Island jail in New York City. The staff of Lookout Santa Cruz in California won a Pulitzer in breaking news reporting for what the prize board called \"nimble community-minded coverage\" of flooding and mudslides. In local reporting, Sarah Conway of City Bureau and Trina Reynolds-Tyler of the Invisible Institute won for an investigative series on missing Black girls and women in Chicago, and how racism and the police response contributed to the problem. Besides the Post, the Pulitzers gave a second award in national reporting to the Reuters staff for an \"eye-opening\"\u009d series that probed Elon Musk's automobile and aerospace businesses. The photo staff of Reuters won that agency's second Pulitzer of the day for its coverage of the Hamas attack on Israel and the first week of the country's response in Gaza. The Pulitzer in criticism went to Justin Chang of The Los Angeles Times for evocative and genre-spanning coverage of movies. The Pulitzers are administered by Columbia University in New York, which itself has been in the news for student demonstrations against the war in Gaza. The Pulitzer board met away from Columbia this past weekend to deliberate on its winners. For the first time, the Pulitzers opened eligibility to broadcast and audio companies that also operate digital news sites, such as CNN, NPR and the broadcast networks ABC, CBS and NBC. None of these companies won, however. The Columbia Journalism School also administers the duPont-Columbia Awards, which recognize audio and visual journalism and are presented in the winter. The Pulitzers also announced that five of the 45 finalists this year used artificial intelligence in research and reporting of their submissions. It was the first time the board required applicants for the award to disclose use of AI. The prizes were established in the will of newspaper publisher Joseph Pulitzer and first awarded in 1917. ___ David Bauder writes about media for The Associated Press.

Staff photographers Greg Bull, Eric Gay, Fernando Llano, Marco Ugarte and Eduardo Verdugo, and longtime AP freelance photographers Christian Chavez, Felix Marquez and Ivan Valencia won Pulitzers for their work.\n\nThe United States has seen more than 10 million border arrivals in the last five years, with migrants arriving from a wide range of new locations like Venezuela, Cuba, Ecuador, Haiti and Africa, in contrast with earlier eras.\n\nBorder policies have been a key issue in the 2024 U.S. presidential campaign. With its global network of journalists, the AP has made coverage of immigration and all its complexities a point of emphasis.\n\nThe AP has won 59 Pulitzer Prizes, including 36 for photography. The news cooperative was named a finalist for the national reporting Pulitzer on Monday for its coverage of hundreds of thousands of children who disappeared from public schools during the pandemic.\n\nThe staff of The New York Times won for its \"wide-ranging and revelatory coverage\" of Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on Israel, the intelligence failures by Israel and the country's response in Gaza. The award comes even as The Times has faced some controversy about its coverage; last month a group of journalism professors called on The New York Times to address questions about an investigation into gender-based violence during the Hamas attack on Israel.\n\nThe Times' Hannah Dreier won a Pulitzer in investigative reporting for her stories on migrant child labor across the United States. Contributing writer Katie Engelhart won the newspaper's third Pulitzer, in feature writing, for her portrait of a family struggling with a matriarch's dementia.\n\nThe Washington Post staff won in national reporting for its \"sobering examination\" of the AR-15 semi-automatic rifle, which came with some gut-wrenching photos. The Post's David E. Hoffman won in editorial writing for a \"compelling and well-researched\" series on how authoritarian regimes repress dissent in the digital age. Its third award went to contributor Vladimir Kara-Murza, for commentaries written from a Russian prison cell.\n\nThe New Yorker magazine won two Pulitzers. Sarah Stillman won in explanatory reporting for her report on the legal system's reliance on felony murder charges. Contributor Medar de la Cruz won in illustrated reporting and commentary for his story humanizing inmates in the Rikers Island jail in New York City.\n\nThe staff of Lookout Santa Cruz in California won a Pulitzer in breaking news reporting for what the prize board called \"detailed and nimble community-minded coverage of flooding and mudslides in its community over a holiday weekend.\n\nIn local reporting, Sarah Conway of City Bureau and Trina Reynolds-Tyler of the Invisible Institute won for an investigative series on missing Black girls and women in Chicago, and how racism and police response contributed to the problem.\n\nBesides the Post, the Pulitzers gave a second award in national reporting to the Reuters staff for an \"eye-opening\" series that probed Elon Musk's automobile and aerospace businesses.\n\nThe Pulitzer in criticism went to Justin Chang of The Los Angeles Times for evocative and genre-spanning coverage of movies.\n\nThe photo staff of Reuters won that agency's second Pulitzer of the day for its coverage of the Hamas attack on Israel and the first week of the country's response in Gaza.\n\nThe Pulitzers are administered by Columbia University in New York, which itself has been in the news for student demonstrations against the war in Gaza. The Pulitzer board met away from Columbia this past weekend to deliberate on its winners.\n\nFor the first time, the Pulitzers opened eligibility to broadcast and audio companies that also operate digital news sites, such as CNN, NPR and the broadcast networks ABC, CBS and NBC. None of these companies won, however.\n\nThe Columbia Journalism School also administers the duPont-Columbia Awards, which recognize audio and visual journalism and are presented in the winter.\n\nThe Pulitzers also announced that five of the 45 finalists this year used artificial intelligence in research and reporting of their submissions. It was the first time the board required applicants for the award to disclose use of AI.\n\nThe prizes were established in the will of newspaper publisher Joseph Pulitzer and first awarded in 1917.\n\nDavid Bauder writes about media for The Associated Press.

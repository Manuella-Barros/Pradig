The judge's ruling that Smyth should be extradited could help bring about the end of a bizarre saga in which victims have painted Smyth as a master of disguise and a veteran traveling grifter.\n\nSmyth faces four counts of fraud by abuse of position under the U.K. Fraud Act of 2006, and four counts of theft in violation of Northern Ireland's Theft Act of 1969, Nivison wrote. Authorities overseas have said Smyth stole money that she had promised to invest and arranged to sell a victim a home but took the money. A court in Northern Ireland issued arrest warrants for her earlier this decade.\n\n\"The evidence presented regarding Ms. Smyth's interactions with and transactions involving the individuals ... is sufficient to sustain the four fraud charges and the four theft charges that are the subject of the extradition request,\" Nivison wrote.\n\nFILE - In a December 2013 photo taken in Los Angeles, Johnathan Walton, and Marianne Smyth pose during her tree trimming Christmas party. Smyth was later found guilty of stealing tens of thousands of dollars from Walton as part of one of several scams she was accused of orchestrating. (Johnathan Walton via AP, File)\n\nSmyth's case is similar in some respects to that of Anna Sorokin, a scammer who was convicted of paying for her lifestyle by impersonating a German heiress. Smyth's victims included Johnathan Walton, a podcaster who warned others of Smyth's grifts. Smyth was found guilty of stealing tens of thousands of dollars from Walton and spent about two years in jail.\n\nThe two had grown close in Los Angeles, and Smyth told Walton she was due an inheritance of $7 million from her wealthy Irish family, but Smyth's story began to fall apart when Walton learned she was jailed for stealing $200,000 from a travel agency she worked for. Walton used his podcast to gather tips from Smyth's other accusers. Some of those accusers said Smyth started a fake charity and others said she posed as everything from a cancer patient to Jennifer Aniston's best friend.\n\nSmyth, who is in fact American, was found and arrested in Maine in February.\n\nFILE - In a selfie taken in July 2014, Johnathan Walton poses with Marianne Smyth during a vacation in Palm Springs, Calif.

She faces allegations that she stole more than $170,000 from the victims from 2008 to 2010 in Northern Ireland.\n\nU.S. Magistrate Judge John Nivison ruled on Thursday that there is sufficient evidence to certify Smyth's extradition to the U.K. to face charges. Nivison wrote that Smyth will be in custody of the U.S. Marshals Service pending a decision on extradition by Secretary of State Antony Blinken.\n\nAn attorney for Smyth, who has declined to comment in the past, did not respond to phone calls and emails on Thursday. The judge's ruling that Smyth should be extradited could help bring about the end of a bizarre saga in which victims have painted Smyth as a master of disguise and a veteran traveling grifter.\n\nSmyth faces four counts of fraud by abuse of position under the U.K. Fraud Act of 2006, and four counts of theft in violation of Northern Ireland's Theft Act of 1969, Nivison wrote. Authorities overseas have said Smyth stole money that she had promised to invest and arranged to sell a victim a home but took the money. A court in Northern Ireland issued arrest warrants for her earlier this decade.\n\n\"The evidence presented regarding Ms. Smyth's interactions with and transactions involving the individuals ... is sufficient to sustain the four fraud charges and the four theft charges that are the subject of the extradition request,\" Nivison wrote.\n\nSmyth's case is similar in some respects to that of Anna Sorokin, a scammer who was convicted of paying for her lifestyle by impersonating a German heiress. Smyth's victims included Johnathan Walton, a podcaster who warned others of Smyth's grifts. Smyth was found guilty of stealing tens of thousands of dollars from Walton and spent about two years in jail.\n\nThe two had grown close in Los Angeles, and Smyth told Walton she was due an inheritance of $7 million from her wealthy Irish family, but Smyth's story began to fall apart when Walton learned she was jailed for stealing $200,000 from a travel agency she worked for. Walton used his podcast to gather tips from Smyth's other accusers. Some of those accusers said Smyth started a fake charity and others said she posed as everything from a cancer patient to Jennifer Aniston's best friend.\n\nSmyth, who is in fact American, was found and arrested in Maine in February.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 The Associated Press.

On Thursday, a judge agreed she should be extradited to Northern Ireland on separate fraud and theft charges.\n\nHer elaborate schemes, among them posing as the heiress to an Irish fortune, swindled people out of huge sums and left Marianne Smyth with two felony convictions.\n\nNow Ms. Smyth, 54, an American, will most likely be extradited to Northern Ireland to face eight separate accusations of theft and fraud there, a federal court ruled on Thursday, saying there was \"sufficient evidence to sustain the charges.\" She will be turned over to the custody of the U.S. Marshals Service, pending a final decision on her extradition by the U.S. secretary of state, according to court documents filed in the U.S. District Court in Maine.\n\nMs. Smyth became known as the \"Irish heiress\" after one of her former victims, Johnathan Walton, started a podcast in 2021 about his experience. The two became close friends after meeting in 2013, and Mr. Walton, a reality television producer, said that Ms. Smyth had claimed to be from a prominent Irish family.\n\nBut she was facing money problems, she told him, and was battling relatives in Ireland over an inheritance worth tens of millions of dollars. Sympathetic, Mr. Walton lent her money and the use of his credit card, an amount that totaled more than $63,000.\n\nWhen he realized that she had deceived him, he reported Ms. Smyth to the police, and in 2019 a jury convicted her of stealing from him.
